14  Entertainer, civil rights activist and spy: Josephine Baker has become the first black woman to be memorialised in the Panthéon in Paris — an honour bestowed by the French president only on those seen as national heroes.President Emmanuel Macron, who is hoping to secure his second term in an election in less than five months, led the nationally televised ceremony on Tuesday evening. In his speech, he described Baker as someone who had “made the right choices at every turn of history”, and said: “You enter our Panthéon because, born American, there is no one more French than you.”The ceremony drew large crowds of young and old along the Rue Soufflot who watched as six members of the French air and space force carried a symbolic cenotaph, a memorial to someone buried elsewhere, covered with the French flag, along a red carpet to the Panthéon. In the background, Baker’s voice was heard singing “Me revoilà Paris” — I’m back in Paris.At her family’s request, Baker’s body is remaining in Monaco where she was buried in 1975, while she is remembered in a casket with soil from the US, France and Monaco in the Panthéon. She is only the sixth woman to be “pantheonised” and joins the likes of Victor Hugo, Marie Curie and Voltaire.Politicians, organisations and fans have campaigned for years to include Baker in the Panthéon, with a recent petition by essayist Laurent Kupferman reviving the debate.But many also view the timing of her entry into the hall of French greats as a timely political move by Macron and an attempt to reconcile the nation at a time of intense debate over immigration, France’s colonial past and feminism.Baker, born in poverty in St Louis, Missouri, in 1906, was one of several black American artists and writers, including author James Baldwin and jazzman Miles Davis, who sought refuge from American racism in France.In an interview with the Guardian in 1974, less than a year before her death, she said: “I became famous first in France in the Twenties. I just couldn’t stand America and I was one of the first coloured Americans to move to Paris.”Her story of coming to France to escape the racism of the US, but also rising to fame in Paris while once performing in only a beaded necklace and a skirt of artificial bananas, makes Baker a controversial symbol among some despite her universal popularity.A dancer and entertainer who in 1927 was the first black woman to star in a major film production, Baker went on to campaign for civil rights with Martin Luther King and was decorated for spying for the French resistance movement, smuggling hidden messages in her sheet music.She renounced her American citizenship in 1937, bought a château in the south of France and adopted 12 children from different countries.The support committee working on Baker’s inclusion in the Panthéon, which includes her son Brian Bouillon-Baker, told AFP: “We pay tribute to her commitment to republican values.” It also recalled that she had said of France: “Here they take me for a person and they do not look at me as a colour.”
15  Britain will not engage in “tit for tat” with the EU by restricting access to the City of London or trying to stop UK-based banking staff relocating to the continent, a senior Bank of England official said on Tuesday.Sam Woods, chief executive of the BoE’s Prudential Regulation Authority, said the UK was “absolutely not in a tit-for-tat game” on financial services market access and staffing.He said Britain’s status as an international financial centre meant that it would continue to be open to banks from other countries.Noting post-Brexit tensions between the EU and the UK, Woods told the Financial Times’ Global Banking Summit: “The EU has a more location-based view of life and they are implementing that vision, and that is leading to some of the tensions. It is a natural consequence of Brexit and we will have to navigate it in a sensible way.”The EU has said it wants international banks traditionally based in London to have sizeable operations on the continent to run their European businesses after the UK left the bloc’s single market last year.In recent months, the European Commission has proposed legislation that would make it harder for banks from countries outside the EU, including the UK, to sell services into the bloc.The European Central Bank, as EU banking supervisor, has also been pushing banks to move more staff from the UK to the EU.Woods said he was “relatively sanguine” about the scale of banks’ job and asset moves from the UK.However, the BoE was keeping an eye on developments to make sure the ECB did not become so demanding it started hollowing out banks’ operations in London — which “would be unacceptable”.Woods also said that “spectacular blow-ups” — including the collapse of hedge fund Archegos and the Greensill Capital scandal — had made the PRA more attuned to the risk that poor conduct would emerge as the memory of the financial crisis faded.“You can look at what is in the public domain, and it is reasonable to question, are people really sufficiently focused on the things that can go wrong, both from a conduct and prudential perspective?” he added.The PRA and the Financial Conduct Authority introduced new governance and conduct standards — including a regime for holding executives personally accountable for major failures — in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Enforcement cases have been relatively rare.The most public action taken by the PRA and FCA was in relation to Barclays’ former chief executive Jes Staley, who stepped down last month.Regulators issued both Staley and Barclays with draft findings of their review into his relationship with the late Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender. Woods declined to comment on the case.
16  How are declining regions to be revitalised? This question arises wherever erstwhile bastions of heavy industry have collapsed in high-income countries. Nostalgia for the past is futile. One must regenerate and renew instead. The Basque country in Spain has succeeded in doing so. Its success suggests some big lessons: first, renewal must come from within; second, it is never finished.The Basque people are concentrated in three provinces in northern Spain and three provinces in south-west France. They speak a unique and ancient language and possess a distinct culture. The Basque country, whose largest city is Bilbao, contains close to 2.2m people. It became a centre of heavy industry in the late 19th century, based on mining and steel. But it suffered terrible violence in the Spanish Civil War, including the notorious bombing of Guernica in 1937, and thereafter repression of its language and culture.In the 1970s, the Basque country was still one of the richest regions in Spain. But it faced great difficulties. As in other parts of the world, its heavy industries were in severe decline and unemployment was high. An administration also needed to be created from scratch for the new “autonomous community”. Despite democracy’s return in the 1970s, the region was long convulsed by Eta’s terrorism, which ended only in 2011.This, then, was a crisis. Four decades later we can see what unfolded. Unemployment is far below the Spanish average, though employment ratios are low by European standards. Nominal gross domestic product per head rose from 70 per cent of the average of the EU15 (with the UK) in 1985 to close to the average in 2019. At purchasing power parity, average incomes per head in the Basque country in 2019 were close to Germany’s. The OECD notes that social welfare is generally as high as, or higher than, in rich Spanish regions, such as Catalonia and Madrid. (See charts.)This rebirth is also cultural and physical. Bilbao in particular has been turned from a dirty industrial city, albeit one with impressive late 19th-century buildings, into a model of architectural and cultural renewal. Frank Gehry’s world renowned Guggenheim Museum is at the heart of this. But it is not unique, as I discovered during a recent visit. The architectural regeneration is as astounding as the food.So, how was this done and what if anything can be learnt from it? There would seem to have been two necessary conditions: the desire to succeed; and the freedom to do so. While both of these were necessary, they became sufficient only by having a favourable context and by taking the right decisions. Spain’s EU membership was the context. But what were the decisions?A striking feature of these was how they were made, namely, by close co-operation among all levels of government and between public and private sectors. The shared aim motivating it all has been one of balanced social and economic development. According to the Basque Institute of Competitiveness, the 1980s were “defined by the creation of the new regional administration alongside the need to promote substantial industrial restructuring”. This “evolved in the 1990s into a strategy built around clusters and geared to improving efficiency, fostering non-R&D-based diversification, and promoting internationalisation”. That then evolved in the 2000s “into a sustained focus on innovation and science-driven industrial diversification”.After 2008, Spain as a whole fell into another huge crisis. Again, the development strategy had to adjust. It did so by building on the Basque country’s growing strengths in science and advanced manufacturing technologies, as well as in bioscience and even nano-science. Now in the 2020s, the Basque country confronts another set of challenges, notably those of the energy transition.As in other cases of rapid economic development across the world, success created the foundations for the next stage. But running through the story of the Basque country seems to be an ability to work out the right response to what was happening in the world. Since successful development demands the creation of a range of vital public goods, it depends on a development-oriented government. But the latter in turn relies on the ability of private business to seize opportunities. A good way to think about this is as a marriage of co-operation with competition within an open world economy.What can other parts of the world learn from this story of regenerating and then developing an old industrial region? The challenge is not unique, after all. In the UK, for example, housing and communities secretary Michael Gove is expected to deliver a plan for “levelling up” quite soon.The parallels with Wales, Scotland and parts of England are evident. Probably the most important lesson is that those who live in and are responsible for the region should have both the resources and the freedom to make decisions. This is not just because they are likely to do it better. It is also because that is a way to foster the needed boldness. Furthermore, a big effort should be made to encourage co-operation among the various players, with a view to creating and exploiting the synergies. Finally, there should be a never-ending effort to develop the region’s resources. Change never ends.It is quite reasonable to ask how much can be learnt from a region that is so different in its history and identity. But bold efforts will never be forthcoming, without far greater autonomy. In the UK, above all, too much has depended for too long on decisions coming out of London. That is not how the Basque country prospered. Autonomy matters. We must learn from that.
17  Russian president Vladimir Putin warned the west against crossing Moscow’s “red lines” in Ukraine and said Nato was threatening Russia’s security by holding exercises and deploying weapons near its borders.Putin told an investment forum on Tuesday that Moscow had developed hypersonic missiles and would be forced to respond “if Nato continued to expand its infrastructure”, including through the alliance’s potential deployment of its own similar missile systems.“If some kind of strike systems appear on the territory of Ukraine, the flight time to Moscow will be seven to 10 minutes, and five minutes in the case of a hypersonic weapon being deployed,” Putin told the online conference on Tuesday.“Then we’ll have to create something similar to those who threaten us. Can you imagine? And we can already do that now,” Putin added.The US has supplied weapons to Ukraine and helped train its army but has not deployed forces or equipment in the manner that Putin suggested. Yet the issue remains pressing for Putin, who claimed without evidence last month that Nato could secretly set up bases and missile systems in Ukraine under the guise of the training programme.Washington has shared intelligence with allies suggesting Russia may be preparing for a return to outright hostilities in Ukraine after massing as many as 114,000 troops to its north, east, and south.US secretary of state Antony Blinken said ahead of a two-day Nato meeting of foreign ministers in Latvia that a Russian attack “would trigger serious consequences”, while UK foreign secretary Liz Truss said her country would use “all diplomatic and economic levers at our disposal” to deter Russia from invading.But Putin said Russia was forced to defend itself from what he described as creeping Nato encroachment since the collapse of the Soviet Union, including siting missile systems in Poland and Romania that he said could be used to launch attacks on Moscow.He also complained that Nato had conducted unplanned military drills in the Black Sea this month, including flying strategic bombers that can carry nuclear weapons just 20km from the Russian border.In response a new Russian hypersonic missile would enter service from the beginning of next year, Putin said. The missile, which can travel at nine times the speed of sound, was successfully tested this month, he added.“The flight time will be five minutes for the people giving the orders [to attack Russia from Ukraine] as well,” Putin said. “We had to create something similar to use on those who threaten us in this way.”The US may deploy its first hypersonic weapons next year, a Pentagon official said earlier this month.Kyiv has said US intelligence indicates a “high probability” that Russia is preparing an invasion after relations frayed with Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky, and that it is losing interest in peace talks led by France and Germany.Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine following a pro-western revolution in 2014, then fuelled a separatist uprising in the eastern Donbas region in which more than 14,000 people have died.Moscow denies it is a party to the conflict but has provided the separatists with troops, equipment and logistical support, according to western governments.Ukraine’s defence minister Oleksii Reznikov on Tuesday suggested Putin was engaging in brinkmanship to get an upper hand in any negotiations with US president Joe Biden about Ukraine and other matters.Russia embarked on a troop build-up in April. Biden agreed to a summit that was held in Geneva in June and Putin told the troops to stand down. But Russia left significant numbers of troops and infrastructure near Ukraine and conducted large-scale joint exercises with Belarus at the border.“The issue isn’t whether to send in troops or not, or to go to war or not, but.to take the interests of all participants in international activities into account,” Putin said. “If we work towards this, then nobody’s security will be threatened.”
18  Greece is to introduce its first climate law, pledging to cut its reliance on coal within six years as part of a move to a carbon “net zero” economy by 2050.The law comes after the country suffered devastating wildfires this year when summer heat soared that was attributed partly to global warming.“The national climate law is of historic importance. in order to deal with the climate crisis and achieve climate neutrality by 2050,” said Kostas Skrekas, environment and energy minister.The law foresees an intermediate target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55 per cent by 2030.Greece is one of EU countries that relies most heavily on coal for energy and has been a laggard within the EU in cutting emissions. Germany has cut its emissions 38 per cent from 1990 levels, according to UN data, while Greece has cut its emissions by less than 19 per cent over the same period.“Given Greece’s worse starting point on reducing greenhouse emissions, achieving a 55 per cent reduction by 2030 is certainly challenging but ambitious,” said Nikos Mantzaris, senior policy analyst at the Green Tank in Athens.As part of its plans Greece will phase out production of lignite, a particularly polluting form of coal, within the next six years. The decision will be reconsidered by 2023 with an eye to accelerating an exit.The law will also require Greece to move more quickly to cleaner vehicles. By 2025 all-new taxis and a third of new rental cars in the two largest cities, Athens and Thessaloniki, will have to be hybrid or electric vehicles. A ban on other sales of new cars with internal combustion engines will start in 2030, five years ahead of the proposed date by the EU.Greece’s market share in electric vehicles is very limited while infrastructure is also basic. The country has just 0.1 per cent of all vehicle charging points in the EUThe law will also end the reliance on heavy oil for electricity production in Greece’s islands. One-quarter of the country’s 200 inhabited islands are not connected to the main grid and rely on the use of heavy oil to cover their energy needs.According to the new law, by 2030 the islands will not be able to use heavy oil but will still be allowed to use diesel.In the housing sector, the legislation introduces a ban on oil burners in all new properties from 2023 in areas where the “natural gas network is available”. Oil heating will be completely banned by 2025. Solar panels will be mandatory on appropriate industrial buildings.However, Greece is not banning exploration for oil and gas, with Athens keen to leave open the possibility of developing reserves in the eastern Mediterranean.“This legislation is in the right direction but it could be tightened up and it all comes down to its effective implementation,” said Hara Xirou, head of South-East Europe at Eunomia Research & Consulting, a UK-based consultancy.
19  Inflation in the eurozone rose to 4.9 per cent in November, a record high since the single currency was created more than two decades ago, prompting policymakers and economists to warn that price pressures are likely to persist for longer than expected.Driven by soaring energy prices, the increase in eurozone inflation — as measured by the harmonised index of consumer prices — outstripped the 4.5 per cent expected on average by economists polled by Reuters. The rise is likely to put more pressure on the European Central Bank to reduce its monetary stimulus.Some investors said the ECB seemed too relaxed about rising prices. “It may be wishful thinking on the part of ECB president [Christine] Lagarde when she declares that price pressures won’t run out of control — they already are and it’s difficult to follow the argument that it will abate soon,” said Charles Hepworth, investment director at GAM Investments.Jens Weidmann, the outgoing president of the Bundesbank, on Tuesday warned the ECB to be “wary of any pressure to maintain its very loose course longer than the price outlook dictates”.The German central banker’s comments came as a 6 per cent rise in German consumer prices, the fastest increase for almost 30 years, is causing political unease. Germany’s incoming finance minister Christian Lindner wrote on Twitter that “inflation gives rise to legitimate concerns”, adding: “In the case of currency devaluation, we’ll observe how it develops after the pandemic.”The ECB has tried to calm anxiety about rising prices by saying many one-off causes of inflation such as surging energy prices, supply chain bottlenecks and the reversal of a German sales tax cut will fade next year.While a surge in coronavirus cases and the spread of a new variant are causing more uncertainty over the economy, there are signs that ECB officials doubt whether inflation will fall as fast as they thought.“In 2022, bottlenecks may last longer than expected,” Luis de Guindos, vice-president of the ECB, said in an interview with Les Echos published on Tuesday. “There’s a risk that inflation will not go down as quickly and as much as we predicted.”A 27.4 per cent rise in energy prices in November from a year earlier was the biggest driver of inflation in the bloc’s 19 countries. But the prices of food, services and goods all rose faster than the ECB’s 2 per cent target.Core inflation, which the ECB monitors for underlying pressures because it strips out more volatile energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices, climbed to 2.6 per cent, up from 2 per cent a month earlier. Some of the increase in services prices was due to a lower weighting of package holidays in the official inflation basket to reflect the drop in tourism during the pandemic.Luigi Speranza, chief global economist at BNP Paribas, said: “It is quite difficult to ignore figures like those we see today, so there will be growing demands for compensation in higher wages for workers.”Economists are struggling to assess the impact on inflation of a record surge in coronavirus cases and the spread of the Omicron variant in Europe.Jack Allen-Reynolds, senior Europe economist at Capital Economics, said the variant was likely to reduce overall inflation due to lower oil prices but could push up goods prices by adding to supply chain logjams created by the pandemic. He predicted eurozone inflation would only fall below the ECB’s 2 per cent target in late 2022.The ECB will issue new inflation forecasts on December 16 and is widely expected to increase them from those issued in September, when it predicted a fall from 2.2 per cent this year to 1.7 per cent next year and 1.5 per cent in 2023.
20  Eric Zemmour, the anti-immigration polemicist, has declared his bid for the French presidency with an appeal to those he said were scorned by elites and felt like strangers in their own country.“You feel dispossessed.you have the impression of no longer living in the country you know,” he said on Tuesday in a YouTube video that included clips showing black residents of France and scenes of violent street demonstrations. “It’s no longer time to reform France, but to save it.”Reading from a script at a desk in front of shelves of leather-bound books, Zemmour said: “This country you cherish is in the process of disappearing.Immigration is not the source of all our problems, but it worsens them all.” He lamented the “thirdworldisation” of France as well as “Islamo-leftism”, “decline” and “decadence”.France will hold a presidential election next April, when President Emmanuel Macron will seek a second term. The 63-year-old Zemmour was at one point in the autumn second in the polls only to Macron, without having declared himself a candidate.The formal launch of his campaign comes as his popularity appears to be declining and after a disastrous visit last weekend to the Mediterranean port of Marseille.He failed to attract supporters on the streets there and returned the gesture when a woman raised her middle finger at him, prompting his political rivals to dismiss him as unworthy of the presidency. Zemmour said his reaction was “very inelegant”.Although his antagonism towards non-European immigrants and Muslims puts him to the right even of his far-right rival Marine Le Pen and her Rassemblement National party, Zemmour has also attracted support from conservative voters who would normally vote for the centre-right.His relentless focus on immigration has helped to set the French political agenda and move debate sharply to the right, as candidates jostle for position ahead of the presidential vote and the legislative election to follow in June.Members of the centre-right Les Républicains party are due to vote for their own candidate this week, and even previously moderate LR hopefuls such as Michel Barnier, the EU’s former Brexit negotiator, have hardened their rhetoric against migration.The leftwing parties once prominent in French politics have almost disappeared from view in the early weeks of the campaign, with the Socialist candidate Anne Hidalgo, the Paris mayor, gaining barely 5 per cent of first-round voting intentions. That leaves her below Jean-Luc Mélenchon of the far-left La France Insoumise (France Unbowed) party, and below Yannick Jadot of the Greens.Zemmour’s declaration was drenched in nostalgia for the France of the past. The French, he said, recalled “the land of Joan of Arc and of Louis XIV, the land of Bonaparte and General de Gaulle, the land of knights and noblewomen, the land of Victor Hugo and Chateaubriand, the land of Pascal and Descartes”.Jean-François Mbaye, an MP for Macron’s centrist La République en Marche party, accused Zemmour of “aping de Gaulle, who must be turning in his grave, with a mediocre and pitiful appeal” while France wanted to look to the future.Fabien Roussel, the Communist party candidate, said “hate is his profession and polemic his aim” while Mélenchon’s campaign chief Manuel Bompard mocked Zemmour’s nostalgia and asked on Twitter: “It seems that Zemmour has just declared himself a candidate for the presidential election of 1965?”
21  Fendi, it transpires, is also feeling the collaborative spirit with Fendi Casa, having inked a partnership deal with Design Holding – owners of brands such as Flos, Louis Poulson and B&B Italia – to create Fashion Furniture Design (FF Design). Design Holding is a majority shareholder, jointly overseeing design, production and distribution, although the details of the financial deal have not been released.Fendi Casa dates back to 1987. It was conceived by the fashion designer Anna Fendi, one of the five Fendi daughters of the founders Adele and Edoardo Fendi. Today, it is overseen by Anna’s daughter Silvia Venturini Fendi (artistic director of accessories and menswear; she and her daughter Delfina Delettrez Fendi are the only family members still working at the brand). Venturini Fendi is intent on carrying that torch into the future. For the new collection, she has brought in a design team and will oversee all forthcoming seasons. The unveiling of the collection at Fendi’s home, the Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana building, known to locals as the Square Colosseum, is also significant: a symbol of Fendi’s mission to create closer links between its fashion and home divisions.What is immediately striking about the new collection – in contrast to the fashion world’s obsession with in-your-face logos (and, to note, the “double F” emblazoned across the new Skims capsule) – is a subtler take on the traditional Fendi Casa aesthetic. While the signature materials, such as leather and detailing, still feel luxurious, the silhouettes of the furniture and accessories are simple and more refined. This shift is a sign of the times, says Venturini Fendi. “Fendi Casa was the first home line from a fashion brand. At the beginning of the ’80s it was portraying the mood of the time and the codes were probably heavier,” she says, adjusting the black-rimmed spectacles that frame her face under a sweep of short blonde hair. “Now the credibility of the house has been built into the pieces, so we really want to work more on the designs of the objects and focus less on the logo.”We design for people who want pieces that will stay”Logos, part of the house’s DNA, remain key to the collection, but are discreetly interwoven into print and pattern. And there are clever reminders of the house’s fashion codes: within the new rug selection is a design reproducing the FF logo of the Baguette bag – created by Venturini Fendi in the 1990s and sparking a revolution in It bags for the house – while the Karligraphy logo, designed by the late Karl Lagerfeld (who joined the maison in 1965 initially to reinvigorate its fur line, and continued as its creative conductor until his death in 2019), and mimicking his swirling handwriting, becomes part of a wave-like pattern on its own striking carpet.Venturini Fendi gets excited about carpets. “Rugs immediately create a strong identity. I define them as sensual – they’re linked to the soft side of Fendi, which has always been very textural if you think of the use of shearling or fur,” says the designer, who took over womenswear for a short time after the death of Lagerfeld before handing the reins to Kim Jones in 2020. “We treat them like we treat our patterns, using them as canvases. I like to have everything very neutral for the furniture but then add a high dose of eclecticism with the rugs. In the future we’re also going to do some tapestries. We are going to use rugs more and more.”The pairing of forms – interspersed with playful touches of colour and design – turns the focus of the collection onto what the house is best known for: craftsmanship with impeccable precision. “We wanted to do something new, but new and timeless, so I think this is what you perceive when you see the pieces – it is subtle but there was a lot of hard work in making simple things complicated,” Venturini Fendi says. “Look closely and they are very detailed. They say Fendi in a way that is whispered – and this is the most challenging thing to achieve.”These details reveal much about the inspirations behind the designs. A pair of Metropolis coffee tables by Swiss architect-designers Atelier Oï (Fendi Casa is continuing its tradition of collaborating with outside architects and designers, who in the past have included creatives such as Cristina Celestino) stand on one Yellow Sign carpet. The oxidised-metal base of the tables takes the form of a series of arches – a design detail I later see repeated on a marble dining table of monolithic proportions. Both pieces ignite a sense of déjà vu – which is when one realises that the arches reference those adorning the façade of the Fendi building. “This place influences all of our collections. Everything is born here. That was why we wanted to show the new Fendi Casa in our own casa. Much of the inspiration – from the colours to the beautiful marbles – comes from here,” says Venturini Fendi. “That marble table is sculpture, but there’s also a version translated into metal, which is so light and airy with a glass top, you just see the bones of it. So it’s about playing with contrast, that is something we do a lot at Fendi.”Playful juxtapositions thread through the entire collection. At one end of the style spectrum is Thierry Lemaire’s opulent emerald velvet Parsifal sofa, replete with armrests neatly decorated with Pequin stripes (Fendi’s “logo, non logo” created by Lagerfeld and the Fendi sisters in 1983). It could not be more disparate from Atelier Oï’s nubuck Fendi Fun sofa – its couch seemingly bursting at the seams as the stuffing and padding peeks from the loosely pinned edges of the upholstery. Then there’s the Groove & Groovy armchair and footstool by Toan Nguyen, a marvellously mad shaggy throwback to the ’70s in shearling.“That beautiful yellow shearling armchair becomes something totally different when you do it in linen, but it still says Fendi,” says Venturini Fendi. “It’s these clashes and contrasts that make the collection so interesting and customisable because we’re not just creating an object, we’re creating a mood. So you can have a very simple sofa next to a very eclectic chair because that’s what makes it exciting.” Eclecticism also extends to the mix and layering of materials: humble bamboo is transformed into an intricate decorative inlay atop Chiara Andreatti’s Astuccio table that’s edged with a metallic finish, while the Delano bed has been updated with a tactile micro-bouclé headboard. Fendi’s future business approach focuses on integration. The house plans to show its new home accessories – small jewels in their own right – with its fashion accessories in store. “There will also be some furniture pieces mixed in, so basically our collections will increasingly be linked,” adds Venturini Fendi. “The furniture connects with our fashion collections because those men and women who go down the catwalk are supposed to be living the Fendi vision, too. It’s a sort of cycle. We design for people who want pieces that will stay in their house, not just for a season but to be reused and passed on. I like durability in objects and I have exactly the same people in mind whatever I’m designing.”As part of that vision, a new store – a veritable world of Fendi – will open in the centre of Milan by April 2022. “It will be a big store, everything will be there, and I assure you it will be very beautiful,” concludes Venturini Fendi with a smile. “And look out for lighting. Lighting will be big…”
22  Turkey’s economy continued its rapid expansion in the third quarter, but analysts warned that the pace of growth was unsustainable given rapidly rising inflation and a depreciating lira.Strong household consumption helped power GDP growth of 7.4 per cent between July and September compared with the same period in 2020.The expansion was also fuelled by government spending and a boom in exports, which rose by close to 26 per cent year on year.The figures, which come on the heels of annual growth of 22 per cent in the second quarter of 2021, will be hailed by Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose political fortunes are widely seen as linked to the performance of the country’s $795bn economy.Both the Turkish government and independent forecasters expect overall GDP growth of about 9 per cent in 2021 — a rate likely to be one of the fastest in the world.Jason Tuvey, of the consultancy Capital Economics, said the Turkish economy had been “really motoring along” in the third quarter.But he warned that the fast-paced expansion was unlikely to last given the sharp slide in the lira, which has lost more than 30 per cent of its value against the dollar since the central bank began cutting interest rates in September under Erdogan’s orders.“Turkey is still in a currency crisis and some of the more pernicious effects we would expect from a sharp currency fall are likely to filter through,” said Tuvey, who predicts a downturn in either the final quarter of this year or the first months of 2022.“While the weak lira will probably support net trade it’s likely to weigh heavily on domestic consumption. As inflation rises and household incomes suffer, consumption is likely to fall back.”That view was echoed by the investment bank Goldman Sachs. “Anecdotal evidence suggests that the recent lira depreciation has been disruptive to economic activity,” its analysts wrote in a note to clients published prior to Tuesday’s data.Erdogan, who holds the unorthodox view that high interest rates cause inflation rather than cooling it, has pressured the central bank to cut rates three times in the past three months even as annual inflation has climbed to almost 20 per cent.The Turkish president, whose fixation on fast-paced growth at all costs has led to repeated bouts of high inflation and financial volatility in recent years, has during previous crises been forced to accept sharp rate rises to restore stability. That has taken a toll on growth.This time, however, Erdogan has insisted rate rises are not on the cards. Speaking last week, he said he would not countenance “crushing our people and our farmers” with high interest rates, adding that the cost of borrowing would fall further.The Turkish president has argued a weak lira will boost exports, investment and employment. Economists say that, even if parts of the strategy succeed, it will come at a cost of soaring inflation that risks severely eroding standards of living.
23  The European Commission tomorrow is set to put some numbers in its investment strategy abroad dubbed “Global Gateway” — an attempt to counterbalance China’s investment spree via its Belt and Road Initiative. The Financial Times has got a hold of the draft and we’ll unpack its proposals. Meanwhile, officials in Brussels say it’s likely that EU leaders will hold a conference call in coming days to improve co-ordination amid a flurry of national restrictions to deal with Omicron. Here is a great explainer of what we know about the new coronavirus variant.In trade news, a tit-for-tat mechanism that would force other countries to open their public procurement market to European companies is inching towards adoption. We’ll look at the main bones of contention between the parliament and member states.And in a rare exercise of self-awareness, the commission has drafted internal guidelines on how to be more inclusive in its communication when it comes to gender, age, religion and disability.This article is an on-site version of our Europe Express newsletter.  to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every weekday morningHaving watched China extend its global economic and political power via the sprawling Belt and Road Initiative for more than seven years, western capitals are trying to develop alternatives, writes Sam Fleming in Brussels. This week the EU will put forward its contribution, in the wake of a decision at the G7 summit in Cornwall in June for democracies to collaborate more closely on addressing developing countries’ multitrillion-euro infrastructure deficit. The Global Gateway project pushed by Brussels will focus on physical infrastructure including fibreoptic cables, green energy, and transport, as well as health systems and education. The project aims to mobilise up to €300bn of private and public spending by 2027, according to a draft seen by Europe Express. The plans do not explicitly name-check China and its signature infrastructure initiative, but the BRI looms heavily over the document. The EU wants to offer its financing under “fair and favourable terms” — in a reference to concerns that some BRI recipient countries have been hobbled by unsustainable debts. Projects will be delivered with good governance, it says, and to high standards. The scheme will aim to “forge links and not create dependencies”.The question is whether the Global Gateway lives up to the commission’s highly ambitious billing. The headline sum in the draft, for example, is a princely one that represents an increase from earlier internal proposals, and it will be closely scrutinised. The commission’s plans hinge heavily on its ability to “crowd in” private spending using very modest amounts of public funding. This construction is long familiar to Brussels watchers, who have followed initiatives such as the Juncker Plan for EU infrastructure.About €135bn of investments will be enabled by guarantees from the EU’s new European Fund for Sustainable Development Plus programme, the draft says. This will entail the Luxembourg-based European Investment Bank catalysing €25bn of investments. Grant financing of up to €18bn will come from other EU programmes. And half of the targeted spending will come from European financial and development finance institutions.All this involves a “Team Europe” approach — a slightly cringey label for Brussels joining forces with the EU member states and other financial institutions. Left unclear is how much of the Global Gateway spending will drive new initiatives, and how much amounts to a rebranding exercise.What the draft makes abundantly clear is the commission’s newfound ambition to turn the EU into a serious player in the global infrastructure arena. The question is whether the outcomes live up to the heady billing.With government procurement still one of the most closed markets worldwide, the EU is attempting to force it open with a tit-for-tat measure that would make it harder for companies to win contracts in the EU if their own government does not open tenders to European companies, writes Andy Bounds in Brussels.The European Commission first proposed the International Procurement Instrument almost a decade ago. Some member states felt it was too protectionist and blocked it for many years. But now the instrument is inching towards adoption, a symbol of how the bloc has moved to a more defensive trade policy.Member states in the council of ministers have agreed their negotiating position and the European parliament’s international trade committee will announce its position today. With all the main political groups backing the legislation, it should pass easily and then be rubber-stamped by the full parliament in mid-January. That will kick off negotiations between the three institutions before the law is finally adopted.France, a big backer of the plan, would like to pass it during its presidency of the EU in the first half of next year.“It should be an effective market opener” in an “increasingly hostile environment” for trade, said Daniel Caspary, the German EPP member who has steered the legislation through. Government procurement typically accounts for 10 to 20 per cent of an average economy’s gross domestic product, according to the commission.The EU has a €2tn market for public procurement of goods, services and public works. The commission estimates that half the global procurement market is closed to foreign bidders and greater access could more than double EU procurement exports, from €10bn annually to €22bn. Brussels is particularly irked by the Buy America Act, which allows public bodies to prioritise domestic companies, and China’s restrictions on selling services in its domestic market.The EU instrument is rather unwieldy, by contrast. First, a complaint must be made that a bid comes from a country with a closed procurement market. The commission will then investigate and could add a penalty to the bid so it is less likely to win. The council wants an extra 20 per cent and the parliament 100 per cent. Or it could ban the company from future bids. But the parliament wants the commission to be able to ban all companies from that country from bidding. Its favoured threshold for an investigation would be €10m for works and concessions, and €5m for goods and services.There is no guarantee that retaliation will lead these countries to open up in return. They could just close their own doors even tighter. Yet arguments that buying cheap from third countries benefits the taxpayer are seldom heard any more.As Inma Rodríguez-Piñero, a Spanish Socialist on the trade committee, said: “We can no longer be naive when it comes to trade relations. Why should other countries build our bridges and roads when we cannot build theirs?” Supplies of vaccines to poorer countries have ramped up since September, but the global disparities in the rollout are stark: So far, 66 per cent of people living in G7 countries have had two vaccine doses; in Africa, only 6 per cent. Almost twice as many people in high-income countries have booster shots as have had first and second doses in low-income countries. (More here) The European Commission has come up with fresh guidelines on how to write inclusive communication with equality and non-discrimination as key values in mind, writes Javier Espinoza in Brussels.Europe Express has seen an internal document outlining the way commission officials are expected to “update their language”, with concrete examples of what phrasings to use and what to avoid. This is not the first time the commission has offered guidance to its staff. It last published a “reminder” to employees in 2018 and the document included a section on inclusion and language. The difference this time around is that the entire guide is on inclusion. Here’s a quick run through of the main points included in the guide:Gender-neutral: EU officials are asked to avoid using gender-specific pronouns and steer clear of gendered words including “chairman”, “ladies and gentleman” or “man-made” and instead use “chair”, “colleagues” and “human-induced”. Also, instead of asking a person which pronouns they prefer, they should simply ask what their pronouns are. Rainbow minefield: Commission staff are warned to be careful when they use words including “gay” and “lesbians” as nouns because it may be inappropriate. “Transgender, bi or intersex are not nouns,” the guidelines say. “Say trans people, gay person, etc or refer to the person explicitly.” EU officials should also avoid using the word “homosexual” because it can be considered offensive and it is sometimes used by anti-gay activists.Display diversity: Instead of assuming that everyone is Christian, white and married, officials are encouraged to use examples and images of people with diverse ethnic, religious or cultural backgrounds. Instead of referring to Christmas, officials should say “the holiday season”. They should also refrain from equating Middle Eastern or Arab to Muslim and be mindful of immigrants or stateless people when referring to “citizens”.A commission spokesperson said the overall aim of the document was to “raise awareness about being inclusive in communication” and admitted there may be better examples that could have been used. “We are not prohibiting nor discouraging the use of the word Christmas. Of course not. Celebrating Christmas and using Christian names and symbols is part of the rich European heritage,” the spokesperson added.The head of the European Medicines Agency fields questions from EU lawmakers on Omicron, boosters and vaccinating children.Nato foreign ministers meet in Riga.There is no evidence to suggest that inflation is spiralling out of controlRecord high: Inflation in Germany has surged to its highest level since 1992, increasing the pressure on the European Central Bank to explain why it still thinks it would be premature to tighten its ultra-loose monetary policy. Protocol boost: The economy of Northern Ireland has largely recovered from the hit of the Covid-19 pandemic, with economic output in the third quarter just 0.3 per cent below that in the final quarter of 2019. This marks the best performance in the UK and points to the nation prospering under the Northern Ireland protocol.

24  On August 6, after hearing about the Taliban advance in southern Afghanistan, Harif Ahmadzai fled his hometown of Gardez without saying goodbye to his parents. That marked the start of a 106-day journey to a makeshift camp in northern France — and the chance of a dangerous boat ride to the UK.“If I stayed, they would have killed me. They’re cleansing the land,” said the 25-year-old soldier and father of two, showing scars on his body that he said came from a car bomb set off by the Islamist militants three years earlier. Two of his cousins, also in the army, had been murdered, he added. “All our lives we helped the government, but they abandoned us on the land, left us there to die.”At a camp in Grande-Synthe near the port of Dunkirk, Ahmadzai is among a growing number of men and children who fled the Taliban regime in the wake of the chaotic withdrawal of US and UK troops from Afghanistan in the summer. These men are joining hundreds of migrants attempting to reach the English shore by sea from northern France, after a police crackdown has made clandestine crossings by train, lorry and car too difficult. People at the camp estimated there were about 100 Afghans waiting to cross the Channel, even after 27 people died at sea last week.Anna Richel, a co-ordinator at Utopia 56, a charity in Dunkirk, has noticed “a lot of people from Afghanistan” in recent months including unaccompanied minors. Governments across Europe “need to discuss creating a safe place in France for people to apply for asylum, as well as a legal way for them to travel”, she said.Even though the Financial Times was not able to verify the details of individuals’ accounts, the country these people come from and the persecution they recount suggests their asylum applications would be credible. A high proportion of asylum applications from Afghans in the UK are successful: of the 826 cases decided in the year to September, 62 per cent were granted asylum or some other form of refugee protection after their initial application. About half of people refused at the initial stage typically succeed in overturning the decision, meaning around 80 per cent will eventually succeed.But they have to make it to the UK first.Ahmadzai gathered about $10,000 for his escape. Half of the money came from the sale of land and savings stashed at home, and half from a loan. Most of it was used to pay smugglers to get into Iran from the province of Nimruz, and travel across Europe. In Dunkirk, he spent £2,500 for a ticket on a motorised inflatable boat to reach the UK — or “the game” as people in the camp call the risky sea crossing.When the Financial Times met him, he said he had attempted the crossing three times — the first time the engine cut out, and police slashed the boats at the beach in the other two attempts. If they do not reach the other side, they can try again as many times as it takes to get there, at no extra cost.Ahmedzai is patient. In the early afternoon in Grande-Synthe, with temperatures hovering just above freezing, he took off his shoes and laid his jacket on the ground to pray. When he was finished, he offered the spot to a 14-year-old Afghan boy who had arrived at the camp alone.Haroon Kabuli, who said he had been a translator for the German forces, said his own journey started before the US and British military withdrawal. He said he had been captured driving a German government car, imprisoned in the north-eastern town of Kunduz and regularly beaten for several weeks in February. When he managed to escape, he headed straight for Nimruz, from where he set off across the Middle East to Europe, paying $3,000 to smugglers along the way.He said he was first refused asylum in Greece after being told he needed to apply in Germany because of his previous translation work. After paying smugglers another €2,500, he arrived in Germany, where he spent two months trying to apply for asylum. Eventually he was told he could not because of the “Dublin regulation”.This regulation generally requires refugees to apply for asylum in the first country deemed safe that they set foot in — Greece in Kabuli’s case — or wait 18 months without the right to work before they can apply again. The EU registered a total of 56,000 asylum applications in the month of August 2021 alone, according to EU data. Almost a fifth of them were made by Afghans, who overtook Syrians to become the largest applicant group.Many often reach the EU in countries such as Malta or Greece where a large number of applications take more than six months to process, according to EU data. When they leave, it is impossible for them to receive asylum in countries such as Germany and France.“People want to stay in France,” Kabuli said. “All of the Afghans here — you can ask all of these people here — they tried to get asylum but they got [hit with] Dublin. Dublin means ‘you are nothing’.”Following Brexit, the UK is no longer part of the Dublin framework, meaning that, while the British system is difficult and slow to navigate, they are at present unlikely to be returned to mainland Europe. The fact that many of them speak English and have relatives in the UK are also major draws. The UK received 1,974 applications for asylum from Afghan citizens in the year to September, 5 per cent of all applications.After the fall of Kabul to the Taliban in August, the UK promised to set up an Afghan citizens’ resettlement scheme to admit up to 20,000 vulnerable Afghans, at a rate of 5,000 a year over the next four years. However, the ACRS has still not been opened and no date has been given for it to do so.One leading member of the British Afghan community, who declined to be named because of the issue’s sensitivity, said: “We need to understand that we can expect people to come illegally if there are no legal routes.”Kabuli is one of those opting for the clandestine route to the UK. “There is at least a sleeping place for us there, some food for us there.until our asylum application is dealt with,” he said. “Here,” he said, pointing to dozens of tents being dashed by the rain, “there is nothing.”The story was amended to reflect that there were 826 asylum cases decided for the year to September, not June
25  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
26  A Dutch trade union has accused fashion retailer H&M and its logistics partner of cutting break times for warehouse staff and refusing to engage with workers in an alleged violation of local labour laws and its own policies.Migrant workers at its Tilburg warehouse in the Netherlands, run by US-listed GXO Logistics on behalf of the world’s second largest fashion retailer, said that security protocols designed to prevent product theft were eating into their break times.The accusations come as retailers race to meet demand during the Black Friday and Christmas peak season at a time of constricted labour supply, mounting pressure on logistics staff.The Federation of Dutch Trade Unions (FNV) said GXO had refused to open dialogue about requiring staff to work six days a week, leading 700 workers to petition the company over working conditions, saying their breaks had been reduced.Warehouse management refused to accept the petition, the union said. GXO told H&M it would accept the petition but not while being filmed as FNV had demanded.H&M said it strives to act ethically, transparently and responsibly and expects the same of its partners, while it had highlighted to GXO that its sustainability commitments require freedom of association for workers in its supply chain.“We are confident that as the directly involved parties, GXO and FNV will use their best efforts to be fair, respectful and constructive in their dialogue and set the right actions for next steps,” it said.GXO said it supports the right of free assembly and addresses staff concerns through Works Councils — internal employee representative bodies. “We comply with all labour regulations and policies and allegations to the contrary are false,” it added.FNV says asking employees to raise their concerns through Works Councils — which it argues are vulnerable to the influence of management representatives — is not in line with H&M’s own guidelines on migrant workers, which allows for freedom of association with any trade union.In an email response to the union, H&M said it “will take a neutral position” because it believed GXO’s local management offered to accept the petition and had not strayed from the retailer’s labour relationship principles and sustainability commitments.Thulsi Narayanasamy, head of labour rights at the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre, said that “H&M is yet to take responsibility directly for these workers in the same way it has for garment suppliers, despite warehouses and delivery drivers being a core part of their supply chain.”A Slovakian working at the warehouse said he had only 35 minutes to rest during his physically demanding eight-hour shifts instead of 45 minutes.“We tried to hand out the petition and go to the office. They blocked the doors with security. They wouldn’t let workers go out or in of the warehouse as if we are some kind of criminals,” he said.The workers, mostly employed through agencies, come from Poland, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Spain and Lithuania.Aneta, who recently stopped working at the warehouse, said the pressure had been building in recent months with packing targets rising to 250 items an hour.“I’m not sure if H&M knows about everything happening in the warehouse,” she said. “Management tells us ‘if H&M wants to know something then tell H&M you don’t speak English’.”The accusations come as conditions within multinational supply chains are under greater scrutiny. Dyson, the British appliance maker, terminated a partnership with ATA IMS this week after a whistleblower accused the Malaysian parts maker of labour rights abuses, while online behemoth Amazon faced strikes in Europe on Friday over pay and conditions.Some governments are seeking to make multinationals responsible for labour issues in their supply chain. Germany passed a law in June requiring large companies to ensure social and environmental standards are applied throughout their supply chains.
27  Asle has some problems. His underage girlfriend is heavily pregnant. They have nowhere to live, and no money. And he has an unfortunate habit of murdering everyone who annoys him.For his new opera Sleepless, composer Peter Eötvös has set Norwegian writer Jon Fosse’s trance-like Trilogy stories to music. The work, co-commissioned by Geneva’s Grand Théâtre, received its world premiere at Berlin’s Staatsoper Unter den Linden on Sunday.The composer’s wife, Mari Mezei, has created a dense, wordy libretto that closely follows Fosse’s original. She leaves out the dream sequences, presumably assuming that Eötvös’s bent for the hallucinogenic will prove sufficiently removed from reality. It does not.Sleepless tells the story of lost lovers in a hostile coastal village. Though parallels with Peter Grimes and Wozzeck are inevitable, Eötvös avoids direct musical quotations. Asle is hanged for his crimes, which sits oddly with Kornél Mundruczó’s modern production. Perhaps the powers-that-be thought that Mundruczó’s gritty realism would be a foil for what, in the end, is a ballad verging dangerously on kitsch.Monika Pormale’s ingenious set consists of a gigantic salmon on a revolving stage — all shiny scales and glowing eye on the outside, raw flesh and bones creating various rooms on the inside. Drunk fisherman in dirty oilskins lurch around with bottles or crates of beer, threatening and judging their way through the story; an angelic chorus of offstage women provide an inner voice for the pregnant, passive Alida.The women in this tale are all hags, whores or mothers; Alida is referred to as “little slut” with monotonous regularity. She has no agency — yet another opera that fails the Bechdel test. Is this really 2021?Eötvös is undoubtedly the master of his craft. Sleepless is beguilingly beautiful, deftly orchestrated, full of consonant octaves and scales and spiced with judiciously placed dissonances, vividly pictorial throughout. The vocal writing is skilful and slick. Eötvös also conducts, and the outcome is both precise and sumptuous.The score is helped along by a superlative cast. As the ill-fated young lovers, Linard Vrielink and Victoria Randem are exquisite — Vrielink all youthful lyricism with an undertone of seething violence, Randem with an ethereal beauty and meltingly lovely top notes. Katharina Kammerloher is a chameleon as both drunken mother and judgmental midwife; Hanna Schwarz makes a formidable Old Woman; Siyabonga Maqungo brings an edgy, creepy tone to his burnished tenor voice as Jeweler. The entire cast, including the offstage women, deliver vocal performances as close to perfection as anyone could wish.The work loses steam after Asle’s death, not helped by the jarring presence of something presumably intended to be a luminous white cloud that looks disturbingly like a giant cauliflower. Even a cauliflower deity might balk at the saccharine ending, as the aged Alida admires a gold bracelet left to her by Asle while drowning herself in the fjord in a blaze of transcendence. Think Suor Angelica on the beach.Sleepless is beautiful music for an irredeemable libretto, in a solid production which fails to find relevance.
28  It was the Cheval Blanc management that approached Buonocore about opening in the hotel. Arnault and his son both knew Langosteria and had dined at the branch in Paraggi near Portofino. “Mr Arnault understood the power of my brand before me,” says Buonocore. The brand is Italian cuisine. But not the “joke” simulacrum of trattoria cooking known around the world, which Buonocore scoffs at. Signature dishes include Assassina-style baby squid, tuna carpaccio with smoked aubergine, candied tomatoes and basil, and king crab à la Catalan. Langosteria represents “new Italian style”, he says, from the food to the ambience and even the staffing model. Every dish is conceived by Enrico with his team of executive chefs drawn from fine-dining kitchens across Italy and beyond. In a country where restaurants have traditionally been family run, Buonocore prides himself on a corporate structure that means the restaurants can scale up without losing their heart or quality of service. He hopes to expand internationally, perhaps to London, New York or Los Angeles.His latest venture is Langosteria Cucina, next door to the original Langosteria on Via Savona in Milan’s design district. That first (dinner-only) restaurant debuted in 2007 and was followed in 2012 by Langosteria Bistrot, which serves lunch and dinner on nearby via Privata Bobbio. The Langosteria Café launched in central Milan in 2016 and the beachside Langosteria Paraggi opened in 2017. Langosteria Cucina is a departure from the previous restaurants in that you can’t order à la carte. You are served a tasting menu, though Buonocore refuses to call it that because it sounds too much like Michelin-star dining, and the idea is to offer the best from any given day. Cucina is meant to recreate the vibe of dining in someone’s home. Dishes are largely to share and (dietary restrictions aside) you eat what the host serves. This includes dishes like salt-cod tripe with polenta, which Buonocore says no Langosteria regular would ever order (“tripe!”) but is so comfortingly delicious that it’s bound to win them round.When Buonocore and I sat down for a pre-opening 10-course lunch in November, everything tasted fantastic. When he wasn’t suggesting minor adjustments to the chef, he was clapping or hooting his approval like a football fan. “Mamma mia!” was a frequent refrain. As a brand, Langosteria’s success is premised on its quality seafood. My meal ranged from deliciously slippery raw Mantis shrimp to vibrant oysters ceviche to seductive grilled tuna belly. Buonocore not only sources the best fish but makes sure no dish is ever boring. This means adding vegetables (the pairing of tuna belly with rapino broccoli was a revelation) and incorporating sauce (what Italians call “puccia”) to mop up with bread.Alongside the food, the brand surely owes its success to Buonocore’s eye for detail. At every venue, the space between tables is kept to a minimum because he likes his waiters “to dance” around the customers (a tango, judging by his demonstration). It adds energy. The height of the tables is lower than elsewhere, because he believes it frames the guests better. In addition, his iPad allows him to remotely control every light in every venue. “When the restaurant in Paris was under construction,” he says, “I spent a lot of my time creating this vision with lighting. When we opened, all the people said the lighting in Langosteria was incredible.” It’s theatre. But it’s also about looking at your companion across the table and finding them beautiful. “After dinner at Langosteria, you want to make love,” he reasons. “It’s important.” 
29  Inflation in Germany has surged to its highest level since 1992, increasing the pressure on the European Central Bank to explain why it thinks it would be premature to tighten its ultra-loose monetary policy.German inflation rose 6 per cent in November from a year earlier, as measured by the harmonised index of consumer prices. The increase exceeded the expectations of most economists. Inflation in the country was last this high shortly after its reunification three decades ago.Spiralling prices are a sensitive subject in a country where people’s approach to money is still haunted by the hyperinflation of the 1920s and 1940s that wiped out most people’s savings.However, the ECB has tried to calm anxiety about rising prices by saying many one-off causes of inflation such as soaring energy prices and supply chain bottlenecks will fade next year.Isabel Schnabel, an ECB executive board member, said in a televised interview with Germany’s ZDF on Monday that “November will prove to be the peak” for inflation in the country.She said German inflation had averaged 2 per cent over the past two years, having fallen sharply when the pandemic hit in 2020, before a sharp rise in 2021. “There is no evidence to suggest that inflation is spiralling out of control,” she added.Eurozone inflation data is due to be released on Tuesday and is expected to hit 4.4 per cent this month, the biggest rise in 13 years and more than double the ECB’s 2 per cent target.Several factors indicate German inflation will fade next year. One is that the rebound in prices from last year’s temporary cut in sales tax will drop out of the inflation data by January. Restrictions announced this month to contain a record surge in coronavirus cases could also cool consumer spending and prices.“There is little doubt that inflation will fall next year: the only debate is how far and how fast,” said Andrew Kenningham, an economist at Capital Economics.The main drivers of German inflation in November were energy prices, which increased 22 per cent from a year earlier. That helped to push overall goods prices up by 5.2 per cent. Food prices rose 4.5 per cent, services prices increased 2.8 and rents rose 1.4 per cent.Part of the increase to the harmonised index of consumer prices came from changes to the weighting of items in the basket, which reflected unusual spending patterns during the pandemic.Germany is not alone in confronting soaring inflation. Spanish consumer prices rose 5.6 per cent this month, according to data released on Monday — also the fastest pace since 1992. Prices in Belgium also rose 5.6 per cent this month.Prices are rising even faster in the US, where they increased 6.3 per cent in October from a year ago, the biggest jump for three decades.The Federal Reserve has responded by starting to wind down its bond-buying programme in a move widely seen as a precursor to the US raising interest rates next year. However. the ECB has pushed back against investors’ bets that it will raise rates in 2022.Christine Lagarde, president of the ECB, said last week that it would be “wrong” to tighten monetary policy in response to the current surge in inflation, predicting price pressures would fade by the time such measures took effect 18 months later.“We would cause unemployment and high adjustment costs and would nonetheless not have countered the current high level of inflation,” Lagarde told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper. “I would find that wrong.”
30  In an old family album, there is photograph of my father and me, standing by a donkey loaded with peat. I must have been six. I was in short trousers. It was a family holiday on a rare trip home to Ireland. My father is smiling. I can see how happy he is. On the back of the photograph, in fading pencil, is written “Valentia Island”.When I was a child, growing up in Canada, Ireland was the absence in our lives. Tales of the sisters at Glen Farm and the shop at the top of the hill, of the Ballygowan Halt, the manse in Ahoghill, and the wet summers at Portstewart were the stories of the dinner table. Every fortnight, the Irish papers arrived, despatched by my grandparents, so after dinner my parents would sit reading about the news of the agricultural show in Donegal or the construction works on the Malone Road, as if they still lived there. And in many senses, they did.I was young when we left Ireland to emigrate, and my own memories of home were illusive. Sometimes I wondered if I remembered Ireland at all or if I merely invented it. I spent hours with the old photograph albums, peering at landscapes more intimate, more beautiful, and far more romantic than those of southwestern Ontario. Ireland had become my lost world. I absorbed my parents’ nostalgia as less fortunate children might absorb parental anxiety or anger. Homesickness is an Irish disease. I caught it from my parents.And so when I was 20, I set off to get my own Ireland. I came to Valentia, the island of the photograph, the island I did not remember. I rented a cottage. For six months, I walked and cycled the length and breadth of this little world. I clambered over the rocks beneath the lighthouse where the waves threatened to engulf me. I went to sea with the fishermen and drank with them in the evenings in the island pub. I wrote short stories, mercifully unpublished, from a desk by a window in my little cottage, overlooking the channel, watching the cloud shadows sail across the mainland mountains towards Doulus Head. I could not have been happier. At the end of my stay, in the dying days of that distant autumn, I was heartbroken to leave, for London and for real life.I have carried those memories of Valentia with me as my parents carried memories of the Antrim Coast and the villages of County Down. And now, decades on, I wanted to return, to rediscover not just the island I had loved, but all those western islands. All travel is a kind of quest, though what you are looking for and what you find rarely coincide. I probably hoped, travelling to Valentia in October, that I might glimpse my young self coming round a bend in the Glanleam road. But in the end, it was really Ireland itself that I was chasing across Kerry and Galway.The seas off the west coast of Ireland are scattered with islands whose remoteness lends them both romance and a curious authority. For generations of Irish writers and artists, they became repositories of identity, some essence of uncontaminated Irishness. The opening of Yeats’ famous poem captures this notion of an island paradise — “I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree.” A host of writers and intellectuals arose and went to the Aran Islands — Lady Gregory, Patrick Pearse, Eoin MacNeil, Frederick Burton, William Wilde, Oscar’s father, and most notably, JM Synge, who went to Inis Meáin at Yeats’s urging.Brooding among waves, Inis Meáin is a stark elemental place armoured with rock. Winds whistle and moan through the dry stone walls enclosing fields of limestone where sheep graze among wildflowers and boulders. A relentless sea batters the shores. There are barely a hundred houses scattered along the narrow lanes of the island, served by one pub, one shop and one church. The island is ruled by its temperamental weather, sweeping off the Atlantic, a constant drama, veering from tempest to benign beauty in a moment.I was happy in the turning weather. I walked the island lanes. Cattle lifted their heads to watch me pass, peering over their stone walls. Upturned boats, or currachs, lay in the fields near the shore, waiting for summer, their black shiny backs like hibernating beetles. On the empty beach that runs round Ceann Gainimh there were no footprints other than my own, just the cuneiform markings of sandpipers’ feet, making their way from the dunes to the lap of the waves. From the clifftops at Aill an Fhéir, I listened to the sea booming far below. Troops of gannets were diving into the black waves and lighthouses winked in the gathering dusk on the coast of Galway.One evening, I fell in with a man out for an evening stroll. In the falling light, his face was indistinct, a strange spectral effect. We talked of the weather of course, and then of the modern world, and how recently it had arrived here. He remembered the first car to come to the island, in 1962. It broke down soon afterwards and no one knew how to fix it. Unimpressed with the internal combustion engine, it was another seven years before anyone risked investing in another.At our backs was the ancient world. The silhouette of the great ringfort of Dún Conor rose against the night sky. Thought to date back to the Bronze or Iron Age, though no-one is really sure, it is one of the grandest buildings in the west of Ireland, its curving dry stone walls 20ft thick in places. The islanders traditionally believed it was inhabited by a cavalcade of spirits, by sprites and banshees and fairies, who fly about the island to unsettle the plans of humans. I would say there are a few that are still believing that, the man laughed.On the way back to my lodgings, I stopped in at the pub, which hummed with the sibilant susurrus of Gaelic. A man sang a traditional air so beautiful, it left me tearful. Afterwards the room was silent but for the wind banging at the door. Travel makes one modest, Flaubert wrote. We see what a tiny place we occupy in the world. On these islands, they have learnt that modesty without leaving home. The islanders are dwarfed by the elements. It has given them the gift of humility.At Dunquin on Slea Head, at the western end of the Dingle Peninsula, a small boat slipped into a narrow cleft in the rocks. Timing my stride between the swells, I skipped aboard. This precarious little harbour, impossible in anything but calm weather, is the Blasket Islands’ only link to the outside world.A hundred years ago, a stream of nervous linguists climbed into currachs in this harbour to brave the crossing to the islands. The isolation of the Blaskets — only a couple of miles offshore — meant that the Irish spoken here was pure and uncontaminated by English. This influx of linguists created the strange impression among the islanders that the whole of the outside world was obsessed with the learning of their language.The largest of the six islands, the Great Blasket, described as “wallowing like a whale in the darkening sea surrounded by its 12 young”, was inhabited by a couple of hundred islanders for over three centuries. They lived on fishing, they grew potatoes, they grazed their sheep and cattle on the rich island grass. Often they were cut off from the mainland for weeks at a time. It was not uncommon for islanders to succumb to illness due to the difficulty of getting a doctor across the channel. The islanders’ own tragedies at sea in their small currachs were a recurring theme, as were falls from the spectacular cliffs when children tried to gather the eggs of sea birds.With little other entertainment, the Blasket islanders had a strong oral tradition, and the literary visitors persuaded some of the islanders to write their memoirs, to record their lives on the island. Thus began an extraordinary canon of Gaelic books from the Blaskets. The memoirs of Tomas O’Crohan, Maurice O’Sullivan, and Peig Sayers are still in print, still much loved, and still central to any study of Gaelic literature. Robin Flower, who translated some of these works, said of Peig Sayers, “her words could be written down as they leave her lips, and they would have the effect of literature”. The irony of the remote Blaskets, inhabited by a couple of hundred people with little schooling among them, is that books became their greatest export.Today the Blaskets are empty. From the quay I followed a grass lane through the abandoned village. By 1953, emigration had shrunk the population to only 22 people, and the government offered them houses on the mainland. In a stormy November of that year, they climbed into their boats and left the island forever. Today Great Blasket is an island of ghosts.Most of the old cottages have fallen into ruin but three have been maintained and are available to visitors to stay the night, provided they bring their own food. My little house, at the top of the ruined village, was the kind of white-washed cottage that appears on Irish postcards, the kind of house I had dreamt of as a boy — rough flagstones, a cast-iron stove, fireside armchairs, a comfy bed beneath the eaves, a view of the ocean and the mountains of the mainland through the half door. When dusk came, I ate dinner outside overlooking the channel beneath a tall sky of stars as constellations sank towards the ocean.On the beach below, where the men of the island used to play hurling, running in and out of the sea after the ball, was a colony of grey seals. They made a sound like low keening that drifted up to the house from the shore below. With the waves, this mournful calling was the only sound on the empty island. By candlelight, I read Tomas O’Crohan’s account of life here. “I have done my best to set down the character of the people about me”, he wrote, “… so that some record of us might live after us, for the like of us will never be again.”Though I had not been back to Valentia for almost 40 years, it had the comforting familiarity of home, which is how I thought of it. The old Royal Hotel still presided over the waterfront in Knightstown, a grand dame unashamed of her old-fashioned manners. Other than an added espresso machine, the pub at the top of the town seemed unchanged. The lighthouse still stood over a tumult of crashing waves with long views across to the Dingle Peninsula and deep into the mountains of Kerry. Far out on the horizon stood the reassuring pyramid silhouette of Skellig Michel where, 1,500 years ago, early Christian monks read Cicero and Virgil.On the north side of Valentia, a narrowing road leads down to a small bay. The sheltered topography and the kindness of the Gulf Stream have created a strange microclimate here. There are palms and bamboo and giant ferns. The old trees are clad with lichens and moss. From the depths of the undergrowth comes the sound of unseen streams.At the end of the lane are the gates to Glanleam House, built by the Knights of Kerry in the 18th century. I remembered an evening party here in the gardens, trays of drinks, voices trailing among the trees, the slow descent of an Irish twilight. A German girl had appeared, coming up over the rocks from the beach below the house, her hair wet and tangled. She was looking for a light for a cigarette. In her stilted English, she asked, “Have you fire?” It turned out I did. The affair lasted a week before she set off for Dingle, but it has lingered, like the island itself, a lifetime.On my last morning, the whole island glistened with dew, like a new-born world. A westerly had blown through in the night. Whitecaps scudded towards Beginish, shadows raced one another across the mountains of Dingle, and small birds flew up from the heather and tumbled away in the wind.“We were imbued with the sound of the wind.”, O’Crohan wrote, “beating in our ears every morning, clearing our brains and rinsing the dust from our skulls.”This is why I had come. I wanted the wind, I wanted that tumultuous humbling weather, I wanted to rinse the dust from my brain, so that I could savour again the strange wild clarity of these islands, and of my time there.
31  Magdalena Andersson has become Sweden’s prime minister for the second time in a week. Her previous stint ended after just seven hours, but in another vote in parliament on Monday she mustered enough support to reclaim the premiership.Andersson, leader of the centre-left Social Democrats, is Sweden’s first female prime minister.The 54-year-old is set to run the country for the next 10 months before elections that will be fiercely contested by the centre-right and nationalist parties who argue that the Social Democrat-led governments of the past seven years have done little to stop the Sweden turning into a hotspot for gang crime, including shootings and grenade attacks.Andersson’s first attempt to become prime minister ended in chaos. Hours after being named premier on Wednesday she lost a parliamentary vote on the budget she wrote as finance minister, her coalition government collapsed and she resigned — all in the course of seven frenetic hours. She will now lead a minority, one-party government.On Monday, Andersson told a press conference: “Somebody must be prime minister in this country, and there does not seem to be an alternative.”She conceded that the events of the past week were seen by many as “odd”, but said it felt “very good” to be elected as Sweden’s first female prime minister.She said her government would try to move Sweden forward in three main areas: welfare, climate change and the fight against gang crime and segregation.Stefan Lofven stepped down as prime minister and Social Democrat leader this month after becoming the first Swedish head of government to lose a vote of no confidence after far-left and far-right parties joined forces to oust him.Sweden’s politics have been in upheaval for the past decade due to the emergence of the nationalist Sweden Democrats, which gained 17.5 per cent of the vote in the 2018 elections and have occasionally topped opinion polls.Initially ostracised by all the other parties because of its roots in the neo-Nazi movement, the Sweden Democrats are now embraced by most of the mainstream centre-right. The Sweden Democrats’ budget — written together with the main opposition party, the Moderates, as well as the Christian Democrats — was adopted by parliament last week, meaning Andersson will be forced to govern with their spending plans. She will have the opportunity in the spring to try to revise those plans.Sweden, known for its focus on gender equality and feminism, is the last Nordic country to have a female prime minister, 40 years after Norway.
32  The EU wants to mobilise up to €300bn of spending on infrastructure and other projects for a Global Gateway plan to respond to China’s influential Belt and Road Initiative.The European Commission’s draft proposals, seen by the Financial Times, suggest that the EU’s ambitions will rely heavily on leveraging private sector spending as well as public investment, while co-opting spending from EU member states.The €300bn, to be invested by 2027, would include resources from the EU, member states, European financial institutions and national development banks. It would also “seek to mobilise private sector finance and expertise and support access to sustainable finance”, according to the document. The commission will set out the plans on Wednesday.Western nations are seeking to bolster their involvement in projects in developing countries and counter the BRI, under which Beijing has extended its reach and influence globally.The Global Gateway project is not explicitly pitched as an alternative to China’s projects, but the draft stresses it will provide a “values-based” option and an “ethical approach”.“By offering a positive choice for global infrastructure development, Global Gateway will invest in international stability and co-operation and demonstrate how democratic values offer certainty and fairness, sustainability for partners, and long-term benefits for people around the world,” the draft document says.The BRI has become an important strategic tool for Beijing since its launch in 2013, as dozens of countries sign up to China-backed projects such as railways, bridges and ports. This and similar initiatives have raised concerns in European capitals that the EU is far behind when it comes to developing nation infrastructure.However, some BRI recipient countries have complained that the initiative’s debt terms are onerous and some projects have deficient environmental or building standards.The EU programme would prioritise investment in digitalisation, health, climate, energy and transport as well as education and research.The draft says the EU plans to boost its budget spending on infrastructure outside the bloc, but the plans also hinge on the use of “innovative financial instruments to crowd-in private capital”, including guarantees to cut the risks of private sector investments.About €135bn of investments will be enabled by guarantees from the EU’s new European Fund for Sustainable Development Plus programme. The Luxembourg-based European Investment Bank would also be involved.Grant financing of up to €18bn will come from other EU programmes.Half of the targeted spending of up to €300bn will come from European financial and development finance institutions, according to the draft.The EU plan is designed to dovetail with work endorsed by the G7 summit held in the UK this year, including US president Joe Biden’s Build Back Better World.
33  The writer is a former chief economist at Goldman Sachs and served as a UK Treasury minister in David Cameron’s governmentIt is 20 years since I published a paper which formally grouped together the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China and coined the term “Bric” to describe them. I argued that since these countries were likely to continue their striking gross domestic product growth over the next decade, we urgently needed them to play a bigger role in global governance. With France, Germany and Italy in permanent economic and monetary union, I suggested their individual places in the G7 and corresponding representation at the IMF and World Bank could be consolidated into a single European seat, making way for the Bric countries to join a slightly expanded G7.It was not until 2003, when my team published a further piece entitled “Dreaming with Brics”, that we hypothesised these four nations could collectively become bigger economies than those of the G6 (excluding Canada). Our timing was fortuitous, coinciding with a globalisation boom which meant many international companies doing more business in Bric countries.A few years on, the financial crisis finally galvanised changes in global governance which were long overdue. My recommendation of consolidating the big continental economies into one representative never happened. But in response to the market turmoil, then US president George W Bush convened the G20 in 2008 — a grouping which included the four Bric countries. When Gordon Brown, then UK prime minister, hosted the expanded group in London a year later, this consolidated its central role in global economic and finance affairs.The introduction of the Financial Stability Forum — which subsequently became the Financial Stability Board in 2009 — and a rebalancing of the voting rights and ownership shares at the IMF and World Bank also seemed significant. These both struck me as important developments towards a greater shared prosperity, and a more representative form of global governance for the future.How disappointing then, another decade on in November 2021, that absolutely nothing has progressed. The mandated five-year review of the special drawing rights — which would probably boost the objective representation of key emerging currencies to reflect their growing strength — has been delayed. Due to US-China rivalry, the G20 itself now seems divided. Very little seems to get done.This is especially concerning because while the IMF predicts that developed economies will not suffer significant damage in the wake of the pandemic, emerging markets, with the exception of China, are expected to have far slower growth than projected before coronavirus struck.Not only has the G20 been unable to agree an equitable plan for Covid-19 vaccine distribution, but some members have also opposed the formation of a new Global Finance and Health Board, which would boost global resilience to future health challenges. The combined failure to show leadership on the 1.5C climate change target, the central feature of this month’s COP26 summit, is most worrying.Of course, the Bric leaders also formed their own economic and political club in 2009, with the addition of South Africa making it “Brics” — a development which boosted the popularity of the acronym. But other than forming another development bank, they have done very little policy co-ordination to foster their own collective economic effort. Neither have they contributed constructively within the G20 for the global common good. This is similarly disappointing.China is the only Bric country to have surpassed its growth projections, and India is not too far off from meeting its estimates. But due to dismal second decades, neither Brazil nor Russia have seen their nominal US dollar shares of GDP grow any bigger than they were back in 2001. The great challenge of how these countries successfully transition towards a higher income status for the whole of society remains unsolved.South Korea continues to be the sole shining example for those nations which genuinely aspire to that goal. In my professional lifetime, it is the only country which has evolved its economy to a level where its citizens are as wealthy as those in southern Europe. No other nation of more than 45m people has yet got close.Countries such as Brazil, Russia, Indonesia, Nigeria and Vietnam should seek to emulate Seoul’s economic success for their own societies. That will end up making their people wealthier and probably happier, while also promoting greater equality around the world.
34  Luigi Gubitosi pledged to make Telecom Italia a “normal company” that was capable of executing a recovery plan when in 2018 he became its fifth chief executive in six years.Instead, his three-year anniversary in the post was marked by his resignation, having failed to deliver on this simple ambition and following a week of drama after the Italian telecoms group received a €33bn takeover offer from US private equity firm KKR.In a letter to the board ahead of an extraordinary meeting last Friday afternoon, Gubitosi offered to quit to facilitate talks with the US buyout fund. By the end of the day he had been replaced by Pietro Labriola, head of Telecom Italia’s Brazilian division, although his successor was given the title of director-general and Gubitosi will remain on the board.“I am very satisfied [with] Labriola’s appointment,” chairman Salvatore Rossi said.But with the management overhaul representing neither continuity nor a total break, the future for Telecom Italia remains unclear just as dealmaking in Europe’s telecoms sector heats up.KKR’s offer earlier this month sent shock waves through the industry and Italian politics. If successful, the takeover would be the biggest private equity buyout in European history and represent the boldest attempt by the industry to break up one of the continent’s former telecoms monopolies.The US group had already signalled its interest in telecoms when it made a surprise bid for Dutch incumbent KPN earlier this year that was rejected.Telecom Italia is a much bigger prize. But the hurdles for a deal are sizeable: among them uncertainty over whether the Italian government — which has a near-10 per cent stake held by state investor Cassa Depositi e Prestiti — will approve, the sheer size of the group and its sluggish performance, and potential rival bids from other PE firms.The role of Vivendi, Telecom Italia’s largest shareholder with a 24 per cent stake, is also critical. It has already deemed that the price offered by KKR, around half the average that it paid to build its stake in 2016, according to analysts, is too low.The French conglomerate had planned to push a no-confidence vote in Gubitosi at the Friday board meeting, according to several people with knowledge of the talks, owing to dissatisfaction with Telecom Italia’s poor performance. Several other board members had also requested the meeting to discuss Gubitosi’s future, according to the people.Vivendi and KKR declined to comment.The bid from KKR follows a bruising year for Telecom Italia. The group issued two profit warnings in succession, a complex merger plan with rival Open Fiber appears to have run aground and a football broadcasting deal with UK-based platform DAZN, pushed by Gubitosi, was not as profitable as shareholders had hoped. Telecom Italia’s stock had fallen almost 40 per cent in the period since Gubitosi took charge and prior to the KKR offer.KKR’s offer of €0.505 a share in cash was pitched at a 44 per cent premium to the company’s previous closing price, giving it an equity value of €10.7bn. The telecoms group has roughly €22.5bn of net debt.Its proposal involves breaking up Telecom Italia and operating the network through a company controlled by Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, which also owns a stake in Open Fiber.Mario Draghi, Italy’s prime minister, told a press conference in Rome last week that the government’s priority would be protecting Italian jobs, technology and the network. He has established a working group made up of key ministers to consider Telecom Italia’s options.“The offer is good news for the country because it means foreign investors’ mood has shifted in a positive way,” said one government official. “But nothing has been decided as there is nothing substantial on the table for us to evaluate right now.”The government has a so-called “golden power” to block the takeover should it be deemed not in the national interest.KKR faces stiff opposition from some quarters of the Italian parliament, including populist leader Matteo Salvini, and security services concerned about the potential sale of a strategic national asset.So far, Draghi has refused to get directly involved and there are contrasting views within his government on the best way forward, according to three members of the cabinet. By coincidence, it includes one of European telecoms’ greatest dealmakers — Vittorio Colao, minister for innovation and digital transition and one of Rome’s main interlocutors with Brussels.The former chief executive of Vodafone negotiated the $135bn sale of the UK company’s stake in Verizon Wireless as well as the €19bn takeover of Liberty Global’s central European assets. He declined to comment on the KKR approach.KKR’s involvement has already drawn out the interest of rival private equity groups, some of whom have also spent a long time weighing how the behemoth could be carved up and taken private.Luxembourg buyout group CVC Capital Partners and US group Advent International are “open” to discussions, CVC has said, although KKR’s stake in Fibercop, Telecom Italia’s ‘last mile’ network, could complicate matters.Vivendi has denied being in talks with the funds and reiterated it wants to be “a long term investor in Telecom Italia”.Olivetti, Deutsche Telekom, AT&T, Telefónica and Vivendi are among the companies that have tried to buy or take control of Telecom Italia over the past two decades.One Italian telecoms executive called the offer a “wake-up call” for a sector that has struggled to deliver growth.Telecom Italia’s market capitalisation had slumped to €7.5bn before KKR’s offer. That reflects a deteriorating financial performance for an incumbent that faces ferocious competition in its home market from Vodafone, CK Hutchison’s Wind Tre and Iliad, controlled by French billionaire Xavier Niel.Revenue in the first nine months of the year fell 2 per cent to €11.4bn but pre-tax profit slumped 85 per cent to €167m. Standard & Poor’s cut its rating on Telecom Italia’s debt to below investment grade last week.Maurice Patrick, an analyst with Barclays, said it remains difficult to judge whether KKR’s plans have a better chance of success without more detail on its strategy. “The end game remains uncertain,” he said. “A simple takeover of the current equity would only add debt to the structure, which is not a constraint that TI needs.”
35  So-called platform workers should enjoy the same rights as staff in more secure forms of employment, according to a confidential European Commission document outlining proposed legislation expected to become law in the next two years.Brussels wants rights extended to gig workers in the EU “irrespective of the contractual designation” of their relationship with the likes of Uber, meaning workers’ rights would be linked to the work they do, regardless of how they are described in any contract. Following months of consultation, the proposals seek protection for platform workers against dismissal and adverse treatment and the right to compensation in cases in which their rights have been violated. The draft proposal, which is still being discussed among EU regulators, says member states must ensure gig workers in employment and those whose work has been terminated “have access to effective and impartial dispute resolution and right to redress, including adequate compensation” if their rights have been breached.“Digitalisation is changing the world of work, improving productivity and enhancing flexibility,” the draft reads. “This has created new opportunities for the labour market, but also put strain on traditional employment and work organisation models.”The European Commission, the executive body of the EU, is set to publish the proposals on December 8 following consultations with workers’ unions and ride-hailing companies.In February, Nicolas Schmit, the EU’s commissioner for jobs and social rights, said: “We want platform workers to have access to the same rights as all other workers” regardless of their status.The draft highlights how several court cases in Europe have revealed that workers in the digital economy have persistently had their employment status misclassified.It comes after a string of decisions in countries across Europe, including the UK, Spain, Italy, Greece and the Netherlands, on whether ride-hailing app workers are self-employed.Last August, Spain introduced new laws for gig workers, reclassifying them as employees. France fell short of granting gig workers employee status and instead authorities there approved a plan for workers to elect representatives to seek deals on social issues. The UK’s top court ruled in February that Uber drivers are workers entitled to rights such as the minimum wage.Industry bodies representing ride-hailing companies will intensify their lobbying efforts this week as they push back against the commission’s proposals. They argue that not every gig worker wants to be reclassified as an employee and that such legislation risks job losses.Industry insiders are particularly worried that an EU-wide reclassification of gig workers as employees would lead to hundreds of legal cases across the bloc’s 27 member states.The draft says that the criteria to classify workers as employees will be defined by member states, leading to concerns of a lack of certainty for platforms or platform workers.A position paper from MoveEU, a trade body representing ride-hailing companies including Uber and FreeNow, said: “Ride-hailing platforms are very much willing to support improving working conditions of platform workers. But creating more legal uncertainty and litigation will only lead to less work opportunities for the hundreds of thousands of platform workers throughout Europe.”
36  Brussels ran into opposition from banks and exchanges within hours of proposing US-style central databases of trading information as the centrepiece of new proposals to integrate its fractured capital markets.The plans published by the European Commission on Thursday set out a pathway that politicians hope will create a “consolidated tape” — a live database containing basic trading information — to help investors find the most competitive prices for their deals.It was the most eye-catching reform in a package to help make the EU a more attractive destination for international investors following the UK’s departure from the single market.Local politicians have long looked enviously at the dynamism and depth of the US financial markets. Relative to gross domestic product, EU capital markets are half as big as in the UK, which is a little more than half as deep as the US, according to New Financial, a London think-tank.Borrowing from America, Brussels wants for its own market US-style central databases that hold information on publicly listed companies and trading activity on stock and bond markets. Consolidated tapes for equities and bonds are common in the US but Europe is a patchwork of more than 470 exchanges and trading venues.Previous attempts have foundered on competing commercial interests and erratic data quality, and often set incumbent stock exchanges against banks and rival trading venues that have tried to set up pan-European platforms.Mairead McGuinness, the EU’s financial services chief, last week made it clear that she felt that the rules favoured venues run by investment banks or high-speed traders, which cater to professional investors, ahead of stock exchanges.“What we in Europe believe in is more transparency, not less,” she said. “We want to level the playing field between different trading venues. We are much more focused on what’s right for our financial sector and business community and believe transparency is better than an opaqueness.”For the equities tape, the Commission proposed requiring all trading venues operating in Europe to supply standardised information of deals to a tape, which would distribute the information in near real-time.But the exchanges were also dissatisfied, after failing in an effort to install a 15-minute delay to the tape. Rainer Riess, director-general of Fese, the exchanges’ lobby group, said he was “deeply concerned by the risks of such an elaborate and complex experiment”.He welcomed the recommendation of standardised data but said the cost fell on exchanges. “The use case of the tape remains unclear.”As the industry picked over the details, others questioned whether the proposal would function as planned. Revenues would be shared between regulated exchanges, but not other venues that supply the data. Losing out would be alternative trading venues like Cboe Europe, Turquoise and Aquis, which collectively account for most share trading activity during the day.“We have long advocated for a European equities consolidated tape, but the proposal is highly discriminatory against pan-European venues,” the Cboe said.“The consolidated tape needs to treat all market data contributors fairly, national and pan-European, to support [Capital Markets Union]’s objectives — but the current proposal fails this basic test, and would be detrimental to investors.”Moreover, the EU said it wanted to encourage innovation and new independent technology companies, but also indicated that operators of the tapes should hit minimum revenue targets. Many worried that smaller businesses would not have a big enough balance sheet or be able to afford extensive sales teams.“I don’t think many firms jump at the chance to be a [tape provider] if you’d need to guarantee revenues,” said Anish Puaar, market structure analyst at Rosenblatt Securities in London.A tape to report bond trades recommended large and illiquid trades be reported by the end of the day. “If it goes ahead it will probably disadvantage key market participants, from investors to banks, by compromising their market positions,” said Elizabeth Callaghan at ICMA, which represents the region’s bond trading industry.There are also calls for a new body to oversee the project. US versions are run by third parties like Finra, a regulatory body, but the EU is proposing that tape operators be technology companies overseen by the European Securities and Markets Authority.“I’m pleased they’ve picked up lots of our recommendations but it’s missing an organisational layer. It’s asking too much of the regulator or a small tech company,” said Niki Beattie, a consultant who produced a report on the tape for the Commission.And although the EU has looked to America for inspiration, Brussels has not proposed a US-style system that collects information on all potential deals in the market.Adam Farkas, chief executive of the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, urged regulators to extend the scope of the plans while Fese warned that it would open the door to a world where “ghost liquidity” and speed races to win the best prices between high-frequency traders “would be ubiquitous”.For all the criticism, most hope that a compromise can be found, and a small step in the slow journey to unifying Europe’s capital markets can be made.A common ticker tape would help both professional and retail investors navigate the jungle of European capital markets, said MEP Sven Giegold, a German Green member of the European parliament.But he added: “It should be noted, though, that the European Commission is putting old wine in new bottles: After all, already Mifid II [a sweeping regulatory package] should have delivered the consolidated tape. The overdue initiative mainly makes up for mistakes of the past.”
37  Historical records show that Roqueta’s ancestors began making wine at the Masia Roqueta farmhouse, in the Bages region north of Barcelona, in 1199. More than 800 years later, the company’s headquarters are on the same site.Roqueta turned to Iese Business School in Barcelona to prepare for his eventual succession. After training at wineries in France, Australia and the US, he enrolled on the Iese MBA in 2005 to sharpen his business and leadership skills. “It’s not only about making wine, but selling it and making the business profitable,” he explains. After graduating in 2007, Roqueta worked in consulting, then took up a management role in the family business in 2009. It was about this time that he enrolled in Iese’s Alumni Learning Program, a series of free training sessions focusing on specific areas of business. Over several years, he took classes on family business challenges such as succession planning and managing family conflicts.He learnt how to create a family protocol, a document that codifies the business’s values, vision and mission, along with rules of ownership, governance and management. The process involved the various family members, which reinforced unity. “This has been a competitive advantage for the company over the generations,” says Roqueta, who took over from his father, Valentí, as chief executive in 2014.Other business schools are emulating Iese by launching courses that focus on the needs of family businesses, which tend to take a long-term outlook on investments instead of chasing quarterly returns. Family businesses typically have strong stakeholder relationships and more loyal workforces than other companies. They are also typically more risk-averse and carry less debt.There are so many concepts and dynamics that are worth understanding, such as business continuity, legacy, stewardship and resilience“We can learn several things from family businesses,” says Allan Discua Cruz, director of the Centre for Family Business at Lancaster University Management School in north-west England. “There are so many concepts and dynamics that are worth understanding, such as business continuity, legacy, stewardship and resilience.”Some academics say that every business student should learn about family enterprise. “With the bulk of economic activity and private sector employment in many European countries generated by family businesses, it is highly likely that our graduates will be working for one at some point,” says Marta Elvira, chair of family-owned business at Iese.She notes an expansion of career opportunities, including at the growing ranks of family offices, in addition to jobs at companies that service family businesses, such as banks and consultancies. Other, more entrepreneurial, students are interested in establishing new business dynasties.Business schools in Europe are therefore sharpening their focus on family enterprises, which make up 60 per cent of the region’s companies — from small businesses to multinationals such as Exor, the investment company owned by Italy’s Agnelli family, and Germany’s Volkswagen, the carmaker controlled by the Porsche and Piëch families.As these companies scale, there is a need to professionalise the management and governanceMorten Bennedsen, academic director of the Wendel International Centre for Family Enterprise at Insead business school in France, points out that family business research only emerged as an academic field in the 1980s. “Business schools have not traditionally focused on family firms. That is changing as awareness grows,” he says. Many entrepreneurs still do not believe their families need a business education, Bennedsen says, but adds: “As these companies scale, there is a need to professionalise the management and governance. That is what you cannot learn from the family.”About 10 per cent of the 1,000 MBA students who enrol at Insead each year are from family-owned companies. Typically, they are heirs, while current owners take part-time executive courses to handle the pressures of preserving a family legacy. Insead offers a family business elective in its MBA, in addition to an executive programme that addresses the challenges these companies face.Family businesses are sometimes said to be especially resilient during crises, but the research is inconclusive. Daniela Maresch and Matthias Fink at France’s Grenoble Ecole de Management found that such businesses reported significantly more financial losses than others during the pandemic. The initial stabilising effect of family involvement can turn into a liability as crises unfold, the professors say, as the burden of responsibility ignites family conflict.Milan’s SDA Bocconi School of Management plans to launch new executive courses for family businesses next year. “There is now a stronger focus on risk mitigation and resilience,” says Alessandro Minichilli, professor of corporate governance at the school. “The demand for business education in areas like succession planning, sustainability and governance is huge.”Rania Labaki, head of the Edhec Family Business Centre in Lille, France, points out that only 30 per cent of family enterprises make it to the second generation, with the survival rate dropping precipitously with each succession.The largest transfer of wealth on record is expected in the coming decade as baby boomers retire. In Europe, at least $3.2tn will change hands by 2030 and, in many European economies, the number of family business leaders over 70 has been rising in the past decade. Labaki believes succession is where business schools can really make a difference: “Young heirs often face a challenge of legitimacy, and they need our competencies to lead the family business,” she says.
38  The writer is an investor in technology start-ups at Samos InvestmentsI have just completed a 10-week mini-MBA and it was the best career decision I have made.Like many who graduate and decide they will work for a period and then return to academia, in reality it is often hard to give up a well-paid job.I enjoyed my days at University College London, but student life, existing on a basic allowance, was not something I wanted to revisit. Long story short, I put off going into a full-time postgraduate course for many years.But recently I came across the London School of Economics’ mini-MBA course. A mini-MBA? I couldn’t see how that could be valuable. And online? I thought the whole point of an MBA was to have the opportunity to meet with various professionals, learn about their industries and network.So I went into the programme feeling a bit sceptical. I was quickly proved wrong.It started with a Zoom call introducing me to my course mates. I was impressed. They came from all over the world — Romania, Singapore, the US, India. They were all busy professionals from sectors including healthcare, aerospace, financial services, with a range of commitments outside of work. It made me think, perhaps this is possible after all. With three small children, a job and several board seats, I had worried I would not find the time.Their reasons for joining the course varied: hope of a promotion, a pay rise or just wanting to learn something new.Over the duration of the mini-MBA, we covered topics such as demand and supply, pricing, inflation — really going back to basics. It was great to have a refresher on some of the subjects I learnt at university, but in the process of revisiting them, I learnt a lot of new things, too. That is because this time around I was able to apply my knowledge in a more practical sense because of my lived experiences.The course prompted me to think about how privileged I am. It wasn’t cheap, £3,200 — out of reach of many. As are full-time MBAs, at £80,000-plus on average, just for fees. So how can organisations be more supportive of employees who want to upskill?First, employers need to better communicate what training is on offer. Most employees never check the benefits portals at work. I had a look at some of the employee perks at a large tech company. It offered free or discounted educational packages from online learning platforms and had £1,000 stipends available towards any course.I was expecting more. Many large companies offer a lot of job-centric training days. What I would love to see is more of them offering stipends in the £1,000 to £3,000 range, where employees can learn anything they want. If smaller businesses such as Learnerbly, a workplace learning company, can offer a £1,000 allowance, then the bigger companies should at least be able to match this.The Department for Education has a great range of options. I worked with some of the largest tech companies, including Google, to put together the DfE’s Skills Toolkit of free short courses. Subjects offered include maths, computing and digital design and marketing, designed for those wishing to upskill and retrain. I highly recommend people check it out- taking any short course will boost your productivity in the long run.If you are open to something a bit more radical, Seth Godin, the US blogger and entrepreneur, has designed an altMBA, a 31-day online leadership workshop. This costs $4,450 and is very project-based.Like my fellow classmates, I took the mini-MBA to exchange ideas, refresh my knowledge and learn new skills to do my job even better. Within a few weeks I already had fresh ideas and felt like I had been given a much deeper lens with which to operate. I wish I had done it sooner. Whichever avenue you choose to further your education, you must be willing to make sacrifices to carve out time from your busy schedule, but it is worth it. I’m glad I did.
39  Countries were racing to contain the Omicron coronavirus variant by restricting travel and imposing new quarantine measures as new cases were detected around the world on Sunday.A third case was identified in the UK and dozens more were being treated as suspected cases, people familiar with the matter told the Financial Times. The government mandated mask-wearing for shops and public transport in England, and people entering the UK will be required to take a PCR test within two days of their arrival and self-isolate until they receive a negative result.The US, EU, UK, Australia, Canada, Saudi Arabia and South Korea all limited travel or ordered quarantines on individuals travelling to and from southern Africa while others, such as Singapore and India, signalled they were reviewing restrictions. Switzerland has also restricted travel to non-African nations where cases have been detected.Israel became the first country to close its borders to foreigners after one case was confirmed and several more were suspected. Returning travellers will be forced to quarantine, monitored by the army and domestic intelligence agency Shin Bet.“Everyone is tired of life in the shadow of the coronavirus,” said Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett. “I hear what people are saying to me: ‘We have just emerged from the Delta strain and now a new strain has arrived?’ It is not easy but it is reality.”Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa’s president, called on the countries imposing controls to immediately end “completely unjustified” travel bans imposed on southern Africa over the Omicron variant, which was first detected in Botswana and South Africa.“There is no scientific justification whatsoever for keeping these restrictions in place” and South Africa was “deeply disappointed” by the actions of the UK and others, Ramaphosa said in a televised statement on Sunday.The restrictions “unfairly discriminate” against southern Africa when the emergence of Omicron should be a wake-up call to end inequality over African access to vaccinations compared with rich countries, he said.Despite the rise in cases and a flagging mass vaccination campaign, South Africa would not impose additional restrictions over Omicron and was still reviewing whether to bring in public vaccination mandates, the president said, attributing the identification of the variant to “the excellent work of our scientists”.The country’s business leaders say travel bans will throttle Africa’s most industrialised economy.Anthony Fauci, the US chief medical adviser, said the variant’s mutations were “troublesome”.“[Omicron] has the capability of transmitting rapidly,” he told NBC. “That’s the thing that’s causing us now to be concerned but also to put the pressure on ourselves now to do something about our preparation for this.”Fauci cautioned that in the longer term the US “certainly [was] not going to eradicate” Covid-19, but that it was within “our own grasp” to coexist with the virus if the “overwhelming majority of the population [is] vaccinated and boosted”. No cases had yet been detected, but he said the new variant could already be present in the US.In the Netherlands, health minister Hugo de Jonge said 13 Omicron cases were found among 61 passengers who tested positive for the virus on two flights from South Africa to Amsterdam on Friday. All positive passengers have been quarantined in hotels for seven days; de Jonge said it was “conceivable” that more Omicron cases were present in the country.Calls for renewed lockdowns were growing louder in Germany after the national academy of sciences, Leopoldina, published a paper advising the government to introduce restrictions on public and private gatherings, including for the vaccinated. Two cases of the Omicron variant have been confirmed in the southern state of Bavaria, while a third was confirmed in the state of Hesse, which contains Germany’s largest airport in Frankfurt.In an interview with Bild am Sonntag, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier called on citizens to prevent a German lockdown by voluntarily restricting their contact with others.The World Health Organization designated Omicron a “variant of concern” on Friday, saying it appeared to be able to reinfect patients and that it displayed mutations previously associated with diminished vaccine efficacy and higher transmissibility.Both findings have yet to be confirmed, and it is also not yet known whether the variant alters the severity of Covid.The WHO has called for borders to remain open and for “balance” in the global response to the variant, saying countries should strategically deploy their testing and sequencing capabilities. The Omicron variant can be detected by proxy on routine PCR tests, as it misses a gene — S — that Alpha, a previous variant, also lacks. Genomic sequencing is needed to confirm its presence.Since coronavirus first emerged in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, more than 261m people have been infected globally and at least 5.1m have died, according to Johns Hopkins University.
40  EU ministers meeting in Calais called for a new agreement with the UK on Sunday to tackle the surge of migrants trying to cross the Channel to England from France in small boats.Four days after 27 people died when a dinghy capsized, Gérald Darmanin, France’s interior minister, said European authorities would work towards “an even more intense” battle against people smugglers organising boat crossings for migrants across the Channel. He added that the main driver for displaced people was the attractiveness of life in the UK.Ministers responsible for immigration from France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany met on Sunday afternoon to discuss ways to end small-boat crossings.Speaking afterwards, Darmanin said: “If migrants come here to Calais.and risk their lives to cross the Channel, it is because they are attracted to England, especially by the labour market.”He said concrete decisions had been taken to improve surveillance of how smugglers buy and transport boats, and ministers had agreed that a new UK-EU migration policy framework was needed in the coming weeks.Darmanin announced that, from Wednesday, the EU will deploy an aeroplane to monitor and police migration traffic in the Channel. This aircraft will “fly day and night” over the area, from France to the Netherlands, he said.Since the sinking on Wednesday, which has shaken politicians across Europe, London and Paris have bickered over a workable response.The intractability of the 25-year-old crisis was underlined on Friday when France angrily withdrew its invitation to Priti Patel, UK home secretary, after Boris Johnson wrote a letter to President Emmanuel Macron and publicised it on Twitter. The British prime minister called for French and British maritime patrols to operate in each other’s territorial waters and for the thousands of migrants who reach English shores to be returned to France.Macron and his ministers objected both to the content of the letter, which blamed France for the crisis while reviving proposals already rejected by Paris, and to how it was immediately made accessible to the British media.“This meeting was not anti-British. It was pro-European,” Darmanin said on Sunday evening. “We must work with our British friends.”“Great Britain left political Europe, but it did not leave the world,” he said, adding that the UK also had to create routes for displaced people to apply for asylum. France has suggested that the UK send protection officers to France to process asylum requests in advance so that migrants do not risk their lives trying to reach England.Stephan Mayer, parliamentary secretary of state at Germany’s interior ministry, said an “agreement between the EU and Great Britain” was urgently needed.Ylva Johansson, European commissioner for home affairs, as well as leaders of Europol and Frontex, the EU’s policing and borders agencies, attended the meeting on Sunday.Michel Duclos, senior fellow at the Montaigne Institute in Paris and an adviser to interior ministers under former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, said he believed policing was not enough: “We should think in terms of offering a legal route to the Afghans, the Iranians, the Syrians and.the Ethiopians.”“France and the EU should contribute but it’s clear that the UK should be open to asylum seekers, coming from France, like any other civilised nation,” he added.One Whitehall source said: “We will this week have more talks with counterparts on how we can work together to resolve this Europe-wide crisis. Priti’s nationality and borders bill is the first step in addressing the broken asylum system and the pull factors it creates.”Patel warned over the weekend that failure to co-operate would lead to “even worse scenes” in the Channel over the next few months.In a statement, she vowed to “continue to push” for action during “urgent talks with my European counterparts” this week “to prevent further tragedies in the Channel”.
41  In 2018, Italian billionaire Leonardo Del Vecchio returned to the city of his birth and offered to invest €500m in the country’s main cancer hospital.The refusal by Milan’s Istituto Europeo di Oncologia to accept the money set the stage for a battle that is now being played out at two of Italy’s most important financial institutions: Mediobanca, long a powerbroker in the country’s corporate sector; and Generali, Italy’s biggest insurer.Del Vecchio, who is founder and chair of the world’s biggest eyewear business Luxottica, took the rejection as a personal slight and blamed the hospital’s biggest backer, investment bank Mediobanca. This has led to tensions between Del Vecchio and the bank’s chief executive, Alberto Nagel, according to several people with knowledge of the relationship.“The animosity between Del Vecchio and Nagel goes back to the aborted investment. That is where all these tensions began,” said a prominent Italian businessman who knows both well.Del Vecchio, a significant investor in both Generali and Mediobanca, has challenged Mediobanca’s reliance on its 13 per cent shareholding in Generali for profits. At the same time, he and other Generali shareholders are engaged in a tug of war with Mediobanca over the future of the group and its management under chief executive Philippe Donnet.A key ally in Del Vecchio’s campaign against Generali’s management team is Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone, the 78-year-old construction tycoon who is deputy vice chair of Generali and is also an investor in Mediobanca.In September, Caltagirone and Del Vecchio, the insurer’s second and third-largest shareholders behind Mediobanca, signed a formal pact with another smaller investor to consult on decisions ahead of Generali’s annual meeting next April. The group collectively owns 14 per cent of its shares.Generali’s strategy day next month, when investors will hear its three-year plan, will be a “watershed moment” in the shareholder battle, said Andrew Ritchie, a senior analyst at research group Autonomous.He expects “more of the same” from Generali, focusing on earnings growth and investor returns, adding: “That will require a response from the agitating shareholders to say what they could do better.”This tussle for control involving two of Italy’s leading finance houses and a pair of ageing billionaires highlights the personal rivalries and entangled shareholdings that dominate the country’s financial sector. “This is not a battle for power, it's a battle for efficiency,” said a spokesperson for Caltagirone, who has increased his stake in Generali from 1 to 8 per cent during the past 12 years.Del Vecchio’s role as a power player in the industry came relatively late in his career. Soon after his donation to the Milan cancer hospital was turned down, he took the Italian financial world by surprise when he announced a 7 per cent stake in Mediobanca. He now owns just under 20 per cent, the maximum allowed under an agreement he reached with the European Central Bank.He has used his position as Mediobanca’s largest investor to push for governance reforms and has also put pressure on Nagel to reduce the bank’s reliance on the dividends it receives from Generali, where it is the biggest shareholder, and from Compass Banca, a consumer credit company.Up to a third of Mediobanca’s revenues come from its Generali holding.“For the first time, Nagel has been put under pressure to really do something,” said a close ally of Del Vecchio. “People think this is the final showdown — there is an atmosphere in the air that something needs to change.”Under the pact between Del Vecchio and Caltagirone, the pair have agreed to consult each other on how to achieve “more profitable and effective management” of the insurer.The banking foundation Fondazione CRT has also signed the pact, and Del Vecchio and Caltagirone hope the powerful Benetton family, who own 4 per cent of Generali shares, will join.The alliance has put Del Vecchio and Caltagirone on a collision course with Nagel and Mediobanca, who back Generali’s management. Mediobanca has responded by borrowing 4 per cent of Generali’s shares, increasing its stake to more than 17 per cent. Mediobanca’s voting rights on the borrowed shares will expire just after Generali’s AGM.To complicate matters further, Italian MPs recently proposed a legal reform that would in effect put a six-year limit on the tenure of top company executives and board members. This would affect Donnet and Gabriele Galateri di Genola, Generali’s chair since 2011, and could matter for Nagel in future.Generali’s approach to technology and its M&A strategy are two points of disagreement between the insurer’s management team and the alliance of aggrieved shareholders. A person close to Delfin, Del Vecchio’s holding company, called Generali a “fintech laggard” and said its recent dealmaking was a “mixed bag of small-scale flag-planting and doubling down in traditional Italy, where it already dominates”.Critics view Generali’s recent acquisition of troubled local rival Cattolica as the kind of deal that is better for the Italian economy than for Generali’s shareholders. People close to Caltagirone said the Cattolica deal was “too little too late”. Generali has fallen behind peers in market capitalisation terms over the past two decades.“Generali needs to find a way of growing organically or [through M&A] which keeps it on a par with the likes of Zurich, Axa and Allianz, who have all taken a lead over Generali if you look back at the early 2000s,” said one large shareholder.But supporters point out that Generali’s shares have generally done better than rivals since Donnet’s last strategic plan was launched three years ago. Generali’s stock is up some 24 per cent since then, compared to 5 per cent at Allianz, 15 per cent at Axa and 25 per cent at Zurich.Another criticism levelled at Generali is that Mediobanca, its largest shareholder, has outsized influence over the insurer. Generali’s long-time chair, Di Genola, had been Mediobanca’s chair until 2007.Generali declined to comment for this article. But a person with knowledge of its view said the narrative of Mediobanca’s sway over Generali was “outdated”.“If you look at the business decisions that have been made by Generali — M&A, strategic, you name it — it is impossible to see where something has been done to the benefit of one specific shareholder rather than all shareholders,” the person said.Del Vecchio and Mediobanca also declined to comment.The question is whether any new strategy can win over Generali’s rebellious shareholders — or at least stop institutional investors from rallying to their side. Another person close to Generali’s management accused Del Vecchio of “strategic infantilism”, adding: “He wants Generali to become the largest insurance company in Europe, if not the world, but how to implement that is not clear.”A former chief executive of an Italian finance group said he did not expect the two sides to reach a compromise before the AGM. “The billionaires will never give up,” he said.“Too much money is at stake, but also as they reach the end of their lives, their reputation, legacy and pride are at stake. It is very difficult to find a compromise with them.”
42  Brazil’s foreign minister has attacked the EU for “trade protectionism” and “myopia” after the bloc proposed a ban on agricultural imports from deforested areas, singling out France for particular criticism over farm subsidies.Brussels proposed a law this month which would force companies selling beef, soy, palm oil, coffee, cocoa and wood into the bloc to prove the commodities were not produced on land that had been deforested or degraded after 2020.Brazil is a major exporter of many of the products targeted and the EU initiative has reignited long-running tensions with the government of far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, which sees ulterior motives behind the bloc’s proposal.“What I can’t accept is using the environment as a form of trade protectionism. It’s bad for consumers [and] trade flows,” foreign minister Carlos Alberto Franco França told the Financial Times in an interview. “I think there’s a certain myopia from the EU.”The planned legislation was published shortly before fresh satellite data that showed destruction of the Brazilian Amazon had surged to a 15-year high, sparking fresh questions over the government’s commitment to protecting the world’s largest rainforest.More than 13,200 sq km was razed in the 12 months to July — an area over eight times the size of Greater London — representing a 22 per cent jump from the previous year, according to data from Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research (Inpe). It was the fastest rate of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon since 2006.The figures have overshadowed plaudits Brazil won for its undertakings at the COP26 climate change summit this month in Glasgow, including a pledge to halt illegal deforestation by 2028 and a more ambitious net zero target of 2050. “The [deforestation] numbers are shocking. Brazil has a serious credibility problem,” said one senior western diplomat in Brasília.França described the latest forest destruction data as “surprising”, but said the numbers were “not as bad as they seem” because there had been an improvement since July. Inpe data for August, September and October of this year suggest a 28 per cent decrease in the number of forest fires.“There’s no Brazilian desire to hide the problem,” the minister added. “When there is illegal deforestation it is often linked to other crimes, such as labour infractions, tax evasion and money laundering. We are treating it as a police matter and this is delivering results.”Brazil is proud of its technologically advanced and highly productive agricultural sector and officials often stress that the vast majority of the country’s farm exports come from properly managed land in the centre and south of the country, not from illegally cleared forest in the Amazon.França singled out for criticism France’s state backing for its agricultural sector. “I understand the internal political reasons the French government has for supporting their farmers. It isn’t environmentally correct that they give [agricultural] subsidies. Because land and water are scarce resources and operating them inefficiently isn’t sustainable.“It’s better to plant here in Brazil where agriculture is increasingly technologically advanced than to produce in France.”Frictions between Brazil and its European counterparts have contributed to an impasse in the ratification of a trade deal painstakingly negotiated over 20 years between the EU and Mercosur, a bloc that also includes Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.Brussels is reluctant to move ahead on ratifying the agreement because of strong opposition from some member states that believe Brazil in particular is not doing enough to combat deforestation. França agreed that the trade pact was “not moving forward”. A foreign ministry spokesperson added: “We are not the party obstructing the deal, Brazil is ready to move forward.”A low-profile career diplomat who has served stints in the US, Bolivia and Paraguay, França was previously head of protocol at the presidential palace under Bolsonaro. He was appointed foreign minister in March, replacing Ernesto Araújo, an outspoken ideologue of the Bolsonarista movement known for his admiration of Donald Trump, dislike of “globalism” and who was accused of hostility towards China.
43  As Covid-19 case numbers rose inexorably in Germany last week, lengthy queues of worried residents formed outside improvised vaccine centres. Among those waiting was Marcel, a 24-year-old chemistry student at Berlin’s Technical University, who turned up spontaneously to try to get a third dose.Standing in a queue of 60 people in an exhibition hall in western Berlin, he said he wanted to help to relieve pressure on the health system. “I have a friend who works in a hospital and tells me what kind of stress he’s under,” he said.That’s a message an increasing number of health ministries across Europe want citizens to hear loud and clear. Many European states have been slow in rolling out boosters and have focused their campaigns on the elderly and medically vulnerable.But the menacing scale of the latest wave of infections, and growing concerns about the spread of the new Omicron variant first discovered in southern Africa, means that governments are rushing to accelerate booster campaigns. Eight EU countries, including Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands, have recorded more than 100 daily cases for every 100,000 people according to FT analysis of the most recent data — the most on record.“A new wave is hitting us, and we need to step up vaccination further,” European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said on Thursday, insisting the problem was not an inadequate supply of doses, but rather the need to get more shots in people’s arms.Jens Lundgren, professor of infectious diseases at the University of Copenhagen’s Rigshospitalet, said Europe’s problem was a combination of two factors: a lack of primary vaccination, coupled with insufficient boosting among those who have already been jabbed. “Focus needs to be maintained on both fronts,” he said.EU agencies are pushing hard. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said last week that boosters should be considered for anyone over 18 years old — with priority for those over 40.As of January 10, travellers entering the EU will have to either have received a booster dose or have received their second jab no more than nine months ago, according to new commission guidance. The EU will also put into place plans for boosters to be recognised in vaccine certificates.Capitals have been closely tracking developments in the UK, where the booster effort began in September, as well as Israel, which led the world in starting boosters. The UK’s daily rate of Covid-related fatalities per 100,000 is half the EU average, according to an FT analysis of official data, with the numbers attributed in part to higher immunity levels that have been helped by booster shots.In France, the government on Thursday said it would make booster jabs available to all adults, five months after their second dose. In Italy, boosters will be given five months from the second dose, instead of six. This will allow most people to receive the additional dose in December ahead of the cold season.But the picture remains disjointed. Spain is sticking with a policy of focusing on booster shots for over-60s. Officials defend the approach, pointing to much lower Covid case rates than Germany, Austria or the Netherlands.Divergent approaches have also been evident in Austria and its non-EU neighbour Switzerland. In Austria, where surging cases owing to a high proportion of totally unvaccinated adults forced the country into a fresh lockdown, about 1.3m boosters have been administered in the population of nearly 9m.The recent surge in the number of Austrians attending vaccination centres — triggered by the government’s increasingly restrictive measures against the unvaccinated — has been largely people taking a third shot.Switzerland, which has an almost identical proportion of unvaccinated people as Austria but has yet to experience an equivalent surge in infections, is at the opposite end of the European spectrum.For weeks Bern has insisted that booster shots were largely unnecessary for most Swiss. Indeed, while other countries are considering shortening the validity period of vaccine certificates, Switzerland has said it plans to go the other way: it wants full vaccination status to last 18 months after the administration of a second dose, up from 12 months.In Germany, officials want to offer the booster jab to at least 27m people by the end of the year. Jens Spahn, health minister, said on Friday 6.5m doses of the Moderna booster would be delivered to the regions on Monday and Tuesday alone: in the space of 10 days, he said, a total of 18m doses will have been sent out.But he admitted the sudden increase could prove a logistical challenge. “In the space of 10-12 days we’re rearranging a system that was working to a different rhythm over the summer, in terms of orders,” Spahn said. In the summer, doctors’ practices and vaccination centres were ordering just 100,000 doses every seven days. “Now we’re sending out 10m doses a week. So all the logistical mechanisms will take a while to get up and running.”Even if the country’s vaccination effort gains momentum, it seems unlikely to prevent a brutal winter. In Germany, the fourth wave is breaking records: on Friday, authorities reported 76,414 new infections, the highest daily toll since the pandemic began.Katja, a 44-year-old sociologist who was among those queueing in Berlin, said she feared the dash for booster shots had come too late. “This. won’t help us now — it’s only of any use for the fifth wave,” she said. “It’s a pity that so many people are only deciding to get the jab now.”By Sam Fleming in Brussels, Silke Richter and Guy Chazan in Berlin, Sam Jones in Zurich, Daniel Dombey in Madrid and Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli in Milan
44  Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition and digital policy chief, has urged the European Parliament and European Council to approve rules to curb the power of Big Tech as a matter of urgency, even if they are imperfect.Speaking ahead of the FT-ETNO Tech and Politics forum on Monday, Vestager said: “It’s important that everyone realises that it is best to get 80 per cent now than 100 per cent never. This is another way of saying that perfect should not be the enemy of very, very good.”Vestager’s appeal comes after almost a year of discussions among EU regulators and legislators, who have struggled to agree on the fine print of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA). The DMA was created to force so-called gatekeepers, such as Google, to ensure more equal terms on their online platforms, while the DSA seeks to clarify the way large online companies should keep illegal content off their platforms.Vestager left open the possibility of legislators reviewing the new rules once they are enacted, which would mean bringing them before the EU Parliament and Council again.“We won’t let another 20 years pass before we may revisit [the legislation]. With the parliament and the council’s position we can make a very strong rule book that can be enforceable soon,” Vestager said. “We have so many companies out there waiting and asking for a level playing field.”The latest draft of the DMA was voted through by MEPs on the European Parliament’s Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee (IMCO) on November 22, ahead of a plenary vote in December.The DMA would affect companies with a market capitalisation of at least €80bn — including Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft — and prohibit Big Tech from ranking its own services above their rivals.The DSA has not yet been put to a vote before the IMCO; however the draft proposals for it and the DMA were backed by the Council of the EU on November 25.The final step for the DMA and DSA involves a three-way discussion between the Commission, the Parliament and the Council to agree a common position before they become law.On Monday a letter signed by the chief executives of 12 of the largest telecoms companies in Europe, including Deutsche Telekom, Telefónica and Vodafone, will call for “concrete and immediate action” from legislators on these tech rules.Vestager said Brussels’ legislation will want to show “all these many businesses that democracy serves them and enables them market access”.
45  Turkey is going through a very unusual currency crisis. The collapse in the lira’s value — down by about a fifth over the past two weeks — has not been caused by problems in the country’s economic fundamentals as it has in the past. The country, which has long suffered from a current account deficit, posted a surplus for the second month running in September thanks to a huge surge in exports and a recovery in foreign tourist numbers. Instead, the currency’s troubles almost entirely reflect the increasingly erratic decision-making of one man and the influence he wields over the supposedly independent Turkish central bank: president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Erdogan blames outside forces for the drop in the value of the lira. But the latest problems began in March of this year after he fired the head of the central bank Naci Agbal. The respected technocrat was the third governor to lose his job in two years. The appointment of the Erdogan-loyalist Sahap Kavcioglu led to the lira dropping 15 per cent shortly afterwards, before it recovered somewhat. The drop then became precipitous earlier this month after the central bank cut rates for the third time in as many months.It is true that emerging market currencies generally have performed badly against the dollar this year. Expectations that the US Federal Reserve will soon begin reducing its programme of asset purchases, designed to support the economy and the financial sector through the coronavirus pandemic, has led to an appreciation of the dollar. Footloose capital that has sought a higher rate of interest in developing countries is now returning home. As the Pakistani central bank governor said in an interview with the Financial Times last week, poorer countries with high levels of foreign currency debt are at risk if sentiment shifts.Against that backdrop Erdogan’s conspiracy-mongering and authoritarian tendencies play even more badly than usual. While he has long rallied against what he calls an “interest rate lobby”, he has also been a wily pragmatist, ultimately allowing the central bank to raise interest rates during previous episodes of currency volatility. This time, he appears determined to follow through on his ideological commitment to low interest rates, saying at the start of last week that Turkey was engaged in an “economic war of independence”.Opposition parties are optimistic that Erdogan is in his last years in power, and elections scheduled for 2023 will bring the vicious spiral to an end. Erdogan’s popularity is fading as higher prices eat into living standards. When he was first elected, his Islamist party promised an era of growth and steadily rising incomes. For many years he delivered, partly thanks to an IMF programme that his government inherited and, later, a construction boom that has now faded. Indeed, memories of that era of debt-fuelled growth may lie behind the president’s continued support for cheap money. That is just one tool out of many at his disposal to try to remain in power.The saga may have an even unhappier end. Inflation is already running at an annual rate of 20 per cent, which means real interest rates are around negative 5 per cent. If the president continues to pursue a programme of interest rate cuts then the lira will fall further and prices will inexorably rise. In those circumstances the only way for Turks to defend their savings will be to turn to a currency outside Erdogan’s control. Unless he suddenly changes course, the only question facing Turkey, a country with great potential, is how much longer the president will stay — and how much damage he can do before he goes.Letters in response to this editorial comment:Devaluing the lira will only make Turks poorer / From Steven E Cerier, New York, NY, USTurkey must restore democracy to halt its economy’s decline / From Engin Kara, Professor of Economics, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK
46  Turkey has thrown caution to the wind as the rest of the world frets about surging inflation. The country’s central bank cut its main interest rate for the third consecutive month to 15 per cent in November, despite the nation’s consumer price index rising 19.9 per cent year on year in October.On Friday, annual inflation is expected to cross the 20 per cent threshold to hit 20.7 per cent, according to a Reuters poll. That would represent its highest rate since November 2018, when the country was reeling from a currency crisis.Turks have been watching with horror while enduring a repeat of that episode in recent weeks, with the lira tumbling 28 per cent against the dollar since the start of November. Analysts warn that if President Recep Tayyip Erdogan refuses to abandon his fixation with low interest rates, Turkey could be headed towards hyperinflation. The country is heavily reliant on imports and other raw materials that are becoming increasingly expensive as the lira slides.“Headline CPI will likely close in on 30 per cent [year on year] over the coming months,” wrote Phoenix Kalen, analyst at the French bank Société Générale, in a recent note.“Headline CPI peaking at 27 per cent over the near term would be an optimistic scenario,” added Kalen. Laura PitelTraders will be watching the US jobs report on Friday closely, as questions mount about the future direction of monetary policy at the world’s largest economy.In early November, Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell urged patience on interest rate rises as the US central bank said it would start unwinding its $120bn-a-month pandemic-era asset purchasing programme.Powell said it was “time to taper”because the economy had achieved “substantial” progress towards the central bank’s two targets of full employment and inflation averaging 2 per cent. But, he added, there was “still ground to cover to reach maximum employment”.Recent data now point to signs of a tightening labour market, with new applications for US unemployment benefits falling to their lowest level since 1969.A big jobs print could add to expectations of a rise in borrowing costs. US employers added 531,000 positions in October and Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics, expects “a solid 500,000 in November”.“But the growing risk of a winter Covid wave and a dwindling supply of available workers look set to weigh on employment growth” soon after, warned Hunter.Meanwhile, the core personal consumption expenditure index — the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation — rose 4.1 per cent in October, its biggest year-on-year jump since the 1990s and higher than the 3.7 per cent annual rise recorded for September.This has left the Fed with a tricky balancing act going into next year, said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at Nuveen.Unlikely to raise interest rates while the US economy is still recovering from the pandemic, investors will soon find out “just how tolerant the Fed has allowed itself to become of higher inflation”, Nick said.“If ‘transitory’ was this year’s buzzword, next year’s will be ‘full employment’,” predicts Nick. George SteerEurozone inflation for November is expected to have climbed at its fastest pace in 30 years on Tuesday. Such a rise would match a similar record reached last month in the US, as both economies face surging energy costs, strong consumer demand and supply chain disruptions.Economists polled by Reuters forecast annual eurozone headline inflation to hit 4.4 per cent in November. This would mark an increase from 4.1 per cent in October, and would be more than double the European Central Bank’s target of price stability at 2 per cent.It would also signify the highest rate recorded since the euro came into existence in 1999, and the fastest pace since 1991.Core inflation, which excludes energy and unprocessed food, is expected to rise to 2.3 per cent, the swiftest rate in more than a decade.“Headline inflation is set to remain high throughout the fourth quarter,” said Melanie Debono, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, “with transitory factors currently supporting the headline rate, such as higher energy prices, pent-up demand in services and supply side disruptions, that could prove more lasting than policymakers anticipate.”In line with the consensus, Debono has recently lifted her inflation forecasts for the eurozone but thinks that “markets are wrong on ECB tightening in 2022”.At its October meeting, there was a broad consensus at the ECB governing council that there were “no signs as of yet” of a pass-through from higher energy prices to wages, according to minutes published on Thursday.This means low underlying price pressure in the medium term while the new Covid-19 variant will perhaps add further downward risk to the eurozone economic and inflation outlook.

47  The writer is Labour MP for Wigan and the shadow foreign secretaryBritain blames France. France blames Britain. But at least 27 people, two of them children, are dead. This is the worst, but not the only, incident of its kind since we started counting deaths in the Channel seven years ago.While Franco-British relations descend into a public war of words, focusing on symptoms rather than causes, little is being done to address the true drivers of this humanitarian crisis. The situation in the Channel is just one manifestation of a global challenge: a world of 26m refugees, widespread conflict, dysfunctional diplomacy and populist politics.With solidarity in desperately short supply, countries have sought to outdo each other with outlandish measures to deter desperate people. The EU pays countries to keep asylum seekers away. Australia sends them to distant islands to be processed. The UK government floated the idea of using wave machines to deter the boats. But, to the apparent surprise of the politicians who devise these schemes, still people move.What is to be done? First, we should make it a priority to focus, together, on the unresolved conflicts and chronic instability that scars much of the world. Major, long-running conflicts have been parked in the “too difficult” box, while the UN struggles to raise the funds needed to sustain even basic humanitarian programmes. The main countries of origin of those arriving in Europe have all experienced recent or ongoing conflicts — countries such as Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Sudan, to which the UK has recently slashed aid.For as long as the world remains unable to co-operate to resolve these conflicts — like the Syrian war, now longer than both world wars combined — people will continue to move. Meanwhile, climate change will exacerbate and create new ones, as water and food become scarce in parts of the world that are heating up fastest. Without action from all governments, everywhere, millions will be forced to move.Second, we need to work together on a plan to get help to the regions most affected by the movement of people. During the recent Afghan evacuation, as we tried to create safe routes out of the country, many Afghans headed to the border with Pakistan. But, as the Pakistani government explained to me, the country faced a challenging pandemic, with limited access to vaccines. While Boris Johnson’s government was asking them to add to the 1.4m refugees already in the country, he was also cutting the UK’s aid to Pakistan.We should not forget that 85 per cent of refugees are hosted in developing countries. Leaving people to languish in refugee camps for decades creates the conditions in which they are prepared to stake everything, even life itself, on the prospect of a decent future.Third, as Labour has urged, the UK should open up safe and legal routes which would undermine the people smugglers who make big money out of people’s despair — we should encourage other countries to do the same. On Thursday’s makeshift boat, which arrived in Dover, was an Afghan soldier who had lost any hope that safe and legal routes would open. A full three months after the prime minister promised to “move heaven and earth” to help Afghans in danger because of their support for Britain, the Afghan Resettlement Scheme hasn’t even opened.The status quo benefits only two groups: the people smugglers and populist politicians the world over who have no interest in co-operating to solve big, complex problems of conflict, persecution and climate change. But while they refuse, the world is left with the consequences of war, climate change, mass displacement of people and the horror of children being allowed to drown on our shores. For as long as the blame game continues, so will the human misery, chaos and despair. They will get away with it only for as long as we let them.
48  Rising rates of infection and deaths; talk of mandatory vaccinations and travel bans; no access to public transport, workplaces or restaurants without proof of jabs, test results or recovery.The news from Germany has been getting more dramatic by the day, with predictions that it may only get worse. It’s all very different from the situation I found in Berlin just a few weeks ago. Then, normal life seemed to have returned to the city — albeit with lots of mask-wearing indoors, which, this being Germany, was pretty much universally and dutifully observed. If anything, the talk back then was about what was going on in the UK, where infection rates were shooting up.Now the situation is reversed and conversations with friends and family in Berlin revolve around whether Christmas plans may be cancelled (again), and an ongoing sense of bewilderment and frustration that the number of unvaxxed remains so relatively high.Answers — from mistrust of Big Pharma to antipathy towards the state, from inept political co-ordination to extremists and conspiracy theorists making mischief — vary according to who you ask. The new would-be “traffic light” coalition government, which finally unveiled its plans this week amid talk of an exciting new era in German politics, certainly has its work cut out.A man of letters One of the reasons I was in Berlin was to attend a memorial event for the writer Karl Heinz Bohrer. Standing on the balcony of his publishing house in Mitte, central east Berlin, looking out across the city’s ever-changing skyline with its glassy newcomers, hardy familiars and baroque remakes, friends and colleagues reflected on a remarkable and busy life that spanned nine decades until his death in London this summer.A luminary in the world of German letters and academia — a “free radical” or “a German Tom Sawyer”, as some dubbed him — Karl Heinz taught in Germany and at Stanford, edited an influential Berlin cultural journal from Paris and later from London. He also wrote prolifically. There were scores of books on subjects ranging from the state of Britain and the aesthetics of fear and the delight of the unexpected, to essays on European culture and two volumes of well-received memoirs that evocatively captured postwar Germany.Coming of age in the stultifying world of 1950s West Germany — where the past was something best not talked about — Karl Heinz went on to witness and chronicle the intellectual and political turmoil of the 1960s. He was friends with Ulrike Meinhof, once one of the smartest and most unflinching columnists of her generation, who tried to convert him to her cause before she embraced terrorism. But Karl Heinz was a life-long unbiddable liberal who became a critical observer of the impact of new left thinking on academic and literary life.He also had deep connection to England — on tour in the 1950s after leaving school; as a correspondent in London for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, where he covered the IRA, football and industrial strife and wrote an elegiac book about a nation wrestling with decline; and then again in this century, when he married my aunt and became a wonderful and inspirational addition to our family. Conversations over the dinner table in Stockwell, where he wrote, ranged far and wide, and did not always end in agreement.West — and later united — Germany, in all its cowering fussiness, was a particular target for Karl Heinz’s linguistic pyrotechnics, and was dispatched in typically scathing, surgically precise, wickedly funny and memorable fashion. In essays and books, he let rip at what he characterised as the repressive, switched-off provincialism of a nation of garden gnomes skulking behind their trellis work; smug do-goodery tapped out in parades of dungarees and fairy lights; the narrow arrogance of the intellectual left; and the forever cautious, vacillating ways of the Merkel years (a sort of “Teletubby republic”).I would have loved to have known what he would have made of the latest political twists. On or off the page, Karl Heinz was never dull and, as the tributes made clear, he left a profound impression on a younger generation of German writers and editors.Berlin writing a new chapter English-language Berlin novels used to have to a familiar ring to them: Nazis, Weimar, spies. Or even all of the above. But the past few years have brought a steady stream of tales set in Berlin that strike a new note, from Red Pill by Hari Kunzru and Chris Powers’ A Lonely Man to Matthew Sperling’s Viral and Lauren Oyler’s Fake Accounts.Next year brings Emma Harding’s novel Friedrichstrasse and Amy Liptrot’s powerful memoir The Instant. Some follow a new pattern: the expat lured to the German capital by the prospect of cheaper rents, generous stipends and an easier, perhaps cooler, English-spoken-here lifestyle — a sort of extended student slacker existence — from where they engage with more universal themes of bad relationships, paranoia, fragile masculinity and geopolitical tensions. Others tap into local themes such as Berlin’s evolving tech scene. Not always a comfortable read, but a new chapter all the same.Old money, new ideas For years, the tech scene seemed to be one of those things that Berlin often excels at: long on promise, fantasy and imagination, short on delivery. There was rhetoric about how the coders in the backyards of tenement blocks in Prenzlauer Berg and Kreuzberg were keystroking in the footsteps of an earlier generations of technological pioneers — Siemens, Börsig, Zuse and co — sounds great. It’s just the bit about turning that into products, sales, jobs — and taxes — that proved a bit elusive.That now seems to be changing. The number of successful digital companies, such as the ever-expansive Delivery Hero or Trade Republic, is growing and attracting investor interest — as became clear to me when I made my way to one of those demi-brutal communist-era concrete blocks that still line Karl Liebknecht Strasse on the way up to Berlin’s iconic television tower.A stone’s throw from the location of the old stock exchange and up the road from the university where the young Marx and Engels acquired a taste for radical thought, the building was built to showcase the culture and lifestyle of East Germany’s “socialist brother state” Hungary. Now, it’s a cool “off location” that hosts events such as the one held by La Familigia, a local venture capitalist firm that marries up old money with new ideas. Internationally minded, well-connected and with serious intent, it’s a combination and a crowd that has really come together in Berlin only over the past decade or so. Now competition for talent is fierce; salaries (along with rents) are rising. That said, some enduring factors remain: as one speaker noted, Europe still has some work to do in seeing and acting on the promise of technology rather than focusing on the problems.Traffic control Creating a problem out of a solution is something of a Berlin speciality. Back in the late 1990s, as the FT’s lone correspondent in the Hauptstadt, I filed an extensive news analysis piece on a proposed new airport for a reunited Berlin in training for a return to frontline duty as national capital. In keeping with the temper of the times, the plans were grandiose and aspirational: a Weltstadt aesthetic, as imagined in the provinces.The piece earned me a fair bit of ribbing. “You fell for that,” teased one generous German colleague. “It’ll never be built.” He got that one wrong — sadly. And now we have to live with “BER” — the much-delayed, overspent Berlin Brandenburg International, which since finally opening for business last year has been doing world-class work in delivering laughable customer service, communist-era levels of queueing and undermining Germany’s reputation for efficiency.Teething problems, perhaps. But already there are calls to accept defeat and pull the whole thing down and start again (Berlin likes nothing more than a mega building project with which to disrupt and distract itself). Either way, it’s left me checking out train options for my next trip — assuming coronavirus makes that possible.
49  Germany’s new coalition partners have struggled to reach consensus on everything from taxes to pensions to climate change. But one thing unites them: a desire to be the country’s most socially progressive government in more than a generation.The coalition agreement they presented on Wednesday includes a broad array of policies that could have a huge positive impact on immigrants, lesbian parents, transsexuals and other minorities.“My heart is racing with joy,” said Greta Garlichs, spokeswoman for QueerGrün, the Greens’ LGBTQ+ lobby group. “So many queer people are writing to me saying how relieved and happy they are.”The coalition deal contains a range of proposals designed to please libertarians and progressives. Cannabis will be legalised, the voting age lowered to 16 and mass video surveillance in German cities banned.The new government also promises to create a more welcoming regime for immigrants. It will make it easier for them to obtain residence permits and, ultimately, German citizenship, and smooth the entry of foreign skilled workers into the German labour market.“The fact that we are finally owning up to being a country of immigration is really groundbreaking,” said Jessica Rosenthal, head of the Jusos, the SPD’s youth wing. “It’s truly a breakthrough.”Business also welcomed the plans. “With our population ageing, Germany needs net immigration of 400,000 a year and it seems the new government really understands that,” said one senior financial services executive. “This is hardcore economics.”The coalition deal was the fruit of a month of negotiations between Social Democrats, Greens and liberals following national elections on September 26 that resulted in a narrow SPD victory. The agreement allows Olaf Scholz, the current finance minister, to succeed Angela Merkel, who is retiring from politics after 16 years as chancellor of Europe’s largest economy.The parties in the Scholz-led “traffic light” coalition — named after their traditional colours — are not natural allies. The Greens and SPD campaigned on a promise to raise taxes on high-earners and invest heavily in mitigating climate change, while the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) are fiscal hawks wedded to the free market and opposed to tax hikes.However, “though a lot separates them in the economic dimension. [all three] fully agree with each other on social policy,” said Thorsten Faas, a political scientist at Berlin’s Free University. “It means they have this area they can always retreat to in order to emphasise their similarities.”The policies being proposed will affect a broad range of constituencies. Pro-choice campaigners, for example, were heartened by the decision to abolish article 219a of the German penal code, which prohibits abortion doctors from advertising their services.“I think it’s super,” Kristina Hänel told Der Spiegel. The doctor and activist became a cause célèbre in 2017 after being fined €6,000 for stating on her website that she carried out terminations.The coalition partners also promised a law change that will help lesbian couples with a child: currently only the biological mother is legally recognised as a parent and her partner must formally adopt the child to obtain custody rights. Under the deal agreed on Wednesday both women would be recognised as the child’s legal mothers.“That’s a historic success for the queer community,” said Garlichs. The previous rule “had always been a massive burden.”The new government also plans to abolish Germany’s law on transsexuals, which dates from 1981, replacing it with a “self-determination law” designed to make it easier for people to declare a change of sex. The ban on gay men and transsexuals donating blood will also be removed.On immigration, the coalition partners want to make it easier for refugees to be reunited with close family members who are still languishing in third countries. More asylum-seekers will be able to take up jobs. Immigrants with no criminal record who have lived in Germany for five years will be entitled to a one-year residence permit. People seeking naturalisation in Germany will no longer be forced to renounce all their other citizenships.The proposed policies have earned harsh criticism from some quarters. Police unions have slammed the plan to legalise cannabis. Pro-life campaigners oppose the abolition of article 219a. Conservatives fear the planned policies will undermine the traditional concept of the family.But most commentators have been positive. “The truth is, there’s a political majority in this country in favour of these changes,” the Süddeutsche Zeitung wrote on Friday. “And everyone else will just have to live with it.”
50  Ukraine’s president has said the country’s intelligence services have uncovered a Russian-backed plot to stage a coup against his government, as international worries mount that Moscow may be preparing a deeper invasion of the country.Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters on Friday that the intelligence services had obtained recordings of conversations between unnamed Russians and Ukrainians who he said were discussing ousting him as early as next Wednesday or Thursday.Zelensky offered no evidence to support his claim but added that the suspected plotters had discussed raising “billions of dollars” and luring Ukraine’s richest oligarch Rinat Akhmetov into the operation.Fears of a return to open hostilities in the long-running conflict on Ukraine’s eastern border with Russia have risen in recent weeks after the US alerted allies to its own intelligence indicating a “high probability” that a recent build-up of Russian troops on its side of the frontier could be laying the groundwork for a deeper invasion, following Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea.Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan spoke with Zelensky’s chief of staff Andriy Yermak on Friday. A spokesperson for the US National Security Council said Sullivan underscored Washington’s “unwavering commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.Ukraine estimates that Russia has massed as many as 114,000 troops to the north, east and south of the Donbas, a mostly Russian-speaking region in the country’s far east, where Russia-backed separatists have fought government forces since a pro-western revolution in Kyiv eight years ago.Russian president Vladimir Putin admitted last week that he was pleased that the Kremlin’s “warnings” about its “red lines” — that Moscow would not accept further western military assistance to Ukraine or the country joining Nato — had rattled the west. He said western powers were using Ukraine for their own aggressive ends against Moscow by funding its army and holding “provocative” exercises near the Russian border.Zelensky said Ukraine’s armed forces were “prepared for any escalation” and called on Putin to distance himself from the alleged plot.“The president of the Russian Federation, too, it seems to me, should publicly say that ‘we do not plan’.[and] that Russia is not preparing a full-scale invasion of Ukraine,” Zelensky said.The Kremlin denied any involvement in the alleged coup plot. Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesman, told reporters that Russia had “no plans to participate” and “never does things like this”, according to Interfax.Zelensky suggested Akhmetov’s “entourage” was trying to “drag him in” to the alleged plot. He stopped short of implicating Akhmetov directly but claimed recordings exist that may implicate the oligarch.“This is not only intelligence information, but also sound information, where representatives from Ukraine, so to speak, discuss the participation of Rinat Akhmetov in the coup d’état in Ukraine with representatives of Russia,” Zelensky said.“I think [Akhmetov] may not know about it,” the president added. “I invite Rinat Akhmetov to [my office] to listen to the information that can be shared.”Akhmetov is a steel and energy tycoon who once bankrolled pro-Russian former president Viktor Yanukovich but lost some of his estimated $7.5bn fortune after Moscow-backed separatists seized several of his industrial assets in the Donbas.He dismissed Zelensky’s claims. “The information made public by Volodymyr Zelensky about attempts to draw me into some kind of coup is an absolute lie.My position has been and will be explicit and definite: an independent, democratic, and united Ukraine with the Crimea and my home region, Donbas,” Akhmetov said in a statement on Friday.“I will continue to defend a free Ukraine.I will do everything I can to prevent authoritarianism and censorship in Ukraine,” he added.The two men are embroiled in an increasingly public conflict over Zelensky’s attempts to curb the vast influence Ukraine’s oligarchs wield over politics and state contracts.Akhmetov’s TV channels fulsomely praised Zelensky after his 2019 landslide election victory but have switched to harsh criticism in recent weeks.Zelensky said on Friday that Akhmetov’s television channels “don’t have the right to misinform our public”. He also took a swipe at Akhmetov’s energy companies, suggesting they were not working with the government to secure ample supplies of coal and other fuels to prevent destabilising electricity blackouts this winter.Akhmetov’s companies have denied such allegations and claim they have secured crucial coal imports, including for state thermoelectric generators, after Russia blocked shipments.
51  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
52  The tragedy on Wednesday in which 27 men, women and children died trying to reach the English coast from France very nearly played out in just the same way a few days earlier. A group of young Afghans were led out to sea in the middle of the night by a man they had just met. After several hours, in the middle of the Channel between northern France and southern England, the boat’s engine cut out.The 21 people squeezed into the small inflatable began to panic. After another four hours waiting in the bitter cold, as they tried desperately to remove the water that had started lapping at their ankles, a woman began hyperventilating.“We believed we were going to die out there,” says Ahmed Khan, a 24-year-old, whose arm was broken during the failed attempt to cross the Channel. Those onboard were eventually found by a rescue boat and taken back to land — adding to the more than 7,800 asylum seekers this year to have been rescued by patrol boats, lifeboats and other vessels in the Channel.Will they attempt the journey again? “We will go out again as soon as we can,” says Khan, an Afghan who arrived alone in Calais one month ago.“What can I do? I have no other option,” he adds, referring to the violence and persecution he says has erupted in his hometown of Logar in eastern Afghanistan since the Taliban took control over the country in August.Since the deaths on Wednesday, which have shamed and shaken politicians on both sides of the Channel, the French and British governments have been bickering over how to prepare a workable response to the crisis.An international meeting to be convened by France in Calais on Sunday for British and European ministers responsible for immigration was supposed to map out an urgent way forward. But the intractability of a 25-year-old migration crisis was underlined on Friday when France angrily withdrew its invitation to Priti Patel, UK home secretary.French officials described as “unacceptable” a letter from Boris Johnson to President Emmanuel Macron in which the UK prime minister called for French and British reciprocal maritime patrols in each other’s territorial waters and for the thousands of asylum seekers who reach English shores to be returned to France.Paris objected to the contents of the letter, which challenged French sovereignty, but also the way it was made public in what the French see as a transparent attempt to secure domestic political advantage for Johnson.Anglo-French relations have in the past few months been at their lowest ebb for several decades in the aftermath of Brexit, with disputes bubbling over trade, deliveries of Covid vaccines and fishing licences for French boats, as well as immigration.On migration, London and Paris agree on an aggressive rule-of-law approach to the problem, with both Johnson and Macron condemning the people traffickers who are said to earn millions of euros a year by charging would-be asylum seekers for help in extracting them from their home countries and ferrying them across Europe to their desired destinations.Both leaders are looking over their shoulders at vocal anti-immigration critics in the rightwing electorates of their respective countries. And both have emphasised the need for crackdowns rather than reforms to the asylum systems — a path recommended by human rights groups to make it easier for refugees to apply for entry to their destinations from abroad, removing the need for smugglers.With an eye on the presidential election less than five months away, Macron is eager to show those on the right that he is as serious about immigration as some of his rivals, including the far-right Rassemblement National leader Marine Le Pen, and the newly popular anti-immigration polemicist Eric Zemmour — one of whom he could meet in the second and final round of the election in April if current opinion poll rankings hold steady.The problem is that cracking down on people smugglers and removing camps full of migrants from the French coast has been tried repeatedly and shows no sign of working. One reason for the sharply rising number of dangerous Channel crossings by small boats in the past couple of years is that both governments worked together to secure the Channel ports and the Channel Tunnel to prevent people stowing away on trucks and in ferries. The people smugglers, and those seeking to get to the UK, are quick to adapt to changing conditions.The politicians on both sides “prefer to deal with this using police, which is their choice, it’s their political orientation, but you can see that it doesn’t work”, says Pierre Roques, co-ordinator of the Auberge des Migrants, an NGO working with displaced people in the Calais region. “These policies are short-term [because] politicians are thinking about their mandate but they lack any vision.”On the day of the latest boat disaster, 780 French police officers were monitoring the coastal beaches between the Pas-de-Calais and the Belgian border. Nonetheless, 757 people successfully completed the trip by boat from France to the UK. Winds were light and conditions relatively favourable.In mid-morning at Dover Harbour, the closest point in England to France, in temperatures only just above freezing, groups of asylum seekers picked up at sea walked slowly up a gangplank towards checks by Border Force officials and buses waiting to take them on to temporary accommodation. All were shrouded in light blue blankets, while some carried children in their arms. A few children arriving were unaccompanied.Some days the numbers have been even higher — 1,185 people, a record for the current surge in arrivals, made the trip on November 11.Small boat crossings started to become a semi-regular method of clandestine migration in 2018, according to local UK charities. Though initially the journeys were few and far between, the number and scale has increased rapidly during the past two years.Calculations made by media organisations based on Home Office information show that up to November 25, at least 26,611 people had made the crossing during 2021, already more than three times the 8,461 total for 2020. However, for the year to June 30 asylum claims in the UK were still 4 per cent down on the same period a year earlier, as the tougher Anglo-French security measures reduced the numbers arriving in the backs of trucks or hidden on trains. That effect has been especially marked since 39 Vietnamese citizens were found dead in the back of a smuggling truck in Essex in October 2019, which had travelled from Belgium.The pandemic also led to sharp falls in truck, train and car traffic between the UK and mainland Europe.The sheer volume of small boat migration has in recent months started to push up the overall numbers of applications received in the UK — the 15,104 claims in the July to September quarter were 60 per cent up on the figure for the same period of 2020. Yet, the UK continues to receive only about a third as many asylum applications annually as Germany, fewer than half the number that France does and fewer than Spain. This is because fewer displaced people ever get to the UK.The calculations about travel routes are made clear by talking to Abdul, a 26-year-old who arrived in Calais six days ago from Iraqi Kurdistan via Turkey and Italy, who says he would have been willing to travel by truck, but “the problem is they have X-rays now”. He adds that a cousin in Kurdistan paid £1,000 for him to take a boat across the Channel after it became dangerous for him to remain at home. He has tried this route twice unsuccessfully and says he will attempt the journey again in the next few days if the weather conditions improve. The agreement many people have with the smugglers is that if they don’t make it first time — usually because police stop them at the beach — they can try again without incurring extra cost.The smugglers’ use of makeshift inflatable boats, adapted to squeeze more people on and often less seaworthy than normal vessels, is part of an evolution in their tactics in the past year as operations have become increasingly professional. They have used a wider range of beaches even though departures from the coast west of Calais result in longer sea journeys and greater risks. UK authorities say that smugglers arrange large numbers of simultaneous launches on some days, in the hope of overwhelming the French authorities.Politicians on both sides of the Channel have united around a common enemy: the smugglers. But local groups say the aggressive pursuit of these criminal organisations deflects attention from the lack of safe avenues to apply for asylum and the increasingly violent policing of the border, both of which leave displaced people with little choice but to take more dangerous routes.“The smugglers go hand in hand with the border, they are the mushrooms that grow with it,” says Roques. “It is instead necessary to suppress their source of income, to fight against people having to risk their lives to cross the Channel.”Many of the displaced people in the camps say they have had limited contact with the leaders of smuggling groups, who often send in young workers to warn members of the camp about the timing of a boat’s departure and help ferry them to the beach, like runners in drug-dealing gangs.Since the Calais “jungle” refugee camp was dismantled in 2016, the displaced people are spread across smaller encampments dotted between Calais and Dunkirk, ranging in size from several hundred to between 1,000 and 2,000. Though these camps have had a steady stream of Iraqi, Kurdish, Syrian and Sudanese people for some years, more recently there has been a rise in arrivals, according to those at the camp, of Afghans fleeing the Taliban.The people in these camps are separated broadly between those with the means to travel by boat — which costs anywhere between £500 and £3,000, according to several asylum seekers — and those who have no money and are planning to chance their luck by sneaking on to a lorry.At camps around the Auchan superstore in the town of Grande-Synthe, about 1,500 mainly Kurdish and Afghan people gather in tents. Family members had helped many of them pay to make the journey to England.A teenage boy arrived in one of these camps on Thursday afternoon, originally from Egypt, dressed in smart, clean clothes and carrying a suitcase, but unable to speak a word of French or English. Close to tears, he spoke quietly on the phone in Arabic to his brother, who was calling from Peterborough in the UK and had paid for the young man to take a boat across the Channel in the next few days.Roques says that he is increasingly worried about the living conditions and “inhuman and degrading treatment” of those living in the camps. The police come every other day to clear the camps, he says, often confiscating people’s tents, blankets and clothes, and using pepper spray on people who refuse to move.There are many reasons why people across the camps are hell bent on making it to the UK in spite of the dangers: many have relatives there and already speak good English, others believe the opportunities for work and the quality of life are much better, and have heard that the British are less discriminatory.A more recent factor is that with Brexit, the UK has now left the Dublin convention whereby asylum seekers are supposed to be processed in the first country they set foot in, meaning the UK can no longer justify refusing asylum to people on the grounds that they arrived elsewhere in Europe first. Some of the displaced people, who faced a grim reception when they arrived in countries such as Malta, Italy and Serbia, are aware of the UK’s new position and see it as the only place they could start over.Marguerite Combes of the migrant support charity Utopia 56 says that people will continue to “die in the middle of the sea or on a truck” trying to get to the UK. “We have to allow people who need to travel between the countries [to do it] in a safe way. That is the only solution.”Given the determination of the displaced people, many of whom are facing equally perilous situations in their home countries, several NGOs and local officials are calling for a “humanitarian bridge” to be set up between the UK and EU countries, whereby people are able to apply for asylum via safe routes from centres located across Europe.Back at the Grand-Synthe camp, Ahmed Khan explains that he lived in London for two years but returned to Afghanistan in 2018 after a relative was killed. More recently, life had been made unbearable by the Taliban, he adds.“If I die here or I die back in my country it’s no difference to me,” he says. 
53  Franco-British relations sank to a new post-Brexit low on Friday when Emmanuel Macron criticised Boris Johnson over what he called his failure to act “seriously” to find a solution to the cross-Channel migrant crisis.Only two days after both governments were shaken by the deaths of 27 people seeking to reach England from France in a small boat, Paris cut London out of an urgent meeting of European ministers in Calais on Sunday because of the UK prime minister’s cavalier approach to the problem.Johnson had written and publicised a letter to France’s president late on Thursday in which he called for French and British maritime patrols in each other’s territorial waters and for the thousands of migrants who reach English shores to be returned to France.“If those who reach this country were swiftly returned, the incentive for people to put their lives in the hands of traffickers would be significantly reduced,” Johnson wrote.Macron and his ministers objected both to the content of the letter, which revived proposals already rejected by France and laid the blame for the crisis at France’s door, and to the way it was immediately made public to the British media.The UK’s right-leaning Daily Express tabloid carried a splash headline on its front page on Friday that read: “UK troops to patrol French beaches”.Macron said on Friday: “You don’t communicate from one leader to another on these matters through a tweet and a letter which you make public. We’re not whistleblowers.”He added: “Our ministers are going to work seriously to deal with this serious matter with serious people.”Macron’s anger is the latest sign that his relations with Johnson are again deteriorating despite indications in the days before the tragedy that the two governments were improving their co-operation in attempting to stop people leaving the French coast.Since British voters opted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum, France and the UK have been embroiled in increasingly rancorous disputes over everything from trade and the status of Northern Ireland to fishing rights and Covid vaccines.On Friday, French fishermen protested against the UK’s refusal to grant all the licences sought by the French for UK and Channel Islands waters under the Brexit agreement, blocking the approach road to the Channel Tunnel with vans and cars and using boats to obstruct cross-Channel ferries for a few hours.Dozens of fishermen at Ouistreham, near Caen, held a banner saying in English: “We want our licences back”.Macron confirmed that France had withdrawn an invitation to Priti Patel, UK home secretary, to join European ministers for the meeting on migrants in Calais. “Then we’ll see with Britain how we can act efficiently if they decide to be serious,” he said.However, Downing Street on Friday said it hoped that the French side would reconsider.French officials have complained that the British government is blaming Macron for problems associated with Brexit and the border issue for domestic political reasons. UK officials in turn say Macron is being difficult because he will be campaigning for re-election in April and is being criticised by his French nationalist opponents.After the tragedy on Wednesday, the Elysée Palace said Macron had told Johnson that the UK and France shared responsibility and that “he expected the British to co-operate fully and to abstain from exploiting a tragedy for political ends”. Johnson’s suggestion that the two countries sign a bilateral agreement to return asylum seekers arriving in the UK to France hit on a highly sensitive topic for the French side.France has persistently rejected UK efforts to negotiate such an agreement, insisting that the process needed to be managed via a deal between the UK and the EU. Gérald Darmanin, France’s interior minister, in September described as “blackmail” a series of proposals by Patel with some similarities to those set out in Thursday’s letter.Michel Barnier, the EU’s former Brexit negotiator and a French presidential candidate, on Friday condemned Johnson’s approach as “unacceptable” and “yet another provocation”, saying that the UK prime minister was being “confrontational” on all topics with the EU.A deal is needed to address the issues created by the UK’s withdrawal last December from the Dublin Conventions, an agreement among European states that allows the return of asylum seekers to safe countries through which they have passed on the way to claiming asylum elsewhere. The conventions also provide for reunions of families stranded in separate countries.Downing Street on Friday insisted that Johnson had no regrets either over sending the letter or posting it on Twitter. The prime minister’s official spokesman said both Johnson and Macron had a “shared recognition” of the situation’s urgency.“You’ll see from the tone of the letter this is about deepening our existing co-operation and building on work that has already been done between our two countries which the PM in the letter paid tribute to,” the spokesman said.
54  Paris prosecutors are to investigate a former French environment minister under president Emmanuel Macron on allegations of rape and sexual assault, after several women came forward with accusations dating back decades.Nicolas Hulot, a popular environmental activist who first rose to prominence in France as a TV presenter in a nature series, had a brief stint in the French cabinet when Macron came to power in 2017.He was one of the high-profile examples of Macron’s attempts to bring fresh blood into politics, but quit just over a year into the job, saying he was disappointed with the slow pace of change on green policies.Four women gave witness accounts and accused Hulot of sexual assault in a television investigation aired on France 2 on Thursday. Two other women also came forward, France 2 said. One of the women on camera said she had been 16 when she met Hulot, and that he had tried to force oral sex on her after she won an invitation to attend his TV show in 1989. Some alleged assaults are as recent as 2001.Public prosecutors said on Friday that the preliminary probe would seek to establish whether there was a case for criminal charges, and whether the statute of limitations, which would normally mean they cannot be pursued, still applied.Hulot rejected the allegations, which had begun to surface before the investigation was even aired, and told BFM TV on Thursday: “I have never seduced anyone by force.”A former contender to lead France’s green party, Hulot said he would quit political life for good.France was seen at first as harbouring a divided response to the #MeToo movement that swept the world in the wake of sexual assault allegations against Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein. While a younger generation of feminists started a French version of the social media campaign — #balancetonporc, literally “rat out your pig” — high-profile figures such as Catherine Deneuve signed a letter defending the right of men to “pester” women.But more French cases have since come to the fore, with various #MeToo style campaigns hitting high-level political circles, TV personalities and members of the French intelligentsia.Before prosecutors stepped in, some politicians questioned the precedent the Hulot case could set, with French justice minister Eric Dupond-Moretti telling LCI radio that “justice should not be rendered on TV or social media”.But Hulot’s response to the allegations has also elicited criticism, with some former allies distancing themselves from him.In the TV investigation, Hulot does not appear on camera but answers journalists by phone, saying that it was no use fighting back, and that the word of women was “sacred”.“The word of men is called into question. So it’s no longer even worth defending yourself,” Hulot said.Elisabeth Moreno, in charge of gender equality within the government, criticised Hulot on Twitter for his sarcastic attitude when defending himself on TV, when he joked about his physique and how it must be an obstacle to winning over women.Marlène Schiappa, a former gender equality junior minister who now has a role in the interior ministry, had publicly backed her former colleague when a separate sexual assault allegation against him surfaced in 2018. It related to an old case that judicial authorities had looked into and dropped. On Friday she said “the two situations are different”.
55  We may never know the names of the 27 people who died trying to cross the English Channel to seek asylum. Or those of the many others who have probably perished without ever being found. In that perilous stretch of water, refugee groups say, bodies can be swept up in currents and never make land.Tragedies like this force us to look at things which make us uneasy. Ours was not just a third country these desperate people were passing through, but their destination, their hope.Britain thinks of itself as a big-hearted country. There was barely a murmur when the government offered almost 3m Hong Kongers the chance to settle in the UK, nor when it pledged to accept 20,000 refugees from Afghanistan. But when people arrive chaotically in small boats, wariness erodes sympathy, and there is fear that we are a “soft touch”.These boats expose the final lie of a government which promised to “take back control” after Brexit, but is now discovering that it can’t control a border from only one side. For the government which left the EU single market in order to end free movement, stopping the boats is a political imperative. But ramping up the rhetoric against France has spectacularly backfired — as demonstrated by the Elysee’s decision to rescind UK home secretary Priti Patel’s invitation to Sunday’s interministerial summit on migration in Calais. Now it is outside the EU, it turns out that Britain needs France a great deal more than France needs it.Yet UK prime minister Boris Johnson cannot resist the temptation to pretend the opposite. With lives at stake, his letter on Thursday to President Emmanuel Macron was breathtaking in its smugness and hypocrisy. Urging the French to establish joint patrols is something you do through diplomatic back channels, with enormous delicacy, not by publishing a letter claiming that Britain had all the best ideas and that France needs to step up. If this is how tone-deaf we are in international negotiations, I fear for our future.Britain has no right to adopt such a stance, given that our current asylum system is both inhumane and ineffective. It doesn’t give voters confidence, nor asylum seekers dignity. We lock up new arrivals and don’t let them work. This would make more sense if we robustly deported those whose claims for asylum are found inadmissible, or those with criminal records, but we don’t. Some melt into the underground economy; others bring multiple appeals until settlement becomes a fact. So the public remains supportive of resettlement from UN refugee camps, which is the British policy, but deeply wary of asylum.Across the world, the UN Refugee Convention of 1951 is fraying under the pressures of war, climate change and the kind of barbarism which recently brought the veteran BBC reporter John Simpson to tears in Afghanistan. It’s getting harder to distinguish refugees fleeing the kind of persecution inflicted by Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia, which was the impetus for the convention, from economic migrants seeking a better life. How do you categorise someone who may have owned a business in Iraq, but fled after it was torched? Who do you believe when someone arrives with no papers? Do the distinctions even make any sense any more?Governments from Poland to the US are under pressure to show their voters that they are choosing who comes, and integrating them without overwhelming local infrastructure. In the UK, the reluctance of successive governments to acknowledge the numbers arriving means that we have failed to provide the services needed. It has also left voters resentful of the resulting pressure on GPs and schools.Right now, unaccompanied asylum-seeking children are putting enormous strain on local authorities which are struggling to look after them properly. In June, Kent county council said that it was at breaking point, and issued legal proceedings against the Home Office. Many of these children have suffered extreme trauma and need extensive help. We should be ambitious for these children. But we also need to be honest about the budgets that are needed. Looking away — as politicians hope we will do — doesn’t help.Smashing the people-smuggling rings supplying the boats that carry migrants across the Channel can only be done by a coalition wider than just France and Britain. This Sunday’s summit will bring European ministers to the table in an effort to trace the big money involved and find the culprits. But more will be needed. And Britain won’t be there.Part of the answer for the UK must be speed up our own systems. Analysis of European asylum applications between 2009 and 2017 suggested that processing speed, and the risk of repatriation, significantly affect which kinds of migrants apply to which countries. Those from the most war-torn places, who can most easily substantiate their claims, favour countries which process claims fastest: more Syrians applied to Germany, and fewer to Sweden, for example, after Germany became more efficient. Equally, “economic” migrants seem more likely to try places with more bureaucracy.This must, surely, be accompanied by an improved ability to deport — especially those with criminal records. Nothing else will quell public jitters or deter the people smugglers.This weekend, those who voted for Brexit would be right to wonder what they voted for. It does us no credit to present Britain as a jingoistic, tone-deaf nation. The British people, and those who want to come here, deserve more. We used to be better than this.
56  Italian prime minister Mario Draghi called reform of the EU’s fiscal rules “inevitable” as he joined forces with French president Emmanuel Macron to sign a new co-operation treaty between the two countries.The leaders addressed the need for greater EU co-ordination on budget rules, investment and migration, and to tackle other common challenges such as energy transition.“As for the budgetary rules that were in force until before the pandemic, they had already proved to be insufficient since the [global] financial crisis,” Draghi said at a press conference in Rome on Friday. “Today the revision [of the rules] is inevitable, not only because of the very high cost of the pandemic in economic and social terms but also because of the future challenges of the EU, from the fight against climate change to new technologies, to the gigantic investments in semiconductors. We need to correct our past and design our future.”Macron did not comment on fiscal reforms, but France has long advocated a review of the EU’s budget rules, known as the Stability and Growth Pact. A consultation is under way over how to amend the rules, which were suspended when the coronavirus crisis broke out, with intense discussions expected over how much leeway to give member states on their public finances.Reflecting warmer ties after the more fractious relationship of recent years, France and Italy signed the Quirinale Treaty at a time when European diplomacy is being tested by the departure of German chancellor Angela Merkel. Italy’s closer links to France give Draghi’s government an opportunity to play a more active role at EU level.Macron dismissed the idea that the treaty would signal a shift in European leadership. Paris and Berlin have a similar alliance dating back to 1963. “You shouldn’t see, in the friendship that we’re building across the Alps, a substitution for the friendship we’re consolidating across the Rhine,” Macron said, adding that the alliances were complementary.For France, which is due to take on the presidency of the EU from January, closer ties with Italy could help Macron bolster the moderate, western European core of the EU. “We’re going to put our affinities at the service of the European project even more resolutely,” Macron said.Plans for closer co-operation between Italy and France were first discussed in 2017 but shelved a year later by the ruling coalition of League and Five Star, which clashed badly with Paris over migration. France recalled its ambassador from Rome in 2019 after Luigi Di Maio, Italy’s then deputy prime minister, met anti-Macron yellow vest protesters.Now, with the former European Central Bank president at the helm, Italy’s nationalist-populist impulses have been so tamed that even League backs the talks with France.The treaty comes at a moment of relative tranquility in Italian politics and before next year’s presidential election in France, in which Macron is expected to seek re-election. Italy’s president Sergio Mattarella steps down next year. There has been much speculation in Rome about whether Draghi intends to replace Mattarella as president, or remain as prime minister until the end of the current parliament in 2023.“We must equip the EU with instruments that are compatible with our ambitions and the expectations of our citizens. The treaty we signed today marks the start of this journey,” Draghi said.
57  A jailed philanthropist at the centre of a row between President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and western nations has been kept behind bars in a decision that risks aggravating Turkey’s already strained ties with Europe and the US.Osman Kavala, who has spent the past four years in a jail without any conviction and whose release has been demanded by the European Court of Human Rights, was ordered to remain in prison by an Istanbul court on Friday.The ruling dashed hopes among his supporters that he could be released ahead of a push to censure Turkey next week at the Council of Europe, the continent’s top human rights body.Speaking outside Istanbul’s Caglayan courthouse, one of Kavala’s lawyers said the Turkish judiciary had been given the opportunity to show it was free from political interference, but added: “I think they were unable to use this opportunity.”Kavala, whose case has become a symbol of the erosion of the rule of law and a crackdown on dissent in Turkey under Erdogan’s watch, did not attend the hearing or present a defence.He announced last month that it was “meaningless” for him to do so when the Turkish president, who last month compared Kavala to “bandits, killers and terrorists”, continued to make “insulting and defamatory” statements about him that he said jeopardised his chance of a fair trial.The packed courtroom included diplomats from some of the 10 nations that found themselves at the centre of a diplomatic crisis last month after they published a joint statement calling for Kavala’s release.Erdogan threatened to expel the ambassadors from the signatory nations, including the US, Germany and France, but backed down after several of the countries offered an olive branch by publicly restating their commitment not to meddle in Turkey’s internal affairs.Kavala, a former businessman who has used his wealth to support civil society projects focused on conservation and minority rights, was arrested in 2017 in the midst of a sweeping crackdown that followed a violent attempted coup in the previous year.The now 64-year-old was accused of seeking to overthrow the government during the Gezi Park protests that rocked Turkey in 2013. He was acquitted last year of those charges, but was rearrested hours later and accused of espionage and seeking to overthrow the government during the 2016 attempted coup — charges that he denies.Some of Kavala’s friends and supporters had hoped that he could be released in order to avert the threat of “infringement proceedings” being brought against Turkey by the Council of Europe.The institution, which oversees the ECHR, said in September that if Kavala was not let out of jail it would vote on a proposal to begin the formal process of reprimanding Turkey for its refusal to follow through on the court’s order for his release.Erdogan has previously declared that his nation was not “bound” by ECHR decisions, even though it is a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights that the court was set up to enforce.The infringement process, though likely to be slow and laborious, could ultimately lead to Turkey’s expulsion from the Council of Europe, striking a symbolic blow to the country’s reputation on the world stage.The next hearing in Kavala’s case has been set for January.
58  The EU and UK were among those who moved to impose travel restrictions on a group of southern African nations as a surge in cases of a heavily mutated coronavirus variant caused alarm among global health officials.After the UK placed six southern African countries back on its red list, the EU said on Friday that it was also likely to ban travellers from the region after the discovery of a new Covid-19 variant, UK officials said.Travellers returning from South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Eswatini would have to quarantine for 10 days at a government facility.Sajid Javid, UK health secretary, on Friday described the new B.1.1.529 variant as a “huge international concern”, telling the House of Commons: “Early indications show this variant may be more transmissible than the Delta variant, and current vaccines may be less effective against it.”The bans follow mounting concern among scientists over the B.1.1.529 Sars-Cov-2 variant’s ability to evade vaccines and transmit faster than the dominant Delta variant. The strain, first identified in Botswana and which is understood to have 50 mutations, is believed to be behind a resurgence in Covid-19 cases in South Africa over the past week.The World Health Organization has convened an emergency meeting on Friday to discuss the new strain. The variant is expected to be classified as a “variant of interest” and given the Greek alphabet name Nu, according to a person familiar with the matter.Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, tweeted on Friday that she would “activate the emergency brake to stop air travel from the southern African region due to the variant”.Israel also banned travel to and from seven southern African nations, including South Africa and Botswana, and Israelis returning from those countries would have to quarantine for seven days, and be tested twice before release.As one definite and two suspected cases of the new strain were confirmed, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett warned that the highly vaccinated country was on the “verge of a state of emergency”. “Our main principle is to act fast, strong and now,” his office said in a statement.Hong Kong said it had recorded two cases of the variant following genome sequencing analysis. They were a traveller who arrived from South Africa this month and another from Canada who had stayed on the same floor of a quarantine hotel. Singapore has also put restrictions on countries in the region.South Africa on Friday accused the UK, which made its move first, on Thursday evening, of rushing to ban travel before the variant was properly assessed.“Whilst South Africa respects the right of all countries to take the necessary precautionary measures to protect their citizens, the UK’s decision to temporarily ban South Africans from entering the UK seems to have been rushed as even the World Health Organization is yet to advise on the next steps,” the foreign ministry said in a statement.“Our immediate concern is the damage that this decision will cause to both the tourism industries and businesses of both countries,” the country’s foreign minister added.The strain has been described as the most concerning coronavirus variant that researchers have encountered. Unconfirmed data appear to show it is spreading faster than thought in South Africa, where the rate of tests yielding a positive result has jumped in recent weeks.At least 59 cases of the variant, mainly originating in South Africa, have been genomically sequenced. Local health officials told the Financial Times that early PCR results indicated that 90 per cent of 1,100 new cases on Wednesday in Gauteng region, which includes Johannesburg, were caused by the new variant.Tulio de Oliveira, the director of the Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation in South Africa, “worried” over traits present in the new variant that had previously been associated with high transmissibility. “And the key question to be answered is what exactly is the effect on the vaccines,” he said.Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist of the WHO, said the new variant had “a number of worrying mutations in the spike protein”.Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, described it as “the most significant variant we have encountered to date and urgent research is under way to learn more about its transmissibility, severity and vaccine susceptibility.”It was “a clear reminder to everyone that this pandemic is not over”, she added.Christina Pagel, a member of the UK’s Independent Sage group of science advisers, welcomed the travel ban. “We’re currently ahead of [this variant] in the UK,” she said. “Acting now is our best chance of preventing importation while we find out more about it.”South Africa and other countries in the region only came off the UK’s red list in October. Travel restrictions were first imposed on the region at the start of the year over the Beta variant, which was superseded by Delta.
59  Tesla has been forced to turn down more than €1.1bn in European subsidies for its planned battery plant near Berlin after delays to the flagship project breached a key condition of the funding.The electric car maker had applied for the money through an EU programme established to develop the battery industry on the continent.The EU requires any sites in receipt of the funds to be the “first industrial deployment” of the technology, according to official documents, meaning the batteries cannot already be made at another Tesla plant.But legal challenges to the construction of the plant, which will produce cars first before making batteries, have delayed its opening by several months. That means the company, whose valuation hit $1tn earlier this year, is likely to begin producing the same batteries elsewhere sooner.The German government confirmed on Friday that Tesla was no longer seeking the subsidies but declined to comment further.“Tesla is still sticking to its plans for the [Brandenburg] battery factory,” said the German economics ministry, adding that the “state subsidies not used by Tesla are now available for other projects”.Tesla’s chief executive Elon Musk has already voiced his frustration at the slow progress of the plant, and has called for German bureaucracy to be streamlined. Employees at the plant are also due to elect a works council within days, potentially handing them power to delay or reject management decisions.In response to questions on Twitter, Musk replied on Friday: “It has always been Tesla’s view that all subsidies should be eliminated, but that must include the massive subsidies for oil & gas.”Tesla has previously taken government support in other construction projects around the world.Separately on Friday, a company filing in China revealed that Tesla plans to expand capacity at its Shanghai car plant, allowing it to increase staff numbers at the site by about a third and boosting production in the world’s largest electric car market.The US carmaker will spend roughly Rmb1.2bn ($188m) to increase capacity at the facility, taking the maximum number of workers at the plant from 15,000 to 19,000.The filing in China did not say how many more vehicles the plant would be able to produce.Its Shanghai site, which began production late in 2019, is at present able to make about 450,000 cars annually, just shy of the number of cars that Tesla sold globally last year.The expansion comes after Tesla was forced to apologise to consumers in China earlier this year after its response to complaints sparked protests against the company and drew the ire of state media.Musk has set a customarily ambitious goal of producing 20m vehicles a year by the end of the decade, an achievement that, if successful, would make Tesla twice as large as Volkswagen or Toyota, the industry’s two largest producers today.Tesla is on track to make close to 1m vehicles this year, despite most of its rivals curtailing production because of global chip shortages.In its third-quarter results last month, Tesla said revenues rose 57 per cent to $13.8bn compared with the same period a year earlier, while it posted a record quarterly profit of $1.6bn.Musk told Tesla’s investors last month that the Shanghai site already produced more vehicles than its flagship facility in Fremont, California.The China site makes the Model 3, which it sells locally and exports to Europe, and the Model Y.
60  We’ve all been there, at the airport counter, with the stash of Covid-19 papers, gripped by anxiety that the country you’ve visited has turned a darker shade of red, meaning quarantine upon arrival. The paperwork won’t disappear in the future, but at least the EU is seeking to move away from colour-coded countries to a more individual approach: is the traveller vaccinated and if so, how long ago? I’ll unpack the European Commission’s announcements on travel restrictions and boosters and what timelines are expected.Over in Rome today, Emmanuel Macron and Mario Draghi are rekindling ties via a long-planned Franco-Italian co-operation treaty, which was thwarted by hostile politics in Rome. We’ll explore what this pact is about and how likely it is for the repaired relationship to last.Meanwhile, in a new instalment of the Brexit saga over fishing rights, fishermen on the French side have said they will blockade three French ports and prevent trucks going through the Channel Tunnel today. And in more disruption news, if you live in Brussels and were planning to hail a ride with Uber later tonight — tough luck. A court ruling earlier this week de facto banned the app from Belgium’s capital (though if you live in other cities in the country you can still use the app).This article is an onsite version of our Europe Express newsletter.  to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every weekday morningTravel in 2022 will still involve a lot more paperwork than in pre-pandemic times, but the focus will shift from the epidemiological situation in the country of origin to the vaccination status of each traveller.The commission yesterday proposed changes to the travel restrictions framework in place since March 2020, which recommends a ban on non-essential travellers from countries with a high incidence of Covid-19 cases. Currently only 19 countries outside the EU are on a green list of non-restricted travel (neither the UK nor the US is included).“We are moving away from this country-based approach to an individual approach. All people that are vaccinated can come into the EU,” said home affairs commissioner Ylva Johansson.The proposals are subject to approval by member states.Several deadlines were mentioned yesterday:January 10: for travellers from outside the EU who show proof of vaccination to start counting backwards and make sure that their second shot was not older than nine monthsMarch 1: for doing away with the colour-coded origin countries for travel restrictionsSix months from the second shot: when the vaccine starts to wear off and when people should be offered a booster jabNine months from the second shot: when the EU Covid-19 certificate expires unless the person has received a booster vaccineIn addition, several caveats on the type of the vaccine are considered — on rules that will apply as of March 1: If travellers have been inoculated with vaccines approved by the World Health Organization but which have not been authorised on the EU market, travellers will also have to produce a negative PCR test result. People who have recovered from Covid-19 can also travel freely to the EU, but will have to show a negative PCR test result. The same rule will apply to children.The colour codes will still be used within the EU for additional restrictions for the non-vaccinated or people who have just recovered from Covid-19, said justice commissioner Didier Reynders.The criteria for putting regions in one of the red, yellow or green categories will change: in addition to the number of new cases and the viral reproduction rate, they will also consider the vaccine uptake and the testing rate in each region. “This takes into account that vaccinated persons are better protected from transmitting the virus, even if not completely,” Reynders said.With several countries having imposed lockdowns in recent days, Reynders warned of the rising danger of fragmentation: “We see a clear risk there may be diverging approaches between countries and may endanger trust in the Covid certificate and impede freedom of movement in the EU.”Is March 1 a rather late deadline for the EU to discontinue the colour-coded travel system?

(More here)After years of diplomatic tensions, France and Italy today are to seal a pact of friendship and co-operation, which should serve as an anchor for when the relationship returns to choppier waters, writes Davide Ghiglione in Rome.France’s President Emmanuel Macron, who arrived in Rome last night for the occasion, is seeking to cement ties with Italy’s Prime Minister Mario Draghi, via the so-called Quirinale treaty. Both leaders see eye to eye on many points on which co-operation will be enshrined in the pact, including on foreign policy, defence and education. The idea of closer co-operation between the two countries was discussed in 2017 by Macron and Italy’s PM at the time, Paolo Gentiloni. But just a year later, plans were shelved by the ruling coalition of Five Star and the nationalist League, which clashed badly with Paris over EU migration. France recalled its ambassador from Rome in 2019 to protest against “interference” in its domestic politics, after Luigi Di Maio, Italy’s deputy prime minister then, met a group of anti-Macron yellow vest protesters near Paris.Now, with the former European Central Bank president at the helm in Rome, Italy’s nationalist-populist impulses have been so tamed that even the League favours the treaty.Politically, a better relationship with Paris could be used by the Draghi government to play a more active role at a European level, particularly at a time when Germany is expected to be focused more on domestic politics as the new government takes the reins from Chancellor Angela Merkel.On the other hand, strengthening ties with Rome could help Macron bolster the moderate, western European core of the EU and gain leverage against populists at home while securing an important ally to support him during the French presidency of the EU which starts in January.The treaty, consisting of 12 chapters, comes at a moment of relative tranquillity ahead of turbulent times for Italian politics and before presidential elections in France in which Macron is expected to seek re-election.In the short term, the unknown is how long the Draghi government will last.Italy’s President Sergio Mattarella, the man who was instrumental in putting Draghi in office this year, steps down next year. There has been much speculation in Rome about whether Draghi will then take the opportunity to step up to replace Mattarella as president, or whether he will instead decide to remain as prime minister until the end of the current parliament, a year later, in 2023.Both leaders’ uncertain future is even more a reason to band together at an EU level and push, for instance, for a quick reform of the EU’s fiscal rules to allow more carve-outs for green investments.Emmanuel Macron and Mario Draghi sign the Franco-Italian treaty in RomeBelgian and Dutch authorities to decide on further Covid-19 restrictionsWorkplace biometrics: In the absence of a coherent rulebook on the use of biometric technologies in the workplace, Bruegel has put out a policy proposal classifying these technologies, based on their main function and identifying pros and cons for each category.Ukraine link-up: Connecting the country to the continental European power grid and the EU’s electricity market is technically complicated and requires profound reforms to the Ukrainian electricity sector, German think-tank SWP writes in this analysis.

61  As Turks fretted this week about the plummeting lira and the soaring cost of living, they received some startling advice from an MP from president Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling party: simply eat less.“Let’s say that, in normal circumstances, we eat one or two kilos of meat per month. Let’s eat half a kilo,” Zulfu Demirbag said in remarks that made the headlines on Tuesday as the currency fell as much as 15 per cent against the dollar. “If we buy two kilos of tomatoes, let’s just buy two tomatoes,” he continued, echoing the narrative of Erdogan by calling on the public to join the resistance against shadowy forces striving to undermine Turkey.Such conspiratorial rhetoric may still work on a hardcore of loyal supporters of Erdogan’s Justice and Development party (AKP) who see the president as a powerful leader battling to assert Turkey’s rightful place in the world order. But for most of the public it is wearing thin.“There is a core group of people who would vote for the party and Erdogan no matter what,” said Sinem Adar, an associate at the Centre for Applied Turkey Studies in Berlin. “But the [AKP] constituency is getting more and more discontented about the policies and the government. There’s a steady decline since September in more or less every reliable poll.”Turks were caught between horror and bewilderment as they watched the lira slide after the country’s central bank, under Erdogan’s orders, cut its benchmark interest rate for the third month in a row despite inflation that officially stood at 20 per cent last month. The lira is down more than 20 per cent against the dollar since the start of November. Its downward spiral accelerated after the president declared on Monday that the country was fighting an “economic war of independence” akin to the country’s liberation struggle in the 1920s and suggested that further rate cuts would come.Technology company Apple halted online sales in Turkey on Tuesday as the currency fell through the thresholds of 11, 12 and then 13 to the dollar, making it impossible for producers to price their products. “When I got into the elevator the dollar was 11.55. When I got out it was 12.15,” one young Istanbul lawyer said in a tweet that quickly went viral.As they followed the turmoil from afar, many international investors predicted that Erdogan would eventually agree to a sharp hike in interest rates to stop the currency’s fall, as he did during the last major currency crisis in the summer of 2018.But Turkish observers doubted the president was unhappy with the currency’s plunge. “I don’t think this is the result of ignorance or a ‘crazy’ move just for the sake of religious beliefs,” said Ibrahim Turhan, a former AKP member of parliament who is now part of a breakaway party. “This is, in my opinion, a calculated policy change.”Erdogan, who has ruled Turkey for close to two decades, suggested as much himself, arguing this week that “a competitive exchange rate opens the way to strong investment, production and employment”. Opposition parties responded by accusing the president of “treachery” for his apparent indifference to mounting hardship in a country whose reliance on imports means that each drop in the lira pushes up the cost of basic goods.Analysts were left wondering how much further the president, who built his early political success on the back of rising national prosperity, was willing to let the currency slide — and what the consequences would be for his political future if, as some economists warn, the depreciation ushers in hyperinflation of 30 per cent or more.Erdogan and his ally Devlet Bahceli, the leader of the ultra rightwing Nationalist Movement party (MHP), have rejected growing opposition calls to pull forward elections that are scheduled for 2023.“I keep asking myself whether the alliance will be able to survive until 2023 given that it’s weakening very rapidly,” said Adar. “What if it suddenly collapses? If the MHP or the security apparatus withdraws its support from the ruling alliance?”Others say that the pressure is more likely to come from defections within the ruling party. “You don’t want to be an AKP MP when the ship is sinking, especially if you’re not in the inner circle,” said Can Selcuki, director of the Turkiye Raporu polling agency.While life this week largely carried on as normal in a country that has lived through countless terror attacks, a coup attempt and multiple bouts of financial turmoil over the past six years, there were small signs of growing disquiet. Queues formed at some petrol stations in anticipation of price rises. Small protests, some of them organised by the Turkish Communist party, led to arrests in Istanbul and Ankara.Selim Koru, an analyst at the Ankara-based think-tank Tepav, said that Erdogan would use force if larger numbers took to the streets. “His supporters are a minority now, and they are losing ground,” he said. “He’s going to be more and more scared of protests.”Some opposition voters think the Turkish president, who has adopted increasingly authoritarian tactics in recent years, could seek to postpone elections or even cancel them altogether if it looks as if efforts to bolster his support through legitimate means fail to bear fruit.Members of the opposition Republican People’s party (CHP) voiced fears at a meeting of the group’s executive committee on Thursday that the Turkish president could declare a state of emergency.One senior opposition official played down those concerns. But he added: “When we think about the government that is running this country, nothing is impossible.”
62  Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron were on Thursday struggling to co-ordinate a coherent response to the deaths of 27 migrants who had drowned trying to cross the English Channel from France the previous day.The UK and French governments, hampered by deteriorating relations since Brexit, blamed criminal networks of people-traffickers for the tragedy and vowed to crack down on the gangs as would-be asylum seekers risked their lives in small boats.“We need stronger European co-operation on this, given that France is a transit country,” the French president said during a visit to Croatia.On Thursday, a further 62 migrants reached the UK in small boats, while France stopped another 30.Tensions continued between the UK and France yesterday with Priti Patel, the British home secretary, saying the onus was on the French government to stop people crossing the Channel. “I’ve offered to work with France to put officers on the ground and do absolutely whatever is necessary to secure the area so that vulnerable people do not risk their lives by getting into unseaworthy boats,” she told the House of commons.Macron added that France was asking for “additional mobilisation from the British. Because I remind you, when it comes to this, we are holding the border for the British.”France’s president said co-operation needed to improve with Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, the UK and the European Commission. Jean Castex, his prime minister, is inviting ministers responsible for immigration to a meeting in Calais on Sunday to discuss the crisis.Johnson wrote to Macron on Thursday evening setting out five proposals that the UK prime minister said could alleviate the situation, including reciprocal maritime patrols in each other’s territorial waters.Johnson added that a bilateral agreement to return migrants back to France would have an “immediate and significant impact” on those trying to cross the channel.“If those who reach this country were swiftly returned, the incentive for people to put their lives in the hands of traffickers would be significantly reduced,” Johnson wrote.Both Johnson and Macron are exposed to criticism from anti-immigration politicians over their perceived failure to stop thousands of asylum seekers and other migrants arriving from the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Two migrants rescued on Wednesday and recovering from severe hypothermia were from Iraq and Somalia.Macron has moved to harden his migration policies ahead of his campaign for re-election next April against anti-immigration candidates such as the polemicist Éric Zemmour and far-right politician Marine Le Pen.Bilateral co-operation between London and Paris has been made difficult by post-Brexit arguments, and sometimes mutually hostile comments, between French and UK leaders over everything from the migrants to fishing licences, Covid-19 policies and the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol.Gérard Romiti, who heads the French fisheries committee, on Thursday said fishermen would use vans to block three ports — Calais, Saint-Malo and Ouistreham near Caen — and the motorway approach to the Channel Tunnel on Friday as a “warning shot” to the UK over its refusal to grant enough licences to French fishing boats after Brexit.UK immigration figures released on Thursday showed the effect of small-boat migration on the UK asylum system. It received 15,104 applications in the July to September quarter, 60 per cent higher compared with the same quarter of 2020. Applications for the year to September were up 18 per cent on the year to September 2020, to 37,562.However, for the year to June — the last period for which comparisons are possible — the 37,235 applications received still put the UK only fourth in Europe for the number of asylum applications received, well behind 113,625 in Germany and 87,180 in France.Hundreds gathered in Calais and Dunkirk on Thursday evening to mourn the deaths of those displaced people at sea as they attempted the journey across the channel, with candles lit and speeches given in English and Arabic.Jean-Marc Puissesseau, president and chair of the ports of Calais and Boulogne, said he was completely “fed up” with the lack of support being given to people in perilous situations in camps around the city and that increasing policing of the 130km coast was “not the solution”.He said the millions of euros being spent on policing should instead be used to create an international centre for migrants, financed by countries across Europe, that would house prospective asylum seekers and help them process their applications. It was a “failure of the EU and the UK” that a system like this had not yet been created to treat displaced people in a humane way, he said.
63  French fishermen will blockade three French ports and prevent freight trucks going through the Channel Tunnel on Friday to protest against the UK’s failure to grant licences to some of their vessels after Brexit.Gérard Romiti, president of France’s fisheries committee, described the action as a “warning shot”.“Our mobilisation tomorrow is a demonstration of our ability to mobilise in the face of the British government’s provocative, arrogant and contemptuous attitude,” he said on Thursday.He added that the fishermen were not seeking handouts but just wanted to get their licences back. They will target goods transport, using vans to block the port of Saint-Malo between 8am and 9am, the port of Ouistreham at 2pm, and the motorway to the Channel Tunnel, as well as its freight entrance at Calais, between noon and 1.30pm.The European Commission on Wednesday gave the UK a stern warning over delays in resolving the dispute over the permits and gave it a deadline of December 10 to come to an agreement with the fishermen.Olivier Leprêtre, head of the fisheries committee in the port of Boulogne, dismissed the Commission’s warning as too weak and insisted that France had been forced to step up action.He warned that if nothing changed, the port of Boulogne — France’s largest fishing port and Europe’s largest seafood processing, distribution and trading centre — would be “well placed” to block imports and exports of seafood.The UK claims to have been “very generous” in granting fishing licences to French vessels and has said that French fishermen who are still waiting for their permits or who have been refused licences have not provided evidence of previous fishing in English and Channel Islands waters.Senior French officials have previously accused the UK government of deliberately targeting France by failing to award some of its vessels the licences to which they are entitled under the Brexit agreement.The blockages, which come after months of wrangling between Paris and London over licences, are likely to add to rising tensions between the two governments, intensified by the cross-Channel migrant crisis.According to France’s fisheries ministry, French vessels had obtained “more than 960 licences” to fish in UK waters and around the Channel Islands but more than 150 were still outstanding.The disputed licences are mainly for small vessels operating six to 12 nautical miles from UK shores and in the waters surrounding Jersey and Guernsey.A Downing Street spokesman said the UK government was “disappointed by threats of protest activity”.They added: “It will be a matter for the French to ensure that there are no illegal actions and that trade is not affected. We continue to monitor the situation closely.”
64  The deaths of 27 migrants in the frigid waters of the Channel as they sought to reach the UK from France in a small boat on Wednesday have forced the two governments to set aside their post-Brexit disagreements to tackle the crisis.Yet the solutions they advocate, centred on a stronger security response, might not be enough to stem the surge of migrants heading for the UK, analysts say.Following the tragedy, France’s prime minister Jean Castex said the problem needed to be “dealt with at the intergovernmental and European levels”. In Downing Street, while UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the French efforts “haven’t been enough”, a senior diplomatic adviser insisted that the UK and France needed “to be working together on the bigger geopolitical and security challenges we face”.The drownings have underlined the immense difficulty for both governments to come to grips with a long-running crisis. While Paris and London have co-operated for decades to address the flow of asylum seekers from the Middle East and Africa seeking to reach the English shores from northern France, relations have been fraught since Brexit.“This [disaster] was bound to happen one day,” said demographer and economist Gérard-François Dumont.Johnson and Emmanuel Macron, president of France, have vowed to focus on traffickers. To do so, Macron said there was a need to co-operate not only with the UK, but also with EU neighbours including Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, because the migrants travel through those countries with the help of criminal gangs of people smugglers on the way to Calais, Dunkirk and their dangerous trips across the Channel. The majority of migrants attempting to cross the Channel enter France just a “few hours before they attempt their crossing,” Castex noted.France has invited the UK, Belgian, German and Dutch ministers responsible for immigration, and the European Commission, to Calais on Sunday to discuss how to bolster “the fight against the people-trafficking networks that exploit the flow of migrants”, said Castex.France says it has held 1,500 people-traffickers this year, including five after the latest incident. But Dumont said there was more to be done by Paris to tackle an international criminal business with annual turnover of billions of euros, with bosses based across the world — in places where they are “untouchable”, such as northern Cyprus — and an ability to adapt to government responses.One reason for the surge in the number of Channel crossings by boat is that the British and French authorities had increased security at ports and the entrance to the Channel Tunnel.Dumont suggested that one way to reduce the number of illegal crossings would be to offer those tempted to emigrate the possibility to apply for asylum remotely, before their perilous journeys.“We know the security approach doesn’t work because it didn’t work in the Mediterranean,” said Heather Grabbe, director of the Open Society European Policy Institute, referring to the flow of migrants in small boats to southern Europe from the north African coast. “The Med became a graveyard that damaged everyone’s integrity.”What was needed, she said, was “a properly functioning system for those who need asylum, and legal routes for those coming for economic reasons”, an area where the EU had failed as badly as the UK even though it was essential to be able to manage consistent pressure for inward migration. “We’ve got millions of refugees around [the edge of] Europe, stuck in Turkey for example.”Brexit has led the UK to leave the so-called “Dublin regulation” — under which asylum seekers are supposed to apply in the first EU country they enter, a provision that legitimised London’s requests for France and other EU members to process their applications. But even if the UK were to rejoin, it might not make a big difference. “The Dublin accords don’t work,” said Dumont.For the time being, however, UK and European politicians are not inclined to reform asylum systems designed decades ago for smaller migration flows. Instead, under pressure from growing anti-immigrant public sentiment, they are set to focus on security reinforcements.In France and the UK, there are also calls to scrap or renegotiate the 2003 Le Touquet bilateral accords under which border checks by both countries are carried out in one location at the point of departure rather than on each side of Channel — which means that the frontier for those leaving France is policed by French officers for the UK.However, one UK minister, who spoke under the condition of anonymity, said there was no appetite for changing the Le Touquet accord or rejoining the Dublin convention. “We’ve made our sovereign choice with Brexit on these treaties, we aren’t revisiting them,” the minister said.Some in the Johnson government think that a longer term answer may be to examine articles three and eight of the Human Rights Act that one Home Office insider said “makes deportations very difficult”. The UK minister added the UK’s membership to the European Convention on Human Rights could be debated. “In the longer term, (leaving the ECHR) may be part of the solution.”
65  The British army is to base hundreds of armoured vehicles in Germany, just over a year after marking its official withdrawal from the country, in a move designed to help bolster Nato as tensions with Moscow over Ukraine remain high.Under plans described as a “radical” restructuring of British land forces, the UK government announced on Thursday that a Nato base at Sennelager, near the German city of Paderborn, would become one of three new “regional land hubs” for the British army, alongside Oman and Kenya.The move represents a U-turn just over a year after the UK ended a permanent military presence on German soil that had been maintained since the end of the second world war. The closure of the last British army military headquarters in Bielefeld last February was the culmination of a decade-long withdrawal of 20,000 British service personnel from the country.“We are putting a substantial number of our armoured vehicles forward in order to be able to move more quickly should they be required anywhere on the continental [European] land mass,” Lieutenant General Ralph Wooddisse, commander field army, said.One government official would not be drawn on exact numbers but said the plans envisaged basing “hundreds” of tanks and armoured vehicles at Sennelager.The decision comes with Nato allies becoming increasingly concerned that Moscow is planning an invasion of Ukraine. Kyiv has said Russia has massed as many as 114,000 troops to the north, east, and south of the Donbas, a mostly Russian-speaking region where Russian-backed separatists have fought government forces since a pro-western revolution in Ukraine in 2014.Earlier this year, US President Joe Biden halted plans by his predecessor Donald Trump to withdraw thousands of US troops from Germany.The plans to send British armour back to Germany form part of an overhaul of the army described as the most “radical” transformation in more than 20 years.“We cannot afford to be slave to sentiment,” UK defence secretary Ben Wallace said, as he announced troops numbers would be cut by 9,000 troops to just 73,000 over the next four years — the smallest the army has been in centuries.The cuts will also see 33 army bases closed around Britain, including the Alanbrooke Barracks in North Yorkshire. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson had promised during the 2019 election campaign that a Conservative government would “not be cutting our armed services in any form”.Tobias Ellwood, the Tory MP and former army officer who chairs the House of Commons defence select committee, criticised the cuts. “Our world is becoming more dangerous, more complex. This is not the time to cut the defence budget or reduce our tanks, our armoured fighting vehicles and our troop numbers as we are doing,” he said.But Wallace insisted the restructuring was designed “to transform the army into a more agile, integrated, lethal, expeditionary force”. The army would be “leaner but more productive”, he added, as he confirmed plans for a new 1,200-strong “Ranger regiment” modelled on the US army’s elite Green Berets.The regiment will be made up of four battalions, which will embed with foreign forces and focus on counter-insurgency operations in regions such as east Africa. Wallace said this would mean more personnel are deployed around the world for longer.Wallace said there would also be a larger proportion of troops based in each of the devolved nations.
66  For months Germany’s Greens have pushed for a major rethink of their country’s foreign policy. Now they have the chance to spell out exactly what changes they have in mind.For the first time in 16 years the Greens will take charge of the foreign ministry under a coalition deal reached this week with the Social Democrats and liberals that could have big implications for partners and adversaries alike. Relations with China and Russia in particular could be set for a bumpy ride.The Greens announced late on Thursday that the job of foreign minister would go to Annalena Baerbock, the Green co-leader, who has argued strongly for a foreign policy “guided by human rights and values”.That could be read as a veiled attack on Angela Merkel, who will retire from politics next month after 16 years as chancellor. The Greens have long argued that Merkel placed Germany’s commercial interests ahead of defending western values such as the rule of law and democracy.The Greens viewed the longtime chancellor as too soft on China, failing to speak out strongly enough on abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong. She pursued sanctions on Russia over Crimea but also backed the Nord Stream 2 pipeline carrying Russian gas directly to Germany — a project that critics said would hurt Ukraine and expand the Kremlin’s grip on EU energy markets.“We have to stop [equating] German interests with German economic interests,” said Franziska Brantner, the Greens’ spokeswoman on Europe, at a conference on foreign policy this week. “We as Germans really have to change course. If we continue, we will pay a very heavy price.”The coalition agreement suggests the foreign policy stance may change.“The language on China is the strongest ever to appear in a German coalition agreement,” said Noah Barkin of Rhodium Group, a consultancy. “The readiness to touch on China’s red lines, including Taiwan, Xinjiang and Hong Kong shows how much the German debate has evolved in recent years.”The agreement says China is a potential partner, but also a competitor and systemic rival. Germany expects Beijing to play a “responsible role for peace and stability in its neighbourhood”, and any change to Taiwan’s status must take place “peacefully and with mutual consent”. Territorial disputes in the South China Sea must be resolved “on the basis of international maritime law”.Crucially, the deal says, Germany will closely co-ordinate China policy with the US and “work together with like-minded countries to reduce strategic dependencies”.Barkin said: “There is a lot of nervousness among Chinese diplomats around Merkel’s departure and the entry of the Greens into the government.They know that if the new government adopts a harder line, Europe will follow.”The rhetoric on Russia, too, is tough. “They are no longer dreaming about the Russia we wish we had, the Russia that lies just beyond the horizon,” said Jana Puglierin, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “They have a much more clear-eyed and realistic view.”The partners call on Russia to “immediately stop” trying to destabilise Ukraine and criticised the Kremlin’s crackdown on civil rights at home. Berlin is prepared to have a “constructive dialogue” with Moscow but will be guided by the interests of its eastern European neighbours and take into account the “perceived threats” they face from Russia.While taking east Europeans’ concerns about Moscow seriously, the coalition partners signalled they would pursue Hungary and Poland more aggressively over their rule of law violations — another Green priority. In the coalition deal they call on the European Commission to “use and enforce the existing rule of law mechanisms more strictly and promptly”.Merkel always prided herself on the bridges she built between Germany and former Warsaw Pact countries such as Hungary. “But if we have a bridge to nowhere, how does that help anyone?” said Brantner. “We have to be tougher on the rule of law, while at the same time accepting the east Europeans’. valid concerns vis-à-vis Putin.”There is plenty of scepticism in Germany and abroad about a new, green-tinged foreign policy. Conservatives have questioned whether Baerbock, who has no government experience, will hold her own against the likes of Vladimir Putin and Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Observers have also questioned how much power a Baerbock-led foreign ministry will really have, in a system where the chancellery tends to have the ultimate say over foreign policy. That is a sharp contrast to the days of Joschka Fischer, who was the only other Green to occupy the post and famously supported a German military role in the Kosovo war in the late 1990s.“Merkel dealt with all the big foreign policy portfolios herself,” said Puglierin. Baerbock will try to bring back competences to the foreign ministry, “but it won’t be easy”. “The Putins, Bidens and Xis will want to talk to the chancellor directly, and not her,” she added.
67  Hungary’s government on Thursday said it expected the US to try to interfere in elections next year in an effort to unseat premier Viktor Orban’s rightwing populist Fidesz party, adding Washington held a grudge against Budapest for its close ties to former President Donald Trump.Foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said that he expected Washington to deploy the Magnitsky Act, which can be used to impose sanctions and other measures against foreign nationals for corruption or human rights abuses, before the central European country’s general election next April.Fidesz faces its toughest challenge yet as Orban runs for a fourth successive mandate in elections next year. Szijjarto said Budapest would fend off attempts to defeat the government.“We don’t live on the Moon. We live in central Europe. Of course there will be attempts,” he said. “We have already detected preparations.I want to reassure Hungarians that all relevant institutions are doing their jobs to fend off external interference attempts in the elections.”The US left Hungary out of its planned Democracy Summit, an international conference next month with 110 nations, a move that observers say reflects Budapest’s reputation for eroding democratic principles and human rights and failure to tackle corruption.Hungary was alone in the EU to be snubbed, which Szijjarto said was “disrespectful”.The US state department said on its website: “Leaders will be encouraged to announce.domestic and international initiatives that counter authoritarianism, combat corruption and promote respect for human rights.”Hungary has fallen foul of all of those points in recent years, western officials and critics contend, which led to a cooling of relations with the US as well as the EU. Brussels has threatened to withhold billions of euros to get Orban to respect democratic standards.Washington denied there were plans to interfere with the 2022 vote.“There is no basis to these claims,” a state department spokesperson told the Financial Times on Friday. “The US has, and will continue, to respect Hungary’s sovereignty and democratic institutions.“As an important part of our bilateral agenda, we continue to press our Hungarian counterparts when we have concerns about developments that erode space for independent media and civil society, curtailed LGBTQI+ rights, and undermined judicial independence.”As Hungary covets close ties with Russia and China, President Joe Biden has yet to send an ambassador to Budapest nearly a year into his administration.“Hungarian-American relations were at their peak during the Trump Presidency,” Szijjarto told the FT when asked about the snub at a press briefing.“We have a great deal of respect for the former president, a respect that is mutual. We give the same respect to every elected US president — regardless of what we get in return — but it is clear that those who were on friendly terms with Donald Trump were not invited.”Washington deployed Magnitsky sanctions against several Bulgarian individuals earlier this year just before elections there, which contributed to the fall of strongman premier Boyko Borisov.The American actions were a “serious reinforcement of the Biden administration’s assessment of Orban’s anti-western and anti-EU policies over the last 11 years”, said Eurasia Group analyst Mujtaba Rahman. “It might even presage stronger pushback and criticism of Orban as he faces re-election next year. The US is close to the end of its tether with Orban’s continual cosying up and double games with Russia, China and other authoritarian regimes.”Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton put Hungary on a par with Russia and Turkey and compared the leaders of those countries to Trump.“Trump and his enablers and those who invaded and attacked our Capitol [in January 2021], they don’t like the world we’re living in and they have that in common with autocratic leaders from Russia to Turkey, from Hungary to Brazil, and so many other places,” Clinton told MSNBC on Wednesday.Hungary’s Szijjarto said Clinton’s remarks about the Democracy Summit proved that “the event has a domestic political character, with invitations withheld from countries whose leaders had good ties with former President Donald Trump.We need nobody to judge the state of Hungarian democracy as if in a school exam.”This story has been updated to include a further response from the US state department
68  Net migration of EU nationals to the UK turned negative in 2020 after the number of Europeans leaving the country overtook that of those arriving, reversing the trend of previous years.About 94,000 more EU nationals left the UK than arrived there last year, marking a turnround in migration patterns since 2019, when 32,000 more people immigrated from the continent into Britain than emigrated.“This reduction in immigration is most likely to be because of a combination of the impact of both the coronavirus pandemic and Brexit,” stated the Office for National Statistics.About 147,000 European nationals left the UK in 2020, nearly three times the number who arrived the previous year, according to experimental data by ONS published on Thursday.The ONS data is “very much a back of the envelope estimate”, but “broadly plausible”, said Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at Oxford university.Sumption explained that the ONS figures did not include the large population of short-term migrants in the UK, who may have also left in large numbers.Jonathan Portes, professor of economics and public policy at King’s College in London, said net emigration of EU nationals was likely to be “considerably more than estimated by ONS”. He had previously calculated a larger exodus of EU nationals.Figures released separately on Thursday by the Home Office showed employers were more likely to hire workers from countries outside the EU, as cross-border recruitment picked up again in 2021.The department said 205,528 work-related visas were granted in the year to September, with the majority given to skilled workers from India, the Philippines, the US and Nigeria. It added that more than 40 per cent of successful visa applicants were from health and social care workers, double the share allocated to that sector in the year before the pandemic.Gerwyn Davies, adviser to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, a body representing HR professionals, said: “The abrupt halt in the supply of EU workers continues to cause shockwaves for employers across all sectors” and would add to hiring and wage pressures.The ONS provisional estimates show about 34,000 more people moved to the UK than left the UK in 2020, down from 271,000 in the previous year — by far the lowest figure since 2011 when comparable data was made available.Historically, the International Passenger Survey was the main source for estimating international migration to and from the UK, but that was suspended at the onset of the pandemic.Since then, the ONS has developed measures of international migration using administrative data and statistical modelling on which the latest statistics are based.“There is a high degree of uncertainty around them [the experimental data],” said the ONS.The ONS said the range of uncertainty for net migration for EU nationals was from minus 180,000 to minus 8,000.ONS population data, also released on Thursday showed that the EU-born population of the UK peaked at 3.6m in the year ending in June 2017 and has been falling following the Brexit referendum.Sumption recognised that figures confirmed the “general view” that there was a net outflow of EU nationals in 2020, while cautioning “there is a huge amount of uncertainty about exactly how big that outflow was”.
69  The grief over the drowning of 27 migrants crossing the Channel in a small boat to the UK is magnified by the knowledge that this disaster was all too predictable, and ought to have been preventable. Today’s poisonous politics of migration mean it often takes a tragedy to galvanise action. The hope is that this incident will finally trigger effective efforts to stem the flow of refugees risking their lives to travel from France to Britain. There is no guarantee. Yet failure will leave open the danger of further, and worse, calamities.Political finger-pointing by London and Paris serves little purpose. Both countries share responsibility for this week’s loss of 17 men, seven women — one pregnant — and three children. Britain’s efforts to deter asylum-seekers by creating an unwelcoming environment and helping to fund French patrols have failed. The number of migrants reaching Britain in small boats has tripled this year to 26,000. That reflects, in part, a success in choking off other routes, such as stowing away on lorries. It shows, however, that the determination to reach the UK is undimmed, and providing ever more business for people smugglers.France says it has made strenuous efforts to curb crossings and clamp down on criminal gangs. Reports of French officers looking on while overloaded inflatables set sail suggest not all personnel are so committed. France has a moral responsibility to people on its soil not to let them be exploited and board unsafe boats that may carry them to their death.Both countries are guilty, too, of allowing differences — over Brexit, fishing rights, or the Australia-UK-US security pact that excluded Paris — to stand in the way of co-operation. Real progress in tackling the cross-Channel migrant problem relies on setting aside such divisions. Britain’s Conservative government in particular — though it has genuine concerns over post-Brexit trade arrangements with Northern Ireland — should refrain from picking fights with the EU and with France as an apparent political stratagem.A two-pronged approach is then needed. The first is to create safe, legal channels for people to claim asylum in Britain. Migrants cannot now do so unless they are already in the UK, but have no route to arrive except on small boats. Boris Johnson’s government is under pressure from rightwing populists such as former Ukip leader Nigel Farage to take a hardline approach. Yet setting up legal corridors and streamlined processes would enable it to appear tough on immigration while still allowing a more humane and effective way of discouraging use of boats and the danger to life this creates.The government could point to the fact that, while Channel crossings contributed to an 18 per cent rise in UK asylum applications to 37,562 in the year to September, this is less than half the peak of two decades ago. It is a fraction of France’s 87,180 and Germany’s 113,625 in the year to June.Some migrants, fearing rejection or seeking to circumvent processing, will still plump for illegal routes. The second prong must therefore be more concerted and co-ordinated efforts to curb trafficking — not just between the UK and France, but the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. Britain will also need to seek to regain the right to return asylum seekers to the first EU country they reached, lost after Brexit.Preventable human tragedies can provide a moment for politicians of stature to confront the failures, divisions and prejudices that may have allowed them to happen. The UK’s Johnson and French president Emmanuel Macron have an opportunity to show that they, too, can rise to such a challenge.Letter in response to this editorial:Britain has to defy its populists to solve the migration issue / From Jim Cashman, Tonbridge, Kent, UK
70  The slogan ‘Get Brexit Done’ was a powerful vote-winner in 2019 because it promised closure to the public after three long years of acrimonious and exhausting national feuding.Those three words — and the related promise to ‘Unleash Britain’s Potential’ — were on the front cover of the Tory party manifesto, featuring a picture of Boris Johnson giving the nation a thumbs up. The message was clear: time to move onwards and upwards.But this week, as we approach the end of the first year of the UK’s life outside the EU single market, it has been hard to find much sense of the post-Brexit momentum that was promised two years ago.The Northern Ireland situation has come off the boil, but based on this week’s headlines is likely to remain a source of simmering tensions well into next year.The trade secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said it was “absolutely not” the government’s intention to trigger Article 16 before Christmas, and Maros Sefcovic, the EU’s Brexit negotiator, wearily confirmed talks are now likely to drag on into 2022.This is clearly better than a full-blown bust up, but as Lord David Frost has frequently himself said, resolving the disagreements over Northern Ireland is a necessary precursor to normalising relations with the EU. That still feels a long way off.And if proof were needed of the extent to which the Northern Ireland Protocol has infected EU-UK relations, it was evidenced by Germany’s new government coalition agreement specifically referencing the need to ensure “full compliance” from the UK with agreements it had signed.But there was also a much longer-term warning from Frost about the government’s determination not to dilute its Brexit vision. This is despite pressure from companies facing the problems caused by erecting high levels of non-tariff barriers with the advanced economy trading bloc on Britain’s doorstep.The barriers are high. The talk of a ‘zero tariff, zero quota’ free trade agreement may have conjured the notion of ‘free-flowing’ trade, but the reality (as this excellent and readable paper by Catherine Barnard and Emilija Leinarte of Cambridge university law faculty explains) is much closer to “WTO rules” or “no deal” than was popularly understood.As they observe, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) is spectacularly unambitious. It contains almost nothing on services, mutual recognition of each others’ standards, mobility provisions for young people and skilled workers, or an agreement on agrifood products that create a fair proportion of headaches at the border.“The result is that the TCA offers little more in terms of eliminating technical barriers to trade than the parties would have been subject to under the WTO rules in case of a ‘no deal’ situation,” they write.This always was a big step for any government to take — the Office for Budget Responsibility continues to forecast that Brexit will cause a 4 per cent long-term hit to UK gross domestic product (twice that of the pandemic) — but forecasts are only forecasts, so in the meantime the government will continue to conjure a more optimistic vision for the future.In his speech to the Margaret Thatcher Conference on Trade this week Frost insisted the UK was right to reject a softer version of Brexit that left the UK “more closely in the EU’s orbit”. He then appeared to squash hopes some in the business world harbour that a resolution in Northern Ireland could kick start a process of addressing some of the deficiencies in the UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.“As far as I can tell, many people.would like to inch us back to that situation over time. That can’t be right,” he said.So there will be no backsliding on Brexit. Instead Frost promised to focus on domestic innovation, a more enabling regulatory environment, and forging global trade deals while also, in his own words, overcoming “the forces of entropy, of laziness, of vested interest”.Recalling Margaret Thatcher’s vision of “a do-it-yourself nation, a get-up-and-go Britain”, Frost said the UK appeared to have lost that spirit during the days of EU membership. But, he said: “Brexit is bringing it back”. This is a seductive narrative for Brexiters. It was one, interestingly, that Johnson reverted to during his infamous ‘Peppa Pig’ speech to the CBI which opened with a paean of praise to the “kitchen appliance and hairdryer makers” who were asked to try to reinvent medical ventilators in the “dark days” of the pandemic. And yet in reality, the scheme was far better at delivering quick headlines than it was ventilators.At ground level, the regulatory autonomy and can-do spirit that Frost and Johnson extol in their speeches gets a much more mixed reception from business, as previous editions of Britain after Brexit have explored, from chemical manufacturers to medical device makers.This week it was the building industry (key to delivering the net zero and levelling-up agendas) which wrote to warn the government over the consequences of its plans to introduce the UKCA quality mark to duplicate the EU’s CE mark.As Peter Caplehorn, chief executive of the Construction Products Association, said, lack of UK bodies able to test for the UK standards (in windows, glass, sealants etc) meant that companies were spending millions in the short term but in the long term “our concern is UKCA will stifle innovation, reduce product ranges and [put] upward pressure on costs over time”.The drinks industry also wrote in to warn that labour and truck driver shortages, driven in part by Brexit, were pushing up delivery times fivefold from three to 15 days, and urged the government to extend its Christmas visa scheme to allow in more lorry drivers.Perhaps in the mind of the government these complaints — usually batted away as a necessary part of “taking back control” — are simply those of “vested interests”, or too granular to bother with.But for businesses on the ground, particularly small businesses with tight margins and limited personnel, the ‘can-do spirit’ that Frost says Brexit is revitalising, is having to expend a lot of its energy battling supply-side headwinds that are, at the very least, not helped by a decision to erect maximum barriers with the EU.It is to be expected that politicians campaign on vision rather than reality, but come the next general election Boris Johnson (or whomever) will still need voters to feel that this government did indeed work to “Unleash Britain’s Potential”, rather than stifle it.The Johnson government — and Frost again in his speech to the Thatcher conference — has consistently pointed to the value of recovering control over international trade policy as a key benefit of Brexit.This is the case despite the fact that, as was pointed out at an international trade select committee hearing this week, the long term upsides to UK GDP of doing trade deals are tiny. In the case of New Zealand and Australia estimates come in at around 0.01 or 0.02 per cent by the government’s own estimates.Those gains clearly do little to offset the negative hit from erecting such substantial trade barriers with Europe — even if the OBR forecast of a long-run hit of 4 per cent turns out to be overstated.One way of trying to screen out the effects of Covid-19 and other factors is to measure UK trade against a ‘doppelgänger’ UK that had not exited the EU, built around modelling the trade performance of other advanced economies such as the US, Germany, Greece, New Zealand and Sweden.This is what has generated the above chart from John Springford at the Centre for European Reform (CER) whose work was referenced by the OBR in its October update.Here he shares the latest iteration of the model for Britain after Brexit readers. It found that in September 2021, leaving the EU’s single market and customs union had reduced goods trade between the UK and the world by £8.5bn or 11.2 per cent.Monthly trade data is quite volatile, but since May 2021 the model has shown a hit to UK trade of between 11 and 16 per cent, which is similar to pre-Brexit forecasts from the OBR and the Theresa May government.Springford says that translating that ‘hit’ to trade into precise estimates of impact on GDP per capita (a key measure of living standards) is an imprecise science. The forecasts range from 2 to 9 per cent reduction in GDP compared to a UK that stayed in the EU.Before the pandemic, the CER estimated that the effects of depreciation of sterling and foregone consumption and investment had reduced GDP by 1 to 3 per cent. Add the effect of reduced trade after a single market exit on top of that figure and, Springford says, there is “good reason to fear” that the OBR estimate of a 4-5 per cent smaller economy is “about right”. Until now, these economic consequences have been largely met with a shrug by voters who were indeed relieved to have “got Brexit done” and then been consumed by dealing with the pandemic. It is also true that since no one lives in Springford’s “doppelgänger” UK most people don’t miss the economy they could, theoretically, have enjoyed.Regardless of whether anyone connects economic issues with Brexit, Springford reckons that a 4-5 per cent is “a big deal” that has already hit tax revenues, causing chancellor Rishi Sunak to raise taxes more than he otherwise would.Whether or not voters attribute weaker economic performance to Brexit policy, the risk for this government is that a prolonged squeeze on living standards (driven in part by its choices on Brexit) will ultimately land at the PM’s door. Brexit may not seem to have caused the City of London a serious injury, but, Helen Thomas argues, it has led to a slow bleed. While early predictions of hundreds of thousands of job losses have proved overblown, change is happening, she says. And there are worrying times ahead.Whatever happened to Michel Barnier?

71  European Central Bank policymakers expect the central bank to raise its short-term inflation forecasts next month as uncertainty persists about how quickly it will need to respond to surging prices.The ECB has consistently underestimated how fast eurozone inflation would rise this year as the economy rebounded from the coronavirus pandemic. Members of the central bank’s governing council said they expected it to raise its 2022 forecast again in December, according to the minutes of its October meeting, published on Thursday.But council members agreed there was “elevated” uncertainty over the outlook for price growth in 2023 and 2024, which is one of the main yardsticks that the central bank will use to calibrate bond purchases and interest rates next year.They believe this means they should maintain “optionality” on their future bond purchases for as long as possible, so they can respond if inflation either drops back below their target or stays above.“While an increase in the upside risks to inflation had to be acknowledged, it was deemed important for the governing council to avoid an overreaction as well as unwarranted inaction, and to keep sufficient optionality in calibrating its monetary policy measures to address all inflation scenarios that might unfold,” it said.Eurozone inflation hit a 13-year high of 4.1 per cent in October, well above the ECB’s 2 per cent target, prompting some investors to bet that the ECB would raise rates next year.But the ECB council agreed last month that many of the factors driving inflation higher this year — including soaring energy prices and supply chain bottlenecks — were likely to fade next year, albeit more slowly than it recently predicted.“Members widely agreed on the expected hump-shaped pattern in the shorter-term inflation outlook,” it said.The ECB is increasingly diverging from other major central banks, such as the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England, which have responded to the recent surge in inflation by promising to tighten policy.December’s ECB meeting is being keenly anticipated by investors. Most expect the central bank to decide that its €1.85tn bond-buying programme, which it launched last year in response to the pandemic, will stop new purchases in March 2022.However, the central bank is widely expected to step up its longer-standing asset purchase programme to soften the impact of the cut to its stimulus.Some more conservative council members have argued that the ECB should be prepared to halt its purchases of new bonds quite quickly next year if inflation does not fall as expected.However, others have urged patience, pointing out that there have been few signs of wage increases spiralling upwards.Council members concluded last month that they “had to be patient in the light of the elevated uncertainty,” the ECB said. “It was seen as important that the governing council should keep sufficient optionality to allow for future monetary policy actions.”Jacob Nell, head of European economics at Morgan Stanley, said the minutes, combined with the risks from recent coronavirus lockdowns in several European countries, indicated the ECB was likely to opt for “a smooth reduction in purchases, and maintaining optionality” at its December meeting.Fabio Balboni, senior economist at HSBC, said: “With widening divisions within the governing council and huge uncertainties about the medium-term inflation outlook it might be difficult for the ECB to commit to further support for a long period of time.”
72  A surge of coronavirus cases in continental Europe has cast a shadow over the travel industry’s recovery, with Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary forecasting a “fraught period” over the next month.Covid cases and deaths are rising quickly across many countries in the region, and several, including Austria and Slovakia, have imposed short national lockdowns in an attempt to rein in infections.Concerns about a weak winter have hit travel stocks, with shares in easyJet, British Airways’ owner IAG and Europe’s largest hotel group Accor each down about 15 per cent over the past three weeks.O’Leary said it was “inevitable” that rising Covid cases would disrupt travel. “It looks like Europe is going to get very nervous again at the worst time of the year, when people are making their Christmas travel plans,” he said this week.The uncertainty could also weigh on early bookings for next summer, which tend to come in between Christmas and New Year, he added.Airlines have slightly pared back their flight schedules, and the number of scheduled seats in western Europe has fallen over the past three weeks, according to data from OAG.“European travel intentions have been affected by the rise in Covid cases across the continent, and by the lockdowns and announcements in many European countries,” said Axel Hefer, chief executive of Trivago.Hefer said there had been a 50 per cent decline in searches for domestic and international travel in Austria, and a 35 per cent fall in the Netherlands, where the government has introduced new restrictions on bars, restaurants and non-essential shops.Room occupancy in Amsterdam has fallen from 62 per cent in the last week of October to 41 per cent this week, and there have also been declines in Vienna and Munich, according to figures from STR, a hospitality data provider.There has been a fall in search interest for hotels in Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany, according to Expedia, the online travel booking company.While the disruption is a blow for companies still recovering from the damage inflicted earlier in the pandemic, the situation is still far better than before vaccines allowed the reopening of travel earlier this year.November is typically a quieter month for the industry, and airlines were still planning to raise capacity again going into the busier Christmas season, OAG said.Searches for flights so far this month have been 80 per cent higher than in the same month last year, according to travel bookings company Amadeus.Mark Simpson, an aviation analyst at Goodbody, said the current difficulties for airlines should not detract from the long-term recovery picture.“Nobody is buying the sector for Christmas prospects, they are buying for summer 2022 and 2023,” he said.“Airline stocks have derated as though they are facing last year’s risk, but I don’t see that. You have to keep the faith in what’s going to be some tough months to come.”
73  Spain’s chamber of deputies has approved the biggest budget in the country’s history after Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez won the support of a Catalan pro-independence party in return for a deal setting a quota for regional languages on digital platforms such as Netflix.The budget, which includes €27bn in EU recovery funds, was backed by an ample majority of 188 votes in the chamber on Thursday and now heads to the country’s Senate. It consolidates Sánchez’s hold on power at the same time as highlighting Spain’s fragmented politics.The agreement between the minority coalition government and the Catalan Republican Left, which also contained a promise not to renovate a police headquarters in Barcelona, was only part of a patchwork of budget deals with smaller parties.Other commitments included provisions for children’s television in the Basque language, help for victims of asbestos, incentives for employers offering a shorter working week and greater regulation of artificial intelligence.Máriam Martínez-Bascuñán, a political scientist at the Autonomous University of Madrid, said the budget had become a “bazaar”, where “everything is up for auction, rather than a negotiation based on the economic crisis caused by Covid or how to manage the [EU] funds”.But she added that it was a success for Sánchez, “given the fragmentation in parliament” where the coalition commands only 155 of 350 seats.She said that even if the government lacked the votes for a budget in the future, it could extend the 2022 budget for another year and therefore reach the end of its mandate in late 2023.The Catalan Left, whose 13 deputies provide crucial support for the government despite the party’s pro-independence stance, hailed the deal to make companies such as Netflix offer at least 6 per cent of their programming in the Catalan, Basque or Galician languages.An EU directive already obliges such platforms to provide a “30 per cent share of European content in their catalogues”.Gabriel Rufián, a leading Catalan Left MP, also praised the government’s commitment not to renovate a police headquarters in central Barcelona, which he said should become a museum commemorating its role as a “centre of torture” during the fascist rule of Francisco Franco who died in 1975.The budget was also backed by EH Bildu, a far-left Basque secessionist party led by Arnaldo Otegi, a former member of the disbanded terrorist group Eta.Pablo Casado, leader of the main opposition People’s party, said the deal with Bildu would “freeze the blood” of Eta victims and showed that Spain’s ruling Socialists had “lost their democratic soul”.“With the exception of the right, which always says no to everything.the rest of the parties in the chamber have made an effort to further understanding,” said María Jesús Montero, Spain’s budget minister.The use of EU funds in next year’s budget is at the heart of the Socialist-led government’s economic and political strategy after a year in which its use of the resources has fallen below expectations, with Spain lagging behind the rest of the bloc in recovering from the pandemic.According to a government budget outline, €3.2bn of the EU funds will go to industrial policy next year, €2.8bn to energy efficiency for buildings, €2.2bn to green transport systems and €2.1bn in aid for small and medium enterprises.The government said it would be carrying out more than €40bn in investments overall — the biggest in Spanish history — out of a total central government budget of €196bn. When social security and transfers to regional authorities are included, government spending rises to €459bn.
74  The National Securities Market Commission responded to Andrés Iniesta, who scored the winning goal in Spain’s 2010 World Cup victory, after he posted on Twitter pictures of himself apparently using the Binance platform.The watchdog’s tweet, sent late on Wednesday, reminded Iniesta that “cryptoassets, as non-regulated products, have some relevant risks”. The regulator told the Financial Times it was worried about sportspeople and other “influencers” promoting cryptocurrencies to audiences that did not necessarily understand how the market worked or what regulations did — or did not — apply. The Spanish watchdog’s intervention comes as promotions of crypto exchanges and tokens in sport have boomed. Singapore-headquartered cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com last week agreed to pay $700m for 20-year naming rights at the Los Angeles arena that is home to the championship Lakers basketball team. Estoy aprendiendo cómo empezar con las criptomonedas con @BinanceES #BinanceForAllI’m learning how to get started with crypto with @binance #BinanceForAll commission urged celebrities and influencers to “take care” about recommending “investment in unregulated products that have additional risks to [the] public”.“All this led us last night to say to Iniesta, whom we admire and who has brought us great joy, please, before recommending this, tell your followers of the risks; this is also your responsibility,” the watchdog said. Rakuten — which owns Vissel Kobe, the Japanese club for which Iniesta plays — owns a crypto exchange itself. Representatives for Iniesta did not immediately respond to requests for comment.For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT with one clickIn reports released on Thursday, Spain’s Association of Financial Users, a consumer protection non-profit, estimated on the basis of a survey that more than 4.4m Spaniards had invested in cryptocurrencies and that 41 per cent of them considered cryptocurrencies to be safe.Iniesta is not the only well-known footballer to have posted an endorsement for Binance. Raúl Jiménez, who plays for Premier League club Wolverhampton Wanderers, Colombian player James Rodríguez and Atlético Madrid striker Luis Suárez all posted images of themselves featuring Binance earlier this month under the #BinanceForAll hashtag. The crypto exchange referred to the three sport stars in a post last week promoting a social media contest: “Get creative with @jamesdrodriguez, @LuisSuarez9, @Raul_Jimenez9 on #Binance and you could win,” the group’s main account said on Twitter. The three footballers have a combined 39m followers on Twitter. Representatives for Jiménez, Rodríguez and Suárez did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Binance said: “We very much agree with the sentiment of the Spanish regulator.”The Spanish regulator’s social media intervention echoes efforts by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority and other watchdogs to restrain influencers promoting crypto and warn particularly younger investors about the risks of digital assets. The UK regulator has launched an £11m online marketing campaign, using TikTok adverts and a partnership with Olympic BMX gold champion Charlotte Worthington, to warn younger investors about risky investments. “This is a target audience that we are concerned that we are not reaching,” Sarah Pritchard, FCA’s executive director of markets, said last month. “We are not communicating via the mechanism that they use and that influences them.”The Spanish securities commission said the country’s government had asked it to regulate crypto advertising while the EU awaited bloc-wide regulations for crypto as a whole. But the commission has yet to formally take on these powers as the Spanish regulations on advertising have yet to take effect.“We realise we are not going to reach the new audience — young people or those between 30 and 45 — with press releases and communiqués so we are making an effort to use other channels, formats, even a different kind of language,” the commission said.Scoreboard is the Financial Times’ new must-read weekly briefing on the business of sport, where you’ll find the best analysis of financial issues affecting clubs, franchises, owners, investors and media groups across the global industry. 
75  The UK and French authorities on Thursday were scrambling to combat small-boat migration across the Channel after 27 people drowned off Dunkirk on Wednesday.French president Emmanuel Macron has called for accelerated attempts by France, the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany to shut down people-trafficking operations across Europe in the aftermath of the disaster, with British and French officials saying that some people looking to reach the UK arrive on the French coast by road from abroad and set off across the Channel within hours.France will invite the UK, Belgian, German and Dutch ministers responsible for immigration, and the European Commission, to an international meeting in Calais on Sunday to discuss the crisis, French prime minister Jean Castex said on Thursday.“This meeting should allow us to define the ways and means of reinforcing police, judicial and humanitarian co-operation to help the struggle against the people-trafficking networks that exploit the flow of migrants,” he added in a statement.The French authorities announced they had arrested five people on suspicion of people smuggling and aggravated involuntary manslaughter in connection with the deaths on Wednesday.Speaking to RTL radio on Thursday morning, Gérald Darmanin, France’s interior minister, said that France had detained 1,500 people traffickers since the beginning of the year. “The people smuggler we arrested last night, for example, had a German-registered car and had bought his inflatable boats in Germany,” he added.Darmanin added that for a few thousand euros, traffickers were offering people “El Dorado” in England.He is due to discuss how best to reduce the numbers of people making the dangerous crossing with Priti Patel, UK home secretary, later on Thursday.Kevin Foster, UK immigration minister, told the BBC’s Today programme it was vital for Britain and France to work together on resolving the issues that have led to more than 27,000 people crossing the Channel in small boats this year.He added the UK had offered during last year’s talks on post-Brexit relations with the EU to sign a bilateral deal with France to return asylum seekers who had passed through safe countries before reaching the UK but had been rebuffed.“We cannot force our partners to reach an agreement,” he said.French officials said the 27 who died on Wednesday comprised 17 men, seven women and three children. The two known survivors, who are recovering from serious hypothermia, are an Iraqi and a Somali. The incident is by far the worst single tragedy in the Channel since small-boat migration became a significant means of making the crossing from France to the UK in late 2018.Castex is to discuss the cross-Channel migrant crisis with his ministers of interior, justice, defence, maritime affairs, transport and foreign and European affairs on Thursday.UK ministers are expected to press the French to agree to joint patrols on French beaches to combat the people smuggling.Foster told the BBC: “What we’re keen to do is look at how we can support French law enforcement in tackling the situation in the Pas-de-Calais.”He pointed out that a British helicopter had assisted over French waters in Wednesday’s search and rescue operation.While such proposals have previously fallen foul of concerns about French sovereignty, Bruno Bonnell, a member of France’s National Assembly for Macron’s La République en Marche party, told Today he would support joint patrols.Immigration figures released by the UK’s Home Office on Thursday showed that cross-Channel crossings were driving an increase in asylum applications. Between July and September there were 15,104 applications, 60 per cent up on the same quarter in 2020. In the year to September, there were 37,562 asylum applications — 18 per cent up on the year to September 2020.The rise was attributed to the arrival of people in small boats, nearly all of whom claim asylum, and the reopening of international travel.But even with the increase, the number of asylum applications received by the UK remains well below other European countries. In the year to June, Germany received 113,625 applications and France received 87,180.
76  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
77  The winners of Germany’s September election have reached a coalition agreement that marks a significant change in political direction of Europe’s largest economy after 16 years of Christian Democratic-led coalitions under Angela Merkel. It signals a change of pace: the coalition agreement shows that the social democratic SPD, the Greens, and the liberal FDP are aiming higher than their lowest common denominator.The three parties have common values in two important areas. One is social liberalism, expressed in a series of commitments ranging from more permissive drugs policy to easier access to citizenship. The other is a strong commitment to much more public and private investment in a decarbonised and digital economy.If the incoming “traffic light coalition” makes good on its ambitions, it could inject a dose of much-needed dynamism into both German and European policymaking, and do so in line with the green and digital priorities adopted by the EU and most of its member states. But successful coalition talks do not guarantee an easy cohabitation in office.On the face of it, the investment needed to restructure the German economy could be stifled by the maintenance of constitutional borrowing limits and a promise not to raise the overall tax burden. These were demanded by the FDP, whose leader Christian Lindner will hold the purse strings as finance minister. The other two parties have secured commitments to social spending, further tying up fiscal resources.But an understanding has clearly been reached to make it easier for the government to borrow to invest, including special funds outside the main budget, more resources for the state investment bank, and a re-evaluation of the technical calculations of the fiscal rules.Flexibility can be hoped for at the European level too. As the SPD’s Olaf Scholz moves from the finance ministry to the chancellery as chief of a traffic light government, he brings with him experience of the EU’s thorniest economic and financial reforms. The agreement envisions an EU-wide reinsurance scheme for deposit guarantees, and is open to reforms of the bloc’s stability and growth pact “to strengthen its effectiveness in the face of the challenges of the time”.The advantage of Germany’s long-winded coalition talks is that much of the difficult bargaining has now been done. But it remains to be seen how much will survive the challenges of office, not least an alarming fourth wave of Covid-19 infections and deaths that is sweeping across the country.There are real incompatibilities between the three parties’ electorates, in particular the FDP and the other two. Clever ways to get around the spirit of the fiscal rules may alienate liberal voters. Green and liberal foreign policy thinking is visible in a programme whose tone on Russia, China, and the rule of law is sharper than what the rest of Europe had learnt to expect from Berlin under Merkel. But in practice they will face resistance from the SPD, which was after all part of the outgoing government. Inevitably some voters will feel betrayed.Merkel’s political longevity and style often produced foot-dragging when both domestic and EU-level challenges required a willingness to push change. The election showed her CDU party looking tired from a long period in government; it can benefit from a spell in opposition. If the promise of renewal that this programme offers is for real, German politics, the country’s economy, and Europe could all benefit.
78  Twenty-seven people have died during an attempt to cross the English Channel from France in the worst accident in a surge of clandestine small-boat crossings that have frayed relations between French and British authorities.French officials said they were alerted to the disaster by the crew of a fishing boat who saw people in the sea in the Dover-Calais strait.Though President Emmanuel Macron and French interior minister Gérald Darmanin said they believed the death toll was 31 on Wednesday evening, this was reduced to 27 overnight, according to a report given by the interior ministry to the AFP news agency.Speaking outside a Calais hospital on Wednesday evening, Darmanin said that among the dead were five women and a girl. “It was an extremely frail boat, and when the rescuers arrived the boat had deflated like an inflatable garden pool.”He added that four smugglers had been arrested who “we suspect may be directly related to this journey”.Macron and UK prime minister Boris Johnson had a conversation late on Wednesday night in which the French president underlined their shared responsibility to deal with the increasing number of perilous border crossings made by displaced people, according to a statement released by the Elysée Palace overnight.Macron told Johnson he “expected the British to co-operate fully and refrain from instrumentalising a dramatic situation for political ends” and “insisted on the need to act with dignity, respect and in a spirit of co-operation when it comes to human lives”, according to the communiqué.AFP reported that prosecutors in Dunkirk had launched an inquiry into possible offences of people smuggling and aggravated involuntary manslaughter. “I want to say here that those primarily responsible for this deplorable situation are the smugglers,” Darmanin said.Johnson said he was “shocked, appalled and deeply saddened” at the deaths and said efforts to stop the crossings “had not been enough”.He added that people smugglers were “getting away with murder” and the UK was eager to work with the French government to do more. “That is the offer we are making,” he said.Macron urged more co-operation between the EU and the UK to combat people-trafficking gangs.“France will not allow the Channel to become a cemetery,” he said. “Europe and its deep respect for humanity is in mourning.”Macron added there was a need to accelerate efforts to break up criminal gangs with the help of the UK, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands.Natacha Bouchart, the mayor of Calais, blamed Britain. “The British government is to blame,” she said. “I believe that Boris Johnson has, for the past year and a half, cynically chosen to blame France.”The UK and France have had bitter exchanges for years about the numbers of migrants, many from the Middle East and Afghanistan, seeking to reach the UK from France.London has accused Paris of failing to stem the flow of migrants from the French side of the Channel, while France has blamed the UK for its lax approach to migration and said that new arrivals were frequently able to work illegally in Britain.Tempers had cooled in recent days after a call between Darmanin and Priti Patel, UK home secretary, and the dismantling of a camp of hundreds of migrants near Dunkirk by French police.After Johnson had spoken to Macron on Wednesday evening, Downing Street said: “They agreed on the urgency of stepping up joint efforts to prevent these deadly crossings and to do everything possible to stop the gangs responsible for putting people’s lives at risk.“Both leaders were clear that today’s tragic loss of life was a stark reminder that it is vital to keep all options on the table to stop these lethal crossings and break the business model of the criminal gangs behind them.”The number of people to have claimed asylum in the UK after crossing the Channel in boats has reached 25,700 for this year so far, more than three times the 8,469 total for all of 2020.There have been numerous reports of individual deaths. French officials reported at the weekend that 31,500 migrants had left the French coast for England since the start of the year.Of those, 7,800 had been rescued and seven had died or disappeared. Decathlon, the sports and clothing retailer, said it had stopped selling kayaks in Dunkirk and Calais because they were being used for dangerous crossings.The French interior ministry this week said it was deploying €11m of new equipment, including all-terrain vehicles, fast boats and night vision sights, under its agreement with the UK to stop migrant crossings.Smugglers this year have started using larger inflatable boats, to fit more migrants into a single crossing. They have also begun launching from a wider range of beaches, sending migrants on longer, more dangerous crossings to evade the French authorities’ attempts to stop them.Jean-Marc Puissesseau, president and chair of the ports of Calais and Boulogne, said the UK and EU needed to work together to find a solution to migrant boat crossings.“All Europe and the UK, we must all try to find a solution because there will be more.”Small-boat migration has replaced previous clandestine methods of reaching the UK, such as hiding in trucks, since scrutiny on those routes has been stepped up. The previous worst single incident involved the drowning of four members of an Iranian Kurdish family off Calais in October last year.There were numerous small-boat crossings amid very calm weather in the Channel on Wednesday. Darmanin said that 250 people managed to cross the Channel on Wednesday, though 671 were stopped from taking the journey.
79  The wait is over. Germany has a new government, Olaf Scholz is set to become chancellor, Christian Lindner from the pro-business Free Democrats scoops up the finance ministry, Green leader Robert Habeck will be the minister for economy and climate, with co-leader Annalena Baerbock as foreign minister. I’ll unpack what the coalition agreement has to say on EU topics, including the banking union, rule of law and why the Greens got in a bit of a pickle over the future of European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen. We’ll also explore an ill-timed commission snipe at Italy’s draft budget and what it means for sensitive eurozone discussions on fiscal rules reform.The largest group in the European parliament, the centre-right European People’s party, meanwhile, selected Maltese MEP Roberta Metsola as its candidate for the leadership of the parliament in January.

This article is an on-site version of our Europe Express newsletter.  to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every weekday morningWith its 178 pages, the new German coalition agreement continues the tradition of lengthy pacts (the previous coalition accord was 175 pages long). On the content, the deal is also continuity rather than radical change.The most significant policy shifts from the previous coalition government led by Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats seem to be headline-grabbing measures such as the legalisation of cannabis for recreational use and the lowering of the voting age from 18 to 16. But on Europe, you’d be hard-pressed to detect huge differences. Here’s a look at what matters:Coal and cars: Meeting the climate targets in the Paris climate accord is “the highest priority”, reads the coalition agreement. If the outgoing government was lukewarm on phasing out combustion engines, the new government wants 15m electric cars on German roads by 2030. An exit from coal-powered energy plants and the closure of coal mines should also “ideally” happen by 2030.Carbon leakage: Germany will develop an industrial strategy linked up to the European Green Deal and wants to avoid carbon leakage. Even though the new government supports an EU-wide carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), it says the format for making importers pay could follow so-called Carbon Contracts for Difference, which the German government is likely to introduce for the country’s industrial suppliers.Club climate: Germany wants to use the EU and other international forums to create an “international climate club with a common minimum CO2 price and a common CO2 border adjustment”. Berlin will also introduce minimum quotas for climate-friendly products in its public procurements.Banking union: The three parties pledged to complete the EU’s banking union, including a European reinsurance system for national deposit guarantee schemes “where contributions are strictly differentiated based on risk”. But, in keeping with the traditional German position, “a full communitarisation of the deposit guarantee systems in Europe is not the goal”.No perma-fund: Despite the emphasis on investments for the twin green and digital transformation, the new German government takes a leaf from the old in insisting that the bloc’s €800bn post-pandemic borrowing spree is “limited in time and size”. Several countries including France have started toying with the idea of expanding the recovery fund and making it permanent.Rule of law: Poland and Hungary are not off the hook. The new German government will approve the commission’s recommendations on EU recovery plans only for countries where “preconditions such as an independent judiciary are met”.Frenemies with China: The new government continues a multiple-track approach to Beijing: co-operate wherever possible, insist on a level playing field and develop a German strategy for China that is part and parcel of EU’s own policy towards the Asian giant, as well as in co-ordination with the US and other like-minded partners.Russia, it’s complicated: German-Russian relations are “deep and multi-faceted”. Beyond a desire to co-operate with Moscow on climate, health and hydrogen, the new government does acknowledge “the interests of our European neighbours, especially our partners in central and eastern Europe. We will take into account various threat perceptions and focus on a common and coherent EU policy towards Russia.” Critical references to Nord Stream 2 that the Greens had made in their party manifesto have gone.Green commissioner: Before even announcing the new accord, Green politicians took to Twitter to make public one significant win: their party will nominate the next German EU commissioner. This led to a flurry of speculations that the new government will no longer support Ursula von der Leyen for a second term at the helm of the European Commission. In the end, the agreement states that the Greens will nominate a candidate only if the commission president is no longer German. When asked about it in the news conference, Olaf Scholz said the coalition agreement described “future cases”, in “terms as friendly as possible”.Advances in technology and funding have sparked optimism about mankind soon being able to harness the fusion reaction that powers the sun to generate clean, limitless electricity on Earth.

(More here)Age-old divisions over the eurozone’s budgetary rule book are beginning to heat up as finance ministries start dissecting each others’ 2022 spending plans, writes Mehreen Khan in Brussels.Next month, EU finance ministers will have to sign off on the European Commission’s assessment of countries’ draft budget plans for next year. It’s a debate that will serve as an appetiser for how northern frugals and the high-debt southern countries line up on the tastier debate about what to do with the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP).The commission seemingly threw a bone to the so-called Hanseatics yesterday, by warning that a number of high-debt countries are in danger of overshooting their fiscal restraints next year.According to Brussels: “In several member states including some high-debt ones, the projected supportive fiscal stance is set to be driven by higher nationally financed current spending, or by unfunded tax cuts. In some cases, this is expected to have a sizeable impact on the underlying fiscal position.”The language is unusually pointed for the commission’s annual end-of-year assessment. It’s likely to be leapt upon by frugal countries which are worried that the expanding debt burdens accumulated during the pandemic pose a serious risk to the eurozone’s wider financial stability.Even more unusually, Italy was singled out as needing to curb its nationally financed spending and pursue a “prudent” fiscal policy. Like other indebted economies, Prime Minister Mario Draghi is being encouraged to use the billions of loans and grants provided by the EU’s recovery fund for investments and reforms instead.The size of Italy’s debt burden — more than 155 per cent of gross domestic product — has long been a source of neurosis for the eurozone’s thrifty northern states. Previous Italian governments such as the populist-led coalition of Giuseppe Conte sparked tremors in the bond markets in 2018 by vowing to defy Brussels’ debt and deficit rules. Draghi’s arrival has helped alleviate immediate fears about Italy’s public finances in hawkish finance ministries such as The Hague and Vienna, partly because of his plans to implement root and branch structural reforms in return for EU recovery cash.But Brussels’ warnings that even Draghi’s government is at risk of spending money it doesn’t have, threaten to poison a looming debate about how best to rewrite the post-pandemic fiscal rule book before it has even begun.As Austria prepared to go into yet another national lockdown this week, 40,000 Austrians took to the streets in Vienna on Sunday in protest. When the government collapsed amid scandal in 2019, only 6,000 demonstrated in the capital, writes Sam Jones, FT’s Switzerland and Austria correspondent.The anger of the crowd — directed primarily at the government’s plan for compulsory vaccination from next February onwards — has not been lost on Austria’s long-established rightwing populists.Austria’s Freedom party (FPÖ) has now gone all out as the party of opposition to lockdowns, vaccine certificates and vaccines.Leader Herbert Kickl (who, ironically, is housebound with coronavirus) has compared the current government to both east-German communists and fascists, called for “unrestricted resistance”, and recommended horse de-wormer Ivermectin as post-infection treatment (that same false information has led to rising numbers of poisonings in the US).For most of 2021, the party’s leadership equivocated on politicising the pandemic. A campaign built around opposition to lockdowns in 2020s important to Viennese municipal elections fell flat.But two big things have recently shifted.In September, a new party of vaccine sceptics, MFG, swept up 6 per cent of the vote in Upper Austria, taking a large portion of FPÖ supporters and signalling vaccine-scepticism as an increasingly powerful political touchstone.A month later, with the ousting of conservative People’s party chancellor Sebastian Kurz, the FPÖ gained a political opening: Kurz had long resisted implementing tougher restrictions nationally, but his successor, Alexander Schallenberg, has not held back.Many moderate conservative voters are deeply opposed to them, and as a result, are now seen by the FPÖ as turnable. The People’s party’s poll collapse means that everything is to play for. Bold bets may pay off.It is a high-stakes course for the FPÖ to pursue, given lives are genuinely at stake. But with more than one in five Austrians still having refused even a first dose of the vaccine as of this week, the party is perhaps reasonably calculating that on this highly contentious issue, the odds are good that it can boost support from the 16 per cent vote share it recorded in September 2019, its poorest in a decade.Other European populist movements will be watching closely.Top EU officials tune into a video summit with Asia-Pacific leadersEU ministers are due to sign off on their negotiating position on sweeping digital regulation at a competitiveness council in BrusselsThe WTO’s rule book is badly out of date.

80  Stef Blok had an unenviable task for any economy minister last week: explaining how his country was about to lose one of its most high-profile multinational companies.The decision by oil and gas group Royal Dutch Shell to end its dual corporate structure and move its tax base to the UK, after being in the Netherlands for more than a century, was a “sensitive loss” for the country, Blok told the Dutch parliament. It is particularly embarrassing for the pro-business caretaker government of Prime Minister Mark Rutte.Shell’s decision sheds light on the shifting business environment in a country often held up as among the most open and competitive in Europe. Companies in the Netherlands are having to contend with a changing public mood that favours tighter corporate tax rules and robust measures to counter climate change, while a poll conducted by Statistics Netherlands last year showed more than 75 per cent of respondents favoured greater use of renewable energy.“Shell’s move is not good for the Dutch business reputation,” said Ingrid Thijssen, president of the country’s confederation of industries and employers. “Headquarters of companies are where the main decisions are made. Your heart is where your home is and we are worried about the future.”The Netherlands’ reputation for open business dates back to its position as the world’s richest trading entrepot during the 17th century. In more recent times, the country has been lauded and criticised in equal measure for providing favourable corporate tax arrangements for foreign companies, making it an attractive location for multinationals such as Nike and Starbucks.Shell’s decision to quit the Netherlands follows the move by Unilever, another company with a historic Anglo-Dutch structure, to abandon its Dutch headquarters in favour of a single company based in London.Brexit helped accelerate the decision of both companies to simplify dual corporate structures that became more difficult to maintain and justify to investors with Britain outside the EU.Unilever and Shell both raised concerns over the Dutch government’s failure to follow through on a promise made in 2017 to abolish a 15 per cent withholding dividend tax. The UK does not impose the tax.A last-ditch attempt by the caretaker government to abolish the levy, hours after Shell’s announcement, was unsuccessful after it failed to win support from opposition parties. Jesse Klaver, leader of the opposition Green Left party, said the cabinet’s attempt to scrap the tax was a sign it was being “financially blackmailed”. Political resistance to tax breaks that would coax companies to the Netherlands or keep them there reflect growing unease over the country’s role in facilitating “aggressive tax planning”, said Jan van de Streek, professor of tax law at Leiden University.Sweetheart tax arrangements offered by EU governments have come under increasing scrutiny in Brussels as a form of potential illegal state aid. “The general public is now more worried about tax fairness and that is causing political parties to respond,” said Van de Streek,He highlights recent decisions to introduce a withholding tax on interest and royalties on payments to international tax havens as signs of a “major shift”. In 2020, the government also abolished a tax ruling that allowed companies such as Shell to offset foreign losses against Dutch tax, resulting in very low or no corporate tax being paid in the country.This move to a less accommodating tax environment has been accompanied by demands for tougher sustainability laws that have made the Netherlands a centre for green legal activism in Europe.Shell was hit by a Dutch court decision in May requiring it to accelerate emissions reduction targets across its global operations by 2030 to meet goals set by the UN Paris climate accord.The verdict was hailed as a big victory for claimants in the case, including Friends of the Earth Europe, which insisted Shell’s move to the UK would not allow it to escape the ruling. Shell, which has appealed against the decision, has denied that the case played a role in its thinking and said shifting to the UK was in part designed to help the company accelerate its energy transition.Other legal rulings enforcing climate targets have also changed the business environment. The Dutch supreme court in 2019 upheld a decision that the state was failing in its duty to meet its Paris accord obligations to reduce CO2 emissions. Judges have also ruled the government has failed to take sufficient measures to hit a binding nitrogen emissions cap, forcing building projects to halt and the motorway speed limit to be cut from 130kph to 100kph last year.Peer de Rijk, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth Netherlands, said Dutch climate activists had resorted to lawsuits as “last-ditch” measures to bring about change in a country where fragmented party politics and unwieldy coalitions made policy changes hard to achieve.The group plans to publish a list of the country’s top-30 polluters next year to put pressure on companies to ensure their compliance with the Paris climate agreement. “We hope companies will engage but, if they keep buying time, other legal challenges will follow,” said De Rijk.While the government has been criticised for not implementing sweeping CO2 reduction measures fast enough for green activists, some Dutch corporates are taking action. Last month ABP, the country’s largest pension fund, said it would divest from all fossil fuels, including Shell shares. Tony’s Chocolonely, the sustainable Dutch chocolate company, is one of the country’s fastest growing international brands.Adriaan de Ruijter, a partner at CMS, a Dutch law firm, said: “Although one of our crown jewels is leaving, many Dutch companies are biting the sour apple of the green transition to reap the rewards in the long run.”
81  Two Deutsche Bahn employees alleged that some senior staff at the state-owned railway company misused corporate funds as part of widespread fraud at one of Europe’s largest infrastructure projects.While an investigation into the allegations was under way, one of the employees was fired. Fearing retaliation, the second whistleblower abruptly broke off contact with compliance staff.The allegations and their aftermath — which a Financial Times investigation uncovered through documents and interviews with people familiar with the case — will add to the controversy over Germany’s most expensive and contentious infrastructure project, a new underground railway station in Stuttgart.The complex scheme — known as Stuttgart 21 — is funded by the German government, the EU, the state of Baden-Württemberg and the city of Stuttgart. It has been overseen since 2017 by Angela Merkel’s former chief of staff Ronald Pofalla, now a Deutsche Bahn executive.Stuttgart 21 has become notorious for delays and budget overruns, placing it on an infamous list alongside Berlin’s airport and Hamburg’s Elbe Philharmonic Hall.The initial €2.5bn price tag has ballooned to €8.2bn. In 2016, Germany’s Bundesrechnungshof, the country’s highest government audit authority, warned costs may rise to €10bn and chided Merkel’s government for “serious shortcomings” in its oversight.The FT can now reveal that in 2016 Deutsche Bahn’s compliance department received repeated warnings from inside the company that a significant part of the cost inflation was caused by glaring mismanagement and suspected corruption.One whistleblower estimated that the alleged misconduct resulted in €600m in unnecessary costs to Deutsche Bahn. Both whistleblowers claimed that some senior managers had commissioned superfluous work and suspected they might be receiving kickbacks.“Group audit needs to act quickly and decisively! Compliance needs to evaluate who is receiving personal gains from this behaviour,” one whistleblower warned in July 2016 in a note seen by the FT.Deutsche Bahn is a state-owned giant with €40bn in annual revenues that also owns UK-based bus operator Arriva. The unlisted group is persistently under fire in Germany for poor service, frequent delays and cancelled trains. In 2020, it reported a net loss of €5.7bn and €37bn of net debt.Stuttgart, the capital of Baden-Württemberg, is Germany’s sixth-largest city and home to carmakers Daimler and Porsche. Located in a narrow valley and surrounded by hills, its terminus station has become a bottleneck. Once finished in 2025, the underground through-station, 28 tunnels and 117km of new high-speed tracks will halve the travel time between the cities of Stuttgart and Ulm.But the project — first proposed in 1994 — has faced fierce protests. Locals have opposed the partial demolition of the listed station building, the logging of trees in a downtown park, high costs and years of construction work. In 2010, police used water cannon against protesters, one of whom was left partially blind.The two whistleblowers were engineers working on the project. One was a highly experienced team leader and specialist in cost allocation who joined Deutsche Bahn in 1997. The other, who was fired during the probe, joined in 2013.One example of unnecessary work cited in the complaint was an electrical substation that was not part of the original master plan. One of the engineers was pressured by superiors to award a €2.5m contract for its construction, even though an alternative solution was available for just €30,000. On this occasion, the engineer stood their ground and the expensive option was dropped, according to a person familiar with the matter.The whistleblowers alleged that some senior executives at Deutsche Bahn ignored their legal obligation to recover costs that other partners were required to cover under German law: for instance, the relocation of an adjacent subway station, whose costs would typically have been shared with the local municipality. The whistleblowers suspected that this behaviour was an attempt to prevent partners from detecting unnecessary spending.The employees first flagged their concerns internally. When senior executives dismissed them despite what both regarded as proof of unnecessary tenders and violations of cost allocation laws, they started to suspect that managers might be deliberately ignoring misconduct.Two decades ago, a fraud scheme linked to the renovation of Leipzig’s station was uncovered after a company that was asked for a bribe reported the demand to Deutsche Bahn. A corrupt manager, who was internally dubbed “Mr Three Percent” as he insisted on a kickback of 3 per cent of invoices, was later jailed.Deutsche Bahn said that an internal investigation into the Stuttgart whistleblowers’ complaint was launched in early 2016 and closed after more than a year without finding anything untoward.“All alleged irregularities were investigated by the unit for internal investigations and evaluated by group security and did not prove to be true,” the company said. It declined to disclose details about the probe’s scope and methods, saying only that it was conducted “in line with internal and legal standards”.The cost allocation specialist summarised their concerns in a four-page note dated July 11 2016 — the date of a joint meeting between the two whistleblowers and compliance staff in Stuttgart. The memo stated that “illegal and improper conduct” including “illicit financing commitments, opaque arrangements[and] organisational chaos” meant the company “has been unnecessarily deprived of €600m”.According to people familiar with the matter, this estimate was the result of a detailed calculation by the cost allocation expert, based on an internal master list of all the construction work affecting other public entities, and the payments that Deutsche Bahn could legally claim from them but did not.The whistleblower’s memo also stated that its author felt repeatedly bullied and was shouted at by superiors who demanded that improper decisions were approved retrospectively.It is unclear how widely this memo was distributed within Deutsche Bahn. Three people familiar with the matter confirmed its authenticity, two of them adding that compliance staff were walked through the arguments in detail by its author.The company told the FT that it did not possess such a document but declined to answer if it was aware of the whistleblower’s €600m estimate. The note’s author took “a rather passive role” in the July meeting, the company said, adding that this person “had not reached out to compliance before July 2016”.Other people familiar with the case told the FT that both whistleblowers had frequently been in touch with compliance since December 2015, and before July had scheduled two joint meetings with compliance and internal investigators, which for various reasons did not happen as planned. Deutsche Bahn told the FT it found this depiction of events “incomprehensible”, adding that “we reject it out of hand”.Weeks after an initial meeting with compliance in January 2016, one of the whistleblowers received a series of written warnings for alleged minor misconduct such as the late filing of sick notes. In December 2016 the whistleblower was fired.The employee successfully sued for wrongful dismissal in 2017. After returning to work one year later, the person was again fired over different alleged misconduct. In the following multiyear legal tussle, judges repeatedly ruled that the second sacking was also unlawful. However, a Stuttgart judge upheld Deutsche Bahn’s request to dissolve the contract, arguing that mutual trust had been destroyed.Deutsche Bahn said its actions towards the employee were totally unrelated to the whistleblower complaint, arguing that they referred to employment-related misconduct. A Stuttgart court in July upheld this view.Deutsche Bahn confirmed that the second whistleblower broke off contact with compliance after the July meeting. People familiar with the matter said that the whistleblower feared retaliation and believed there was no appetite to investigate the allegations thoroughly. Deutsche Bahn declined to comment on the reasons for the whistleblower’s change of heart but pointed out that this person was still an employee.The company told the FT that “the protection of whistleblowers who act in good faith is of high importance”, adding that its compliance management system was “state of the art, fully effective and matches the highest expectations”.By contrast, both employees suspected that their identities were disclosed to the project’s senior management early on against their will, documents show.

They have a golden opportunity to breathe new life into the World Trade Organization.Success could accelerate global economic recovery and boost climate action, while failure risks further fragmentation of the global trading system and erosion of trust among its members.The WTO’s core mission is to underpin rules-based international trade. By many economic measures, it has been a success. By joining the WTO, members have, on average, almost tripled their trade. This has in turn helped to lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty worldwide.In the EU, 38m jobs are supported by international trade — an astonishing 11m more than a decade ago.Today, however, the WTO’s rule book is badly out of date. Its ability to referee trade disputes is paralysed and it is out of touch with current imperatives such as action on climate change and the expansion of digital trade.An irrelevant WTO may lead to a system based on power relations, which harms everybody and benefits no one. This would also hit the interests of those developing countries less integrated in global trade.All our economies are relying on international trade for recovery, but the global rule book needs to catch up with global reality to make a real difference.At their biennial gathering (MC12) next week, trade ministers can get this much-needed process of reform under way. But they must first stop speaking past each other and focus on workable compromises.MC12 can be a game-changer, kick-starting a process that restores the WTO as a negotiation and deliberation forum, with a reformed dispute settlement system.The EU has been leading from the front, publishing a plan for rebooting the WTO earlier this year — one with sustainability at its heart — and working to build coalitions for reform ever since.The wider EU to-do list is clear. With the COP26 climate summit still fresh in our minds, we believe that the global trading system must do more to protect our planet. Real progress on sustainability is within reach at MC12, with a deal to protect oceans and global fish stocks. Specifically, ministers can agree to eliminate harmful subsidies that led to illegal fishing and overfishing.This agreement is tantalisingly close and would represent a victory for both the economy and environment, while sending a strong signal that the WTO is back in business. The EU is ready to do everything it takes to get a result, and is willing to accept new sustainability rules and eliminate subsidies for vessels fishing in the unregulated high seas. We expect other countries to do the same.A successful MC12 must also demonstrate that the WTO can help in the fight against Covid-19. The EU has credibility on this question: we have exported well over half of our vaccine production.We want to see a shared commitment from WTO members to keeping supply chains open, helping to get every citizen vaccinated worldwide. We also need to make sure we are prepared for future pandemics. That is why the EU is committed to helping improve regional production capacity, particularly in Africa.Of course, intellectual property has to be part of the global response, too. The EU is working actively in this area and is advocating a targeted waiver on compulsory licenses. This solution could facilitate production of vaccines and other essential health products while preserving incentives for innovation and investment, which are key for continents such as Africa. We still hope consensus can be found in this crucial matter in the days ahead.On the economic front, the door is also open for an agreement on the regulation of services. The OECD estimates this could save $140bn in trade costs, giving another welcome boost to global recovery.The stakes are high. Real breakthroughs are possible, but only with sufficient political will and a shared sense of urgency. The EU will not be found wanting, but we need others to play their part.Failure to do so would represent an unconscionable dereliction of duty to our citizens, our workers, and to the hopes of a truly sustainable global recovery.Letter in response to this article:WTO meeting must renew ban on data flow duties / From John WH Denton, Secretary General, International Chamber of Commerce, Paris, France
83  Less than two years ago Olaf Scholz was licking his wounds after the most bruising defeat in his long career — losing to two little-known left-wingers in the contest to lead Germany’s Social Democrats (SPD). His dream of one day becoming his country’s chancellor had been dealt a near-fatal blow.But on Wednesday he sealed one of the most remarkable comebacks in German politics. Written off for months as an also-ran, from a party that was dwindling into irrelevance, he stood before a packed hall as Angela Merkel’s presumptive successor.The occasion was the unveiling of the coalition agreement negotiated by the SPD, Greens and liberals Free Democrats, the fruit of nearly two months of intense negotiations following national elections in September that resulted in a narrow victory for the Social Democrats.Scholz said his government would usher in a “decade of investment”, and the “biggest industrial modernisation of Germany in more than 100 years”.“We are united by the will to make this country better, to drive it forward and keep it together,” he said. “We want to dare more progress.” The next government, he said, would “invest massively to ensure Germany remains a world leader”, and turn it into a “pioneer in climate protection”.The deal envisages aggressive action on climate and huge investments in improving Germany’s shabby infrastructure. But it also enshrines key SPD demands: an increase in minimum wage, a commitment to stable pensions and more social housing.The coalition brings together strange bedfellows — a Green party that campaigned to relax the country’s strict fiscal rules and invest billions in greening the economy, and an FDP that insisted on a swift return to pre-pandemic economic orthodoxy. That such ideological differences were bridged — and far faster than many expected — is a testament to Scholz’s skills as a negotiator.It also vindicates the Scholz approach — a pragmatism and moderation which often annoyed left-wingers in his party. Many in the SPD worried that he was too close to Merkel and her Christian Democrats. Indeed, he explicitly campaigned in this year’s election as the continuity candidate, claiming his long experience in government and down-to-earth, unideological manner made him a worthy heir to Merkel.The message resonated with a voting public alarmed by Covid-19 and already missing the stabilising influence of a chancellor who has governed Germany for 16 years.But Scholz may soon be forced by circumstance to adopt a different style. “If he really wants to. tackle the big tasks of our time, climate change, growing social inequality and digitisation, he’ll be forced to do the opposite of what he’s so far known for: he will have to fight, and to fight with passion,” wrote Veit Medick in Der Spiegel.In his youth, Scholz was a lot more passionate. When he joined the SPD in 1975 he initially identified with the more radical wing of the party, pledging to “overcome the capitalist economy”. “I’ve definitely become more pragmatic over the years,” he said last August of his youthful militancy.A labour lawyer in the 1990s, he gradually climbed the ranks in the SPD, becoming general secretary in 2002. In that role he earned the enmity of the left for his strong support of then chancellor Gerhard Schröder’s contentious labour market reforms. He also earned his nickname “Scholz-o-mat”, a reference to his often robotic, monotonous delivery.Scholz served as Merkel’s labour minister during the 2008-09 financial crisis and in 2011 was elected mayor of Hamburg, a job he held for seven years. While popular, his reputation was tarnished by violent clashes between anarchists and police during a G20 summit in 2017 that turned parts of the city into a battleground.When Merkel appointed him finance minister in her last cabinet, he hewed closely to the strict fiscal orthodoxy of his predecessor in the job, Wolfgang Schäuble, who had come to symbolise the austerity policies of post-crisis Europe.But that changed when the pandemic hit and Scholz helped put together a €420bn programme of support for businesses and workers — one of Europe’s most generous emergency aid packages.“This is the bazooka, and we will use it to do whatever it takes,” he said in March 2020, echoing the words of former European Central Bank president Mario Draghi during the eurozone debt crisis in 2012.Scholz took on vast amounts of debt and suspended Germany’s “debt brake”, the constitutional limit on new borrowing. He also played a key role in driving through plans for the EU’s recovery fund, which will channel loans and grants to countries to help them weather the pandemic.Those expansive fiscal policies endeared Scholz to once-sceptical left-wingers in the SPD and in August 2020 he was named as its candidate for chancellor.Few fancied his chances: the SPD was languishing at about 14 per cent in the polls, far behind the Greens and Merkel’s CDU. But Scholz benefited from unforced errors by rival candidates and in the last stage of the campaign the SPD pulled ahead. When results came in on September 26 it was clear the party had scored a narrow victory — and that Scholz was to be Germany’s next chancellor.Scholz earned sincere applause from Social Democrats on Wednesday but the warmest praise came from a rival, Christian Lindner, the FDP leader. Scholz had emerged in the coalition negotiations, he said, as a “strong leader, with the experience and professionalism to take this country into a good future”, he said. “He will be a strong chancellor for Germany.”
84  Orange’s chief executive Stéphane Richard is to leave the group by the end of January at the latest, after he was given a one year-suspended prison sentence in a fraud case in France unconnected to the company.The long-running legal saga, linked to late businessman Bernard Tapie and Richard’s time in a government job, had long hung over the executive’s tenure at Orange, although he had been acquitted of any wrongdoing in an earlier ruling.But Richard, who is also chair, handed in his resignation at a board meeting on Wednesday, the company said. It will take effect when “the new governance structure has been appointed and at the latest by January 31 2022”, Orange added.After a decade in the role, Richard was one of the longest-serving leaders in European telecoms and leaves at a time of turmoil and fierce competition within the sector. His mandate was due to end in May 2022, and Richard had harboured ambitions of staying on as chair, even though he had said he would be prepared to relinquish his CEO job by then.An appeals court in France cleared Richard of aiding fraud but found him guilty of complicity in the misuse of public funds, linked to a previous position as Christine Lagarde’s chief of staff when she was finance minister. He was also fined €50,000.Richard rejected the verdict and said he would appeal to France’s highest court. “During the process, the charges have shifted. this is totally incomprehensible and profoundly unjust,” he said in a statement.Orange has two deputy CEOs who would be among obvious candidates to vie for his job: Gervais Pellissier, who has been in executive roles at Orange since 2005, and Ramon Fernandez, a former government adviser, who is also Orange’s financial director.Richard’s appointment in 2011 coincided with a tumultuous period in French telecoms after the rise of aggressive rivals such as Altice, which acquired SFR and Numericable, and Xavier Niel’s Iliad. His departure also comes against a backdrop of upheaval for the European telecoms sector after KKR bid for Telecom Italia this week.Richard is credited with steadying Orange during the early part of his tenure, when the company was recovering from a crisis sparked by a wave of staff suicides.“He returned a sense of calm to labour relations, which was a real success,” said Sébastien Crozier, a representative of the CFE-CGC union who sits on Orange’s board, before directors met on Wednesday.However, the group has recently struggled in some markets, including Spain, sparking a €3.7bn writedown of its business there earlier this year. Richard had also come under pressure in France in June after a network outage which prevented emergency calls for several hours, during which several people died.The French state has a 23 per cent stake in Orange.The court case harks back to a €403m payout awarded by the government to Tapie, a well-known French businessman who once chaired Olympique de Marseille football club and who died in October.Tapie had accused the government of defrauding him when he sold a stake in sportswear group Adidas to a state-backed bank in 1992.The state payment, overseen by Lagarde, was later criticised as excessive amid accusations that it was a covert reward for Tapie’s support of former president Nicolas Sarkozy during his election campaign.Lagarde, now chief of the European Central Bank, was found guilty in 2016 of negligence in public office.
85  Poland’s constitutional tribunal ruled that the European Court of Human Rights cannot question the status of its judges, opening a new front in the battle over an overhaul of the country’s judiciary.The ruling, in response to a case brought by Poland’s hawkish justice minister Zbigniew Ziobro, comes amid a long-running battle between Warsaw and Brussels over a series of changes that critics say fundamentally undermine the independence of Poland’s judiciary.The European Commission has challenged several aspects of Warsaw’s reforms at the EU’s top court, the European Court of Justice, which has ruled that some of the changes — such as a new disciplinary regime for judges — are illegal.However, aspects of the overhaul have also been addressed by the European Court of Human Rights — an institution distinct from the EU, which ruled in May that a Polish business had been denied its right to a fair hearing because a constitutional tribunal judge had been illegally appointed.In its ruling on Wednesday, which was widely seen as a response to that case, Poland’s constitutional tribunal ruled that part of Article 6.1 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to a fair trial by an independent court, could not be applied to the Polish constitutional tribunal, or used to give the ECHR the right to assess the legality of the appointment of judges to the Polish constitutional court.Jakub Jaraczewski, a legal expert at Democracy Reporting International, said the ruling was significant because it “escalated” Poland’s rule of law stand-off beyond its conflict with the EU to other international institutions, such as the ECHR.“The European Court of Human Rights has issued a couple of judgments regarding Poland, and now we have the Polish reaction. This is an attempt to disable the ECHR by providing the government with legal cover to ignore its judgment,” he said.“This ruling takes this crisis beyond a conflict between Warsaw and Brussels on how the EU should be set up. It is now clear that this is about the Polish government damaging the rule of law in Poland, and various international institutions.trying to do something about it.”Sebastian Kaleta, Poland’s deputy justice minister, welcomed the constitutional tribunal’s decision. “The latest attempt at external and illegal interference in Poland’s judicial system has been prevented by the constitutional tribunal”, he wrote on Twitter.The stand-off between Poland and the EU over Warsaw’s judicial changes has been intensifying since the conservative-nationalist Law and Justice party embarked on a series of reforms that it says are necessary to improve the functioning of the judiciary.The dispute came to a head last month when the constitutional tribunal, which was neutered by the government in 2016 in a series of manoeuvres that the tribunal itself deemed unconstitutional, ruled key parts of EU law were not compatible with the Polish constitution, sparking questions about Poland’s long-term future in the bloc.The stand-off has delayed Brussels’ approval of Poland’s Covid-19 economic recovery package, in effect freezing €36bn of funding, and sparked calls for a new conditionality mechanism to be used to withhold further EU funds from Warsaw.Last week, the commission wrote to Poland asking for information about how it would safeguard EU funds in light of its judicial changes. Warsaw has two months to respond.
86  Magdalena Andersson’s reign as Sweden’s first female prime minister lasted just seven hours as the Scandinavian country plunged into political chaos on an extraordinary day of drama in Stockholm.Andersson resigned as prime minister on Wednesday, only hours after gaining sufficient backing from parliament to take the role, when her new partners from the Green party quit the coalition and collapsed her centre-left government.The Greens left in protest after parliament refused to back the government’s spending plans and instead adopted a budget drafted by the opposition, nationalist Sweden Democrats and two mainstream centre-right parties.Handing in her resignation just hours after saying how “moved” she was to become leader and inspire girls across Sweden, Andersson said: “This maybe is not the best image of Swedish politics.”In a day of high political drama, Andersson first became Sweden’s new leader despite losing the vote, as a majority could not be mustered to stop her taking office by one vote.Then her own budget, drafted when she was finance minister, was rejected by parliament, meaning she would have to govern with opposition spending plans until national elections next September — although a revised budget could be presented in the spring.That led the Greens to resign from the government due to the opposition budget reversing several environmental measures. They said they would back Andersson as prime minister in the new vote, but it is unclear how other parties would react.Andersson said she would try to govern with a one-party minority government of her Social Democrat party, noting that earlier in the day she had sufficient support to become prime minister.Sweden, long a bastion of political stability where the Social Democrats have come first in every election in more than a century, is facing an extended period of political turmoil as a result of the rapid rise of the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats.The nationalist party, which first entered parliament in 2010, has broken up the traditional system of leftwing and rightwing blocs, and new uneasy constellations are only starting to be formed.Stefan Lofven, Andersson’s predecessor as both prime minister and Social Democrat leader, was forced to resign in June after becoming the first Swedish head of government to lose a no-confidence vote. In July, he won enough support in parliament to resume the job, only to announce his resignation a month later.With their joint budget proposal and an earlier common immigration policy, the Sweden Democrats, Moderate party and Christian Democrats have been paving the way for a potential new conservative bloc ahead of next year’s elections.The rightwing parties have won voter support for their focus on crime and immigration, increasingly important issues in a country that has faced almost daily incidents of shootings as well as bombings or grenade attacks in suburbs with large numbers of foreign-born residents.Andersson now faces the challenge of uniting the disparate parties — ranging from the ex-communists of the Left party to the nominally centre-right Centre party — which backed her in a new vote. The Speaker of parliament said he accepted Andersson’s resignation, and would reveal his plans on Thursday afternoon.Sweden, which prides itself as a country that takes gender equality seriously and has a government that professes to run a feminist foreign policy, was the last of the Nordic countries to gain a female prime minister, 40 years after Norway became the first.
87  Olaf Scholz unveiled the coalition agreement between the Social Democrats, Greens and liberals that will allow him to succeed Angela Merkel as German chancellor, promising the “biggest industrial modernisation of Germany in more than 100 years”.He said the agreement would pave the way for Germany to become a “pioneer on climate protection”, adding that “we will invest massively to maintain Germany’s status as a world leader”. Annalena Baerbock, Green co-leader, said the new government would introduce a “paradigm change” in German politics.The coalition agreement was the fruit of almost two months of intense negotiations following the Social Democrats’ narrow victory in national elections on September 26.Though the emphasis in the party leaders’ press conference on Wednesday was on climate change, public investment and more workers’ rights, the new government’s most urgent priority will be to stem a pandemic that is threatening to swamp Germany’s hospitals. Authorities reported 66,884 new coronavirus infections over the past 24 hours — a new record.Under the coalition agreement, the SPD will get six ministries, in addition to the chancellery, while the Greens will be awarded five and the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), four.The Greens will take control of the foreign ministry and a newly-created economy and climate protection ministry. Though no official announcement was made, people close to the negotiations said Baerbock would head up the first and Robert Habeck, the Greens’ co-leader, the second.Baerbock said the parties had agreed to “return to an active European foreign policy”, one that was based on diplomacy and dialogue and “driven by values and human rights”.The finance ministry goes to the FDP, which has a reputation for fiscal hawkishness: it is widely expected in Berlin that the party’s leader, Christian Lindner, will become minister.Speaking on Wednesday afternoon, he said the coalition deal would ensure that Germany remained an “advocate of sound [public] finances — this is important in view of the concerns a lot of people have right now about inflation”.September’s election marked a watershed in German politics. With Merkel quitting the stage after four terms as chancellor, her Christian Democrats slumped to their worst result and were forced into opposition for the first time in 16 years and only the third time since the second world war.The CDU’s poor performance opened a path for Scholz to form a “traffic-light” coalition with the Greens and liberals — named after the three parties’ traditional colours. It will be the first such alliance on a national level in Germany’s history and is expected to put the fight against climate change at the top of its agenda.The parties agreed to bring forward Germany’s exit from coal “ideally” to 2030 (it is currently scheduled to take place in 2038). They also said they would ensure that renewables account for 80 per cent of German electricity output by 2030, up from 45 per cent in the past year. In addition, some 2 per cent of German territory will be reserved for wind turbines.The parties also agreed to legalise cannabis for adults, toughen rental controls, raise the minimum wage from €9.60 an hour to €12, and allow for the introduction of armed drones to better protect Bundeswehr soldiers.The parties agreed to take a cautious approach to fiscal policy, insisting that Germany revert to the “debt brake”, a cap on new borrowing enshrined in the country’s constitution, which was suspended during the pandemic, in 2023.Asked how they will finance their planned investments while sticking to the debt brake, Habeck said “we know exactly how we’ll pay for it” without providing further details.The SPD and FDP will hold party conferences to approve the coalition deal while the Greens will put it to a vote of all the eco-party’s 125,000 members. If it gets the green light, the new government will be sworn in by the Bundestag early next month.
88  After Germany’s 2017 Bundestag elections, almost six months passed before a new coalition government took office. This time it’s different. If, as expected, Olaf Scholz of the Social Democratic party is confirmed as chancellor in a Bundestag vote planned for the second week of December, it will have taken Germany just over 70 days to form a government since the September 26 elections.The progress has been encouragingly fast, given that the SPD, Greens and liberal Free Democrats faced the task of forming the first three-party coalition to rule Germany since the 1950s. Nevertheless the coalition agreement that was made public on Wednesday conceals what are potentially awkward policy differences among the three parties, which have never governed together at national level. The areas to watch out for are the pandemic, fiscal policy in its German and eurozone contexts and foreign policy with regard to Russia, China and Nato.Germany’s Covid-19 infection rates have hit their highest levels this month since the pandemic broke out in early 2020. The premiers of powerful western German states such as Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria are pressing for mandatory vaccinations, as adopted in Austria. But several eastern German states where anti-vaccination sentiment is vocal oppose such sweeping measures, as does the FDP.For the incoming government, the difficulty will be to set out a coherent line on health policy to which all three coalition parties can agree, as far as possible in tandem with Germany’s 16 states. The aim should be to avoid the mixed messaging from the federal and state governments that has confused and divided German society in the closing weeks of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s administration.Despite being the smallest of the incoming government’s three parties, the FDP can be expected to wield influence above its weight in key areas of coalition policy. This will be particularly true for the management of the public finances if, as appears likely, FDP leader Christian Lindner takes over as finance minister.The three parties have agreed not to alter Germany’s “debt brake”, a constitutionally-enshrined limit on government borrowing, but the FDP goes further than the SPD and Greens in not wanting the EU’s post-pandemic recovery fund to evolve into a permanent instrument of European economic policy. The FDP takes a similarly hard line on the need for the eurozone to return to the strict fiscal rules suspended during the pandemic.The incoming government will have to find a way of reconciling its commitment to fiscal discipline with its promises to raise domestic public investment, particularly in digitalisation, infrastructure and climate change measures. The Greens won the argument for bringing forward the phasing out of coal to 2030 from 2038, but this too may test the limits of budgetary restraint. On the EU stage, the new government may face calls from France, Italy and others to be more flexible when it comes to renegotiating fiscal rules.Finally, the incoming coalition’s three parties do not see wholly eye to eye on foreign policy. The Greens and FDP campaigned this year for a tougher line on Russia and China than was pursued by Merkel’s government, of which the SPD formed part. There have also been tensions over nuclear weapons policy and over Germany’s failure to meet Nato’s target that every member state should spend at least 2 per cent of gross domestic product on defence.With Merkel’s departure after 16 years in office and the first SPD-led government since 2005, Germany is in new political territory. The nation’s allies and friends are counting on the new government to make a strong start.
89  Veteran financiers worry that lessons painfully learnt in the last crisis will be lost on the generation that has come of age since. There is a parallel that fewer people fret over: the ranks of corporate managers who have risen up since the last UK inflation spike a decade ago and have not been disciplined in how to push through large price rises.Getting customers to swallow a price increase in line with inflation should be easy. Except now that customer might have to take a rather large gulp.At 4.2 per cent last month, consumer price inflation is rising quickly enough. Yet costs for manufacturers are rising quicker still. In October some 37 per cent of UK businesses surveyed by the Office for National Statistics reported that prices of materials, goods and services they bought in the last month had gone up more than normal. Fifteen per cent put up their own prices in response.The good news is that “the economics of price increases are almost impossible to get wrong”, according to Mark Billige, a pricing specialist and chief executive of consultancy Simon-Kucher & Partners. Margin improvements will almost always outweigh revenue losses.Yet companies — even big ones — can still be bad at it. Of course there are consumer-facing groups with dynamic pricing down to a T, those with operations in emerging markets or who have ridden the commodity cycle of the past decade and are well practised in pricing.But an analysis from consultants McKinsey showed companies typically ended up implementing around a third of the price increase they originally wanted. Data from Simon-Kucher paint a similar picture.There are those scarred by the experiences of previous price rises. In 2011, Netflix put up prices by 60 per cent. The company lost fewer customers than the revenue it ultimately gained. But it shed more than 70 per cent of its share price in the months that followed, reversing on its rationale for the rise — but not the rise itself. It became a case study for how not to push up prices.Or take the big British grocers after 2006. Then an oil price spike, poor northern hemisphere harvest and demand from Asia pushed up input prices. A cycle of price rises started. Throw in a promotional binge from consumer goods groups and grocery bosses got drunk on the cocktail of price rises and promotions. That is until the financial crisis kicked in, customers started switching to the discount retailers, and we all know how that ended.Still, the bigger risk may be that companies bungle their pricing by failing to put them up enough.In normal circumstances, that might be annoying but not overly damaging. Companies can cut costs rather than increase ticket prices. One boss of a big FTSE 100 group said he would always try to offset inflation with productivity savings. Consumer goods groups can lop another triangle from a Toblerone or take a couple of Quality Street out of the tin (and brand it as a health drive to boot). But as inflation climbs, getting price rises wrong could be more costly. Slow and steady annual rises of 3 or 4 per cent across the board may no longer cut it. If inflation hits harder and faster, it is difficult to follow a one-and-done approach to raising prices. More targeted action is needed.Customers meanwhile are not necessarily as price sensitive as many companies assume. Retailer Next — always a model of modelling best practice — did some number crunching in 2011. It compared a basket of equivalent items and concluded prices had to go up 8 per cent for it to lose 1.5 per cent of sales. In the first half of its next financial year, the chain expects to put up prices 2.5 per cent overall, and only 1 per cent on clothing. Unilever, at the sharp end of cost inflation, pushed through a 4.1 per cent price increase last quarter, the 10th-highest rise in roughly 19 years. It lost only 1.5 per cent in sales volumes, broadly consistent with historic trends.Neither company would put up prices above inflation to buy themselves long-term growth. But who does well at passing on price rises in the months ahead will help determine the corporate winners of next year.
90  Austrian prosecutors have closed an 18-month investigation into the outbreak of coronavirus in the ski resort of Ischgl in early 2020 — one of the pandemic’s first superspreader events in Europe.The Innsbruck state prosecutor ended its probe into criminal liability for the outbreak with no charges of wrongdoing for authorities in Ischgl, it said in a statement on Wednesday.The finding comes as scant relief for hoteliers and business owners in Austria’s crisis-hit ski regions. As the country tackles its worst wave of Covid-19 infections, they face delays in reopening the resorts and uncertainty over whether foreign visitors will be allowed.Since Monday, Austria has again been in a national lockdown as it battles to curb the surge in Covid cases, and the government is drawing up plans for mandatory vaccination from early next year. Ischgl had been due to open its lifts fully on Thursday, with a gala weekend of celebrations planned to mark the return after the 2020-21 season was cancelled.Ischgl became a byword for the ski industry’s travails during the pandemic.The village, known for its raucous après-ski scene, became a hotspot for the virus when its bars and pistes stayed open despite rising numbers of people becoming sick in February and March 2020. That led to a wave of infections beyond Austria’s borders as holidaymakers returned from the slopes.Hundreds of the earliest infections in Germany were traced to the tiny town in Austria’s western Tyrol region. Icelandic epidemiologists said Ischgl was the sole source of their country’s first wave of infections. Half of Norway’s initial bout of cases came from the pistes there, as did one-third of those in Denmark and one-sixth of those in Sweden, according to health officials in those countries.Research by epidemiologists at the University of Innsbruck, who tested 80 per cent of the population in Ischgl, found that 45 per cent of residents had contracted coronavirus in the first wave of the pandemic, the highest level of infection detected per head in any study at that point worldwide.“There is no evidence that [authorities] were culpable of doing, or refraining from doing, something that would have led to an increase in the risk of infections,” the Innsbruck prosecutor said on Wednesday.The investigation looked at accusations that officials — including the district governor and Ischgl’s mayor — had pushed to keep the resort’s facilities open amid concerns over the economic impact of curbing the tourist season. Skiing is big business in Austria: winter sports contribute a roughly equivalent share to the economy as carmaking in Germany, according to research by Dutch bank ING.The prosecutor said it had reviewed more than 15,000 pages of evidence and conducted 27 interviews. The probe was completed in May but has only now been reviewed by senior prosecutorial authorities and the Austrian justice ministry.An earlier government inquiry into events at Ischgl found that officials had poorly managed the outbreak. Ski lifts should have been shut earlier, it concluded, and communication with tourists was chaotic.A separate civil suit against Ischgl authorities, backed by Austria’s consumer protection association, is ongoing in Vienna.Austria reported a seven-day average of 155 new Covid cases per 100,000 residents on Wednesday, Europe’s second-highest rate of infection, according to Johns Hopkins University. About 30 per cent of the population have still not received their first vaccine.
91  The de facto ruler of the United Arab Emirates visited Turkey for the first time in almost a decade, heralding a thaw in one of the region’s most difficult relationships and buoying the Turkish lira with a promise of $10bn of Emirati investment.Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi and one of the Arab world’s most influential leaders, met Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the presidential palace in Ankara.Sheikh Mohammed tweeted later that the two held “fruitful discussions focusing on ways to strengthen relations between our countries. I look forward to exploring new co-operation opportunities to benefit our two nations & advance our mutual development goals.”The lira, which on Tuesday lost almost 12 per cent of its value against the dollar amid mounting fears about Erdogan’s management of the economy, rebounded by as much as 10 per cent as markets cheered the prospect of UAE investment in Turkey at a time when western capital is scarce.Sinem Cengiz, an analyst on Turkish-Gulf relations, described the meeting as a landmark moment for the geopolitics of the region. “The visit symbolises a turning point in Turkey-UAE relations after a decade-long feud,” she said.The two states have competed for influence across the region since popular uprisings rocked the Arab world in 2011, and their bitter rivalry has reverberated from the oil-rich Gulf to the Horn of Africa and the conflict in Libya.The talks are a further sign of a tentative shift towards de-escalation in the Middle East as the election of US president Joe Biden and the economic turmoil triggered by the coronavirus pandemic have prompted regional leaders to recalibrate their foreign policies.The UAE is shifting its focus towards economic diplomacy as it seeks to boost its post-pandemic recovery, while Erdogan wants to repair ties with regional rivals as he faces strained relations with western powers.“Both countries realised that after being at each other’s throats for 10 years neither side had punched a knockout blow and it was time to disengage,” said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a Dubai-based political science professor.The two nations signed a series of economic co-operation agreements, including a memorandum of understanding between the Abu Dhabi Development Holding (ADQ) and the Turkish Wealth Fund. ADQ is one of Abu Dhabi’s newest and most active state investment vehicles. ADQ chief executive Mohammed Hassan al-Suwaidi told Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency that the UAE had set aside a $10bn fund for Turkey.Deals are expected to include investments in energy, technology and health as well as ports and logistics, according to Turkey’s state-owned TRT news service. Reuters news agency reported that Turkey’s central bank governor was also meeting Emirati officials to discuss the potential for a swap agreement that would boost the country’s foreign currency reserves.Analysts caution that many of the underlying issues at the core of their dispute remain unresolved. Relations became strained when Turkey and its Gulf ally Qatar backed the Arab uprisings in 2011. The autocratic monarchies in the UAE, and its main ally, Saudi Arabia, saw the revolutions as a threat to regional stability and their own hold on power.Abu Dhabi and Ankara backed opposing sides in Libya’s civil war, and UAE officials have railed against what they perceive to be Turkey’s interference in Arab affairs. When Saudi Arabia and the UAE led a trade and travel embargo against Qatar in 2017, Turkey accelerated the deployment of troops to a military base in Doha in a muscular show of support for its closest Arab ally. But tensions began to ease after Saudi Arabia moved to lift the regional boycott of Qatar at the beginning of the year.
92  European regulators will examine whether lenders downplayed the potential cost of bad loans during the pandemic by sidestepping new accounting rules on when provisions should be taken against entire industries.The European Banking Authority, which sets rules for lenders in the bloc, said bank loan-loss provisions could have been “significantly affected” by their failure to use the “collective assessment” method included in accounting standards introduced three years ago.Under collective assessment, entire groups of borrowers are moved into a category with higher loan-loss charges, known as Stage 2, because they are all deemed to be at risk from the same negative factors. Banks can avoid this if they can demonstrate they have the capacity to analyse all the loans individually or have another method that is just as robust.“We were surprised the collective assessment was not used more,” said Delphine Reymondon, a divisional head at the EBA, of the finding that just over a third of banks were using the measure as of June 2020. “The question is that if you don’t use it during this [pandemic] period, then when do you use it?” In its report on the implementation of the new accounting standards, which have generally led to the earlier recognition of loan-loss charges, the EBA cited “concerns” about whether the failure of some banks to use collective assessment resulted in a delay in borrowers being moved to Stage 2, saying this could have “significantly affected” final loan-loss provisions.The EBA added that the lack of collective assessment “does not seem to be justified” and was a “point of attention for supervisors and regulators”.Reymondon told the Financial Times that banks may be “reluctant” to use collective assessment because “moving an entire portfolio [of loans] to stage 2 leads to a high impact [on expected losses]”. The relatively low use of collective assessment will be an “important area of further scrutiny for supervisors,” she added.European and US banks made huge provisions for loan losses earlier in the pandemic as they contemplated mass defaults while economies were shut down. Unprecedented support packages from governments held the worst of the losses at bay, enabling banks to release some of those provisions in late 2020.Still, some argue that banks will not feel the full impact of losses related to Covid-19 until the crisis comes to an end and support measures are withdrawn, setting the scene for difficult decisions as banks calculate their final provisions for 2021.
93  Brussels has warned Italy to rein in government spending growth and pursue a “prudent” fiscal policy next year as the European Commission flags budget risks in high-debt economies.In its annual review of EU member states’ budget plans, Brussels found that Rome had not sufficiently limited the growth of its “nationally financed current expenditure” in its 2022 budget and urged it to take the “necessary measures” to address the overshoot given its debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 150 per cent.“Given the level of Italy’s government debt and high sustainability challenges in the medium term before the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.it is important to preserve prudent fiscal policy in order to ensure sustainable public finances,” the commission said.The verdict is a setback for Italian prime minister Mario Draghi, who came to office this year with a promise to help repair strained relations between Brussels and Rome over budget targets. The former European Central Bank chief has set out an ambitious plan to revamp Italy’s economy in return for billions of loans and grants from the EU’s recovery and resilience fund (RRF).The warnings will receive heightened attention this year as the commission is reviewing the suitability of its debt and deficit rule book known as the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) — a debate that risks reigniting old divisions between frugal northern eurozone economies and higher-debt countries in the south. Draghi has called for a “change” in the rules to account for higher debt levels taken on by governments during the pandemic. No concrete EU proposals on the SGP are due until next year.Paolo Gentiloni, EU commissioner for the economy, said Brussels was not “rejecting” the Italian budget or making specific requests, adding that the country had a good growth outlook. However the commission did want to focus attention on current spending that could become a permanent burden on the public finances, he said. “We need to make a growth-friendly path of reduction of the debt possible,” he added. A commission official said on Wednesday that Italy had been “invited” to take on Brussels’ advice on spending but would not need to submit a revised budget. Nationally financed current expenditure in Italy would have a 1.5 per cent of GDP impact on the country’s underlying fiscal position, the commission said. One EU official described the overshoot as “significant”. Italy’s assessment comes with a wider warning that a number of high debt countries will lift current spending by more than their potential growth rates, “suggesting an increasing weight of permanent current expenditure or unfunded tax cuts”. Brussels wants fiscal policy to remain moderately supportive next year in the euro area, but for fiscal policy measures to gradually “pivot” towards investments that drive a sustainable recovery. Member states should draw on the billions of recovery funds provided by the EU’s €800bn landmark borrowing instrument.About a quarter of all recovery support measures in 2022 will be funded by RRF money. Spain will spend the most recovery fund cash over 2021-22 — at about 3 per cent of national GDP. “RRF spending will be very significant in a number of member states,” an EU official said.Brussels’ overall draft budgetary assessments will need to be signed off by EU finance ministers next month, a negotiation that diplomats say will be a foretaste of broader splits on the future of the SGP. The EU’s fiscal rule book has been suspended since 2020 owing to the pandemic and is due to be reinstated in 2023.
94  The writer is an investment director at GAMOn paper, 2021 should have been a great year for emerging market currencies and bonds as global growth recovered from the Covid-19 shocks. But Turkey’s alarming currency plunge this year has shown how things can sometimes go horribly wrong in the emerging market world.On the checklist for emerging market strength is a series of ticks: strong export growth, accommodative monetary policy in the big developed economies, rising currency reserves and strong commodity prices. Yet JPMorgan’s index of emerging market currencies has dropped 9 per cent this year and yields have risen.This is at least partially due to the return of the “vigilante” effect in financial markets where countries that deviate from traditional economic orthodoxy or borrow too much pay the price in currency weakness and higher bond yields. In big, developed economies, such forces are still quiescent. Not so in emerging markets.Turkey is the most obvious example after a 20 per cent drop in the lira over the past two weeks following fresh rate cuts that deepened concern over Ankara’s economic management.Turkey’s economic fundamentals are in many respects the best for years, but the insistence of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on interest rates cuts has put the lira under pressure.In July 2019, Erdogan fired central bank governor Murat Cetinkaya. The lira appreciated over the next month, and by the end of 2019 was roughly unchanged. When Erdogan repeated the action against Naci Agbal in March this year, the lira dropped 15 per cent in one day before recovering, and has struggled since.But a rate cut last week — the third since September — sent the lira into freefall, hitting 13 per dollar (compared with 7.2 on Agbal’s last day in office). The worst day for the lira came after Erdogan reiterated his commitment to his unorthodox views that high interest rates cause inflation.Turkey’s case might be the most extreme but there have also been investor revolts in markets from Brazil to South Africa.Emerging markets have been dragged down by three factors. The first is the strength of the dollar. Emerging markets have always struggled when the US currency is strong. It makes foreign debt more costly to service and can spur investment outflows.The second is Covid. The vaccine rollout has come and gone in developed economies, bringing euphoria then disappointment. Emerging markets have gone straight for disappointment. Vaccines have been slow to reach poorer countries. Even when they are available, vaccination rates are low.The third, and likely to be the most intractable, is the price that emerging markets pay for populist, sometimes unpredictable governments with a relaxed approach to fiscal spending.Unlike big developed economies, emerging markets have a great deal less flexibility on the policy front. Residents in emerging markets are much more prone to move their savings into foreign currency and even offshore, causing a repricing of both bond prices and exchange rates.Beyond Turkey, the yields in longer bonds across emerging markets raise doubts about fiscal sustainability. Brazil’s policy rate is 7.75 per cent, but 10-year bonds yield 12 per cent. South Africa’s figures are 3.75 per cent and 10 per cent. South African bonds have struggled to claw back post-Covid losses while Brazilian investors assume the country is going into one of its periodic phases of rate rises.These countries are pointing to either higher credit risk a few years out or long-term high rates to stem capital flight. Even Russia — with a sovereign balance sheet that would leave most finance ministers green with envy — pays nearly 9 per cent to borrow for 10 years.These rates seem like an anomaly in a world where G20 yields are still historically low. It does look as if the investors who are happy to pay stratospheric valuations for tech stocks or fraud-prone cryptocurrencies suddenly become sober and cautious when faced with poorer countries. Emerging markets seldom get the benefit of the doubt.This has not been uniform since the outbreak of Covid — while emerging markets were sold along with everything else during the initial outbreak, a solid rally late last year delivered 9.6 per cent return in JPMorgan’s index of local currency emerging market debt in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the index hit its all-time high at the turn of the year.For an investor, the current path seems clear: emerging market assets are cheap but investments in them are best funded out of non-dollar currencies, and better to stick to countries with responsible governments.
95  Good morning. Thanksgiving is tomorrow, and Unhedged will be giving thanks for our readers, who are the reason Ethan and I get to have fun jobs. Thank you! We’ll be back on Monday. In the meantime, we think our British readers should sign up for the FT’s excellent City Bulletin newsletter, a brisk daily primer on the London financial scene. Recep Tayyip Erdogan thinks that cutting interest rates will help stabilise the Turkish currency and control inflation. He is wrong. Here is the lira against the dollar since 2014, the year he became Turkey’s president (this and the following charts use data from Bloomberg):The red circle shows the latest Turkish currency crisis, which follows the central bank cutting interest rates to 15 per cent (they were 19 per cent in September) and Erdogan making a combative speech damning global finance on Tuesday. Here is how investors in Turkish shares have done, in lira and in dollars:It’s remarkable, given the devastation of the lira, that hard currency investors have only lost half their money in Turkish stocks. But for the nation, the situation is desperate, and something will have to be done. A statement on Tuesday from the central bank suggests that the government may be intervening in currency markets to support the lira, but it does not have the reserves to do this at a meaningful scale. Edward Glossop, emerging markets economist at Abrdn, told me that the basic options at this point are rate increases and capital controls, but that Erdogan’s belligerent tone suggests rate rises are unlikely. “Soft touch” capital controls, like requiring conversion of hard currency deposits into lira within a certain window, may be the next step. Edward Al-Hussainy of Columbia Threadneedle argues, by contrast, that rate increases are becoming more likely by the day. The good news — for everyone except the Turks — is that the crisis has been caused primarily by bad policy that is unique to Turkey, and that there are few channels for it to spread elsewhere. As Jonas Goltermann of Capital Economics sums up, Turkish imports are not significant enough globally that their collapse would cause much external damage; foreign investment in Turkey has shrunk to become a small part of even emerging market-focused portfolios; and the Turkey mess is unlikely to make investors fear the possibility of crises in other markets, because everyone knows how uniquely bad Ankara’s policies are and how uniquely vulnerable its currency is.But this is not quite the whole story, because the strengthening dollar and the prospect of tightening US monetary policy are making the situation worse. In the past decade, the value of EM assets (stocks, bonds and currencies) has become increasingly sensitive to capital flows from the developed world, and therefore to the looseness of developed world financial policy. Here is 10 years of the MSCI Emerging Markets stock index, charted against the Goldman Sachs US financial conditions index, which tracks interest rates, dollar strength and stock market valuations: That is a strong relationship. It is notable, though, that US financial conditions have loosened this year, and EM assets have not strengthened. This is down to two factors: inflation and the mess in China, which is about a third of the MSCI EM index. Here is the S&P 500, the MSCI EM index and the MSCI EM index with China struck out over the past year:In the first half of this year, EM ex-China was outperforming US stocks; reflation, and the associated rise in commodity prices, provided a seemingly ideal environment. But in June, when inflation became truly hot, the ex-China index started tracking sideways, and in the last month, as the dollar has strengthened, US stocks have roared ahead. Emerging market central banks can’t afford to get cute with inflation the way the US can. They have to smother it quickly with growth-killing rate rises, and outside of Turkey most have done so. Tightening of US monetary policy is coming at a terrible time for Turkey — and a bad time for emerging markets generally. It is not surprising that EM assets are underperforming. What remains a slight puzzle, though, is the behaviour of risk assets in the developed world. They are, with the exception of a few super-speculative equities, acting as if tighter policy will do them no harm at all.Unhedged is no fan of the bitcoin exchange traded funds. They are opaque and expensive. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s fraud concerns mean that bitcoin ETFs are really bitcoin-futures ETFs, creating heavy “rollover” costs as expiring futures contracts are sold and expensive new ones bought.It didn’t take a genius to see this when the products made their debut, and it’s brutally obvious now. As Steve Johnson reported in the FT on Monday, only three bitcoin-futures ETFs have actually launched, compared to the dozen or so that filed with the SEC. Invesco ETF head Anna Paglia said the following after Invesco pulled it’s own bitcoin offering: “We ran a number of simulations and the cost of rolling the futures produced a drag of 60-80 basis points [a month]. We are talking about some big numbers, 5-10 per cent annualised. It was not going to be plain vanilla replication of the [bitcoin] index.”On the other hand.who cares? Bitcoin! Some $1.6bn has flowed into the three inaugural bitcoin ETFs — ProShares ($1.5bn), Valkyrie ($57m) and VanEck ($3m):We asked Valkyrie chief executive Leah Wald what’s going on. She told us demand was coming from institutional and retail investors alike, but for different reasons. For institutions, an ETF offers tax-exempt bitcoin exposure through retirement accounts, where it is impossible to hold bitcoin itself. The ETFs also help investors avoid dealing with annoying cryptocurrency exchanges or custody issues. We think this is bad — simplicity obscuring risk — but it’s logical.Asked why retail investors shouldn’t just buy from Coinbase or Robinhood and avoid the rollover costs, Wald pointed to the costs associated with directly trading crypto, including:Potential tax events with every purchase or sale of a cryptocurrency (tax guidance is ambiguous here);Blockchain transaction fees;Exchange withdrawal and transaction fees;Custodial and/or wallet fees.Some of these costs, according to Wald, are not transparent, and could be invisibly baked into the spread on a bitcoin trade. So savvier bitcoin investors may be reckoning that the ETF route is, in fact, more cost-effective than buying spot bitcoin.Even if you buy that line (we’re unsure) it’s hardly an affirmative pitch — it’s just an argument that owning physical bitcoin is costly, too. The success of the bitcoin ETFs, if it is sustained, amounts to a nasty criticism of bitcoin itself (Ethan Wu). OK, OK maybe team permanent is right about inflation.FT Asset Management — The inside story on the movers and shakers behind a multitrillion-dollar industry.

96  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.A year after tightening the bloc’s foreign investment screening regime, the European Commission put out some numbers yesterday that show most deals are still getting through. We’ll unpack the findings and what the challenges are when Chinese companies are changing their tactics in acquiring European assets.In economic news, the commission today is publishing its assessments of each member state’s budget plan for next year under the so-called European Semester.Later tonight, the largest group in the European parliament, the European People’s party, will vote in a secret ballot on who should succeed Manfred Weber as group chair next year. In the run are Roberta Metsola from Malta, Othmar Karas from Austria and Esther de Lange from the Netherlands.Meanwhile, Austria’s upcoming mandatory vaccination strategy is gathering support in neighbouring Germany — at least in some parts of the country. We’ll examine the pros and cons and what further Covid-19 restrictions kick in as of today.And Ireland’s data protection commissioner, Helen Dixon, tells Europe Express what her strategy for 2022 is when it comes to cases against large tech companies.Not too long ago, western countries boasted of the amount of foreign domestic investment they attracted. Now they brag about how much they have rejected, writes Andy Bounds in Brussels.Yesterday the European Commission published its first report on the FDI screening regulation, which came into force in October 2020. The report also examines actions by member states to rein in on what is seen as hostile takeovers of sensitive technology or strategic assets by companies from outside the EU.Both the bloc as such and at a national level, Europeans have followed the US and tightened their scrutiny over fears that Chinese groups could be plundering local technology from companies or using them to further Beijing’s foreign policy aims.Some 18 countries now have an FDI screening system and six more are planning one. The holdouts are Bulgaria, Croatia and Cyprus.The commission only examines sensitive deals that affect more than one member state or community programmes such as the Galileo satellite system. It cannot block deals itself but can ask national regulators to do so.Over the past year, the commission looked at 265 projects and put conditions or tried to block only eight. Officials confirmed to Europe Express that they included the purchase of Italian semiconductor company LPE by Shenzhen Investment Holdings.On the national side, member states’ regulators looked at a total of 1,793 cases and 80 per cent of FDI projects were approved without screening. Of those screened, just 2 per cent were blocked and 7 per cent aborted by one of the parties. Some 45 per cent of cases involved US purchasers, and just 8 per cent Chinese (though the Chinese share of FDI was just 2 per cent).But the regulation might already need adapting, warned Noah Barkin, an expert in Chinese-EU investment at Rhodium Group, a US consultancy.“China is shifting its approach,” he said. Chinese companies prefer to build their own factories in the EU rather than gain access by buying EU ones, which tends to attract scrutiny. “Greenfield investment has hit levels last seen in 2016,” Barkin told Europe Express.Chinese companies also look for smaller deals and use offshore structures to avoid attention, he added.“The EU needs to remain vigilant to track the shift in how Chinese firms approach the EU market,” Barkin said.The Wall Street Journal reported this month that Italian authorities have discovered that the 75 per cent stake in drone maker Alpi Aviation was sold via offshore vehicles to China Railway Rolling Stock Corp — a state-owned rail company — and an investment group controlled by the Wuxi municipal government.Scrutinising deals that are structured through offshore companies would require a whole different level of resources, both at a national and EU level, however. And that is unlikely to happen anytime soon, with commission officials admitting they are already struggling with the volume of cases.German officials long ruled out mandatory vaccinations. But with the rate of vaccine hesitancy still stubbornly high and new infections climbing, they are changing their tune, writes Guy Chazan in Berlin.The leaders of a number of German states — Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg and Schleswig-Holstein — have now called for the imposition of a universal vaccine mandate, similar to the one that Austria is to introduce.The prime minister of Hesse, Volker Bouffier, yesterday became the latest regional governor to come out in favour of obligatory jabs. “I think that it has to happen to permanently break these waves,” he said. All previous attempts to increase the vaccination rate had failed, he said. “Either we go from wave to wave and each time impose restrictions, or we succeed in raising the vaccination status,” he said.Others, though, are more sceptical. “Mandated vaccinations would come too late to stop the fourth wave of coronavirus,” said Andreas Bovenschulte, mayor of the northern port city of Bremen.Jens Spahn, the federal health minister, is also opposed.Even without a mandate, pressure is building on the vaccine holdouts.From today, employees will have to show either a vaccination certificate, proof that they have recovered from Covid-19, or a negative test result to attend their place of work. The same goes for passengers on Germany’s buses and trains.Some states are going further.Bavaria is today introducing contact restrictions for the unvaccinated, decreeing that only five people from two households can meet, not counting children under the age of 12, vaccinated people and those who have recovered from Covid-19.Thuringia, which has been hit particularly hard by the new wave, is to close all clubs, bars and discos, as well as Christmas markets, while restaurants will not be allowed to stay open beyond 10pm.Meanwhile, the case numbers keep rising. Germany recorded 45,326 new infections yesterday and 309 deaths from Covid-19. The number of cases per 100,000 over seven days reached 399.8 and the number of free beds in intensive care wards dropped about 300 to 2,400.Business activity in the eurozone picked up this month despite rising inflation driven by supply chain disruptions, rising energy costs and a rebound in Covid-19 cases. The survey showed services outperformed manufacturing for a third straight month, recording the strongest growth in activity for three months. (More here)The head of the Irish data privacy watchdog says her office will focus on high-risk cases next year, rather than pursuing every small complaint — in an attempt to stave off criticism about her alleged reluctance to go after Big Tech, writes Javier Espinoza in Brussels.A recent analysis showed how the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) had a huge number of complaints against large online platforms still unresolved. (Read about it here).Dublin has even received harsh criticism from its peers. Ulrich Kelber, head of Germany’s data protection watchdog, recently complained that his country alone had “sent more than 50 complaints about WhatsApp” to the Irish authorities, “none of which had been closed to date”.Now the IDPC is fighting back.Helen Dixon, the Irish data protection commissioner, told Europe Express that she will make the enforcement of big tech cases a higher priority.She said her office often gets bogged down with individual complaints that amount to not much as she seeks to dedicate resources to go after cases that involve the likes of Facebook or TikTok.“Some of the complaints we deal with can take up a lot of time but they don’t expose any systemic risks and there is no significant risk to the individual,” she said, adding that the watchdog will “push back” more on such cases.Dixon said pursuing cases on data breaches by Big Tech is “certainly one of the sub priorities” but rejected accusations that she’s not doing enough. She argued that the Irish authority became the lead enforcer only after the passing of privacy laws three years ago and that the system can only move at a certain pace.Dixon continues to face fresh criticism, however. Yesterday, Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems accused the IDPC of trying to prohibit him from publishing material in relation to a complaint against Facebook.“They basically deny us all our rights to a fair procedure unless we agree to shut up,” he said.The IDPC said: “As a matter of fairness to all parties, the integrity of the inquiry process should be respected and the confidentiality of information exchanged between the parties upheld.”
97  On my last visit to Istanbul, while passing along the Golden Horn in bright autumnal light, I came across a semi-deserted Ottoman tomb complex. A shady garden gave on to the courtyard of a mosque, behind which stood an octagonal tomb tower. This, I read, was the mausoleum of a long-forgotten Ottoman admiral, named Kilic Ali Pasha. The Pasha had distinguished himself fighting the massed navies of Christendom’s Holy League at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571. For his bravery in this disastrous battle — where 200 out of 230 Ottoman ships sank and some 50,000 of their seamen lost their lives, he was made the Kaptan Pasha, or High Admiral. In 1573 he went on to seize Christian Cyprus from the Venetians.Here, it seemed, was a figure who might be taken to personify the Clash of Civilisations — “The Terrible Turk” incarnate — until, that is, I discovered that Kilic Ali was actually a Calabrian named Occhiali who had chosen to convert to Islam to enter Ottoman service. Any assumption of some inevitable battle between the forces of Asia and Europe was further challenged when I read that the complex had been constructed by another Christian convert, the great Sinan, formerly an Armenian named Joseph, and that the mosque was modelled on the great Byzantine church of Haghia Sophia. During the same period, the most powerful Ottoman vizier was the eunuch Hasan Aga, formerly Samson Rowlie from Great Yarmouth, while the Ottoman general known as “Ingliz Mustapha” was in reality a Scot, a Campbell no less, who had embraced Islam and joined the Janissaries.Kilic Ali Pasha’s Istanbul tomb was situated in the perfect position for a man who lived such a cross-cultural life, balanced between two continents. Yet, for all its exoticism, Istanbul, the New Rome of the Emperor Constantine, has always been a European city. And while the Ottomans’ Turkic roots lay in Anatolia, and before that Central Asia, they nevertheless played a central part in European history: indeed at their peak, controlling one bank of the Danube, and encamped in the suburbs of Vienna, the Ottoman’s global empire governed nearly a quarter of Europe, including all of modern Serbia, Bosnia, Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Greece. They were also western Europe’s biggest trading partner. These are the central facts that underlie Marc David Baer’s magnificent new book, The Ottomans.“Like its language, the Ottoman Empire was not simply Turkish,” writes Baer, professor of international history at the London School of Economics. “Nor was it made up only of Muslims.Like the Roman Empire it was a multi-ethnic, multilingual, multiracial, multireligious empire.It was a European Empire that remains an integral part of European culture and history.”The Ottomans believed that their advance into Europe meant that they were the inheritors of Byzantium and should therefore be considered the new Romans. This was something that people around the world were once happy to acknowledge: “Arabs, Persians, Indian and Turks referred to the Ottoman rulers as Caesars and their dominion as the Roman Empire,” writes Baer. “Beginning with the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople, some Western European writers did too.Why have we forgotten what Europeans thought five hundred years ago? The Ottomans did not evolve in parallel with Europe; their story is the unacknowledged part of the story the West tells about itself.”Like a swift Ottoman caique cutting through the Sweet Waters of Asia, Baer’s taut prose splices stereotypes and makes us think twice about long-held assumptions. For an empire once so threatening to the outside world, the Ottomans remain today one of the least explored areas of global history: “the forgotten giant” as one Ottoman historian has called it. Today, if they are remembered at all, the Ottomans are usually dismissed in the west as aggressive but ultimately decadent and intellectually incurious warriors who controlled an old-fashioned land empire and who were ultimately defeated by the intellectual firepower of European science, then finally outflanked by its growing transcontinental sea power. Harvesting the fruits of a remarkable wave of recent scholarship, including his own long labours in the Topkapi Palace archives, Baer convincingly shows how comprehensively wrong all these different assumptions are.Baer opens his book with a wonderful description of working in the archives when he caught a glimpse of one of the great treasures of the collection, the map of the Ottoman admiral, Piri Reis, a predecessor of Kilic Ali Pasha: “At his own initiative, Piri Reis of Gallipoli, a former corsair.had drawn one of the earliest surviving maps of the coastline of the New World,” he writes. “He had based it on Columbus’s original, which is lost, and even interviewed a crew member from Columbus’s voyages. To produce for the sultan one of the most complete and accurate maps of the world, Piri Reis had consulted ancient Ptolemaic, medieval Arab, and contemporary Portuguese and Spanish maps.” Intent on rivalling the Portuguese from Iberia to Indonesia, the Ottomans were intent on keeping up with European discoveries. Other Ottoman admirals wrote books on astronomy and nautical science and compiled atlases and geographical treatises, though none matched Piri Reis’s great Book of the Sea (1526).Baer points out that the Ottomans were important players in what we tend to regard as the exclusively European Age of Discovery, that period of exploration which laid the foundations for three centuries of western colonialism. He shows how, following the Ottoman conquest of Egypt in the early 16th century, the Ottomans became a major maritime power in the Indian Ocean, where they battled their Portuguese enemies, and in the interlude before the establishment of Mughal power, even briefly took over the Indian ports of Surat and Diu. Indeed with “ships agile as sea serpents” they projected their power further still, aiming to control oceangoing trade to south-east Asia. No wonder the Sultans referred to themselves as “Lord of the Two Seas and Two Continents,” and “Masters of the Seven Climes”.The author ably demonstrates how for 200 years, from the mid-15th century, the Ottoman Empire was in fact the most powerful force in Eurasia. From behind the Sublime Porte, the Sultan and his Viziers ruled a patchwork of peoples, languages and religions across many times zones: decisions made in Constantinople affected millions across the globe. From his palace on the Bosphorus, the 16th-century Grand Vizier, Mehmed Sokollu Pasha, a Serbian convert from Christianity and son-in-law of Selim II, simultaneously planned canals between the Don and the Volga, and the Red Sea and the Mediterranean; one day he might send artillery experts to the Sultanate of Aceh, Sumatra, to cut off the Malacca Strait and dispatch agents to fan rebellion against the Portuguese across the Indian Ocean; the next, choose a new king of Poland to thwart the Russians; the third, dispatch “musketeers to fight as guerrillas on the side of Morisco rebels in Andalusia.” He ordered pictures from Venice and commissioned an eleven-arched bridge over the Drina river. His inner circle included “Jewish courtiers, Venetian ambassadors and members of the Ottoman Greek elite.”Ottoman merchants were equally innovative, cultivating tobacco and tomatoes, tapping into the rich vein of trade in spices and silk, building watches, clocks and eyeglasses and turning coffee into a global fad.Nor — at least at first — was this an intolerant empire. Although tensions always existed between Muslim rulers and the religious communities living under their capricious thumb — by modern standards, Christians and Jews, the dhimmi, were treated as second-class citizens — there was at least a kind of pluralist equilibrium — what Spanish historians have called convivencia or “living together” — which had no parallel in Christendom. When the Catholic kings evicted the Jews from Granada, they were granted asylum within the Ottoman Empire. Salonica soon had a Jewish majority.It was only when, as Baer puts it, “the Ottomans turned away from incorporating diversity that.tolerance was replaced by ethnic cleansing and genocide,” and the empire promptly collapsed, as a tidal wave of nationalist uprisings spread from Bulgaria and Greece, replacing multi-ethnic diversity with a series of mono-ethnic religious nationalisms. The last Sultans sealed their fate by condoning the anti-Armenian pogroms that culminated in the terrible massacres of 1915-16. Then, in the darkest moment in Turkish history, maybe 1.5m Armenians were starved, beaten or bayoneted to death in a genocide that is said to have inspired Hitler. In the aftermath, the Anatolian Greeks migrated to Greece, the Jews to Palestine, and those Armenians who survived, to a truncated soon-to-be-Soviet Armenia and the US.Until the twin forces of President Erdogan’s Neo-Ottomanism, and the Netflix Ottoman mega-drama Ertugrul reminded them, even the Turks had come to ignore an imperial past they had been taught by Ataturk to think of as the decadent “sick man of Europe”. Few western historians have had the knowledge of Ottoman Turkish to prove them wrong. Marc David Baer’s important and hugely readable book — a model of well-written, accessible scholarship — goes a long way to correct this.The Ottomans: Khans, Caesars and Caliphs by Marc David Baer, Basic Books $35/£30, 544 pagesWilliam Dalrymple’s ‘The Company Quartet’ is published by BloomsburyJoin our online book group on Facebook at FT Books CaféLetters in response to this article:Anatolian Greeks had a different name for it / From Vilma Nikolaidou, London E5, UKOttoman insecurity was behind printing press ban / From Imran Riffat, New York, NY, US
98  Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s defence of recent interest rate cuts and declaration of an “economic war of independence” has sent the lira plunging and left analysts wondering how much further he is willing to let the currency fall.Erdogan, who has sacked three central bank governors since mid-2019 and is a life-long opponent of high interest, has insisted that he will continue on the path of low rates in a quest to stimulate growth and investment. Forecasters including the IMF expect gross domestic product growth of 9 per cent this year — one of the fastest rates in the world.But with the lira falling 15 per cent on Tuesday, analysts warn that the currency volatility could severely damp future growth. Erdogan’s approach, they say, carries serious risks for the health of the country’s financial system and the broader economy — as well as the prospect of growing public discontent. They see four main pressure points.Turkish banks allow customers to hold deposits in foreign currencies as well as in lira. In recent years, Turks have increasingly opted to keep their money in dollars and euros as high inflation and low interest rates have eroded returns on lira savings. Foreign currency deposits make up 55 per cent of all deposits in the country’s banking sector — around $260bn — compared with 49 per cent in 2018.Analysts worry that dollar holdings could rise further, heaping more pressure on the lira and creating a vicious cycle.Their ultimate fear is that people will lose trust and seek to withdraw their cash, which happened on a small scale during the last currency crisis in summer 2018. “My concern is from this point on: would you want to keep your money in the Turkish banking sector?” said Phoenix Kalen, an emerging markets strategist at Société Générale.A full-blown run on the banks, when customers lose confidence and rush to withdraw their deposits, was last seen in Turkey in 2001. In such a scenario, the government could choose to impose capital controls, such as measures to make it harder to withdraw hard currency, although it has previously insisted it would not do so.Soaring prices are already at the top of Turkey’s political agenda. Annual inflation stood at almost 20 per cent in October, according to the Turkish statistical institute. Food price inflation, which was more than 27 per cent year on year in the same month, has hit low income households especially hard.Turkey’s reliance on imported goods, especially energy and raw materials, means a collapse in the currency translates quickly into higher prices. Jason Tuvey, of the consultancy Capital Economics, predicts inflation “is now likely to rise to 25 to 30 per cent over the next month or two”.High inflation risks fuelling more currency weakness and stifling growth as consumer confidence is hit. It could also further undermine public support for Erdogan, whose two-decade rule was for years associated with rising prosperity. The opposition, which won control of the country’s two largest cities in municipal elections after the 2018 crisis, wants early elections so they can capitalise on growing disquiet over the economy.The depleted net foreign exchange reserves of the central bank mean that its ability to intervene to defend the currency is limited. During previous bouts of lira weakness, including 2018, Turkey eventually announced emergency interest rate increases that halted the slide in the lira and tamed runaway inflation. But, in light of Erdogan’s tight grip on the central bank and his hints of more rate cuts, some analysts ask if this time is different.The government appears to have “tolerance for a weakening lira”, said Enver Erkan, an analyst at the Istanbul-based Terra Investment, adding that it was hard to predict how far policymakers would be willing to let it fall.Banks in Turkey are heavily reliant on borrowing from abroad to fund their lending at home.While foreign financing has remained resilient even in past episodes of extreme currency stress, such as in 2018, a sudden change in sentiment among foreign lenders could put the financial system under pressure.“In recent years Turkey has gone through multiple crises and we’ve seen banks retain quite reasonable access,” said Huseyin Sevinc, who covers Turkish banks at the rating agency Fitch. Lenders had this year been successfully rolling over their syndicated loans from abroad, he added.Banks “have significant foreign currency liquidity buffers to cover a brief market closure of around a year”, he said, but warned: “A prolonged market closure could carry significant risks.”During the 2018 currency crisis, when the lira fell as much as 18.5 per cent in a single day after a row with the US ignited broader investor concerns about the economy, one of the biggest worries was the ability of the country’s heavily indebted corporate sector to pay back dollar and euro denominated loans.Three years on, companies are in better shape, having deleveraged their external debt by $74bn, according to Barclays. Instead, some of that foreign debt has shifted to the public sector after the Treasury began issuing local debt denominated in foreign currency on the watch of former finance minister Berat Albayrak.The FX component of central government debt reached 60 per cent of the total last month — up from 39 per cent in 2017. That means that as the currency slides it becomes more expensive for the Treasury to service its debt burden.Turkey’s overall debt-to-GDP ratio is still low compared with that of its emerging market peers, at around 40 per cent of GDP. But analysts say the rising cost of debt servicing could limit the government’s fiscal space at a time when it is planning to increase giveaways as elections loom.Letter in response to this article:Manzoni’s novel throws light on the lira collapse / From Jan Bouwens, Professor of Accounting, Amsterdam Business School, The Netherlands
99  Germany’s financial regulator BaFin is set to have to cut its ties to banking lobbyists and ensure it does not take orders from the finance ministry under rules being proposed by Brussels in the wake of the Wirecard scandal.The draft legislation would stop bank supervisors across the EU “seeking or taking instructions” or being influenced by any external body, including companies they regulate or government agencies. It will also tighten up rules on regulatory staff trading in the shares of supervised companies.“Recent developments such as the Wirecard scandal showed the need for clearer and more operational provisions on the principle of the independence of supervisors. This is included in our proposal,” said a commission official.The provisions are being scrutinised in Germany. BaFin was heavily criticised for its handling of the scandal involving Wirecard, the payments group that collapsed in 2020 after revealing a multiyear fraud.A report by the European Securities and Markets Authority last year raised questions about BaFin’s independence from political interference, pointing to the fact that the regulator was closely updating the finance ministry about its work “in some cases before actions were taken”. The report also flagged trading in Wirecard shares by some of BaFin’s team members as “concerning”. The measures now suggested by Brussels are part of banking legislation proposed by the European Commission to strengthen financial supervision across the EU.Sebastian Mack, Policy Fellow for European Financial Markets at the Jacques Delors Centre in Berlin, said the provisions, which are part of a broader regulatory package, “would massively strengthen the operational independence of BaFin and other national supervisors”.BaFin has three finance industry representatives on a 17-member administrative council that monitors its management and sets its budget. It also has a separate advisory board with industry representatives. These representatives would probably have to leave under Brussels’ plans.Germany’s finance ministry believes the draft would not require a new legal set-up for BaFin, according to a person familiar with the discussions.Berlin believed BaFin had always been independent to make decisions on individual banks, the person said, while a parliamentary inquiry into the Wirecard case showed that this was respected by the finance ministry.The finance ministry said: “We welcome the European Commission’s proposal for the adjustment of the capital requirements directives,” adding that the measures were still being negotiated in Brussels.The ministry said Germany favoured strong and effective supervision with operating independence but said the country’s constitution demanded that all government authorities needed to have parliamentary oversight.The Association of German Banks, whose chief executive Christian Ossig is on BaFin’s administrative council and advisory board, told the Financial Times that this did not impair the regulator’s independence.“The administrative council has no say over the regulatory activities nor with regard to appointing top executives,” it said, adding that there was “currently no need to change the board’s composition” and that discussions in the advisory council were “useful for both sides”.Gerhard Schick, a former Green MP who is the chief executive of Bürgerbewegung Finanzwende, a German consumer finance lobby group, told the FT that “the financial industry’s lobby have no place in financial regulators”, adding that it would be a “good step” if the proposals would be implemented.Mack, of the Jacques Delors Centre, said the commission’s proposal to prohibit supervisors from seeking and taking instructions would stop the finance ministry controlling “the appropriateness and the legality” of BaFin’s decisions.But he added: “As long as the head of the authority can be dismissed at any time and without giving reasons, the authority remains structurally dependent on the government.”The commission said when the new rules were released in October that “recent developments” had shown the need for clearer and more operational provisions on the principle of independence of competent authorities.BaFin declined to comment.
100  The EU has proposed that developing countries be allowed to manufacture Covid-19 vaccines, softening its defence of drug companies’ intellectual property.Valdis Dombrovskis, trade commissioner, who had opposed a plan to reduce IP protection, has now said he could support limited exemptions.India and South Africa are pushing for the abolition of IP controls, so domestic producers could replicate products from the likes of AstraZeneca and Pfizer without paying them royalties.Dombrovskis offered a targeted waiver on compulsory licences, which would allow governments to compel manufacturers to hand over their formulas to create cheaper forms of their drug.He offered few details but added: “This solution could facilitate production of vaccines and other essential health products, which are key for regions such as Africa, while preserving incentives for innovation and investment.“The protection of patents is crucial in this respect, as they are essential for countries that want to attract investment and to have transfer of technology, in order to develop their own production capacity.“We still hope to have consensus in this crucial matter in the days ahead, and we will maintain strong engagement to that end.”Trade ministers will meet at the World Trade Organization in Geneva next week with vaccines high on the agenda.While rich countries are delivering third booster jabs, many in the developing world remain unvaccinated.The US supports a full waiver of IP rights but the EU says this would reduce the incentive for companies to spend billions researching new drugs.The EU move will raise hopes of a WTO deal next week but India has so far rejected any compromise. Its joint proposal with Pretoria calls for any drug that could treat Covid to be stripped of IP protection for three years.Dombrovskis said: “IP is only one piece in a big jigsaw. Collaboration with industry and investment in production capacity plays a much bigger part.”
101  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
102  The Turkish lira suffered a historic retreat after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan praised a recent interest rate cut and declared that his country was fighting an “economic war of independence”.The currency, which is down more than 40 per cent against the dollar this year, plunged as much as 15 per cent on Tuesday — a drop that eclipsed even Turkey’s currency crisis of 2018 — and broke through the symbolic threshold of 13 to the dollar after Erdogan used a combative speech to expound his vision for the country’s economy. The fall eased to around 11 per cent in mid-afternoon dealings in London.“It’s like a horror film,” said Enver Erkan, an analyst at the Istanbul-based Terra Investment, adding that it was hard to say how much further the currency would plunge given that policymakers appeared willing to simply let it fall.“This is the inevitable consequence of Erdogan’s war on rates,” said Uday Patnaik, head of emerging market debt at Legal & General Investment Management. “The thing that would stop the freefall is some sign of an independent central bank in Turkey. But there’s not much prospect of that. Erdogan’s the type of guy who likes to keep doubling down.”Erdogan, a life-long opponent of high interest rates, declared in an address on Monday night that he was “pleased” the central bank had cut rates for the third consecutive month last week, despite warnings from economists that it would stoke inflation, which is already running at an annual rate of 20 per cent, and further destabilise the currency.Painting a picture of a dark global conspiracy aimed at subjugating Turkey, Erdogan said the country would not give in to economists, “opportunists” and “global financial acrobats” calling for interest rate rises.The government was prioritising growth, he said, in order to encourage investment, production, exports and employment. “That’s why we pay no attention to the clamour of the doomsayers,” he said.He compared the struggle to the one the nation fought against foreign occupiers in the aftermath of the first world war, which culminated in the foundation of the modern Turkish republic in 1923. “With the help of God and the support of our people, we will emerge victorious from this war of economic independence,” he said.The collapse in the currency prompted outrage from Turkey’s opposition parties, including those led by former allies of the Turkish president.Ali Babacan, who for years served as an economy chief in Erdogan’s government and now heads the opposition Deva party, accused him of “bankrupting” the country.Ahmet Davutoglu, a former prime minister and one-time chair of Erdogan’s ruling Justice and Development party, went further. “This is no longer ignorance, this is treachery,” he wrote on Twitter.Turkey’s central bank, which has faced growing interference from the president, last month sought to argue that rate cuts would help to stabilise the plummeting currency and soaring inflation by erasing the country’s chronic current account deficit.Economists warn that such logic is flawed, and say that allowing the lira to spiral risks creating hyperinflation in a country that is heavily reliant on imported energy and raw materials.The currency briefly trimmed its losses following reports that Erdogan was meeting central bank officials. However, it resumed its decline after the central bank published a statement saying that financial market moves were “unrealistic and completely detached from economic fundamentals”, but offered no hint of a change of tack in monetary policy.Analysts at Goldman Sachs said the lira’s declines were being driven by the negative interest rates faced by Turkish savers when accounting for blistering inflation, rather than an exodus of foreign investors or worries about Turkey’s trade deficit, factors which have triggered past sell-offs in the currency. “We think the pressures will only subside after a change in policy,” Goldman said in a note to clients.The sharp slide in the currency also threatens further eroding living standards at a time when Erdogan is already facing mounting public anger at the rising cost of basic goods.One Turkish banker described the lira’s slide as “a policymaker-induced currency shock” that had been actively chosen by the government.“The choice is clear,” he said. “They are just implementing their strategy now. This is the new approach.”Semih Tumen, a former central bank deputy governor who was last month among several senior officials sacked by the president, spoke publicly for the first time since his firing as the currency tumbled to call on the government to “abandon this irrational experiment that has no chance of success”.He wrote on Twitter: “We need to immediately return to high-quality policies that will protect the value of the lira and the welfare of the Turkish people.”Letter in response to this article:Turkey’s currency crisis and the threat of contagion / From Professor Costas Milas, Management School, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK
103  The EU wants to force the likes of Facebook and Google to reveal how they target people with political advertising, as it tries to shine a light on the murky world of online campaigning.A draft of new legislation, seen by the Financial Times, suggests that tech companies should disclose the number of people targeted by a political ad, how long the ad runs for, and the methods they use to choose who sees it.The document warned that the way in which large internet companies had used people’s data to target them with political ads had had “negative effects” on “their freedoms of opinion and of information, to make political decisions and exercise their voting rights”.Facebook has earned almost $3bn in the US since May 2018 from ads about social issues, elections or politics, while Google has earned $810m.While political advertising is only a small fraction of the two companies’ overall revenues, there have been repeated complaints that the current system allows political parties to target voters without any transparency.Vera Jourova, the European Commission vice-president for values and transparency, this month told an audience in Lisbon that digital advertising for political purposes “is the unchecked race of dirty and opaque methods”.“We have to hit the ‘slow down’ button, because our democracy is too precious,” she said. “The right to speak does not mean the right to reach.”The rules will make political parties label their ads and force companies working on so-called issues-based advertising to clearly identify which political party is funding an ad.The regulation is expected to enter into force before the end of the current European parliament in 2024. The tougher rules will also force users on Twitter to identify anyone who is sponsoring their posts.Companies that break the rules face a fine of up to 5 per cent of turnover in line with the privacy rules in place in the bloc, the draft proposals say. The enforcement will be handed to national authorities.Once the draft legislation is published the text will be discussed between the member states, the parliament and the commission in a “trialogue” discussion.A clampdown on the way large online platforms treat political advertising is part of a wider movement in Brussels to address the power of Big Tech.Google and Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
104  Business activity in the eurozone picked up this month despite surging inflation driven by supply chain disruptions, rising energy costs and higher wages, which together with a rebound in Covid-19 cases damped sentiment.The eurozone IHS Markit flash composite purchasing managers’ survey, a monthly poll that takes the pulse of business activity, showed costs and average selling prices for goods and services rising at the fastest pace since the survey began in 1998.Businesses reported that shortages were driving up prices for many goods and services, alongside higher shipping costs, rising energy prices and increases in staff costs. Selling price inflation also accelerated in both manufacturing and services to the fastest recorded by the survey as companies sought to pass higher costs on to customers, most notably in Germany.However, the headline eurozone IHS Markit flash composite purchasing managers’ index, a measure of the health of the economy, unexpectedly increased to a two-month high of 55.8 in November from 54.2 in the previous month.The figure, based on data collected between November 12 and 19, was stronger than the drop to 53.2 forecast by economists polled by Reuters, reflecting higher than expected readings for Germany and France.Official data published by Eurostat earlier this month showed that headline eurozone inflation rose to 4.1 per cent in October, the fastest pace since the creation of the currency union, and Tuesday’s data point to a further increase in November.European Central Bank board member Isabel Schnabel told Bloomberg that while it was “plausible” to assume inflation was going to drop below the ECB target of 2 per cent in the medium term, the risks to inflation were “skewed to the upside”.Jessica Hinds, economist at Capital Economics, said that the unexpected rise in the eurozone composite PMI in November “suggests that the region’s recovery has not lost further momentum”, but added that “with supply shortages still acute, Covid restrictions being tightened and price pressures intensifying, renewed falls in the index seem likely”.Chris Williamson, at IHS Markit, said the stronger expansion of business activity in November “was unlikely to prevent the eurozone from suffering slower growth in the fourth quarter.” He added that due to the combination of supply delays, soaring costs and renewed Covid worries, business optimism had sunk to the lowest since January, “adding to near-term downside risks for the eurozone economy”.The survey showed services outperformed manufacturing for a third straight month, recording the strongest growth in activity for three months.Growth also picked up in manufacturing, driven by robust demand for tech equipment, household goods, and food and drink. In contrast, growth was held back by a third successive monthly drop in production in the autos sector, which was severely affected by supply chain disruptions.Across the eurozone manufacturers, suppliers’ delivery times increased at one of the steepest rates on record, easing only modestly from October, due to supply shortages and transport problems.Businesses continued to hire workers at a fast pace but they nonetheless accumulated backlogs of work, particularly in German factories.Growth accelerated in Germany and France, with the latter recording the sharpest rise in services activity for nearly four years, which offset a second successive monthly drop in factory output. Markit also reported that the rest of the region enjoyed faster growth of both manufacturing and services than seen in France and Germany.The ECB’s Schnabel said stricter Covid restrictions were “likely to have a moderating effect on activity in the short run,” in particular in the contact-intensive services sector. “But I do not think that this will derail the overall recovery.”
105  The Parisian waiter bends over the candle at an empty table and fiddles with it. He then repeats the ritual at each adjoining table. Finally, I realise what he is doing: he is aligning the candles into a perfect line, just as the nearby Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel is perfectly aligned with the Arc de Triomphe. The waiter straightens himself, triumphant: he has perfected the ground-floor café of Paris’s new Madame Rêve hotel. In this underlit room of warm wooden colours and eight-metre ceilings, almost everybody striding along the oak floors looks beautiful.The people who put together the hotel have the Parisian eye, which can alight on the tiniest blemish in a room: a woman wearing the wrong colours, a tasteless bag sticking out from a stall, a foreigner talking too loudly. An imaginary red alert flashes on the blemish, and perfection is restored. In 2021, the Parisian eye has been applied not just to Madame Rêve but to the entire 1st arrondissement. For good and bad, central Paris has undergone top-end cosmetic surgery.The 1st is more or less the geographical heart of Paris and therefore, arguably, of the world. It’s a tiny arrondissement, just 1.83 sq km, much of which consists of the Louvre, the Tuileries Garden and the Forum des Halles shopping centre. The building that has become Madame Rêve originally opened in 1888 as a giant, arcaded post office, a kind of Haussmannian people’s palace. At the time, the 1st was a packed and booming neighbourhood with perhaps 70,000 inhabitants. There were fabulous parties and newly rich industrialists prowling for excitement. A few steps from the post office were the Bourse de commerce and the food market at Les Halles, the “belly of Paris”. Around the corner but still inside the arrondissement, the Samaritaine department store showcased the luxuries of the age.Later the arrondissement faded. The Bourse lost its grandeur. The Halles market was torn down in 1971 and re-arose as a hideous, mostly underground shopping mall. Until recently, quite ordinary people could afford to live in the 1st. In early 2002, when I moved to Paris, apartment prices in the arrondissement averaged less than €4,000 per sq m.The 1st’s marginalisation continued with La Samaritaine’s closure in 2005. Meanwhile, the quartier’s arcaded main drag, the Rue de Rivoli, degenerated into an angry traffic jam with mid-range shops. The post office was the last monument to go. It has a place in Parisian popular culture as the city’s only “la Poste” that stayed open nights. Everyone has stories of arriving here at five minutes to midnight to pay taxes and get the all-important stamp showing you had beaten the French state’s deadline. But as administration moved online and people stopped sending letters, the massive post office became redundant. It too closed in 2015. After that, you would come to the 1st for the Louvre, the Tuileries or work, but not for much else. In 2018 the arrondissement had just 16,093 inhabitants.The revival began with the second conversion of Les Halles in 2016, this time into a park and passable shopping mall with an open, canopied roof. But the arrondissement’s full makeover has occurred in just the past 18 months. After the pandemic hit, the Rue de Rivoli was closed to cars and turned into a cycling street with four bike lanes. Suddenly, you could get from the Louvre to almost anywhere in central Paris in 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a locked-down world hungry for beauty, the global success of the Netflix series Call My Agent!, about a fictional talent agency located at 149 Rue St Honoré in the 1st, restored some of the arrondissement’s glamour.Last May, the Bourse reopened, now housing the billionaire François Pinault’s contemporary art collection. A month later, La Samaritaine, owned by Pinault’s billionaire rival Bernard Arnault, emerged from its 16-year makeover. Madame Rêve joined them in October. In 2024 the Fondation Cartier for contemporary art is scheduled to arrive, moving from southern Paris to a new home on the Place du Palais-Royal, five minutes’ walk from the hotel. Boosters of the 1st say it’s replacing the chicest section of the 8th as the city’s new “triangle d’or” — golden triangle. Given the wealth pouring in, “gold” may be understating it. Apartment prices in the 1st have already nearly quadrupled this century, to more than €12,000 per sq m.Laurent Taïeb, creator of Madame Rêve, has one thing in common with Donald Trump: in 2016 the latter converted Washington DC’s Old Post Office into the Trump International Hotel, currently being sold and renamed after being tarred by his presidency. But Taïeb, previously a designer of cafés and restaurants, says: “My point of departure was to respect the history and to cite it.” Madame Rêve’s café, for instance, retains the immense ceilings and pillars of the old post office’s dispatch room.In Madame Rêve, explains Taïeb, the ground floor evokes the 1880s. The upper two levels, built on top of the former post office, carry the visitor back into the 21st century. Almost everywhere in the hotel you are sublimely aware of Paris. This isn’t one of those standard-issue luxury palaces where you could be in Los Angeles or Macau. Half of the 82 rooms, which are all on the same floor, overlook the Haussmannian rooftops and the neighbouring 17th-century St-Eustache church. St-Eustache isn’t quite Notre-Dame, and Taïeb could surely have built a better church himself, but he praises its “haunted castle” aspect. His other rooms overlook a soothing interior garden, because the new theme of Parisian architecture is the “vegetalisation” of this hitherto stone city. The rooms are decorated with 800 items of philately-themed art that Taïeb bought from an anonymous collector. Very unusually for Paris, many rooms have terraces.The pride of Madame Rêve will be its rooftop bar, which opens next spring, and where you will feel you are in a Disney film of Paris. In a four-minute stroll around the plant-filled, tree-lined roof, you can take in the Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame, the Panthéon, the Sacré-Coeur church, the Pompidou Centre and also, unfortunately, the 1973 Montparnasse Tower. Taïeb, excited by the new trend of remote work, hopes that Parisians and laptop-carrying nomadic workers alike will throng the roof and the hotel’s two restaurants. And as if to claim absolution for this palace of international consumption, rooftop solar panels will provide half the building’s hot water.Inside, Taïeb’s eye and nose have perfected every detail. The lifts and corridors are scented with the hotel’s signature perfume, a mix (I am told) of rose and cedar. The lamp fittings are in the shape of a woman’s décolleté with corset — a nod to the imaginary Madame Rêve herself, title character of Alain Bashung’s 1991 song. Taïeb brought in the best French craftspeople to create vases and numerous other objects that draw on a late 19th-century aesthetic. Wandering around the hotel, you sometimes feel that the only blot on this landscape is you.I asked Taïeb, a disarmingly cheerful, hoarse-voiced bald man, whether the beauty of his hotel was intimidating. “Of course,” he admitted. “It can be. But we have tried to create an emotional pathway.”My pathway was more hedonic. In the downstairs café with its Sardinian chef and Mediterranean cuisine, I had arguably the best squid I’ve ever eaten. The upstairs restaurant, La Plume, about to open, will be Japanese-French. The highlight of my stay was a 90-minute massage in the spa. I don’t think I have ever actually felt relaxed, but I have read about it in books and this is what it must be like.Every time I left Madame Rêve I was assailed by Fear of Missing Out, but I dutifully explored everything within a seven-minute walk. The gardens of the Palais-Royal are possibly the best stroll in Paris, and sufficiently hidden away to remain one of this city’s least overcrowded beauty spots. Pinault’s collection at the Bourse was perfectly enjoyable. Behind it, the Forum des Halles — the traditional entryway to Paris from the suburbs by local train — is an open garden where a much more proletarian crowd sits eating takeaway lunches. Les Halles has gone from eyesore to democratic public space — a necessity in a city whose people are cooped up in tiny apartments.The new Samaritaine is more than a shop. It aspires, fabulously, to be a Parisian monument. The staff member who helped me jostle through the throng one recent weekday afternoon said that in the first three months since reopening, the “Samar” notched up 1.5m visitors, far more than expected. The new shop offers a mix of Parisian high style and “street”. The English word has become a term of praise in upmarket Paris and can denote anything from street fashion to street architecture to La Samaritaine’s “Street Caviar by Prunier”, which sells caviar sandwiches or even burgers to take out. Outside, on the newly pedestrianised Rue de la Monnaie, Parisians sit in the sun admiring the store’s twin facades: one an impeccable example of art nouveau, its neighbour impeccable art deco. Only in Paris. Here’s a shopping experience Amazon cannot replace.As I said goodbye to the high life, I felt that central Paris had jumped from gentrification to plutocratisation. Even many people in the 1 per cent of French incomes can no longer afford to buy here. In another era, the post office and perhaps the Bourse might have been converted into housing. Instead, practically the only members of the lower orders still living in the 1st are the poor souls freezing in sleeping bags on the Rue de Rivoli at night. I put it to Taïeb that today’s arrondissement of millionaires and monuments recalls the inequality of the 1880s. “Certainly,” he said. “But everyone can enjoy it. You can get a coffee in our café that costs about the same as in other Paris cafés. Anyone can walk into the Samaritaine.”It’s true. Paris is morphing from a place to live in, or even an open-air museum, into an open-air luxury department store to drop into. You can lament the change, but no city could have accomplished it more elegantly.
106  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.EU’s barely six-month-old digital Covid-19 certificate, announced with great fanfare in July as a means to boost travel across the bloc, is facing some existential problems.The European Commission had designed the system to be valid for a year, but some countries have gone ahead and limited the validity of people’s vaccination status to as short as six months from the second shot.We’ll bring you up to speed with the latest thinking and what to expect tomorrow when the commission puts forward its proposals on how to keep the pass alive even as countries have very different approaches to booster jabs.Meanwhile, in Germany, the central bank has thrown its weight behind hawkish voices calling for a speedy return to fiscal rules. In its latest monthly report, the Bundesbank is seeing no reason why the suspension of the country’s “debt brake” shouldn’t end as soon as next year.And in Swedish politics, the country’s potential new prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, is facing an uphill struggle in cobbling together the majority needed both for her taking office and for passing the country’s budget.Resurgent infection rates in the EU are again raising the spectre of a fragmented approach to battling Covid-19 between different member states, write Sam Fleming and Mehreen Khan in Brussels.In an attempt to keep a lid on the disharmony, the European Commission has been discussing an update to its digital Covid-19 certificate, which has been seen as a success story when it comes to reviving free movement between member states over the summer holidays.Stella Kyriakides, the EU health commissioner, confirmed yesterday that Brussels is working with the “utmost urgency” to ensure rules for free movement within the union remain co-ordinated. That meant looking at the length of the validity of the certificates and the role of boosters, she told MEPs.At issue is evidence of waning immunity after two vaccinations, which is raising the question of how long the certificates should last. One of the options is to set the validity at up to 12 months after the second jab. But the commission is also looking at how to recognise boosters on the certificates.Kyriakos Mitsotakis, prime minister of Greece, last week said a third jab should be required after six months to keep the certificates valid.Brussels would come up with “specific proposals” on free movement and the certificates this week, Kyriakides told the European parliament in Strasbourg yesterday, as she stressed the risks of fragmentation. “We are aware we need to give clear, coherent messages to citizens.”Administering booster shots poses a practical and technical issue in many parts of the EU. Not only is access to additional jabs varied across member states, but in countries where they are available, recipients may not always have the shots logged in their digital Covid-19 certificates.The French government has said that over-65s will have their existing vaccine passes annulled by December 15 unless they have received a booster or if they are still within six months of their second jab. Austria earlier this month lowered the expiration date from 12 to nine months after the second shot.European affairs ministers will discuss boosters and broader co-ordination over social restrictions at a meeting in Brussels this morning. Some diplomats are already warning that any commission attempts to impose binding new legal requirements on how and when Covid passes should be valid, will be met with short shrift. “This is still for governments to decide,” said one diplomat.Germany’s central bank has said the country’s new government should reinstate the rules of Germany’s “debt brake” next year — advice that could prove hard for some of the coalition partners to accept, writes Guy Chazan in Berlin.The debt brake, which is inscribed in the German constitution, puts strict limits on new government borrowing. It was suspended when the coronavirus pandemic necessitated a massive ramp-up in spending to save the country’s economy from collapse, and will not apply in 2022 either.But in its latest monthly report, the Bundesbank says it should be reinstated next year. There is, it says, “good reason to believe that 2022 will not be a crisis year”. “This means that there should be comparatively little need for pandemic-related government expenditures,” it adds.The bank says there is a “general expectation”, partly reflected in the German government’s own forecasts, that “normal economic conditions” will return soon, and cites the latest estimates that tax revenues will probably exceed pre-crisis expectations.Based on that, any decision to suspend the debt brake for another year “does not appear warranted as things stand”. “At all events, it would be extremely difficult to justify financing non-crisis-related budgetary burdens through borrowing made possible by the [temporary suspension of the debt brake],” it says.The Bundesbank’s intervention comes with negotiations still ongoing between the Social Democrats (SPD), Greens and liberals on forming a new “traffic light” coalition government — talks in which fiscal policy has emerged as a big bone of contention.The liberals (FDP) want a quick return to fiscal orthodoxy while the Greens campaigned on a platform of reforming the debt brake to allow for massive investments in halting climate change and upgrading Germany’s shabby infrastructure.Though the coalition partners are staying mum, it is believed that one compromise solution would see the creation of off-balance sheet funds that wouldn’t count towards budgetary spending. That would allow the new government to ramp up investment while still complying with the debt brake.The Bundesbank is sceptical. Such reform ideas are, it suggests, just a way of “hollowing out and circumventing the debt brake”. They would mean that Germany would no longer be in compliance with European fiscal rules, it adds. (Those fiscal rules are also suspended, at least until 2023, and several countries are asking for a revamp that would allow more carve-outs for investments.)The bank says that if the new government wants to change Germany’s restriction on new borrowing, the reforms “should be discussed openly and, where necessary, given a new legal grounding”. But it’s very much of the opinion that such changes are not really needed. “The debt brake has proved its worth so far, and adjustments do not appear urgently necessary,” it says.An increasing number of EU member states are luring the super-rich with preferential tax deals: between 1994 and 2020, the number of special tax regimes has increased more than fivefold, according to this study published by EU Tax Observatory. The most attractive tax regimes have been created by Italy, Greece, Cyprus and Portugal, the study shows.Sweden’s special kind of political turmoil is continuing with Magdalena Andersson still far from certain of becoming the country’s first female prime minister, writes Richard Milne, Nordic and Baltic Correspondent.Tomorrow promises to be a day of high drama in Sweden’s parliament. First up will come a vote on whether Andersson, the new leader of the centre-left Social Democrats, will become prime minister to succeed Stefan Lofven who resigned earlier this month.She needs to ensure a majority does not vote against her; in practice, that means she needs the backing of both the far-left Left party and the nominally centre-right Centre. Centre appear to be on board but have demanded the Left have no influence over the government.Talks between Andersson and the Left failed to make a breakthrough over the weekend so the Social Democrat leader will spend the next 24 hours frantically negotiating with the ex-Communists, who have made it clear they will vote against her absent an agreement.The second vote, tomorrow afternoon, will be on next year’s budget, which Andersson formulated in her role as finance minister. Lofven was twice forced to rule with an opposition centre-right budget, a fate she will be desperate to avoid.The short-term backdrop to all this uncertainty and frantic behaviour is that if Andersson fails to gain support to become prime minister, early elections in three or four months’ time are possible. Elections would then have to be held again, as scheduled, in September. Few parties want two votes within a year.The longer-term reason, as this piece explains, is the rise of the rightwing Sweden Democrats. They are getting close to their goal of establishing a conservative bloc, together with two more mainstream centre-right parties.

107  Fidelity, UBS and State Street Global Advisors have confirmed that, like rivals BlackRock and Invesco, they are looking into the potential of offering exposure to cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin.Assets in European exchange traded products and mutual funds with cryptocurrency exposure have topped €10.5bn, according to Morningstar data, showing the potential appeal of these products for asset managers.XBT, part of CoinShares, is the largest provider in Europe, with assets of €5.4bn across eight products domiciled in Sweden and Jersey, followed by Swiss group 21Shares, which manages €2.1bn across its range.Matteo Andreetto, head of SSGA’s SPDR exchange traded fund business for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said: “Clearly, we are looking at the space and evaluating the way the space is evolving.This article was previously published by Ignites Europe, a title owned by the FT Group.“Clients are not only asking about cryptocurrencies but also specifically SPDR crypto products. They like the fact we are a robust, safe pair of hands.”Fidelity said it was “keeping close to the evolution of cryptocurrencies [.] as part of a wider exploration of the potential for digital assets, and the distributed ledger technology that sits behind them”.“As you would expect, Fidelity International is exploring the potential of this technology for the benefit of clients,” Fidelity added.Clemens Reuter, global head of ETFs at UBS Asset Management, said: “[Cryptocurrency is] an area everyone needs to look at the moment.” However, he added: “As of today, we have not decided to launch anything.”In May, Invesco told Ignites Europe that it was “investigating” digital asset exposure for ETPs.Jose Garcia-Zarate, associate director, passive strategies at Morningstar, said he expected more cryptocurrency products to be launched as part of the “gimmicky” trend.“ETFs lend themselves to these sorts of exposures,” he added.However, the asset managers also pointed to the hurdles involved in entering the cryptocurrency space.Reuter noted that investing in cryptocurrencies was not yet permitted for Ucits funds.Andreetto said SSGA would not launch an ETF until the group was “sure” it could reach the “very high bar” to sit alongside its other ETFs and “have all the features of [a] SPDR product”.“Moving into an ETP would be a deviation for us,” he adds.European ETPs and funds giving cryptocurrency exposure generated an average return of 461.7 per cent over the 12 months to the end of October. They have achieved an annualised return of 116.3 per cent over three years, Morningstar data show.But Garcia-Zarate said investors should be “careful what they wish for” with cryptocurrency products.Investors “need very in-depth due diligence” to understand how cryptocurrencies and related futures markets work, he said.*Ignites Europe is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

108  The EU’s ambition to encourage retail investing in Europe will be dealt a big blow if authorities ban brokers from selling customer orders on to market makers, one of the region’s largest stock-trading apps has warned.Known as payment for order flow, the practice has come under intense scrutiny in the US as the volatility unleashed by the pandemic drew more retail investors into financial markets.Critics say it encourages brokers to put more effort into selling orders to market makers, who then find a price for the trade, rather than seeking out the best price for their customers themselves.However, Christian Hecker, chief executive of Trade Republic, a German trading start-up that has more than a million customers, said that a further tightening of the rules in Europe would lead to higher costs for retail customers making small trades.Brokers such as Trade Republic say that income generated from selling orders helps keep upfront trading fees low for retail investors who typically buy and sell a smaller quantity of shares. Hecker said the median trade size on Trade Republic is €450.“There is a very important question at hand that will determine the future of markets for retail individuals,” said Hecker. “I think there is some blurry fear of payment for order flow”.European authorities have said they want to see more people investing their money in the market in an effort to swell retirement savings threatened by persistently low interest rates.The intervention from Trade Republic, which was valued at $5bn this year and counts US venture capitalist firm Sequoia among its backers, comes as the EU prepares to toughen rules in the region, where the practice is banned in many countries but permitted in Germany.According to a draft proposal seen by the Financial Times, the European Commission is minded to formalise a ban on the practice in a move that would force national regulators to enforce it. The proposals are expected to be published on Tuesday.Banning the practice would “likely lead to higher prices for consumers, spreads that are worse and exchanges that are going to make more money,” said Hecker. "This would hurt low income investors. It’s the opposite of what is intended.”Like US peers Robinhood, Schwab and E*Trade, Trade Republic has relied on selling customer orders as the industry shifts to offering share trading with only a minimal upfront fee.Trade Republic said a study by three academics found that its use of payment for order flow, trading through the Hamburg exchange, delivered better prices for its customers than if it had tried to execute the trades itself on the Frankfurt exchange, Germany’s biggest equity venue.However, Edward Monrad, head of European equity market structure at market maker Optiver in Amsterdam, welcomed the prospect of greater clarity on how the practice is regulated in Europe.“Some member states allow PFOF, while others forbid it, which has created a confusing patchwork of regulation,” he said.
109  How do you honour the spirit of the constitution while, potentially, breaching the letter? That is the conundrum facing Hungary’s opposition coalition as it prepares for parliamentary elections in April. Opponents of Viktor Orban, the country’s illiberal premier, sense his defeat is within their grasp. But if Orban were to lose the vote — and it remains a big if given his propaganda machine — he would, they contend, continue to exert power through a “deep state” of officials loyal to his rightwing nationalist Fidesz party. Fidesz control is locked in place by a constitution which Orban reformed to his advantage after returning to power in 2010.Peter Marki-Zay, the small-town conservative mayor chosen in a primary as opposition leader for next year’s poll, told the Financial Times earlier this month that the premier had “built up a system which grants him exclusive power and which makes him pretty much irreplaceable and invincible”. So the opposition would hold a referendum on reforming it within 60 days of winning the election, Marki-Zay said. The problem is that many legal experts say the constitution cannot be changed by plebiscite but only by a two-thirds vote in parliament. The opposition seems highly unlikely to be able to muster such a supermajority in the next parliament.In 2010 Fidesz won 68 per cent of the seats thanks to public disgust at the outgoing socialist government and to the iniquities of the post-communist electoral system. It then changed the voting rules to entrench its electoral advantage. It has since used its parliamentary super-majorities to pass constitutional changes cementing its control over powerful executive agencies, such as the media regulator or the national judiciary office overseeing judges.It is normal in other democracies for an incoming government to have to work with officials appointed by the outgoing one, such as the central bank governor. But Orban’s supermajority lock also touches on what elsewhere would be considered run-of-the-mill legislation. For example, Fidesz-appointed members of Hungary’s budgetary council, whose mandates are open-ended and who cannot be removed from office, can block a new government from passing a budget if it breaches debt guidelines, thereby triggering a snap election. The fiscal challenge for the next government is likely to be all the more daunting, given the Orban government’s lavish spending on pre-election giveaways.“It will be a hostile institutional environment with the brutal fiscal legacy of Fidesz,” said Peter Kreko, director of the Political Capital Institute, a think-tank.Some observers in Budapest said Marki-Zay’s push for constitutional reform was puzzling because it divided the opposition he was supposed to unite. Changing the constitution was championed by Klara Dobrev, the defeated socialist candidate in the opposition primary, who said “the new government shouldn’t shake in its boots when it has to alter the two-thirds law”.Gergely Karacsony, the mayor of Budapest and another defeated contender, responded that Dobrev’s stance was “damaging” and that “if we want to defeat Orban and his regime, and we do, we have to be better than them”.Some analysts fear Marki-Zay’s approach would tip a new government into an immediate constitutional and political crisis. Kreko said trying to change the constitution without a two-thirds majority would set a dangerous precedent and create “a lot of institutional conflicts for the next government”. It would be challenged by the (Fidesz-controlled) constitutional court. Some fear it could trigger demonstrations or even unrest by Orban supporters. It could also be awkward for Brussels at a moment when the EU is stepping up its efforts to uphold the rule of law.By setting up a constitutional battle, Marki-Zay risked looking like he was thirsting for “retribution”, which could turn off voters, said a foreign diplomat. Potential swing voters were more concerned by the cost of living, corruption and coronavirus.Marki-Zay in effect is saying that Orban’s changes to the constitution using the two-thirds law procedure have breached its democratic spirit and so must be changed irrespective of procedure. It may be a tough argument to pull off.
110  France and Italy were at such odds two years ago that Paris recalled its ambassador and a spat between leaders descended into name-calling. But a Franco-Italian “friendship treaty” that President Emmanuel Macron will sign in Rome this week shows how the mood has changed.Meant to spur closer collaboration on everything from foreign policy to defence and culture, the 60-page Quirinale Treaty mirrors a Franco-German deal from 1963. The idea was discussed in 2017 by Macron and former Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni but was sunk the following year by Italy’s coalition of Five Star and the nationalist League, which clashed badly with Paris over the matter of EU migration.Now the project has been revived under Macron and Mario Draghi, Italy’s prime minister. With the former European Central Bank president at the helm in Rome, Italy’s nationalist-populist impulses have been so tamed that even the League favours the treaty.“Our interest right now is to restart talks with France,” Lorenzo Fontana, the League lawmaker who is responsible for the party’s foreign policy, told Italian media.Politically, the Draghi government wants to use a better relationship with Paris to play a more active role at a European level — particularly at a time when Germany is expected to be focused more on domestic politics as a new government takes the reins from Chancellor Angela Merkel.There are important upsides from France, too, from a stronger relationship. Strengthening ties will help Macron bolster the moderate, western European core of the EU and gain leverage against populists at home while securing an important ally to support him during the French presidency of the EU from the start of 2022.The bridge between Rome and Paris could also help to negotiate a post-pandemic reform of the EU’s fiscal rules. The Stability and Growth Pact aims to limit government deficits and debt and is at present suspended because of the pandemic. A battle may loom over reform with so-called frugal countries such as Austria, Denmark, Finland and the Netherlands.Even with Macron and Draghi in charge, however, it might not be all smooth sailing between the two countries — particularly on the business front, frequently a source of friction between competing French and Italian industries.Discussions over the possible sale of an Italian weapons maker owned by state-controlled defence group Leonardo to a French rival could prove one early test. People close to the deal talks had been expecting the sale to be discussed during the French visit, but Italian doubts mean a decision could take a lot longer to hash out.KMW+Nexter, a Franco-German defence joint venture, has made a €650m non-binding offer to buy Leonardo’s defence systems division, according to several people close to the talks. The division includes two businesses, formerly known as OTO Melara and Wass, that are leading manufacturers of naval cannons, tank turrets and torpedoes. The offer is €200m higher than that of Italy’s state-controlled shipbuilder Fincantieri.But a backlash has begun, with the Five Star Movement, the senior member of Draghi’s coalition government, saying it opposes “the sell-off of Italian strategic assets to foreign investors”. The Democratic party, through labour minister Andrea Orlando, and unions have also criticised the idea of a sale.At the weekend, Orlando, who is from the Ligurian city of La Spezia where OTO Melara is headquartered, said it was not a matter of “protectionism [but] it is quite obvious that financing foreign groups’ growth with national funds isn’t a clever strategy”.“I spoke to [defence minister Lorenzo Guerini] and I think he is very clear on this,” he added.Guerini has been more cautious in public statements and several officials in Rome say a solution is not straightforward because it is in Italy’s interest to be part of a Franco-German project to build the so-called European Main Battle Tank.Supporters of a deal argue that it would help Italy’s defence capability by slashing production costs and be a tangible sign of increased European co-operation in the defence sector. Critics say Italy would, in effect, help France get rid of an important competitor in the arms manufacturing space while also putting Italian jobs at risk.Wariness between French and Italian businesses has led to protracted takeover battles — as well as some ill-feeling — in the past. “French industrial groups have bought up a lot of Italian businesses,” said Philippe Moreau Defarges, a former diplomat and a senior fellow at the French Institute of International Relations think-tank.In luxury goods, in particular, French businessmen such as Bernard Arnault and François Pinault have swept up emblematic Italian brands, adding the likes of Loro Piana, Bulgari and Gucci to their empires.Italians have also flagged concerns over the merger in carmaking between FCA and PSA of France to form Stellantis. Paris, unlike Rome, owns a minority stake in the combined group which, they think, will help it better defend French production plants and jobs.
112  The IMF’s executive board approved a long-delayed $700m disbursement to Ukraine on Monday, propping up the war-torn country amid fears that Russia was plotting a deeper invasion.The newly arriving funds mark a second tranche from a $5bn Stand-By Arrangement programme agreed in the spring of 2020 to help Ukraine cope with the pandemic. It follows a $2.7bn IMF allocation of special drawing rights (SDR) extended to Ukraine this summer, as well as €600m in EU financing provided last month.“Ukraine’s IMF-supported economic programme aims to help the authorities address the effects of the Covid-19 shock, sustain the economic recovery, and move ahead on important structural reforms to reduce key vulnerabilities,” the fund said late on Monday.Arrival of these funds, as well as extension of the IMF programme through to June 2022, provides a critical and timely financial cushion for Kyiv.US and European officials have sounded alarm bells this month over a mushrooming build-up of 90,000-114,000 Russian troops near the country’s borders. They, along with Ukrainian officials, warn that Moscow could be plotting a deeper invasion after annexing the Crimean peninsula in 2014 and fomenting a proxy separatist war in the eastern Donbas region that has claimed some 14,000 lives.Multibillion-dollar financial backing from the IMF, World Bank and other international financial institutions, as well as the US and EU, has been critical to shoring up Ukraine since Russia began its aggressive policies.The IMF tranche was delayed for about a year by a combination of foot-dragging on reforms by President Volodymyr Zelensky’s administration and a constitutional court ruling last autumn initiated by pro-Russian parties that threatened to neuter newly established anti-corruption institutions.Recent legislation adopted by Zelensky’s ruling majority in parliament addressed the IMF’s concerns by improving independence of both anti-corruption bodies and the central bank.Zelensky wrote on Twitter: “Grateful to [the IMF] board of governors for the decision to complete the review of the stand-by program on the allocation of a tranche of about $700m. We’ll use these funds to support the financial system and combat Covid-19.”Attending the Halifax International Security Forum this weekend, Oleksiy Danylov, Ukraine’s national security chief, called on the US, EU and other western backers to strengthen military assistance and other forms of support for Kyiv while warning that Russian president Vladimir Putin “understands only the language of force”.“By drawing troops to the Ukrainian border, Russia is trying to aggravate the security situation in the region as much as possible to raise stakes at future talks at the table,” he added.
113  Boris Johnson’s Brexit negotiating strategy over Northern Ireland has been thrown into confusion after a cabinet minister ruled out a full scale confrontation with the EU before Christmas.Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the UK’s international trade secretary, said it was “absolutely not” Britain’s intention to trigger the Article 16 process, which overrides post-Brexit trade arrangements in Northern Ireland, in the coming weeks.Her comments confirmed an FT report last week that ministers wanted a Christmas “truce” to give UK and EU negotiators time to try to strike a compromise over the border arrangements in Northern Ireland.“I don’t think anyone’s calling Article 16 before Christmas, absolutely not,” she told the Daily Telegraph.Trevelyan’s comments undermine the position of Lord David Frost, the UK’s Brexit minister, who has insisted the government stands ready to activate Article 16 at any time, and maintains that it is “on the table”.Trevelyan suggested the government expected Frost and his EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic to carry on talking for a while yet, saying they “will plod on doing the work that negotiators do”.Negotiations are continuing between the two sides to try to soften the application of the so-called Northern Ireland protocol, the part of the Brexit deal that deals with trading relations in Northern Ireland.The protocol left Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market for goods in order to prevent the return of a north-south trade border on the island of Ireland, but it means there are some checks on trade between Great Britain and the region.“Our preference remains to agree a negotiated solution if we can,” said a Downing Street spokesperson. “Of course we will use Article 16, the safety mechanism, if solutions cannot be found.”Asked directly if the government was willing to trigger Article 16 before Christmas, the spokesperson appeared to repudiate Trevelyan’s words, saying: “Well, I am not going to put a timetable on it.” Separately, at a hearing of parliament’s public accounts committee, Richard Ballantyne, chief executive of the British Ports Association, said ports were preparing well for the introduction of full checks on EU imports from next July.Ballantyne said there “should be sufficient capacity in terms of physical space”, but added there were “reservations” about whether there would be enough vets and other officials to carry out the checks.“If government officials, departments and agencies started wanting to pull in over 90 per cent of goods for various checks, then you’d run into a capacity issue,” he told MPs.Meanwhile Nigel Farage, former Brexit party leader, said he was considering a political comeback in the wake of the continuing migrant crisis in the English Channel, but added that his “gut instinct” was not to do so.Farage is now a presenter on GB News. However, Tory MPs worry that at some point an anti-immigration party to the right of the Conservatives could re-emerge to channel public frustration on the migration issue.
114  Romania’s two largest political parties on Monday agreed to form a broad coalition government, ending weeks of political paralysis as the country faced an upsurge in coronavirus cases and steeply rising energy prices.Nicolae Ciuca, a 54 year-old former army general, has been designated as the prime minister to head a coalition of the centre-right National Liberal Party (PNL) together with its largest rival, the centre-left Social Democrats (PSD).Along with the ethnic Hungarian party UMDR, the trio will hold a two-thirds majority in parliament. The deal is expected to win approval in a parliamentary confidence vote on Thursday.Romania has had some of the highest infection and death rates in the world for weeks, putting immense strain on its hospitals, as vaccine take-up rates lagged far behind EU peers.“Romanians expect us to deliver solutions to fight the impact of pandemic and the energy crisis,” Ciuca told reporters on Monday.He said the government would also focus on a social agenda, with growing demands from the PSD for higher pensions and family allowances as inflation has reached multiyear highs.The liberals and social democrats have agreed to hold the premier’s job in rotation, changing 18 months from now. Elections are due in late 2024.The PSD will control most of the important ministries in what is widely seen as a political victory. The PNL won elections a year ago but its government imploded after a former junior coalition partner pulled out, leading to weeks of attempts to find a new administration.“This is an unnatural alliance between former enemies,” analyst Ion Ionita told the Financial Times. “It depends how the government performs. Romania in the next few months may pass the crisis and we’ll see how the government survives in the next year. In any case, I doubt it will be long lived.”Months of wrangling within the ranks of the liberals have cost the party popular support: The most recent poll by CURS found that the Social Democrats were far and away the strongest party, with 38 per cent support, compared with 18 per cent for the Liberals.Asked who was responsible for the crisis in the country, the poll found that more than two-thirds faulted either liberal President Klaus Iohannis or his PNL at least to some degree.“The government is strong enough right now, it has the full support of the president. But both the premier and the liberals are very weak in this government,” Ionita said.The extremist, anti-vaccine AUR party is now the clear third largest political force in the country, and Ionita said any mismanagement by the next government would probably lead to a further strengthening of the far right.
115  The European Central Bank has asked banks to “urgently” improve plans to protect their businesses from climate change risk after a review found widespread shortcomings in lenders’ approach to environmental challenges.The ECB, which has directly supervised the biggest banks across the eurozone for seven years, has completed its first assessment of banks’ preparedness to deal with increased climate and environmental risks. It found that no bank under its watch was close to meeting the ECB’s expectations. The central bank said lenders might “eventually” face higher capital demands as it integrated climate risk assessments with its regular work on setting individual banks’ capital levels.The biggest risks to banks comes from exposure to energy companies that do not pivot to more sustainable activities and energy-intensive sectors such as aviation, according to the assessment. Other risks include lending on buildings which are less energy efficient and therefore may have a lower resale value.Although banks such as HSBC and Bank of America have introduced their own net zero targets, scrutiny has increased in recent years of the sector’s lending to carbon-intensive activities.The ECB’s study focused on 112 banks with combined assets of €24tn. Half of those lenders said climate change would have a “material” impact on their businesses over the next three to five years. None of the banks that reported climate risks as “immaterial” had carried out sufficient analysis, wrote Frank Elderson, ECB executive board member and vice-chair of the ECB’s supervisory board, in a blog post.Other shortcomings highlighted by the ECB included a lack of stress testing to see what would happen to banks’ businesses in various climate change scenarios, and poor planning for how they should make their business models more resilient in the face of climate change. The banks with the biggest shortcomings have been urged to fix them as part of the ECB’s regular supervision.“Banks urgently need to set ambitious and concrete goals and timelines — including measurable intermediate milestones — to mitigate their exposure to current and future climate and environmental risks,” Elderson wrote.Sasja Beslik, head of sustainability at Denmark’s largest pension fund PFA and a prominent environmental, social and governance investor, said he did not expect banks to make “major improvements” in their climate risk management strategies “before they have seen financial losses [from lending to unsustainable industries]”.“Banks are mirroring the real economy; the real economy is not sustainable so the way banks operate is not sustainable,” he added.The ECB did find some bright spots. Elderson said two-thirds of banks had made “meaningful progress” in factoring climate risk into their lending decisions, by doing extra due diligence on borrowers’ climate risks or phasing out lending to some of the most exposed industries.The ECB will publish a report on banks’ climate risk disclosures in the first quarter of 2022 and is planning a broader review on banks’ strategy, governance and risk management around climate change risk in the first half of next year. The review will only announce results for the financial system, not for individual lenders.In the UK, banks last month submitted data for the Bank of England’s first climate “stress tests”, which the BoE described as “exploratory in nature” with no bearing on capital requirements. Results, which will be presented as aggregate findings for the UK banking system, are scheduled to be published by May.
116  Sweden’s populist anti-immigration party is talking openly about ways to join or support a potential conservative government and end a decade of political ostracism.The moves by the Sweden Democrats to create a nascent conservative bloc with two mainstream centre-right parties are changing the balance in the country’s politics. They come as the rival Social Democrats try to stay in power under new leader Magdalena Andersson, who faces a vote on Wednesday to try to become Sweden’s first female prime minister.Stefan Lofven resigned this month as prime minister and party leader after losing a parliamentary vote of no confidence.Long shunned by all other political groups owing to their roots in the neo-Nazi movement, the Sweden Democrats have been brought in from the cold by the centre-right parties as their long-time focus on immigration and law and order has come to dominate the political agenda. Sweden has become a European hotspot for shootings and bombings as part of a gang crime wave.The Sweden Democrats first entered parliament in 2010 and scored 17.5 per cent in the last elections in 2018, making them the third-largest party.As the country’s political turmoil has increased they have come closer to their goal of forming a conservative bloc, first teaming up with centre-right parties for a joint immigration policy.This month, for the first time, they have put forward a joint budget proposal with the two largest centre-right parties, the Moderates and Christian Democrats. Together with another centre-right group, the four parties are one seat short of a majority in parliament.Mattias Karlsson, the Sweden Democrats’ former acting leader and its chief ideologue, told the Financial Times that the party was “quite pragmatic” about gaining influence for its main issues of “national identity, safety, and immigration”.“What really matters is what we can get in terms of political content. If we feel we could change society more by being in government we will probably do so. If we believe we could get more by being outside and influencing each budget, then we would. It’s not a goal either way,” he added.The joint budget agreement “is another step on the load to normalisation of the Sweden Democrats in party politics. It’s easy to forget how controversial they once were,” said Nicholas Aylott, associate professor at Sodertorn University. “Eleven years ago, when the Sweden Democrats first got into parliament, they were utterly ostracised, on both political and personal levels.”Karlsson said the political alignment with the centre-right was “greater than ever” and that the three parties “can talk openly about any topic now”.The Moderates, the largest opposition party led by Ulf Kristerson, have said they would prefer to govern with other centre-right groups and not have the Sweden Democrats in government.But the Centre party, one of four nominally centre-right groups, has backed both Lofven and Andersson, leaving the Moderates with little choice other than to cosy up to the Sweden Democrats.Andersson’s talks with the ex-Communists of the Left party broke down on Monday without agreement, leaving her facing two uncertain votes on Wednesday: to become prime minister, and pass her budget.Should she fail, the speaker of the parliament has a number of options including asking the right to try to form a government or calling extra elections. Elections next September would still have to be held.Karlsson said he expected the Social Democrats to take a tougher line on crime and immigration under Andersson ahead of elections in an attempt to win back the working class.“They are going to use this opportunity to go into opposition against themselves. There is going to be a lot of crime rules to try to get part of our voters back. But the interesting thing is: the working party has lost their workers,” he added.Sweden has become accustomed to bombings and crimes such as a 14-year-old being shot on Saturday in the central town of Eskilstuna. Rapper Einar, linked to several crime figures and kidnapped by a fellow musician, was recently shot dead in what police described as an execution-like killing.Karlsson blamed the Social Democrats mostly and the Moderates, in power from 2006-14, for what he called Sweden’s “loss of innocence”. He added: “We have accepted more immigrants than we could integrate and in its place an American-inspired gangster culture has taken root.”He said the left preferred to talk about “more teachers, more social workers, and planting more flowers” but while there was eventually room for that the priority would be to crack down on the gangs.“As long as the gangs are still there threatening the social fabric of these areas, you have to go in really hard against them and remove them. And then you go in with social measures,” he added.
117  Whatever happened to Michel Barnier? As the head of the EU negotiating team on Brexit, the patrician Frenchman became famous for his insistence that the EU must never deviate from its core principles — including the supremacy of European law and the free movement of people.Now Brexit is done and Barnier has moved on. He is running for the presidency of France and has adopted many of the ideas he once rejected. Supremacy of EU law? Barnier now has his doubts. Immigration? Barnier is calling for a moratorium of up to five years. The European ideal? Barnier warns that Germany has become too powerful within the EU.One possible explanation for this curious volte face is that the former EU commissioner has reflected deeply on the Brexit negotiations and decided that the Brexiters had a point. An alternative theory is that Barnier has reflected deeply on his own ambition to be president of France — and has decided that the shortest route to power involves a sharp right turn, followed by a swift reversal over his own principles.It is possible that a really good lawyer could make the statements of the two Barniers sound consistent. His current demand for a moratorium on immigration, for example, applies only to arrivals from outside the EU. But one of his former close colleagues in Brussels tells me: “What he is saying now, for example on the European Convention on Human Rights, is clearly different from what he was saying during the Brexit negotiations.”The Barnier story is about more than the cynicism of one man. It says something important about politics in Europe. The backlash against Brussels is not confined to France. In different forms, it is cropping up all over the EU — from Warsaw to Budapest to the German constitutional court in Karlsruhe. The supremacy of EU law, a principle established in the 1960s that is fundamental to the European project, is increasingly under challenge.One key reason for these challenges is that the EU has expanded its powers into policy areas that used to be at the heart of the nation state: borders, budgets, currency and civil rights. As a result, many politicians chafe at having to accept European legal supremacy on subjects, such as immigration, that are deeply controversial at home. This problem is compounded by the fact that the EU club now has 27 members — making it harder to agree on a common rule book that suits everyone.Over the past 20 years, the EU has been engaged in a rolling argument over where sovereignty and power is best located: Brussels or the nation-states? This was an issue when French and Dutch voters rejected a proposed EU constitution (championed by Barnier) in 2005 because it was too integrationist. The power of the EU to demand change in a nation state was also controversial throughout the Greek debt crisis.Sovereignty was the central issue in the Brexit campaign in Britain in 2016 — highlighted by the Leave campaign’s winning slogan: “Take back control”. Control of borders, a crucial issue for the Brexiters, has also been central to the arguments of Eurosceptics in Hungary, Poland and France.The fact that Brexit is widely perceived as a failing project means that no other countries are currently considering leaving the EU. But the question of the powers of Brussels and the supremacy of EU law are popping up in other guises. In 2020, the German constitutional court ruled that the European Central Bank’s policy of buying the bonds of EU nations was illegal, suggesting that German judges could over-rule their European counterparts. Although Karlsruhe eventually backed off (as it tends to), its ruling encouraged the Eurosceptic governments in Poland and Hungary.The Polish constitutional court — at the prompting of the government in Warsaw — recently ruled that Poland’s constitution outranks EU law. Unlike the Germans, the Poles were willing to escalate the conflict into an outright confrontation with Brussels.The case is complicated by the fact that the Polish government is, in many respects, acting in bad faith. The ultra-conservative Law and Justice party has packed the court with its own loyalists — something that Brussels regards as a threat to the rule-of-law in Poland. The issues of the primacy of EU law and of the independence of the Polish judiciary have become intermingled — although, logically, they are distinct questions.With Brussels currently threatening to cut off the flow of funds to Warsaw, there is a strong chance that the European Commission and the Polish government will eventually compromise. But, as the French election illustrates, the broader question of whether too much power now resides in Brussels will come up in other guises.Previously it has always been assumed that power struggles between Brussels and member states would generally be resolved in favour of Brussels. “Ever closer union” seemed inevitable.The strategic and economic arguments for deeper European integration remain powerful. But the politics look less and less favourable. Eurosceptic revolts in Britain and Poland are one thing. But when Barnier, the epitome of the “good European”, turns into a nationalist the political ground is clearly shifting. The next constitutional settlement in the EU may favour nations, not Brussels.
118  Apple has finally seen the light on repairs. After years of consumer and legal pressure, the smartphone maker last week launched a self-service repair programme that will allow customers to buy replacement parts. While few people have the skills to fix their own iPhones, this could drive up demand for independent technicians.This is long overdue from a company that has fiercely guarded its control over the repair process and used means fair and foul to induce smartphone owners to upgrade regularly. Last year, Apple agreed to pay $500m to settle claims that it deliberately slowed down some iPhones as they got older.The company has long contended that its experts are best positioned to repair its devices, but the prices it charges are extremely high. Replacing the back glass on an out-of-warranty iPhone 13 Pro Max can cost $599, half the price of a new model.Apple has plenty of company. Hard-to-repair machines are everywhere, from farm tractors to washing machines to smartphones. This planned obsolescence is anti-competitive, allowing companies to drive up revenue at the expense of their customers. It is also unconscionably wasteful.Users discarded 53.6m metric tonnes of electric and electronic products in 2019, up 21 per cent in five years, and the figure is projected to rise by another 50 per cent by the end of this decade. Less than 20 per cent of this e-waste was recycled.Consumer groups and environmentalists have been trying for years to address the waste of money and materials through “right-to-repair” laws. They have had some success with US cars and UK and EU white goods.Manufacturers have fought them every step of the way. At least 27 US state legislatures considered right-to-repair bills this year, but most failed to pass in the face of opposition from manufacturers, particularly Big Tech. Apple and Microsoft lobbied hard against some of the proposals, as did Amazon and Google.Both the UK and EU’s right to repair laws have drawn sharp criticism from consumer groups as inadequate. First they apply only to certain appliances and televisions, while currently excluding laptops, smartphones and tablets. Second there is nothing to prevent manufacturers from making repairs prohibitively expensive by charging high prices for parts or bundling parts together so that large sections have to be replaced together.But the pressure is mounting. US President Joe Biden has ordered the Federal Trade Commission to look at anti-competitive restrictions on repair markets. The EU is also looking to strengthen its rules as part of the bloc’s plan for a circular economy.Suddenly Big Tech has started to change its position on repairs. Microsoft promised in October to find ways to reduce its environmental impact by making its products easier to repair. Both it and Apple were facing specific shareholder proposals on the issue.These small concessions must not be allowed to derail government efforts to set higher standards. The UK and EU should enact stronger right-to-repair laws and the US needs requirements of its own.None of this will have the desired impact unless consumers change their buying habits. But governments can nudge them along. France now requires manufacturers to include a “repairability rating” on product listings. Rules on corporate carbon-footprint disclosures should force companies to reveal how long products last and whether they are recycled in the end. It is long past time to throw away the throwaway economy.
119  Europe’s protests against Covid-19 curbs spread to Brussels on Sunday when tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the city centre in protests that later turned violent.Protests also broke out in Austria, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Croatia over the weekend as European governments stepped up their efforts to curb a steep rise in infections that is putting pressure on healthcare systems across the continent and last week prompted the World Health Organization to express concern.In Brussels, 35,000 people took part in initially peaceful protests close to the EU headquarters. The demonstration later erupted into violence. Police deployed water cannon, tear gas and mounted officers in response to a group throwing projectiles.Police made more than 40 arrests after several shops were broken into, and video on social media showed barricades on fire and police cars badly damaged. Three police officers were taken to hospital with minor injuries.Belgium has one of the highest vaccination rates in Europe but is reimposing restrictions as cases soar. The country’s most vaccinated province, West Flanders, has one of the highest infection rates in the country. Last week, the government expanded work-from-home rules and strengthened restrictions on the unvaccinated.There was a second night of rioting in the Netherlands on Saturday over the introduction of new coronavirus restrictions. The disorder led to dozens of arrests across the country, with authorities deploying mounted police, dogs and water cannon in three provinces after protesters started fires and threw rocks and fireworks.Austria, the Netherlands and Germany have experienced western Europe’s fastest increase in cases since the start of the month. Late last week Germany’s caseload hit a record high, with acting health minister Jens Spahn saying a full lockdown could not be ruled out.Austria started a national lockdown on Monday, while further restrictions are set to come into force in other European countries.In Greece, unvaccinated people will not be allowed into indoor spaces, including restaurants, cinemas, museums and gyms. Vaccination certificates for the over-60s will be valid for only seven months, with people then required to get a “booster” shot to maintain validity.In Slovakia, the country’s prime minister, Eduard Heger, announced a “lockdown for the unvaccinated” from Monday.In the Netherlands, unrest was sparked by plans to restrict the use of the Covid pass to those who have either been vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19. Previously, it also covered people with a negative test result. A ban on fireworks for New Year’s Eve celebrations also roused anger.The new restrictions are expected to last for an initial three weeks.Saturday’s unrest followed rioting in Rotterdam on Friday night when police opened fire on hundreds of protesters. Authorities defended the use of force, with the city’s mayor, Ahmed Aboutaleb, blaming the crowds for “an orgy of violence”.In Austria, thousands of people took to the streets of Vienna on Saturday night to protest against the national lockdown and plans to make vaccination mandatory. Police put the number of demonstrators at 40,000.Austrians will be asked to work from home and non-essential shops will shut until at least December 12. The measures will be reviewed in 10 days.“The atmosphere became heated among some groups of demonstrators and resulted in repeated clashes with police. In front of the palace gate [Heldenplatz] police were forced to use pepper spray against aggressive activists,” the police said in a statement. They said about 1,300 officers from across Austria were brought in to assist.Thousands also marched in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, against new vaccination mandates for health workers.In Italy, hundreds of people took to the streets in Rome to protest against the introduction of a “green pass” required to access venues, workplaces and public transport.
120  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.The European parliament’s plenary session in Strasbourg will go back into hybrid mode this week, amid a spike in Covid-19 cases in France and with Belgium implementing a four-day teleworking week as of today.Regardless of the format, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen will have to field questions from MEPs tomorrow on the results of last month’s EU summit, which included a discussion on Poland over the rule of law. After the FT saw the letters sent on Friday to Warsaw and Budapest, we’ll unpack what they contain and ask why some MEPs are still unhappy with the commission.Meanwhile, France’s clampdown on migrant camps earlier this month seems to have done little in the way of deterring people from trying to cross the Channel to the UK. We’ll explore the latest events from the weekend and look at their impact on Franco-British relations.And with COP26 now behind us, we’ll look at how the task of translating Europe’s ambitious climate plan into concrete legislation is proving a task as complicated as agreeing on the bloc’s seven-year budget.Brussels has made a first preliminary move in a process that could lead to financial sanctions for Hungary and Poland over fraud and corruption linked to EU money, but the incremental step has angered those who think the commission is simply buying itself time, writes Mehreen Khan in Brussels.The FT has seen the two missives sent to Poland and Hungary’s envoys to the EU last week, which lay out questions for Warsaw and Budapest over potential judicial and procurement corruption that need to be answered within the next two months.The letters, signed by the commission’s chief budgetary official, are a first step towards action under the bloc’s new rule of law mechanism, which can punish countries that misuse EU taxpayer money by freezing funds. At stake for Poland and Hungary is access to billions in EU budget cash that make up significant portions of their national GDP. (This mechanism was the reason why Warsaw and Budapest held up an agreement on post-EU recovery money for several months.)Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has been under sustained pressure from the European parliament and within parts of her own college to deploy the mechanism because of Warsaw’s judicial reforms and Budapest’s respect for EU values and anti-corruption laws.These letters do not formally trigger the mechanism, however. They are a precursor to taking the formal legal step if Poland and Hungary cannot muster adequate responses within the two month deadline.For those who want Brussels to get tough after years of strained relations with Viktor Orban and Poland’s ultranationalist PiS, Friday’s step merely ensures that real pressure will not be exerted until the new year. “The letters would now mean that no further action will be taken and the process will be dragged out until at least mid-January,” said Daniel Freund, a Green MEP.Looming over any rule of law conditionality tool is a pending judgment from the European Court of Justice, which has been asked to preside over the mechanism’s legality by Poland and Hungary. Commission officials have said they will await the Luxembourg ruling before formally going ahead with a trigger. An initial ECJ opinion on the mechanism is set for December 2 with the final judgment likely to be pushed into early 2022.Frustrated MEPs have launched legal action against Brussels for the delays. The commission’s position, however, has the backing of member states that gave von der Leyen a vote of confidence in her approach at a leaders’ summit last month.While critics argue that Poland and Hungary have won a reprieve, another pot of cash — recovery fund money for both capitals — is also unlikely to be approved by Brussels within the next two months. At best, the state of purgatory may act as a de facto financial punishment even if sanctions remain a long way away.A survey of UK business activity due tomorrow will provide a snapshot of how the economy has fared in recent weeks. Last month, the IHS Markit purchasing managers’ index showed improved growth momentum. While analysts expect a deceleration in November, a positive surprise might feed into expectations on whether the Bank of England will increase interest rates in December. (More here)Hundreds of migrants continued their attempts to cross the Channel from northern France to southern England in small vessels over the weekend, despite last week’s closure by French police of what interior minister Gérald Darmanin called an illegal encampment near the port of Dunkirk, writes Victor Mallet in Paris.On Friday night and through Saturday, French lifeboats and coastguard vessels rescued 243 migrants in difficulties in bad weather in the Channel, according to the maritime prefecture responsible for the Channel and the North Sea.The flow of thousands of migrants, many from the Middle East and Afghanistan, through France and on to the UK has long been a source of contention between Paris and London, although the tone of the discussions has calmed down in recent days following the closure of the Dunkirk camp and a video meeting between Darmanin and his UK counterpart Priti Patel.French president Emmanuel Macron said France should further increase collaboration with the British, even though they “swing between partnership and provocation”. He told local newspaper La Voix du Nord in an interview that he would seek to introduce reforms to the migration system when France holds the EU presidency in the first half of next year.“If those [migrants] who want to go to Britain have family there, that’s about regrouping families,” Macron said. “But if they are victims of people traffickers, we must break that system.”French officials say 31,500 migrants have left the north coast of France so far this year, and 7,800 have been rescued while seven have died or disappeared. Last week the French sports and clothing retailer Decathlon said it would no longer sell kayaks at its stores in Calais and Grande-Synthe near Dunkirk because they were being used for dangerous cross-Channel attempts by migrants.Clandestine migration into France and other EU countries is a hot topic in the campaigning that has already begun for next year’s French presidential election, with extreme-right would-be candidate Éric Zemmour calling for migrants to be “sent home”.Brussels’ Green Deal legislative blitz has barely got off the ground but is already proving to be among the most complex interlocking packages of measures ever undertaken in the EU, writes Mehreen Khan.Unlike most legislation proposed by the European Commission, the group of over a dozen green measures — dubbed “Fit for 55” — risks ending up descending into a bean-counting exercise about where best to cut emissions across countries and sectors.“Nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed,” said one senior diplomat, echoing the mantra that marked the bloc’s Brexit negotiations.The green package is a unique proposition for lawmakers in the council and the parliament. The 13 separate files, which range from renewable energy targets, transport regulation and new carbon taxes, have been intricately designed by the commission to add up to the magic figure of 55 per cent reduction in CO2 emission by 2030.But as lawmakers start making progress on the low-hanging fruit in Fit For 55, some are realising that it may prove impossible to agree positions on laws when the future of others is up in the air. If the parliament or council decides to water down some measures, “the deficit will have to be made up by bolstering other parts”, warned a commission official.The biggest sticking point in the entire package is a plan to extend the EU’s carbon pricing system to consumer-facing sectors like cars and buildings. The extension has support from Germany and the Netherlands, but has met resistance from France and southern EU countries for punishing poorer households that will have to bear higher costs.If the Emissions Trading Scheme extension is scrapped, then the burden of emissions cuts will have to shift to other sectors.One diplomat said the interlocking nature of the laws meant the negotiations over Fit For 55 would “end up like the EU budget” — a reference to the last-minute negotiating where countries haggle over their payments and obligations.To help unblock talks, some countries have asked Brussels to provide its secret formula for adding up the emissions contributions of each piece of legislation. But as with budget talks, the commission is unwilling to disclose its calculations for fear of encouraging more horse-trading over a package of measures in which it says “balance” is keyand later this week
121  Brussels plans to crack down on a patchwork of national arrangements that allow banks outside the EU to sell services into the bloc, dealing a blow to lenders in London that rely on the arrangements to cushion the impact of Brexit.The proposal would stop almost all cross-border selling from non-EU countries into the bloc’s single market. Banks are keen on cross-border access to the EU because it is cheaper and simpler to do some trade from their main international centres rather than moving capital and staff.The cross-border clampdown is part of an attempt to streamline how global banks operate in the EU, with Brussels also wanting to give regulators more power to make banks turn some branches into more closely supervised subsidiaries.It is part of the European Commission’s capital requirements directive, which will give a legal basis to the latest global bank capital standards and end discrepancies in what different national regulators allow. It still has to be agreed by Europe’s parliament and council.European Central Bank officials have become concerned about a recent sharp increase in the post-Brexit use of national arrangements and waivers to conduct cross-border business, as banks continued to serve EU clients from London. Cross-border permissions have long been used by banks based in the US, Switzerland and Asia for some of their activities in the EU.Edouard Fernandez-Bollo, a member of the board of the ECB’s supervisory arm, warned in September that banks should not use cross-border regimes “as a means to carry out large volumes of activities in the EU in a business-as-usual environment”. “The direction of travel since Brexit has clearly been that the European authorities are looking to get more hands on supervision and financial services and banking activities inside the EU,” said Peter Bevan, a lawyer at Linklaters. “There’s obviously been an increasing scepticism about services that are provided from the UK.”He said it was “difficult to see” how national regimes granting cross-border access could be compatible with the commission’s proposals.The new measure put forward by Brussels limits cross-border activity from non-EU countries to “reverse solicitation”, where a client approaches a bank without any marketing by the institution.“Most of western Europe has some kind of cross-border licensing regime,” said Caroline Dawson, a lawyer at Clifford Chance. The new measure would “repeal all of them”, she said, adding that reverse solicitation was difficult to prove and could not be done at scale.She said Brussels’ proposed restrictions would be “cutting people’s options and therefore cutting the volume of business that people will do”.An executive at a large international lender said that while his bank could use its subsidiaries and branches to replace the cross border arrangements, the way the measure was introduced made them nervous about the unpredictability of EU policymaking. “This wasn’t impact-assessed or consulted,” he said.Brussels’ proposals strengthen a general requirement under the EU’s existing rules that non EU-banks should have either a branch or a legal entity in a member state where they wish to do business.The national access regimes in Ireland and Luxembourg are among the most flexible in the EU, Dawson said. Luxembourg typically only requires a licence if the provider of a service is physically in the country. Ireland allows most activities on a cross-border basis as long as they do not involve retail clients.Luxembourg’s regulator did not reply to a request for comment. Ireland’s central bank said it was “reviewing all aspects” of the European banking package.The Swiss Bankers Association said “granting cross-border market access into the EU to Swiss financial institutions.contributes to open and integrated markets and, therefore, is in the interest of EU investors and hence ultimately in the interest of the EU”. “The European parliament and the Council of the EU may amend the new rules,” the SBA added. “We will carefully analyse the possible impact of the proposals with our members. At this point, it is premature to have a final view.”The European Commission declined to comment.
122  On Frankfurt’s main shopping street the early Christmas window displays work hard to entice passers-by. But German consumers, worried about a recent surge in inflation, are cautious about spending their money.“I have felt it quite a bit,” said Maria, a 40-year-old social worker, who had put off buying jewellery and electronics because of higher prices. “I noticed when shopping with my mum that gold has gone up from €1,500 to over €1,700 [per ounce] in only one week.” German inflation, as measured by the harmonised index of consumer prices, rose 4.6 per cent in October from a year earlier — its highest level since shortly after the country’s reunification three decades ago. It is widely expected to exceed 5 per cent by December.Spiralling prices are a sensitive subject in a country where people’s approach to money is still haunted by the hyperinflation of the 1920s and 1940s that wiped out most Germans’ savings.The issue is rising up the agenda for the incoming government — still being formed after September’s election — amid criticism of the European Central Bank’s ultra-loose monetary policies.“Germany is a country of savers and the inflation debate is connected to the one about people feeling they are being robbed by these negative interest rates,” said Carsten Brzeski, head of macro research at ING. “Some parts of the country suspect the ECB just wants to protect indebted southern European countries and not to look out for their interests.”Lyn, a 33-year-old primary school teacher, said the higher cost of rent and energy was often discussed among colleagues at her school. “I try to shop more carefully now,” she said, adding that the rising cost of living “should be an issue for the next government” to tackle.Germany is not alone in confronting soaring inflation, which is running at a 13-year high of 4.1 per cent across the wider euro area. Prices are rising even faster in the US, where they increased 6.3 per cent in October from a year ago, the biggest jump for three decades.Once people started being vaccinated against Covid-19 and lockdowns were lifted, consumer and business activity rebounded and the supply of many items — from semiconductors to natural gas — struggled to keep up with demand, driving up prices.A rebound in energy prices is a big factor behind higher inflation. But global supply bottlenecks also mean there are not enough parts — such as semiconductors — to produce all the goods people want to buy. This pushed up producer prices at German factories 18.4 per cent in the year to October — the highest rise since 1951.An extreme example is the way shortages of new cars have boosted prices for older ones. In Germany, used car prices have on average risen €3,666, or 18 per cent, in the past year to a record high of €24,502 in October, according to AutoScout24, a leading sales site.“Prices are skyrocketing, our purchasing power is melting away,” warned Bild, the country’s top-selling tabloid newspaper last week. It suggested readers invest in property, shares or precious metals to protect their money from “Madame Inflation” — a reference to Christine Lagarde, president of the ECB.The central bank’s recent policies of negative interest rates and buying vast amounts of government debt have long been criticised and subject to legal challenges in Germany, where opponents warned it risked runaway inflation. Now prices are surging, those criticisms are growing.Otmar Issing, a German economist and former ECB executive, wrote in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung last week that the bank was “exposing itself to a high risk” by assuming inflation will fall next year and it will be able to continue buying bonds and keep rates low “on the assumption that employees would simply accept the inflation-related real wage losses”.Such frustrations were a factor behind Jens Weidmann’s recent decision to step down as president of the Bundesbank at the end of December, six years before his term as the head of the central bank expires, while warning his staff “not to lose sight of prospective inflationary dangers”.Many Germans keep their savings in bank deposits, on which they are paid almost no interest and for which banks increasingly charge them fees. The pandemic only accentuated this trend, as German household deposits increased by €214bn to more than €2.6tn since the crisis started in March 2020.But economists say an important explanation for German anxiety about rising prices stems from their conservative approach to money, which makes them more sensitive to an erosion of their purchasing power.Only about 15 per cent of Germans directly invest in the stock market, compared with about 55 per cent in the US and 33 per cent in the UK. In addition, fewer than half of German households own their own home — against two-thirds in the UK or US and eight out of 10 in Italy. So while asset prices have been soaring, many Germans have missed out.The country’s ageing population, in which the number of people aged 80 or over rose 4.5 per cent to 5.9m last year, is also vulnerable to the corrosive effect of inflation on savings and pensions.There are, however, several factors suggesting German inflation will fade next year. One is that the rebound in prices from last year’s temporary cut in sales tax will drop out of the inflation data by January. Restrictions announced last week to contain a record surge in coronavirus cases could also have a cooling effect on consumer spending and prices. German retail sales already fell 2.5 per cent in September from the previous month.Furthermore, negotiated wages rose only 1.5 per cent in the first six months of this year from a year earlier. Isabel Schnabel, a German economist on the ECB board, said last week: “We do not see any widespread wage pressure which could give rise to an undesirable wage-price spiral.”Yet Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank, has predicted that German wages will rise 2.5 per cent next year and pointed to a commitment by political parties negotiating to form a new government in Berlin to raise the minimum wage by a quarter to €12 per hour. “This will also force many companies to raise the pay of those close to the minimum wage,” he said.If inflation stayed high, the German political debate was likely to heat up, warned Volker Wieland, a professor at Frankfurt’s Goethe university and adviser to the government: “If we had another year of 5 per cent inflation that would certainly become a topic in the political arena, and it would be difficult for the government, say the finance minister or chancellor, not to react to it.”
123  For Eddie Jones, coach of England’s rugby union team, the season started in the worst possible way. But England’s last-minute victory on Saturday against rugby world champions South Africa represents a “rebirth”, he said after the match.Fly-half Marcus Smith secured England’s 27-26 win with a penalty following earlier devastating losses that put Jones under such pressure this year.So poor was his side’s performance at this year’s Six Nations Championship, an annual tournament contested against France, Wales, Italy, Scotland and Ireland, that England’s Rugby Football Union, the governing body, commissioned a review into what went wrong.A fifth-place finish told only part of the story. At the Six Nations, beating the trio of Ireland, Wales and Scotland is an honour known as the Triple Crown. Instead, England lost all three of those matches for the first time in 45 years to achieve the opposite.It was a feeble defence of the title England had won a year earlier, piling the pressure on Jones and creating a conundrum for the RFU as the critics questioned his suitability to lead the team.How the narrative has changed since Jones took on the job after England’s early exit from the 2015 World Cup, losing in front of their home fans at the Twickenham stadium in London.Within weeks of taking over, Jones led England to Six Nations triumph in 2016, transforming the squad, before defending the title in 2017 and winning it again in 2020. Under his leadership, England enjoyed a 17-match winning streak in test matches.Arguably the defining moment — and disappointment — of his England career, however, was the 2019 World Cup final. The country revelled in the side’s semi-final win against New Zealand, the legendary All Blacks, three-times winners of the competition.Despite being favourites for the final, England failed to score a try against winners South Africa. It was a double blow for Jones, who is Australian-Japanese, to lose in Yokohama.Following this year’s dismal defence of the Six Nations, past glories and near-misses could do nothing to stop the media from openly asking if Jones’s time was up.His job was on the line. But Jones does not shy away from one big reason for England’s poor display: himself.“We underperformed, mate,” he told the Financial Times. “My coaching wasn’t good enough, there’s no hiding from that, so that’s the end of the story.probably 80 per cent of my job is selection [and] I didn’t get that right and we didn’t get the environment right.”Much has been made of Jones’s intensity as a leader. In Leadership: Lessons From My Life in Rugby, his new book, he talks about waking up Japan’s players at 4.30am to prepare for “hard” training an hour later in the search for the fitness levels that helped the perennial underdogs to beat South Africa at the 2015 World Cup in one of the biggest upsets the game has ever seen.But when that approach falters in terms of results, critics say Jones’s demanding leadership style has caused high turnover in England’s coaching staff. More recently, he had to defend his comments about British tennis sensation Emma Raducanu, 19, after saying that she “hasn’t done so well” since winning the US Open in September, warning of the trappings of fame for players such as Smith.But the RFU review found that Jones’s players were “positive and supportive”. However, it identified a number of reasons for the underperformance, ranging from more “stringent” Covid protocols than other teams, to some players suffering from fatigue after playing back-to-back seasons — another side-effect of the pandemic and the disruption it caused to the rugby calendar.“The players saved him,” says one person with knowledge of the review.Jones also convinced his superiors, namely RFU chief executive Bill Sweeney, who said: “Eddie approached this review with a great deal of self-awareness and humility, allowing us to look at every aspect of the tournament to identify every small change we can make in order to improve.”The importance of Sweeney’s decision was elevated because he was in effect also picking a coach to lead the team into the 2023 World Cup, two decades since Jonny Wilkinson’s famous drop goal won England the sport’s most-coveted prize against Jones’s Australia.Despite the scrutiny of RFU board members, executives and independent experts, Jones insists he never feared being dismissed.“What do I have to worry about, mate? If they want to sack me, they sack me, then I’m on to my next job. If they want to keep me, I keep working,” Jones says. “Why worry about it? Wasted energy.“If you worry about things you can’t control, then it’s always going to detract away from what you’re supposed to be doing.”That approach was vindicated when the RFU supplied its verdict: despite recognising that the campaign had been “suboptimal”, the governing body confirmed its “full support and backing” for Jones.But Jones can ill-afford further missteps in his leadership as he tries to build a team capable of challenging for the 2023 World Cup in France.This month’s Autumn Internationals offered him a shot to prove that he’s the man to lead England at the 2023 World Cup.There was a 32-15 win over Australia, followed by the rousing win against South Africa, the reigning world champions, still a sore point for England after coming up so short against the Springboks in the 2019 final.Going into the match, the two sides’ first meeting since England’s defeat in Japan, Jones had wanted to claim a “South African scalp” ahead of the next edition of the Six Nations in February.It is one of the few remaining steps towards the next World Cup, an honour Jones has never won as head coach, having been on the losing side twice in two finals, though he was assistant for South Africa’s 2007 win.In his book, Jones admits that he was so “aggrieved” to lose the 2003 final to England that he allowed his “World Cup obsession to get the better of me”, though he says he is “definitely more balanced about it” now.I ask why it is not a mistake to be staying on with England; whether he was repeating the error he made in 2003 when he remained with Australia until he was dismissed following a loss of form in 2005.“The reason it’s not a mistake to stay is because I still don’t think we’ve maximised the potential of the team,” he says. “So if I felt that in 2019 that the team’s potential had been maximised, I would have walked away. I think we’ve got growth in the team.and I’d like to have the opportunity to do it.”
124  In Freudian psychoanalysis, neurotic behaviour is the manifestation of repressed feelings. In the EU’s obsession with codified rules, it is politics that is being repressed. That is why the newly relaunched debate on the bloc’s fiscal rules is going to be difficult.The current fiscal framework satisfies no one. Deficit countries find its discipline too constraining to promote economic growth that would improve public finances. Surplus countries see high debt in struggling neighbours and conclude it hasn’t been constraining enough. The rules are too complex to communicate to voters, undermining their democratic acceptability.The least negative thing anyone has had to say — in particular German finance minister and likely next chancellor, Olaf Scholz — is that the rules did not stop governments from saving their economies from disaster during the Covid lockdowns. It could be a dictionary definition of damning with faint praise.Significant change is therefore overdue, but few hold out much hope of a consensus on what form it should take. Hence the temptation to tinker at the edges. The problem, however, is that the economic circumstances have changed in at least two consequential ways.First, the (correct) response to the pandemic caused a jump in public debt-to-gross domestic product ratios. Second, the EU’s priorities require a drastic increase in investment in order to transition to economies that have net zero carbon emissions, are thoroughly digitised, and restore a broad-based opportunity for prosperity.The current framework does not reflect these changes. Under today’s rules, governments with debt-to-GDP ratios above 60 per cent are supposed to cut the excess by one-twentieth per year. That speed of consolidation is a recipe for a heavy drag on growth, which would very probably defeat its own purpose.The scale of additional public investment needed is incompatible with the ban on excessive deficits, unless it is funded with deep spending cuts or tax rises elsewhere. Those, too, would harm growth and erode political support for the green and digital transition.In the absence of reform, therefore, we will not return to a situation where the rules are at least somewhat binding. The most indebted countries will not reduce their debt at the prescribed pace. Governments will borrow to invest so as not to fall behind in the economic transition, deficit limits be damned. The fiscal rules will become a balancing item in the political calculation.Such observations are largely common ground. As a result a number of good technical proposals have been floated, including from institutions whose concern for sustainable public finances is unimpeachable.The European Fiscal Board recommends country-specific paths for debt reduction, taking account of some countries’ difficult starting points. Klaus Regling, managing director of the European Stability Mechanism, thinks the 60 per cent ceiling on the ration of public debt to GDP “is no longer relevant” and should be raised. The think-tank Bruegel proposes a “green golden rule” by which public investment spending could be exempted from the fiscal constraints.These would all be useful reforms. But their adoption does not depend on their usefulness. The deep challenge of the EU’s fiscal rules is that they substitute technical solutions for political ones.In a multinational bloc with multiple layers of sovereignty, it is tempting to try to eliminate politics altogether. But it is also futile. Like Freud’s repressed emotions, repressed politics does not go away, but causes dysfunction somewhere else — including in the ability of the rules to do their job to everyone’s satisfaction.The obstacle to good fiscal governance in the EU is not bad rules but poor politics. In particular, the lack of shared political ownership of economic policy in the member states — despite the treaty obligation to “regard their economic policies as a matter of common concern” — makes for mutual distrust. Fiscally weaker countries distrust the motives of stronger ones, who in turn distrust the weaker ones’ ability to manage their economies.However, the politics of the new post-pandemic recovery funds contain signs of hope. Aside from Hungary and Poland, they have not triggered the old suspicions between weaker and stronger economies. Quite the contrary. It is early days, but if this process is seen as successful, it will prove that Europe’s north and south can trust one another to pursue joint economic goals. That will make more difference to fiscal governance than any technical change.
125  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
126  A fourth wave of Covid-19 infections is barrelling across continental Europe, forcing governments to take drastic measures to contain the virus’s spread and stop hospitals from being overwhelmed. Germany, like some of its neighbours, is restricting access to public places for the unvaccinated. On Friday, the Austrian government took the most severe steps of all: it ordered a three-week national lockdown and said that from February vaccination would become compulsory, a first for any advanced economy.An autumn surge in Covid was inevitable, with the more infectious Delta variant now dominant in Europe. Colder weather has been driving social interaction indoors. And yet the explosion of cases appears to have taken authorities by surprise. Most alarming is the spike in hospitalisations and deaths. Slovakia’s death rate is now four times the UK’s. Austrian hospitals, which have the second-highest ratio of critical-care beds per capita in Europe after Germany, risk being overwhelmed. Hospitals in parts of Germany, where new cases have reached their highest-ever level, are also under intense pressure.Some parts of Europe are now paying a heavy price for insufficient vaccine coverage. The overwhelming majority of those who are gravely ill with Covid-19 are unvaccinated. The virus is drawing on reservoirs of unvaccinated people. These are deep in central and eastern Europe. Only 43 per cent of Romanian adults have been fully vaccinated. In Bulgaria, it is a dismal 29 per cent. Neither country has a stable government, and distrust of authority — whether governmental or medical — is widespread, as it is in many former communist countries.Even countries with high jab rates are reintroducing social-distancing measures. The Netherlands is shutting restaurants and bars early. Belgium has mandated working from home four days a week. That they are not resorting to more drastic steps — for now — is due to their inoculation success (81 and 87 per cent respectively).Spain and Portugal have been effective at immunising their populations with well-organised public health campaigns. Elsewhere, stronger incentives, a degree of discrimination and a dose of compulsion were required. France and Italy deployed mandatory Covid passes for access to restaurants, entertainment venues and long-distance trains. Italy extended it to the workplace. France ended free tests as an alternative to proof of vaccination, further inconveniencing the unvaccinated. This approach has helped nudge many of the hesitant to get a jab; it has worked less well with the recalcitrant.Austria’s problem — as in other German-speaking areas and elsewhere in central Europe — is the large number of vaccine refuseniks nourished with conspiracy theories then amplified by far-right political parties.Alexander Schallenberg, Austria’s chancellor, said he had been against compulsory vaccination but “we have too many political forces, flimsy vaccine sceptics and spreaders of fake news in this country”. It did not help that the government declared “the pandemic mastered, the crisis beaten” this summer when the vaccination campaign was far from complete. Austria had a Covid pass but its effects were blunted by easily available free tests. Restrictions on the unvaccinated, while discriminatory and divisive, might have spurred more vaccine uptake had they been implemented earlier. Resorting to compulsory vaccination — which should be a step too far for any government — is an admission of failure by Vienna. Regrettably, it is not the only capital to fall short.Letter in response to this editorial comment:Austria deserves praise for changing course on Covid / From Ulrich Hewer, Washington, DC, US
127  How long do European Central Bank rate-setters expect to keep buying bonds and when might they raise interest rates from their ultra-low levels? More light is due to be shed on these crucial questions when the minutes of last month’s ECB policy meeting are published on Thursday.Investors are likely to scour the minutes for any clues on how the debate is shaping up between ECB policymakers over the big decisions they are preparing to make at their next policy meeting on December 16.Most investors expect the ECB to say next month that its flagship €1.85tn bond-buying programme, which it launched last year in response to the pandemic, will come to an end in March 2022. However, the central bank is widely expected to step up its longer standing asset purchase programme at the same time to limit any sell-off in bond markets.Having committed not to raise rates before it stops buying bonds at the point of issuance, next month’s decision will send a vital signal on the timing of the first rate rise. Especially as investors are betting the ECB could raise rates by early 2023 in response to higher than expected inflation caused by surging energy prices and supply chain bottlenecks.“In the medium term we think there is enough upward pressure on inflation for the ECB’s own forecasts to be at or above its 2 per cent target in the medium term, so it will be able to declare mission accomplished and raise rates,” said Carsten Brzeski, head of macro research at ING. Martin ArnoldA key survey of UK business activity due on Tuesday will provide a snapshot of how the economy has fared in recent weeks.The IHS Markit purchasing managers’ index unexpectedly showed improved growth momentum in October and while analysts expect a deceleration in November, a positive surprise might feed into expectations on whether the Bank of England will increase interest rates in December.Economists polled by Reuters forecast the preliminary PMI reading for services to fall to 58.5 in November from 59.1 in the previous month.Sandra Horsfield, economist at Investec, said that she has pencilled in “a slight moderation” in the composite index, which averages services and manufacturing, in November as she expects that “the manufacturing sector continued to be constrained by supply chain shortages, while ongoing staff shortages may have hampered output growth in both the manufacturing and service sectors.” She added that price pressures “are also likely to be a key theme of the report.”A more downbeat reading is expected for eurozone PMI as businesses not only face surging costs and ongoing supply chain disruptions, like those in the UK, but also rising coronavirus infections that led many countries to reintroduce new restrictions.As a result, analysts forecast the eurozone PMI index for services to decline to 53.6 in November, down from 54.6 in October and the lowest since April. The same figure for Germany, where the rise in infections is particularly sharp, is expected to tumble to 51.5. Valentina RomeiEarlier this month, blockbuster consumer price data showed that US inflation rose in September at its fastest rate in 30 years. But the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation — the personal consumption expenditures price index — for October will be released on Wednesday, and markets will be watching for further signs of price pressures.Evidence of such pressures has already driven market speculation that the US central bank may be forced to raise borrowing costs faster than anticipated. The Fed earlier this month announced that it would begin slowing its pandemic-era quantitative easing programme, but investor attention quickly turned to the possibility of interest rate rises.The market is currently pricing in a roughly 80 per cent chance of three quarter-point interest rate increases by the end of 2022, with better-than 50 per cent odds that the first hike will come as soon as June, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. A month ago the chances of three rate hikes by December were roughly 25 per cent.PCE data reflects changes in household expenditures. A subsection of the data known as core PCE, which discounts the effects of the volatile food and energy sectors, is particularly closely watched. Analysts at TD Securities said they expect the PCE data to show that prices rose strongly, though at a slower pace than the CPI index. They estimate that the year-over-year change is likely to have risen to 4.1 per cent from 3.6 per cent. They also expect the report to show consumers beginning to spend down excess savings, which means nominal spending will outpace income and the savings rate could drop below its pre-Covid level.

128  Stock market regulators in Hong Kong are probing plans by Russian aluminium producer Rusal to spin off its high-carbon smelters and refineries into a separate company that will be listed in Moscow.The decision to examine the proposed demerger was triggered by a complaint from Odey Asset Management, according to emails seen by the Financial Times.The London-based hedge fund believes a recent agreement between Rusal’s two biggest shareholders means they should not be allowed to vote.If they are prevented from voting on the deal, it would hand a huge amount of influence to minority shareholders. Hong Kong-listed Rusal has a public free float of little more than 10 per cent according to some analysts and the demerger requires backing from 75 per cent of shareholders present at a special meeting.Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing declined to comment.Rusal announced the spin-off plan in May in a move that would allow it to focus on the fast-growing market for “green aluminium”.The company is 57 per cent owned by EN+, the hydropower-to-metals group once controlled by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. Its second-biggest shareholder with 25.5 per cent is Sual Partners, a vehicle in which billionaires Sir Leonard Blavatnik and Viktor Vekselberg are investors.For much of the year, Sual has been at loggerheads with Rusal and EN+, calling for the appointment of a new board and the resumption of dividends. It has objected to the demerger and voted against plans for Rusal to be renamed AL+ at its annual meeting.However, Sual this month dropped its opposition to the spin off after “further discussions with EN+”. The “alignment”, as EN+ called it, has rung alarm bells at Odey, which is concerned that an attempt could be made to buy out minority shareholders once the demerger is complete, according to people with knowledge of the matter.Rusal is worth $15.6bn — only $3bn more than the value of its 25.5 per cent stake in Russian metals miner Norilsk Nickel. At current prices, its value including net debt, adjusted for its stake in Norilsk Nickel, is about 3.5 times forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, according to JPMorgan.Odey’s Natural Resources Fund, run by Henry Steel, has told Rusal and its advisers that it would vote in favour of the deal but only if Rusal sets out a sustainable capital returns policy, the people said — a move it believes would help drive a re-rating of its shares.Aluminium prices have risen more than 30 per cent this year following production cuts in China, boosting profits and cash flow at Rusal, which has a 6 per cent share of the global market. However, the company has again decided not to pay a dividend, focusing instead on reducing debt.Odey holds no shares in Rusal but owns derivatives that give it the option to acquire a stake. Steel has used derivatives to agitate for higher bids in the takeovers of Acacia Mining and Sirius Minerals. His fund has delivered a 20 per cent annual annual return since its launch in 2019.Rusal said it was not aware of any investigation by HKEX and that it had yet to publish any information concerning voting arrangements for the demerger.“The case for demerger is clear and will create value for all shareholders,” the company said in a statement. “The two businesses will have a different trajectory and strategy to decarbonise their operations but they will share the same 2050 goal: net zero.”EN+ declined to comment. Sual did not respond to a request for comment.Steel said he had discussed his concerns with Rusal and the chair of EN+.“We are grateful for the continued engagement with all stakeholders, particularly with the boards of EN+ and Rusal, to ensure that potential or perceived conflicts with minority shareholders are nullified,” he said.Rusal’s spin-off plan comes after the EU launched a carbon border adjustment mechanism that will force importers of steel, cement, aluminium and fertiliser to pay the same carbon costs faced by European industry. The prospect of the levy has alarmed Russian businesses, which have said they would be the worst hit.
129  Poland and Hungary have two months to respond to a series of questions over alleged rule of law violations that could threaten their EU funding as Brussels steps up pressure over judicial independence.On Friday, Brussels sent letters to the Polish and Hungarian ambassadors to the EU, which set out a detailed series of questions on possible breaches to the rule of law in Warsaw and Budapest and their implications for the protection of EU money.The letters, seen by the FT, mark an informal step towards a decision in the coming months by Brussels over whether to trigger a new rule of law conditionality mechanism, which would permit EU funds to be held back.Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, has said triggering the mechanism is one of the options on the table as Brussels responds to rule of law concerns in Poland.The letter sent to Warsaw concerns judicial and prosecutorial services, while the commission has asked Hungary to provide information on the country's system of public procurement and the independence of its courts.The commission has been engaged in a long-running legal battle over changes to Poland’s court system that it says threaten judicial independence and the fundamental legal bonds that hold the EU together.Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party says the changes are necessary to increase efficiency, and that Brussels has no right to intervene in what it regards as a domestic matter.Tension between Brussels and Warsaw escalated in October when the country’s top court ruled that key elements of EU law were incompatible with its constitution.The stand-off has delayed approval of Poland’s €36bn Covid-19 economic recovery package from Brussels.Some member states and parts of the commission have called for the activation of the new conditionality mechanism, which could threaten tens of billions of euros in annual EU funds paid to Warsaw.Hungary is due to receive €7.2bn from the recovery fund.The letters sent to Warsaw and Budapest do not mark a formal triggering of the mechanism, but they are a step in that direction.Hungary has been asked to provide clarification over “persistent” deficiencies and weaknesses in the country's procurement rules that have stoked concern over corruption linked to the dispersal of EU funds.Brussels has asked Viktor Orban's government to provide a list of the 10 people or groups who receive the highest share of the billions of euros of EU farming subsidies that Hungary receives.The letter to the Polish government contains a set of detailed questions about judicial developments.Among the issues raised is a Polish court ruling this autumn that found parts of EU law were not compatible with the country’s constitution, as well as a July ruling about interim measures ordered by the European Court of Justice. The letter asks how Poland will ensure respect for laws regarding the protection of EU money, in light of those decisions.The letter also raises questions about the Polish prosecutorial services, including the merger of the office of the Polish minister of justice with its prosecutor-general, as well as the dismissal of a number of prosecutors in recent years.If the prosecution service is not properly effective and impartial, this could have implications for cases regarding the management of EU funds, the letter says.The commission also raises questions over the pursuit of corruption and conflict of interest cases in Poland, asking whether cases involving the use of EU money will be properly handled.Challenges to the independence of the Polish judiciary could also affect the “effectiveness and impartiality” of judicial proceedings relating to the management of EU funds, the commission said, “creating a risk to the protection of the financial interests of the European Union.”Poland is under pressure to dismantle a controversial disciplinary chamber for judges that the European Court of Justice has found to be illegal.Polish officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
130  As Carlos Torres Vila, the head of BBVA, set out why the Spanish lender planned to take full ownership of Turkish bank Garanti, it did not always sound like the sales pitch typically rolled out for corporate deals.But then the 55-year-old BBVA chair could hardly ignore the backdrop to the transaction — years of erratic economic management and turbulent politics under Turkey president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.“We have seen recurrent crises, spiralling inflation and depreciation of the currency, and we have suffered that in our flesh and blood, through devaluation of our invested amount,” Torres said on Monday, as BBVA announced plans to pay €2.25bn for the remaining 50 per cent of Garanti, in which it has been building a stake since 2011.The BBVA bid, which would be one of Turkey’s biggest single foreign direct investments in recent years if shareholders and regulators approve it, buoyed the country’s stock market. But BBVA shares closed down 4 per cent, with analysts at Citigroup describing the deal as “risky”.Despite the euphoria over the deal in Istanbul, business executives and analysts cautioned it was too early to declare whether the move would herald more investment in a country whose strategic location and 83m-strong population has long held great promise for foreign companies.“Most western investors see the political risk in Turkey as too high right now,” said Jonathan Friedman, an analyst at Wallbrook, a global risk and ESG consultancy.Instead, the BBVA deal fits into a pattern familiar to foreign diplomats in Turkey: while new entrants remain deeply wary, some of those companies with a longstanding presence are prepared to increase their commitment.Torres hailed the chance to capture the rest of Garanti as a great deal, in part because of the Spanish bank’s intimate knowledge of the Turkish lender, which was already largely consolidated in BBVA’s accounts.“At these prices the risks are priced in,” he told analysts. “We know the asset well, we’ve run it for a decade, we’ve seen how in crisis situations it operates and generates euro returns.”Over the past five years Garanti had generated an average of €1.2bn to €1.3bn in net profits a year, he added — even though the Turkish lira has tumbled more than 70 per cent against the euro since the start of 2016.The currency sank further on Thursday after the central bank slashed interest rates, defying warnings from investors that the move would further fuel inflation. The decline in the lira was steep enough to drag on BBVA shares, which closed 5.5 per cent lower.Ahmet Burak Daglioglu, head of the Turkish government’s investment office, which is tasked with attracting foreign capital, insisted that “the risk perception of those outside Turkey is higher than those inside Turkey”.It is a view echoed by Cavit Habib, chief executive of the Turkish division of Danish services provider ISS, which has been in the country for 16 years and this year acquired a local facilities management company. “Being here and looking at things from the outside are totally two different things,” said Habib.Nor is BBVA the only foreign company willing to stomach the macro turmoil. Ford Otosan, a partnership between the US carmaker and Turkey’s largest conglomerate that dates back almost a century, announced in March plans to invest €2bn over the next five years.Huhtamaki, a Finnish producer of sustainable packaging that first entered Turkey in 1997, acquired local company Elif Plastik for €412m in September. “It’s not a new market for us. That makes it easier,” said Katariina Hietaranta, a Huhtamaki official, adding that the fact that the majority of its sales were exports “helps a lot to mitigate the currency risk”.However, international companies already in Turkey are not blind to the dangers, including a steady erosion of democratic freedoms and the rule of law. One foreign executive said he lives in fear of being hit with some “horrible, politicised” tax ruling that could result in a large fine. “It’s not just that it drags on in the courts, but that you will never successfully appeal it,” he said.Erdogan’s determination to prioritise growth at all costs, and relentless interference in the central bank, has hammered the lira while leaving Turkey mired in a boom-and-bust cycle. Although the IMF forecasts the economy will grow by about 9 per cent this year, that expansion has come with an inflation rate running at 20 per cent.The corporate departures from Turkey in recent years have been notable, including Japanese carmaker Honda and the US home appliance maker Whirlpool. UniCredit, Italy’s second-largest bank, joined them this month, announcing plans to sell its remaining 20 per cent stake in Turkish lender Yapi Kredi in 2022.Andrea Orcel has set about simplifying UniCredit’s global footprint since joining as chief executive in April. The decision to dispose of its stake in Yapi Kredi was part of that strategy, with UniCredit selling off minority holdings in countries where it does not have a significant presence.But a person with knowledge of the bank’s plans said the relative lack of liquidity in Turkey’s capital markets, combined with political uncertainty in Ankara, played a part in UniCredit’s decision.Turkish officials say that foreign direct investment figures for this year will improve on the levels seen in 2019 and 2020, when they languished at 15-year lows, with the country’s growing tech sector helping.Tech start-ups, often based in Istanbul, have defied the gloomy trend as venture capitalists, private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds pour money into the likes of Getir, a delivery app, and Trendyol, an ecommerce site.Turkey bulls also point to the growing confidence among opposition parties that Erdogan could be forced from power in elections that are due in 2023, but could take place sooner.“The consensus view is that all Turkey needs is for one man to retire and the country could be off to the races,” said Charles Robertson of Renaissance Capital, the emerging markets-focused investment bank.Yet analysts like Friedman at Wallbrook said betting that the worst was over remained a huge gamble. He added: “Investing on the upswing is always seen as lower risk than trying to time the bottom.”
131  The wife of France’s president said it went against the “beauty” of the language, the country’s education minister saw it as a sign of creeping “wokeism” and a parliamentarian was so enraged he complained to the Académie Française. The culprit: a three-letter entry in the online edition of Le Petit Robert.Brigitte Macron, wife of President Emmanuel Macron and a former teacher, education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer and MP François Jolivet were among those who this week publicly voiced their disapproval at the inclusion of the gender-neutral pronoun “iel”, a blend of “il” and “elle” or he and she, in the dictionary that is a staple in homes across the country.According to the new definition, “iel” and “iels” in plural are used to “refer to a person of any gender” and are an “inclusive form of communication”. They are often used by those who do not identify exclusively as either a man or a woman, also referred to as “gender non-binary”, and who can feel excluded by the mainstream use of gendered pronouns.For Blanquer, however, such “inclusive writing is not the future”, while Jolivet in his letter to the official guardian of the French language hit out at an “ideological intrusion”. The publisher’s staff were “activists of a cause which has nothing French about it: wokeism”, he wrote in an accompanying tweet.Questioned by journalists after she visited a school, Brigitte Macron insisted there were “two pronouns: he and she”, adding that “the language is so beautiful and two pronouns is good.”The “iel” controversy has stoked the ire of many French politicians, intellectuals and journalists against what they see as the creep of progressive American values into French culture, particularly pertaining to gender, race and colonial history.It has touched a nerve particularly on the French political right, who believe their culture and way of life are under attack from politically correct militants and “Islamo-leftist” academics.It has also reignited a debate about the inherent sexism of French and other Latin languages where everything has a gender, including the word for “they” used as a gender-neutral pronoun in English.“This is currently part of a very explosive context around what is referred to as ‘cancel culture’, ‘wokeism’ and ‘intersectionality’,” said Virginie Martin, a political analyst at Kedge Business School.Rightwing politicians, such as presidential hopeful Eric Zemmour, were inflaming the debate and “creating a kind of competition and bidding war around who can manifest more traditionalist values”, she added.The criticisms drew a sharp response from Le Robert’s director-general, who noted that even though use of the word was “still relatively limited”, his staff had noted its increasing popularity in the past few months.“The meaning of the word ‘iel’ cannot be understood by reading it alone.and it seemed useful to us to specify its meaning for those who encounter it, whether they wish to use it or[not],” Charles Bimbenet wrote.“Le Robert’s mission is to observe the evolution of the French language in motion, diverse as it is, and to report on it,” he said, adding that the publisher “was not suddenly affected by acute ‘wokeism’.(not yet defined, editor’s note) whose definition we promise to provide soon.”Al Colsaet, a French doctoral student who defines as “iel”, wrote on Twitter that “fortunately the future of the French language is not decided by [Blanquer] or [Jolivet] or the Academy, but by those who speak it. I use #iel every day and it warms my heart to see it in the [dictionary].”The fight echoes the increasingly rancorous debate that has fermented in the US over what schools should teach, which at its heart is a fight between conservatives and liberals over which version of America will prevail.Martin, however, said there was also a particularly French element to the “iel” row.“What seems to be behind all of this is that France. does not like to talk about minorities. It doesn’t know how to do it,” she said, referring to those who uncomfortable with the use of gendered pronouns. “The French form of universalism tends to render minorities invisible.”The Academie Francaise has yet to pronounce on the matter.Letters in response to this article:Three-letter word strikes chord for lovers of ‘la langue française’ / From Michael Poynor, Coustouge, Occitanie, FranceQuestions raised by row over ‘preferred pronouns’ / From Louis Marvick, Emeritus Professor of French University of Nevada, Reno, NV, US, Lüneburg, Germany
132  With Russia in the grip of runaway inflation and a divisive push for Covid vaccine passports, state television’s most-watched news talk shows have turned to a favourite subject in trying times: Ukraine, the “brotherly nation”-turned-familiar bugbear for the Kremlin.The heightened tensions with the west over a troop build-up near the border have highlighted Russia’s fixation with Ukraine during a seven-year proxy war that has killed more than 14,000 in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas.Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, has denied any Russian involvement in Kyiv’s conflict with Moscow-led separatists, but made Ukraine the centrepiece of a 30-minute address to foreign policy officials this week, telling them the war footing was a reminder to the west not to cross Russia’s “red lines”.Those include a promise that Nato refrain from expanding into Ukraine, according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who described it as “an extremely undesirable and unacceptable scenario for us”.The Ukraine issue is an emotional one for Russians, who retain close cultural and family ties to the country despite several years of war.Evgeny Popov, a lawmaker and co-host of 60 Minutes, Russian state television’s most popular talk show, is a case in point: he is unable to visit his father, who lives in a Ukrainian town he would not name, thanks to an entry ban by Ukrainian security services.“People don’t watch these shows for entertainment value — they see what’s happening to their relatives and loved ones,” Popov said.“We are one people. It’s basically the same space — it just so happens that we’re on other sides of the border thanks to some villains,” he added.Analysts say Putin’s desire to rid Ukraine of western influence is underpinned by a conviction that it is an inalienable part of the “Russian world”, a Moscow-centric sphere of influence rooted in the Soviet Union and the Tsarist empire.Putin has described the collapse of the USSR, which separated millions of intermarried families on either side of the Ukrainian border, as “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century” and has questioned the grounds on which Ukraine broke off from Russia.Following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, Putin likened the Ukrainian peninsula, where Vladimir the Great — the first Christian ruler of Rus, a medieval state ruled from Kyiv — was baptised in 988AD, as “Russia’s Temple Mount” — a notion that has no theological basis but cast Putin as the protector of Russians everywhere.Moscow has sought to put that into practice by protesting against laws introduced by Kyiv that aim to promoting the primacy of the Ukrainian language, including limitations on using the Russian language in public settings and an exclusion of Russians from a list of Ukraine’s “indigenous peoples.”The language laws have proved relatively uncontroversial in Ukraine, where Ukrainian is growing popular even among some native Russian speakers, but provided ample fodder for Russian TV.“They’re trying to destroy the Russian people. We need to save that people,” said Popov.In July, Putin published a 5,000-word article, apparently based on his own historical research in which he wrote that he was “convinced that the true sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership with Russia” and vowed Moscow would never allow the country to become “anti-Russia”.“In Putin’s understanding, the people of Ukraine are basically one with Russians, so they should support integration with Russia. But since the country is under the thumb of the west the people are being tricked — they’re hostage to geopolitical games,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of political consultancy R. Politik. “If the Americans left, it’d be a unified state.and everything would be great. Or so Putin thinks.”The article sparked concerns in Ukraine that Putin — who has avoided requests to meet his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky and visibly lost interest in the Ukrainian peace process — had grander designs on the country.“Putin has a sense of mission on reinstalling a new kind of empire. It’s sitting very deep in his mind. Not just Ukraine’s success, but also any separate path of Ukraine would be highly damaging to the Russian mythology,” said Pavlo Klimkin, Ukraine’s former foreign minister.Klimkin, who was born in Kursk, Russia, added: “The narrative in Russia is that there is no Ukrainian identity as such, including history, language, mentality and statehood. Putin’s stance on Ukraine is highly irrational. Ukrainians and Russians have two different sets of values.”Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, said Russia had neglected to study Ukraine’s changing society over the years in favour of dealing directly with its oligarchical elites, many of whom had close business ties to Moscow until 2014.That blinkered attitude led the Kremlin to write off surges in pro-western sentiment, such as the 2004 Orange revolution and the Euromaidan protests a decade later, as manipulation by foreign powers rather than reflective of broader changes in Ukrainian society, Trenin said.The war had accelerated those social changes to the point where “separate Ukrainian statehood is incompatible with any meaningful integration with Russia”, added Trenin.Ukraine’s cultural ties to Russia made Moscow’s stand-off with the US over security all the more poignant, Popov said, likening recent Nato exercises in Ukraine and western support for Kyiv’s military to the Cuban missile crisis.“There’s a great joke that captures what this is all about — Russia and America will fight each other until there are no Ukrainians left,” Popov said. “America’s far away, that’s a geopolitical advantage. And the missiles and anti-missile systems and tanks and troops and bases [.] are in Ukraine. Why should we put up with that?”
133  As we fire more and more wonderful tech into orbit around the Earth, the need grows for increased “space traffic control” and simple garbage collection tech to cope with decay and inevitable obsolescence.The problem of space debris has been highlighted this week by Russia blowing apart one of its own satellites in a test of an anti-satellite missile. The US protested that it generated more than 1,500 pieces of “trackable orbital debris and will likely generate hundreds of thousands of pieces of smaller orbital debris”, threatening people working at the International Space Station and “other human space flight activities”.There is no tech deployed to date that can “Hoover” up such potentially deadly fragments. Japan’s Astroscale is the closest we have to a space clean-up company. Its ELSA-d prototype successfully demonstrated in August how it could magnetically capture redundant satellites, with the aim of towing them away to disintegrate in the Earth’s atmosphere as they descend. UK satellite company OneWeb is already fitting its latest satellites with compatible magnetic docking plates.Katrina Manson and Max Seddon report the debris cloud created by Russia in low earth orbit threatens to affect hundreds of commercial satellites, including from SpaceX and the US imaging company Planet, while refocusing rising tensions between Russia and the US on the escalating weaponisation of space.“They basically set off a bomb in the middle of the new space race,” said Daniel Ceperley, chief executive and co-founder of Leo Labs, which uses radar to track objects in space to prevent collisions.The Californian company recently received a follow-on investment from Seraphim Space Investment Trust, the world’s first listed SpaceTech fund, which reported September quarter results today after listing in London in July.Seraphim said it had also invested in antenna, earth observation and navigation companies. “The SpaceTech investment market remains buoyant, with record levels of private investment,” said CEO Mark Boggett. Its research shows $6.4bn was invested in SpaceTech in the first half of this year and nearly 600 satellites were launched in the second quarter. Anyone with good ideas on how to enable a circular economy for the thousands of objects circling the earth ought to be getting some of that money as well.1.

134  Good evening,Worrying data on increasing case rates of infections, hospitalisations and deaths across Europe have provoked a range of measures to reduce the spread of Covid-19 this week.The tightening of restrictions, particularly on those who have declined immunisation or proffering evidence of immunity from transmitting the disease, has reopened ugly fissures between proponents of personal responsibility and critics of communal coercion.Austria’s government confirmed today that it plans to make vaccination against coronavirus mandatory for all citizens from early next year, making it the first European country to do so. Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said that it was time “to face reality” as he announced a new three-week lockdown for all Austrians. But between the rights or wrongs of political debates over a growing wave of tightening measures across Europe, the increasing strains on health services and squeeze on economic activities in the lead up to the festive season remind us that for many this Christmas will not be a much hoped for return to pre-pandemic Yuletide normality.Dr Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, warned yesterday that the continent faced “a hard winter ahead” despite the success of vaccination programmes in allowing the easing of preventive measures and unlocking of economies over the year.“But far too many remain unvaccinated, so we have pockets in which the virus continues to spread and cause strain on local and national health systems,” he told the BBC.His remarks came just a day after departing German chancellor Angela Merkel warned that a fourth wave of Covid-19 was “hitting our country with full force”, as health agencies announced a record daily case rate of over 65,000.Much of Germany and Austria are now covered by variations of so-called 2G restrictions — a reference to German words geimpft and genesen for vaccinated and recovered — that preclude significant minorities of unvaccinated people from non-essential shops and social events. Dutch MPs also debated the move this week.Similar restrictions on leisure activities, encouragement of homeworking and enforcement of “Covid passports” for entry to events have been rolled out elsewhere in recent days, including in Ireland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic.Vaccine passports enjoy substantial support across Europe, according to a YouGov survey published today in the Guardian.The survey, which covers 10 countries, suggests there is majority backing for mandatory vaccine passes to access large events as well as support in most territories for them to be required in cafés, restaurants and gyms.Plans for extensions to stimulus packages to help underpin stuttering recovery for leading economies were the order of the week.US legislators today voted through Joe Biden’s $1.75tn Build Back Better bill, designed to make sweeping investments in early childhood education, public healthcare for pensioners and programmes to combat climate change, after a filibustering speech by a leading Republican delayed approval yesterday night.The wrangle comes just days after Biden signed his flagship $1.2tn infrastructure bill into law after gaining bipartisan support. This bill contains $550bn in new spending on roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, broadband and other infrastructure improvements.In Japan, new prime minister Fumio Kishida unveiled a ¥43.7tn ($383bn) stimulus package today. It includes generous cash handouts for households and help for struggling businesses and is designed to prop up the country’s faltering recovery from the pandemic.Japan has already spent ¥88tn in fiscal stimulus, or nearly 17 per cent of gross domestic product, since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak in 2020.An early surge in shopping ahead of Christmas helped British retail sales return to growth last month after nearly half a year of contraction.Figures released by the UK’s Office for National Statistics today show the volume of monthly retail sales in Great Britain grew 0.8 per cent between September and October.Growth was helped by clothing stores, which recorded their highest sales since the start of the pandemic.However, public borrowing in the UK fell less than expected in October, reflecting higher interest payments on public debt and the cost of the Covid-19 vaccination programme even as tax receipts increased thanks to stronger economic activity.The ONS estimated public sector net borrowing was £18.8bn last month, compared with a forecast of £13.8bn culled from a poll of economists by Reuters.Meanwhile, Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, warned against an overhasty squeeze on monetary policy across the eurozone today.Speaking to a Frankfurt banking conference, she said: “We must not rush into a premature tightening when faced with passing or supply-driven inflation shocks.”Her remarks put further pressure on the euro exchange rate against other major currencies, fuelling expectations of a growing interest rate gap between the eurozone and other major economies.However, the prospect of ECB policy staying accommodative for longer, boosted by news of the fresh German and Austrian restrictions, prompted a rally in eurozone government bonds.America’s largest retailers are weathering the country’s supply chain storm, while smaller rivals struggle to secure sufficient supplies, according to the latest wave of earnings announcements.The surging recovery in demand since last year’s Covid-19 lockdowns has strained all importers, write the FT’s Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson and Obey Manayiti. Rocketing ocean freight costs, port logjams and shortages of materials, truckers and warehouse space have led to unprecedented supply chain challenges.But it is smaller, poorer countries that are being hit hardest by bottlenecks caused by the bounceback in global trading activity, writes Harry Dempsey.The UN has warned that elevated shipping costs resulting from the global supply chain crunch would further fuel inflation around the world and disproportionately hit developing nations’ economies. The pandemic-induced boom in demand for goods, combined with supply chain disruptions, have caused freight rates to rocket to record highs, reaching about five times their average over the past decade.Pandemic control: The British may fetishise their National Health Service and the Americans their healthcare innovations and star doctors, but when seen through the lens of coronavirus, other countries — from Taiwan to Norway — have served their citizens’ health better.Zoologists fear wildlife could become a reservoir of infection that could be transmitted to people. Two studies showing high levels of Covid-19 infection among wild deer in the US have renewed concerns about the virus spreading through animal populations.Genetic engineering research has made some fear the next pandemic could be lab-made.Vaccines: Pfizer is seeking regulatory authorisation in the US for its Covid-19 antiviral pill, which has been shown to cut the risk of hospitalisation and death in adults by nearly 90 per cent in late-stage studies. Sandy Douglas, one of the scientists behind the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine has defended a decision to make profits on new supply deals this week, as the partnership announced that more than 2bn doses had been delivered.Treatments: The FT’s video team has had a look inside UK hospitals to assess the strain Covid-19 has been placing on the health system.Get the latest worldwide picture with our vaccine trackerSit back and relax: from politics, economics and history to art, food and, of course, fiction — FT writers and critics pick their favourite reads in our annual round-up of publishing highlights.FT readers are invited to register to attend The Global Boardroom, an online digital conference being held on 7-9 December.Topics will include:Register here for free
135  A senior UK cabinet minister said on Friday the government was “confident” that talks with the EU over the post-Brexit trading status of Northern Ireland could be resolved without a bust-up with Brussels.Michael Gove’s comments came as the EU and UK both reported progress after a week of “constructive” talks in Brussels over how to settle the long-running dispute over the so-called Northern Ireland protocol.Prospects for a deal were raised when Gove, secretary of state for housing and levelling up and a former negotiator on implementing Brexit, said he did not believe Britain would have to trigger the Article 16 mechanism to suspend parts of the protocol.Gove is among a number of cabinet ministers keen to avoid a potential trade war with the EU over the issue; chancellor Rishi Sunak has also warned of the economic consequences of such a dispute.“I do believe that there is a constructive approach that’s being taken by the [European] Commission,” Gove said at a meeting of the British-Irish Council in Dublin.Gove said that while Lord David Frost, Brexit minister, had signalled his willingness to use Article 16, “we’re confident that we’ll be able to make progress without it”. Gove was seen in Brussels as a much more constructive negotiating partner than Frost.Frost has been instructed by Boris Johnson, prime minister, to make a renewed push for a negotiated agreement in the run-up to Christmas; combative language has been replaced by a more conciliatory tone.Frost met Maros Šefčovič, commission vice-president, in Brussels on Friday to review the latest talks on the protocol, part of the Brexit deal intended to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland.It does this by allowing Northern Ireland to remain in the EU single market for goods, but this requires checks on shipments crossing the Irish Sea between Great Britain and the region. The Brexit minister argues that the inspections demanded by Brussels are excessive.Frost said on Friday that, while “significant gaps” remained between the two sides on most issues, the recent round of talks had been “intensive and constructive”.He said that Article 16 remained “a legitimate” recourse for the UK government in the event that a negotiated agreement was not possible, but added that he wanted to “secure a solution based on consensus”.Šefčovič said there had been enough progress to continue the talks but called for a “shift into a result-oriented mode”. He added: “It is essential that the recent change in tone now leads to joint tangible solutions in the framework of the protocol,” he said.He said there had been “useful engagement at a technical level” on reducing customs controls by half. The biggest gap remains on agrifood checks. Sefcovic called for a “clear move towards us” by the UK.“Identity and physical checks would be reduced by around 80 per cent compared to the checks currently required,” he said.But the UK disputes that figure and is wary of allowing the EU oversight of production standards, a quid pro quo of the deal. London is also pushing for free movement of pets across the Irish Sea.
136  Eric Zemmour knows how to get himself noticed: the extreme-right French presidential hopeful, whose insurgent tactics and ability to stir outrage have been likened to those of Donald Trump, has electrified a campaign season that had looked set to culminate in a repeat of the 2017 showdown between Emmanuel Macron, now the incumbent, and far-right leader Marine Le Pen.The latest attention-grabbing move by Zemmour, who has been on trial in Paris this week for hate speech, was to visit the Bataclan concert hall last Saturday night, on the sixth anniversary of the Islamist terror attacks that killed 130 in Paris. Instead of simply paying his respects in silence like other politicians at the site, he publicly blamed the killings on immigration — the issue that he has relentlessly pushed to the front of the political agenda in France ahead of the April election.Zemmour — a vulpine 63-year-old television talk show polemicist, who in recent weeks overtook Le Pen to reach number two in the opinion polls behind Macron — said that then president François Hollande “knew that terrorists were infiltrated among migrants [coming into Europe].and he made the absolutely criminal decision to keep the borders open”.Opprobrium rained down almost immediately not only from victims’ groups and Hollande himself, but also from Le Pen. “Eric Zemmour’s problem is that he is a polemicist and he does not know how to do anything but create polemics,” said Le Pen.Zemmour, however, won two full days of news coverage out of the episode. Boosted by CNews — the TV channel backed by rightwing tycoon Vincent Bolloré where he was the star commentator — he was already creating more buzz in the form of Google searches and social media commentary than his rivals, despite having yet to officially declare his campaign.His extraordinary rise since he emerged as a putative candidate in the summer is down to a Trumpian genius for picking simple themes that resonate with voters and an equally Trumpian insistence that the country is going to the dogs, all with an intellectual flavour and a smattering of history to appeal to the French middle class.While Trump wanted to “build the wall” to keep out immigrants from Latin America, Zemmour has suggested banning foreign first names such as Mohammed and Kevin. And while Trump wanted to “make America great again”, Zemmour warns of the decline of a Judeo-Christian nation under assault from immigration, feminism and liberalism; one of his books is called The Suicide of France.“He touches a pretty deep anguish,” says François-Xavier Bellamy, a member of the European Parliament for the conservative Les Républicains party. “It’s a pessimistic vision, declinist if you will, but not unfounded.” In a country with the largest populations in western Europe of both Muslims and Jews, Zemmour’s inflammatory language and his talent for setting the agenda are regarded as extremely dangerous on the left and in the centre of French politics — particularly since he has won the support of supposedly centre-right voters long wary of Le Pen.“All the candidates of the right are becoming more extreme, are Zemmour-ising themselves,” says Virginie Martin, politics professor at Kedge Business School in Paris.Julian Jackson, biographer of Charles de Gaulle, says Zemmour’s peculiar defence of Philippe Pétain’s wartime Vichy government — he has controversially claimed that the regime protected French Jews at the expense of foreigners — is “very, very dangerous” because he says that Zemmour, who is himself Jewish, is trying to justify discrimination if it falls short of extermination.“In the 1930s, people talked of Jews the way Zemmour talks of Muslims today,” says Jackson.Zemmour thrives on such controversy. Only this week, the Royal Institution in London, citing a “process of due diligence”, cancelled an event at which Zemmour was due to speak on Friday as part of his campaign to win support from the many French voters living in the UK.He has repeatedly run foul of France’s strict laws against inciting racial or religious hatred and denying the Holocaust, and been accused in 16 such legal cases over the years, according to his lawyer. But he has prevailed in most of them, often using a free speech defence, and he argues that he is being targeted for politically incorrect views.On Wednesday, although not present in court, he went on trial for “inciting hatred” for particularly virulent comments he made on CNews last year about immigrant minors as “thieves”, “murderers” and “rapists” whom France should “send back”. Faced with a possible fine of €10,000 if convicted, Zemmour put out a statement to say he would not be silenced: “I will not attend this trial because I refuse that political debate take place in courtrooms. The prosecutor and the antiracist groups think they can intimidate and discourage me. They are only reinforcing my determination.”It was vintage Zemmour from a newcomer to electoral politics so outrageous he has succeeded in making Le Pen and her Rassemblement National party seem almost moderate. “He thinks civil war has started,” said the RN’s Jordan Bardella, accusing Zemmour of dragging French nationalists back to the era of Pétain. “I don’t think it has, and must be avoided.” 
137  Turkey’s lira dropped to an all-time low on Friday as investors reacted with bewilderment to the previous day’s cut in interest rates, which some analysts say has plunged the country into a currency crisis.The lira had rebounded in morning trading from a heavy fall, but sustained a fresh jolt of selling by the London afternoon. The currency was recently trading down around 2 per cent at TL11.32 per dollar.The currency has declined more than 30 per cent this year after investors lost faith in the authorities’ ability to manage the economy in the face of inflation that accelerated to almost 20 per cent in October. Turkey’s central bank under governor Sahap Kavcioglu has slashed rates from 19 per cent since the start of September — under heavy pressure from president Recep Tayyip Erdogan — despite the runaway price rises.“If a currency loses more than one-third of its value on the FX market in less than three months then it is probably justified to speak of a crisis,” said Ulrich Leuchtmann, Commerzbank’s head of FX research.Investors said there was little prospect of a lasting recovery for the lira unless the central bank could somehow free itself from Erdogan’s unorthodox belief that high interest rates fuelled, rather than tamed, inflation.“As an investor, when you see a blow-up in a currency it’s always tempting to take the other side,” said Viktor Szabo, a portfolio manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “But in this case it’s not worth it. If you had some certainty policy was going to change then maybe, but there’s no sign of that.”While interest rates of 15 per cent might be ostensibly attractive to return-hungry overseas investors, prospective annual gains could be “wiped out in a few weeks”, given the pace of decline in the lira, Szabo said.Erdogan, who fired Kavcioglu’s well-respected predecessor in March, has stepped up his campaign for lower borrowing costs in recent months in a bid to bolster growth as he faces a slide in popularity. But Thursday’s cut, which could be followed by a further reduction in December, is likely to prove “unsustainable”, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs.“Policy easing is likely to quickly translate into inflation, rather than growth,” they said, adding that negative real interest rates — once inflation is taken into account — increase risks that Turkish households will begin to shift their savings en masse into dollars.“In the end they will have to hike,” said Timothy Ash of BlueBay Asset Management. “Otherwise you end up in a situation where inflation is so high you will see locals selling the lira, you end up in a vicious cycle of inflation and depreciation.”
138  The head of Germany’s central bank has set up a clash over eurozone monetary policy by warning that inflation is likely to stay above the European Central Bank’s target for longer than expected and may require a reduction in its stimulus.Jens Weidmann, the outgoing president of the Bundesbank and a member of the ECB governing council, told a banking conference in Frankfurt on Friday: “Given the considerable uncertainty about the inflation outlook, monetary policy should not commit to its current very expansionary stance for too long.”His comments jarred with those by Christine Lagarde a few hours earlier, when the ECB president told the same event that rate-setters should remain “patient” to avoid tightening policy prematurely, despite soaring eurozone inflation that is “unwelcome and painful”.“We must not rush into a premature tightening when faced with passing or supply-driven inflation shocks,” said Lagarde, indicating she expects the ECB to maintain a sizeable stimulus at its meeting next month even as other central banks reduce support.Their speeches laid bare divisions among ECB rate-setters ahead of their meeting next month when they are due to decide how many bonds to buy next year and to publish new inflation forecasts that will give investors a crucial clue about how close they are to raising rates.The ECB is increasingly diverging from other major central banks, such as the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England, which have responded to the recent surge in inflation by promising to tighten policy.Inflation in the euro area hit a 13-year high of 4.1 per cent in October, well above the ECB’s 2 per cent target, prompting some investors to bet that the ECB would raise rates next year. But Lagarde said many of the drivers of higher inflation, such as soaring energy prices and supply chain bottlenecks, were “likely to fade over the medium term”, which meant “conditions to raise rates are very unlikely to be satisfied next year”.“At a time when purchasing power is already being squeezed by higher energy and fuel bills, an undue tightening would represent an unwarranted headwind for the recovery,” she added.Lagarde’s remarks knocked the euro, which was already being hit by investor concerns about restrictions to counter record Covid-19 infections in parts of Europe. The euro fell 0.7 per cent against the US dollar to trade at $1.284, close to a 16-month low, and lost ground against other major currencies including sterling and the yen. Against the Swiss franc it hit a six-year low of SFr1.048.Eurozone government bonds rallied on the prospect of ECB policy staying accommodative for longer, and were given a further boost by news of fresh German and Austrian restrictions being implemented to contain the spread of coronavirus. The yields on German 10-year government bonds, a benchmark for assets across the euro area, fell 0.04 of a percentage point to minus 0.32 per cent, the lowest level in two months.“The market is understandably fearful of further Covid-related disruptions and the impact that could have on growth,” said Lee Hardman, a currency analyst at MUFG. “That certainly helps Lagarde’s efforts to push back on expectations for early ECB rate hikes.” The Bundesbank boss expressed doubt about ECB predictions for inflation to fall back below its 2 per cent target in the next couple of years. “The elevated inflation rates will probably take longer than previously projected to recede again,” said Weidmann, who last month announced he would step down in December, six years before his term expires, in part due to his frustration over ECB policy.“To keep inflation expectations well anchored, we need to reiterate over and over again: if required to safeguard price stability, monetary policy as a whole will have to be normalised,” he said.When the ECB meets next month it is widely expected to announce that its flagship €1.85tn bond-buying programme will expire in March 2022. Investors are expecting the central bank to cushion the potential impact on bond markets by stepping up its longer-standing asset purchase programme.Having committed not to raise rates before it stops primary bond purchases, next month’s decision will provide a vital signal on the potential timing of the first rate rise.Weidmann pointed out that the ECB had become the biggest creditor to eurozone governments after buying sovereign debt worth almost a third of the bloc’s gross domestic product. “Central banks will come increasingly under pressure from governments and financial markets to keep monetary policy expansionary for longer than the rationale of price stability would call for,” he said.
139  The writer is chair of the Centre for Liberal Strategies, SofiaRevenge is the true religion of petty dictators. Consider Alexander Lukashenko, the strongman ruler of Belarus, who lured desperate people from the Middle East and Africa with the promise of easy entrance into the EU via the Belarusian-Polish border.He was driven by a desire to punish the EU for its support for anti-government demonstrations in his country, rather than by some grand strategy of rebalancing the constellation of powers in Europe. It was also an attempt to strengthen his position with respect to Moscow and to distract his own people from domestic grievances.It was not very original of Lukashenko to make migration an instrument of his revenge. Citing research by the US academic Kelly Greenhill in his book The Age of Unpeace, Mark Leonard highlights that since the 1951 refugee convention came into force, there have been at least 75 attempts globally by state and non-state actors to use displaced people as political weapons. Their methods and aims have been political, military and economic, ranging from the provision of financial aid to full-scale invasion and assistance in effecting regime change.The frightening statistic is that in nearly three-quarters of these historical cases, the coercers achieved at least some of their stated objectives. In well over half of the documented cases, they obtained all or nearly all of what they sought, making this unconventional instrument of state-level influence more effective than either economic sanctions or traditional, military-backed coercive diplomacy.It may seem that Lukashenko’s attempt to weaponise migration will turn out to be a rare example of failure. The Belarusian authorities started this week to clear the encampments at the country’s border with Poland. Migrants have been moved to a logistics centre where at least they can get some food and medication. The first repatriation flight to Iraq has departed from Minsk. Lukashenko’s plan has collapsed — unless we are to believe that the only reason he brought so much suffering to thousands of migrants was to have telephone conversations with Angela Merkel, Germany’s outgoing chancellor.But while the tensions on the Polish-Belarusian border have receded, and Poland and the EU seem to have prevailed, this is hardly a victory for the 27-nation bloc. The crisis has revealed that the mood in Europe today is marked by anticipatory panic. The EU’s foreign policy is trapped by the growing gap between Brussels’ lofty rhetoric and the realpolitik practised by member states.Brussels was quick to stand behind Poland in its confrontation with the Belarusian regime because it is terrified of a return to the east-west divisions that erupted in the 2015 refugee and migrant crisis. However, the EU is far from united. The Polish government has opened a war on two fronts — one battle is to stop migrants on the border, but it is also fighting to demonstrate that Warsaw does not need the EU in order to defend its borders.The crisis has exposed the central irony of Europe’s position in today’s world. Dictators fear that their societies dream of the freedoms and way of life we have in Europe, so they dream of a world without the EU. But European leaders fear their own soft power no less than foreign dictators do. They feel powerless to help those who want democracy in their own countries and they dread the arrival of Europe-dreaming migrants on the EU’s borders. Their deepest trauma is a return of anti-migrant rightwing populism, which could be deadlier for European democracies than any of the pandemic’s successive waves.The upshot is that Europe has become terrified of its own attractiveness. Once we were empowered by the idea that many people in the world want to live like us. Now we are frightened by this idea. The pandemic has taught Europeans to live with projections and to think in terms of worst- case scenarios. So, when watching on their screens a few thousand migrants storming the Polish border, many ordinary Europeans were thinking about the climate reports predicting that by 2070 some 3bn people will be unable to live in the areas where they live today.All the discussions about how the Covid-19 crisis will change Europe in the future have obscured the ways in which change has already happened.The economic upheaval triggered by the pandemic persuaded even most defenders of budget deficit rules that it made more sense for Europe to spend rather than cling to fiscal discipline. So, when it comes to economic policies, Europe has moved to the left — or, if you prefer, to the south, adopting the position advocated by southern European states in the aftermath of the euro crisis.But when it comes to migration, Europe has moved to the right — or, if you prefer, to the east, adopting the position advocated by many central and eastern European states during the crisis of 2015. The Covid-19 emergency has produced a tacit consensus that the EU should try to keep its external borders closed in order to keep its internal borders open.In the Belarusian border crisis, Lukashenko hopes to fight his people’s dream of “becoming Europe” by conjuring up the nightmare of EU leaders that “everyone will be coming to Europe”. In stirring up these fears he is on stronger ground than his critics like to admit.This article has been amended to show that in his book ‘The Age of Unpeace’, Mark Leonard was citing the research of US academic Kelly Greenhill and her book ‘Weapons of Mass Migration’Letter in response to this article:A professor’s outstanding work is acknowledged / From Ivan Krastev, Chair, Centre for Liberal Strategies, Sofia, Bulgaria
140  Norway’s parliament is embroiled in a growing expenses scandal that has cost the jobs of the wealthy Nordic country’s second-most-powerful official and a party leader, sparked a police investigation and threatens to erode the high level of public trust in the political establishment.The affair centres on allegations that some lawmakers have exploited a rule allowing them to have a “commuter flat” paid for by parliament if they live more than 40km from Oslo.It came to a head on Thursday evening as Eva Kristin Hansen, president of Norway’s parliament and the country’s highest official after the monarch, resigned when a local newspaper revealed she had used a commuter flat despite owning a house just 29km from Oslo.A few weeks earlier, Kjell Ingolf Ropstad stepped down as leader of the centre-right Christian Democrats and as a government minister after he claimed a commuter flat for his family while using his parents’ home hundreds of kilometres from Oslo as his registered address, despite owning part of a property close to the Norwegian capital.Public prosecutors ordered police on Thursday to investigate six unnamed lawmakers over whether they had committed fraud or other offences, as experts warned the scandal threatened to erode Norwegians’ high level of trust in politicians.“These allegations can be really serious because it’s about the political institution, not just individuals. It’s about not just trust in the political system but in the heart of democracy. Now it’s important that parliament recognises that they have a problem and finds a solution,” Signe Bock Segaard, senior research fellow at Norway’s Institute for Social Research, said on Friday.Various politicians from almost all Norway’s main parties — including Labour, the Conservatives, the populist Progress and the Socialist Left — have been implicated in the commuter flat scandal.Hansen, a member of the ruling centre-left Labour party, initially resisted pressure from across the political spectrum to resign but did so after the police announced their investigation and parliament’s own administration said she had broken the rules. She blamed a difficult private life and said she was “very sick” at the time she claimed the flat. Ropstad has said he made mistakes that he regretted.Norwegian politics have been hit by an unusually high number of scandals in recent months, including some lawmakers allegedly filing exaggerated or false travel expenses and the former prime minister Erna Solberg breaking Covid-19 regulations. There has also been a high-profile welfare scandal in which people entitled to benefits were wrongly convicted and had money taken away.Norway has one of the world’s highest levels of trust in politicians and the political system. But experts said the scandals could fuel an impression of there being different rules for politicians.“It’s building this story that politicians are granting themselves perks that normal people can’t expect. This is definitely not good for the public’s trust in politicians,” said Hans Fredrik Marthinussen, law professor at the University of Bergen.Segaard said the country’s general trust levels had been fairly stable, although they had fallen slightly since spiking after the 2011 far-right terror attack on the Labour party, but that they had dropped among those with low education levels.“You should never take trust for granted. In a global perspective, the level of trust is very high in the Nordics.But the recent small decreases we have seen may be a sign of a bigger problem,” she added.
141  A total of 170 jobs are to be created in Northern Ireland by one of the world’s biggest packaging companies, the latest business seeking to exploit the region’s “best of both worlds” post-Brexit trading status.Ardagh Metal Packaging on Friday announced plans to build a $200m beverage can plant near Belfast, from which drinks will be exported both to Britain and EU markets.The investment is one of the largest greenfield projects in the region since Brexit took effect and will be seen as a vote of confidence in the controversial Northern Ireland protocol.The 2019 protocol gives Northern Ireland free access to the wider UK market, while leaving it within the EU’s single market for goods. The region is the only place in Europe with free access to both markets.Although the arrangement is widely supported by businesses in the region, the British government is threatening to suspend parts of the protocol as talks with the EU continue.Lord David Frost, UK Brexit minister, has claimed the deal imposes excessive checks on goods moved from Great Britain across the Irish Sea to Northern Ireland and has threatened to activate the Article 16 override mechanism in the treaty. Talks with the EU continued in Brussels on Friday.Luxembourg-based Ardagh, which has origins in glassmaking in Dublin, said its “state of the art” plant would service “the growing needs of AMP’s beverage customers in Ireland, the UK and Europe”.Relatively low labour costs in the region were another factor in the company’s choice of location. People close to the deal said the factory would create 170 high quality jobs, including technicians and engineers.Oliver Graham, chief executive of AMP, said: “We are delighted to be investing in Northern Ireland, supporting our clients’ sustainability needs and further reducing our carbon footprint by locating closer to our end customers.” Its customers include Coca-Cola, which has a plant in Lisburn.Last year Michael Gove, secretary of state for levelling up, said businesses in Northern Ireland would get “the best of both worlds” under the protocol, and many employers want the Brexit arrangement to continue.Ardagh’s investment came days after Northern Irish pharmaceuticals group, Almac, announced it was creating 1,000 jobs in the region over the next three years as part of a global expansion.Almac, which develops and manufactures pharmaceuticals and is based in Craigavon, sang the praises of the protocol, telling its customers the post-Brexit deal offered “unique, unfettered and flexible access to the UK, Europe and beyond”.Not all businesses were as effusive about the protocol being a win-win for Northern Irish companies, with many filled with dread at the prospect of yet more disruption and uncertainty if Article 16 was triggered.“Our exporters are having the time of their lives at the moment,” said Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, a lobby group.That is borne out by booming cross-border trade. Ireland’s imports from Northern Ireland leapt 60 per cent in the first nine months of this year, compared with the same period last year, according to official Irish statistics.“[Businesses are] concerned the uncertainty created around triggering Article 16 would be viewed as real [legal] jeopardy,” Kelly added. “The minute it’s done, Northern Ireland will be viewed as legally challenging and boardrooms and customer orders will begin to be impacted that very same day, that’s just the reality of it.”One business leader, who asked not to be named, said: “Triggering Article 16 would create another uncertainty lasting another 12 months if not longer, just as we’re entering the Christmas period.”He said one manufacturing company, which did not want to be identified, had planned to move some operations from Ireland into Northern Ireland in order to benefit from both jurisdictions, but had put the plans on ice while they “wait and see” how UK-EU talks go.“We’re not happy at all to be back to this Brexit stuff,” said Damian McGenity, a part-time beef farmer and spokesman for the Border Communities Against Brexit group, which is organising protests at five points along the border on November 20.“Order books are full, businesses are recovering well [from Covid-19]. This is the last thing we need,” said McGenity. “Most business people want to get on with business.”
142  The past is a perennial source of inspiration for Montagut, who grew up in a family of antique dealers and artists, and used to assist film-set decorator Christian Sapet in his antiques shop in the Saint-Ouen flea market. It was here he met style doyenne Inès de la Fressange, with whom he co-wrote the coffee-table book Maison: Parisian Chic at Home, a window into the homes of tastemakers including Sézane founder Morgane Sézalory and Isabel Marant CEO Sophie Duruflé. “I have a big passion for flea markets,” says Montagut, who sourced all of the shop’s decor from antique traders. “I go every weekend.”Marin Montagut is divided into three rooms, each lined with antique shelving and apothecary-style cabinets. Paris itself is a recurrent motif: the artist’s illustrations of the Jardin du Luxembourg’s green metal chairs and the shop’s “Rue Madame” street sign feature on everything from recycled, mouth-blown glass vases (€125) and porcelain tableware (cups from €38), to cushions and silk scarves (€95). “Usually, there are a lot of tourists in the shop,” he says. “But I also see locals, because Parisians love their city.” Scented candles (€68) evoke some of Montagut’s favourite aromas: Sicilian orange blossom, the fireplaces of Paris, and tomato leaves (inspired by the vegetable garden in his country house in Normandy). Hollowed-out secret storage books (€115) feature Montagut’s hand-painted, tarot card-inspired covers: “I was inspired by the 18th century, when people cut inside books to make a little box in which to keep their secret things – such as jewellery or private letters,” he says. Clustered on the walls of the shop’s middle room, dubbed the “boudoir”, is a collection of decorative handpainted plates (€95), botanical wall hangings inspired by 18th-century engravings (€188) and porcelain ex-votos (€45) – small tokens hung in holy places as an offering of gratitude to a saint or divinity. These are one of the shop’s bestsellers, says Montagut.Finally, hidden away in the back room is a small wooden desk – a recreation of Montagut’s workspace in his Montmartre studio, which is strewn with paintbrushes and watercolours. It’s a further immersion into his charmingly anachronistic world. “When you enter the store, it’s like you’re travelling to the past of Paris. The smell of the furniture, the creak of the floorboards – it’s a rare, real experience at a time when every shop is the same.”
143  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.The EU is still a long way from a capital markets union, but a fresh set of proposals to be unveiled next week seek to inch the bloc closer to that elusive goal. We’ll bring you up to speed with what to expect.After a few weeks of delay prompted latterly by the Belarus migration crisis, the European Commission later today is likely to send inquiry letters on the rule of law in Hungary and Poland, several officials familiar with the matter told Europe Express. The letters are still a preliminary step as the commission considers whether to trigger a new sanctions mechanism in the coming months.Meanwhile, Belarus seemed to climb down after a flurry of calls from Germany’s outgoing chancellor, as it moved migrants away from the Polish border yesterday. Over in Moscow, however, President Vladimir Putin has vowed to maintain “tension” with the west, despite recent calls from Europe and the US to roll back the Russian troop build-up on the Ukrainian border.We’ll also look at why Portugal had nearly the lowest inflation rate in the euro area last month (1.8 per cent, second only to Malta) — and much lower than neighbouring Spain (5.4 per cent) or Lithuania (8.2 per cent).And in Danish politics, the fortunes of the anti-immigrant Danish People’s party have faded dramatically in recent local elections, but that’s mainly because its anti-immigrant stance was embraced by the ruling Social Democrats.Brussels will next week attempt to re-energise the drive toward one of its most elusive and long-cherished goals, namely the creation of a capital markets union, write Sam Fleming in Brussels and Philip Stafford in London.Politicians have always been conscious that Europe’s financial system has neither the depth nor dynamism of the US, despite the scale of the EU economy. There are few Teslas and Googles and no government debt market to compare with the clout of US Treasuries. Capital raising is usually in the form of bank lending, not financed by markets. The departure of the UK from the single market, with its world-class financial base of the City of London, has only raised the temperature.Next week the commission will table a package of draft legislation attempting to address some of those shortcomings. The proposals, seen by the Financial Times, represent an attempt to bag some low-hanging fruit when it comes to building a true cross-border single market for financial services.They can hardly be described as a quantum leap towards achieving the EU’s unfulfilled capital markets ambitions, which have been around for more than a decade and a half. But the package contains some reforms that will have important consequences for how market actors carry on business in the union.Among them are efforts to bolster flows of financial and markets information around the EU.This will involve the creation of a European Single Access Point, which will serve as a common source of free public information about EU companies. The European Commission also envisages tapes that bundle together trading data, providing greater transparency for investors (More details here).Cross-border barriers will also be addressed via a review of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive. The EU appears to be heading towards a pragmatic resolution to a question over how much of an EU presence overseas (meaning London-based) hedge fund managers should have in the bloc. Brussels now wants at least two senior full-time managers to be based in the EU, so the fund’s operations are more than just a brass nameplate on a door. That appears to be some relief to funds concerned the minimum might be three people.There are some caveats. They will probably have to provide Esma, the markets regulator, with more information about how portfolios are managed. Still, analysts say the proposals would not be too painful to implement, and likely to be something that Dublin and Luxembourg, the two main domiciles for alternative funds within the EU, can live with.Other measures will be unveiled next week, largely revolving around Mifid II rules that need to be rethought after Brexit, either because the UK is now a rival or because the rules had initially been written to account for the City.The EU has long been conscious of the degree to which it suffers from fragmented capital markets and an over-reliance on bank lending. Next week’s commission package will by no means transform Europe into another America, but its backers will argue it represents a step in the right direction.Will the EU ever get to a US-style capital market? Tell us what you think and click here to take the poll.Inflation in Portugal rose to its highest level in four years in October. But, at 1.8 per cent, the increase still placed the country at the second-lowest level in the eurozone, where the monthly inflation rate hit a 13-year high of 4.1 per cent, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon.Portugal’s finance minister João Leão said the measures his government had taken to stabilise electricity prices helped underpin the country’s relatively low level of inflation.Like the rest of the bloc, Portugal has been hit hard by supply-chain bottlenecks and surging energy prices. The minority socialist government, however, introduced measures to ease the pressure on fuel costs last month, shortly before parliament rejected its 2022 budget, triggering a snap election two years ahead of schedule.Portugal’s inflation rate also reflects the depth of the pandemic-induced recession it suffered last year, when average inflation decreased and the economy shrank 8.4 per cent, its biggest contraction since the 1930s.In effect, one of the measures introduced by the Portuguese government is returning to motorists the gains in value added tax the state has benefited from as a result of the global rise in fuel prices. It is doing this by decreasing a special tax on fuel by two euro cents a litre for gasoline and one cent for diesel until the end of January.António Mendonça Mendes, the outgoing fiscal affairs secretary, estimates the tax cut to be worth €90m a year, roughly equivalent to the projected gain in the VAT levied on fuel in 2021 compared with 2019. Portuguese consumers are more used to the government using the mechanism to uphold tax revenues when international fuel prices drop, as it did in 2016.The government also introduced an “auto voucher” scheme this month that enables consumers to save up to €25 over five months when filling their tanks at participating gas stations. Similar discounts are available for taxi and bus owners as well as other tax benefits aimed at reducing transport costs.The whole scheme, which lasts until the end of the year, is forecast to cost the taxpayer about €300m, a cost that some lawmakers have criticised as an incentive to consume fossil fuels.In a separate measure, the government passed legislation last month enabling it to cap the sales margins of fuel retailers. Before the early election was called for January 30, the government also announced that electricity prices for most domestic consumers would be kept flat in 2022.Finance minister Leão said the outgoing government would also go ahead with a planned increase of about 0.9 per cent in public sector wages next year, taking into account average inflation over the previous 12 months.Mário Centeno, a former finance minister and now governor of Portugal’s central bank, told a Lisbon conference this week that inflation remained “a temporary phenomenon”. He said Europe needed to show patience in regard to rising prices, which he described as partly a consequence of the speed of the post-pandemic recovery.California-based LeoLabs, which uses radars to track objects in space to prevent collisions, identified a total of 243 new pieces of debris orbiting the Earth — all from an anti-satellite missile test that Russia had launched recently. The test caused widespread condemnation and forced personnel aboard the International Space Station to take cover in their hatches. (More here)One of the pioneering anti-immigrant populist parties in Europe continued its electoral implosion this week, writes Richard Milne, Nordic and Baltic Correspondent.The Danish People’s party recorded its worst result in at least two decades in local elections this week, gaining just 4.1 per cent of the vote, which led Kristian Thulesen Dahl to offer his resignation as party leader.The DPP has been hit hard by the ruling centre-left Social Democrats adopting much of its rhetoric and policy proposals on immigration and integration as well as the emergence of a new party further to its right that has eaten up votes.Its fall from grace has been spectacular. The DPP made its breakthrough in 2001 and supported the centre-right government in Copenhagen for the next decade, as well as in 2015-19.In 2015, it seemed to surprise even itself by coming second behind only the Social Democrats and was reluctant to enter government. By the time it was ready to do so, in the last parliamentary elections in 2019, its star had fallen significantly and it won just 8.7 per cent.The Social Democrats’ tack to the right on immigration has been hailed by some political scientists as one of the potential recipes for reviving the centre-left, but one that few others in Europe have tried. And the Danish Social Democrats had problems of their own in Wednesday’s local elections as they also lost ground, perhaps because of their botched handling of the cull of all the country’s mink.Still, with 28.5 per cent, they were by some distance the biggest party and their fate is far different from that of the DPP, for whom a long period of soul-searching beckons.
144  Big polluting nations have cast doubt on whether they would upgrade their emissions targets next year, after agreeing at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow to “revisit and strengthen” them in line with the Paris accord.The text agreed after marathon two-week talks committed signatories to new greenhouse gas emissions targets by the end of 2022, three years earlier than originally agreed, to meet the goals of the climate deal signed in the French capital in 2015. Retaining the commitment in the face of opposition from countries such as China was billed as a key success of COP26.But the US and Australia have already called into question whether they needed to upgrade targets known as “nationally determined contributions” or NDCs.“On NDCs, this COP has not seen what it should have,” said Laurence Tubiana, head of the European Climate Foundation, and a key architect of the Paris deal. “That’s why it’s really important that this meeting was finally able to obtain agreement to revisit them next year.”With the world far off track from the Paris goals, the Glasgow pact sealed last weekend aims to encourage countries to improve their targets to limit warming to well below 2C, ideally to 1.5C. Existing 2030 emissions targets put the world on course for between 2.5 and 2.7 degrees of warming by the end of the century.But the ink was hardly dry in Glasgow when US climate envoy John Kerry left significant room for manoeuvre on whether the US would upgrade its NDC next year. Australia, which was criticised at COP26 for lacking a credible plan to reach “net zero” emissions, has said it will not update its target.“Not necessarily,” Kerry said when asked about a new pledge. “You don’t automatically have to come back with a new NDC, you have to review it, and make a judgment,” he said. “We need to see what’s do-able.” Because the COP process has no formal enforcement mechanism — and no punishment for countries that miss their targets — its primary power lies in peer pressure and public scrutiny.The COP26 deal also committed rich countries to double their levels of finance for climate adaptation, such as infrastructure to adapt to a warmer planet. They provided about $19bn in adaptation finance in 2019, which could rise to about $40bn under the agreement.However, for many of the countries that are most vulnerable to climate change, this does not go far enough. As the dust settled on COP26, Bangladesh accused rich countries of “failing” at-risk nations by not providing the necessary funding and technology transfers needed to combat climate change. “What we’re seeing now from different developed countries, they’re failing one after another on their commitments. This is very upsetting,” Zunaid Ahmed Palak, Bangladesh’s information minister, told the Financial Times in an interview. Bangladesh chairs the Climate Vulnerable Forum which represents developing countries most at risk from climate change. The low-lying country is struggling with rising sea levels and a more erratic monsoon rain season, leaving tens of millions of its citizens at risk of displacement. Palak said that COP26 did represent some improvement from previous years, particularly pledges of further negotiations and co-operation from the UK, US and Europe. “We’re not satisfied with the result of COP26 but the good thing is there are some hopes and positive assurances we got from different influential politicians.”Scientists say COP26 did help lower the projected levels of global warming — but still far from what is needed to limit warming to 1.5C.However, Johan Rockstrom, joint director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said he “cannot celebrate despite significant progress, because the room for manoeuvre is so limited”.“If this was a COP meeting 20 years ago I would have declared it a huge success because we’d have had time to get the laggards on board.But now we’ve run out of time. We have only 10 years to cut global emission in half to have a chance to deliver 1.5,” he said.Under the Glasgow deal, the UN will conduct an annual analysis of emissions targets, and report next year about a new work programme to scale up emissions cuts.Negotiators say that the Glasgow pact would lay the groundwork for incremental improvements in the emissions targets, such as for countries to make “add-ons” to their existing emissions targets.The pact is much more pointed, when it comes to countries that have not submitted a new emissions target at all, who are “urged” to do so ahead of COP27 next year.Although India announced on the opening day of COP26 a target for net zero emissions by 2070, it has not yet submitted a new emissions target.Another area of concern at COP26 is that several countries submitted new NDCs that were actually worse — in terms of climate impact — than their previous NDCs. These include Brazil, Australia, Ethiopia and Mexico.
145  Ford and General Motors said on Thursday that they are improving links with semiconductor manufacturers to improve their supply of electronic chips as the car industry confronts a shortage. Some foreign companies are still investing in Turkey despite the country’s ailing economy. Plus, the FT’s markets editor, Katie Martin, explains why the euro is losing value against the US dollar and why it could potentially make inflation worse. Ford and GM pursue ties with semiconductor groups to boost chip supply. 
146  The EU has long looked to take a global lead on climate, and its 2030 goal to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 55 per is a benchmark for decisive global action.But Brussels has not shown the same boldness in its industrial policy for securing the sustainable upstream metals supply needed to deliver that target. Its ever-growing metals dependencies threaten to derail the development of new clean energy value chains.The International Energy Agency this year warned of a “looming mismatch” between climate ambition and minerals availability. Europe has a long list of serious metal supply challenges on its radar over the next decade unless it quickly and radically changes course.First up is magnesium, of which Europe risks completely running out of supply later this month, leading to an imminent stop to aluminium alloy production. This means Europe will not be able to make its lightweight cars, aerospace components and so much more.The back-story is one of avoidable dependency. Despite Europe having a big magnesium industry until the early 2000s, past industrial policy decisions meant production was lost to more polluting Chinese imports.Fast-forward to today: China has a near-monopoly on global magnesium production, providing 95 per cent of Europe’s supply. Its recent production curbs have led to a rapid halving of magnesium output, creating a global supply crunch.Europe today faces a similar dependence on China for other energy transition metals, such as the rare earths used in electric cars and wind turbines, and the germanium, gallium and indium needed for a restart of solar panel production. It is also powerless to address the major environmental and social impacts from their production.The second metals challenge is looming five years from now, after which Europe risks a supply deficit for lithium and other battery materials.According to Wood Mackenzie, the world in 2030 will need eight times more lithium than today to supply electric vehicle batteries. Yet currently announced global extraction projects only cover about a third of this massive demand.There is no quick fix, because it can take up to 10 years to open a new mine. Unsurprisingly, today’s lithium market is already experiencing shortages, and electric vehicle batteries have become more expensive after years of decline.Europe woke up to this danger last year with the launch of its European Raw Materials Alliance to spark domestic investment and global partnerships. China, however, is at least a decade ahead, holding 80 per cent of the world’s refining capacity for battery metals, and investing more than any other country into securing supply from the world’s mines.Europe’s third metals challenge is the risk of new dependencies by the end of this decade. Take aluminium. According to the World Bank, the energy transition will need more tonnes of aluminium than any other strategic metal — for lightweight vehicles, electrifying the grid and solar panels.Yet, alarmingly, over the same period, Europe has lost one-third of its primary aluminium production. Today, European producers are battling Chinese overcapacity, high-carbon dumping, and high power prices while at the same time investing heavily in decarbonisation.This May, Brussels introduced anti-dumping duties for semi-finished aluminium products in a belated attempt to equalise the playing field with Chinese competitors. Then, in September, these very same anti-dumping duties were suspended for nine months despite clear evidence of significant injury.Short-term decisions such as this risk repeating past mistakes that have been made at the expense of the region’s upstream industries. Aluminium cannot become Europe’s next magnesium.Nothing less than a massive shift in industrial policy is needed to solve Europe’s growing metals problems, across three areas of action.First, Europe needs to accept that more mining and refining of strategic metals is urgently needed under the right environmental and social conditions. This must be backed up with a clear strategy for sourcing and financing sustainable minerals both at home and abroad.Second, the continent needs to confront its dependence on Chinese monopolies and evaluate alternative paths forward — from supply diversification to reshoring of production — while keeping strong, consistent trade defence instruments to prevent further production leakage.Third, Brussels needs to recognise that the energy transition will massively challenge power-intensive metals producers as they themselves decarbonise. The EU must safeguard its industries from debilitating energy price rises, while delivering affordable carbon-free electricity in the massive volumes required for producing the sustainable metals of Europe’s future.The metals industry is a willing, enabling partner in Europe’s ambitious plans to decarbonise its economy. We now need Brussels to deliver an effective industrial policy that will help us realise that ambition.Guy Thiran is director-general of Europe’s metals association, EurometauxThe Commodities Note is an online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times
147  Belarus on Thursday moved migrants away from a camp on its border with Poland in a move that could help ease a crisis which has sent relations between the EU and Minsk to historic lows.Thousands of migrants, mainly from the Middle East, have attempted to reach the EU via Belarus since the summer, in a surge that EU officials say has been orchestrated by Minsk in retaliation for the bloc’s support for Belarus’s persecuted opposition.Belarus’s state-run news agency, Belta, said on Thursday that migrants had left the camp near the Bruzgi-Kuznica border-crossing, where many have gathered in recent days. The area was the scene of clashes between migrants and Polish border forces on Tuesday.Poland’s border guard confirmed the camp had emptied and said the migrants had been taken to a logistics centre a few hundred meters away.The move follows a burst of diplomatic activity in recent days with German chancellor Angela Merkel twice speaking to Belarus’s authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko. It was the first time a western leader has spoken to him directly since he launched a savage crackdown on his opponents last year.French president Emmanuel Macron has spoken to Lukashenko’s main international ally, Russian president Vladimir Putin, over the crisis.Lukashenko has also moderated his rhetoric, saying on Tuesday that an escalation of the crisis was in no one’s interest. On Thursday, the first flight repatriating migrants left Belarus, with Iraq sending a plane to take around 400 of its citizens back to the country.Resolving the crisis has taken on an added urgency as eastern Europe’s harsh winter approaches, with refugees camped on the border enduring increasingly low temperatures. At least eight migrants have died in Poland since the crisis began.Earlier on Thursday, Natalia Eismont, Lukashenko’s spokeswoman, claimed that during his first call with Merkel the Belarusian leader had proposed a solution to the crisis, under which Belarus would return 5,000 migrants to their country of origin, and the EU would accept 2,000.However, this was rejected by Berlin. “Germany did not agree to that,” said a senior German official. “It’s a European problem and Germany will not act alone in this matter.”During a press conference in Warsaw, German interior minister Horst Seehofer reiterated the denial, warned against disinformation and said Germany would not take any action without consulting Poland.“Everything we do, we co-ordinate with each other, we discuss with each other, and we don’t do politics behind our partner’s back,” he said.
148  Angela Merkel said anyone in Germany who has yet to be vaccinated against Covid-19 will have to show a negative test result to be allowed to go to work, as authorities scrambled to deal with a huge surge in new coronavirus infections.“We are in the middle of the fourth wave, trying to deal with a dramatic level of infection in Germany,” the chancellor said, adding that it was essential to “put a brake on the exponential increase” in new infections.Merkel and the leaders of Germany’s 16 federal states met on Thursday as the number of new infections in the country reached record highs. According to figures from the Robert Koch Institute, the country’s main public health agency, the number of new cases in the past 24 hours stood at 65,371.“The situation is highly dramatic and it’s now a question of acting fast, or acting consistently and monitoring better,” she said.The leaders agreed to introduce a new system of incremental restrictions tied to the level of hospital admissions.Germany is one of several European countries that are introducing new restrictions to battle a fourth wave of infections. In Austria, pressure is mounting on the federal government to impose a nationwide lockdown after the states of Upper Austria and Salzburg ordered all residents to stay at home regardless of their vaccination status.Slovakia and the Czech Republic, which both recorded their worst daily infection figures since the start of the pandemic on Wednesday, set out new measures on Thursday. Belgium has imposed a four-day homeworking rule to come into force next week.Thomas Stelzer, governor of Upper Austria, urged the federal government to implement the measures, which include shutting non-essential shops and hospitality venues, nationwide.“We have very, very little room for manoeuvre,” he said on Thursday. “If there isn’t a full federal lockdown by Monday, then we will go ahead with a lockdown lasting for several weeks in Upper Austria and the neighbouring state of Salzburg.”State governors will meet the federal government on Friday to discuss the proposals for a nationwide lockdown. The leader of the opposition Social Democrats, Pamela Rendi-Wagner, said she supported the plan.Many believe a short lockdown is the best option in order to allow the winter sports season to go ahead with relative normality from December. Skiing and snowboarding attract an estimated 600,000 tourists to Austria annually. According to Dutch bank ING, in the winter the sports account for up to 4 per cent of gross domestic product.Austria registered a seven-day average of 136 new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 residents on Wednesday, one of the highest rates in Europe, according to Johns Hopkins University. A day earlier it recorded a new high of 15,609 new daily cases. The country has operated a controversial lockdown against the unvaccinated, with severe financial penalties enforced against rule-breakers.Despite widespread availability, about a quarter of Austrians over the age of 12 have yet to receive any dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. Scepticism about the vaccine’s efficacy and opposition to its enforced administration are widespread in Austria and other European countries.Slovakia’s Prime Minister Eduard Heger said he would introduce a three-week “lockdown of the unvaccinated” from Monday. Only people who have been vaccinated or recovered from coronavirus in the past six months will be allowed to enter non-essential shops, restaurants, sports facilities and public gatherings.The Czech Republic announced similar measures, banning unvaccinated people who have not had Covid-19 in the past six months from restaurants and public gatherings.Slovakia and the Czech Republic have a seven-day average of new cases per 100,000 people of 116 and 115 respectively, according to Johns Hopkins. Both countries have lower vaccination rates than the EU average, with just 58 per cent of Czechs and 43 per cent of Slovaks fully inoculated.In Belgium, employees will be obliged to work from home for four days a week until December 12, when the requirement will be relaxed to three days.“We are taking measures everyone can follow, so we can avoid another lockdown,” Belgium’s Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said late on Wednesday when announcing the measures, which also include mask mandates indoors and in crowded outdoor spaces.Belgium has experienced a steady rise in infections and hospital admissions, despite having 75 per cent of its population fully vaccinated. The country aims to finalise its booster campaign by March or April next year.
149  Vladimir Putin has vowed to maintain “tension” with the west over Ukraine and complained that Moscow’s red lines on regional security were being dismissed, days after the US warned over a Russian troop surge at the border.Speaking to an audience of foreign policy officials on Thursday, Russia’s president also said Moscow would react “appropriately” to what he described as “provocative” activity by the west in Ukraine. This included supplies of weaponry to Kyiv’s army and recent snap drills in the Black Sea he claimed involved strategic bomber flights carrying nuclear weapons 20km from the Russian border.“Our recent warnings have been noticed and are having an effect. There’s a certain tension there,” Putin said. “We need that condition to remain for as long as possible, so they don’t get it in their heads to start some conflict we don’t need on our western borders.”He added: “Of course, we understand that our partners are quite peculiar and, to put it mildly, have a superficial attitude to all our warnings and red lines.”Washington warned Ukraine and European allies last week that US-gathered intelligence raised the possibility of a deeper Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula in 2014 and fuelled a separatist war in the far eastern Donbass region, which has — according to Kyiv — claimed more than 14,000 lives.Lloyd Austin, US defence secretary, said on Wednesday he was in regular contact with the commander of US and Nato forces in Europe, over the Russian troop build-up. “We’re not sure exactly what Mr Putin is up to,” he said. “But these movements certainly have our attention and I would urge Russia to be more transparent about what they’re up to.Our support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity remains unwavering.”Meanwhile, Kyiv accused Moscow on Thursday of seeking to derail long-stalled peace talks on the Donbass.Putin insisted, however, that Russia was ready to talk. “Indeed, our interests, judgments, and positions do differ on numerous bilateral and international issues. Everyone is well aware of this. Sometimes they differ radically. However, I’d like to say this once again, we are open to contacts, an exchange of opinions and a constructive dialogue,” he said.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that Russia expected contact “at the highest level” following Putin and US President Joe Biden’s first meeting in Geneva in June.The Kommersant newspaper reported last week that Putin and Biden were expected to speak via video link by the end of the year and meet in person some time in 2022.The White House has sought to put relations with Moscow on a more stable footing this year by opening channels to discuss issues where it thinks the US and Russia can find common ground.In a phone call with Nikolai Patrushev, Russian security council secretary, on Wednesday, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan discussed nuclear disarmament and cyber security — where the countries are negotiating an understanding — as well as Ukraine and the migrant crisis on the Poland-Belarus border.The call was the latest high-level contact between the White House and the Kremlin after recent visits to Moscow from CIA director William Burns, under-secretary of state Victoria Nuland and Eric Green, senior director for Russia on the US National Security Council.
150  Turkey slashed interest rates on Thursday, sending the lira tumbling as much as 6 per cent to a new record low, heightening concerns President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s fixation on low borrowing costs will worsen already acute inflation.The central bank cut its one-week repo rate 1 percentage point to 15 per cent, marking the third straight reduction in interest rates under governor Sahap Kavcioglu from 19 per cent at the start of September. The bank said many factors behind surging consumer prices were “beyond monetary policy’s control” and that it would “consider” ending its cycle of rate cuts this December.The lira’s decline had eased to 3 per cent by the end of the London trading day. However, the currency has fallen more than 30 per cent this year — on a par with Turkey’s currency crisis in 2018 — as economists fret that low interest rates will worsen an inflation spiral, with consumer price growth having reached an annual pace of almost 20 per cent in October.“It’s mystifying why they would do this,” said Paul McNamara, an emerging market investor at GAM in London. He said some aspects of Turkey’s economy looked encouraging as the country recovered from the pandemic. “The only driver for a weak lira is the policy outlook,” he said.Turkey’s central bank has been under intense pressure from Erdogan to loosen monetary policy despite blistering inflation. Lower rates — and a weaker currency — tend to worsen inflation because it increases the price of imported goods, creating a vicious cycle.Erdogan, who holds the unorthodox view that high interest rates cause, rather than tame, inflation, on Wednesday renewed his pledge to free Turkey from the “scourge” of high interest rates.“I’m sorry to our friends [from the ruling party] who defend [high] interest but I cannot and will not walk the same path as them,” he said.The central bank on Thursday laid blame for the elevated inflation on “transitory effects of supply-side factors” including high global food and energy prices, which it expected to last into the first half of next year.It said many advanced economies were continuing to pursue monetary policy stimulus, partially on expectations that the surge in global inflation would prove to be fleeting in the medium to long term.But Turkey’s loosening of monetary policy leaves the country as an outlier at a time when many other emerging markets are raising rates. Both South Africa and Hungary announced rate rises on Thursday. The US Federal Reserve, the world’s most influential central bank, is also reducing its stimulus measures, something that has placed emerging markets under more pressure to increase interest rates to attract investment.Analysts at Barclays said Turkey had entered “uncharted waters”, calling the recent rate reductions “counter-productive”.Erdogan has faced mounting calls from the opposition and the Turkish business community to set aside his obsession with rate cuts in order to tame inflation and stabilise the currency, whose slide has been eroding standards of living.“Now STOP, Erdogan!” Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the country’s largest opposition party, said in a tweet in response to Thursday’s decision and repeated his demand for Turkey to go to elections.The rightwing IYI party, which has been enjoying growing support in the polls, accused Erdogan of “bankrupting” the country.“The reasons that are causing a currency crisis right now are not macroeconomic per se. It’s the decision-making system that gives Erdogan endless authority,” said Umit Ozlale, one of the party’s vice-presidents. “Whatever he wants is done. That’s why we’re in this crisis. This is a decision-making crisis.”Jittery markets had been further unnerved by an item published overnight in the country’s official gazette relating to foreign currency transactions at Turkish bureaux de change.Turkish officials dismissed frenzied speculation on social media that the move was a sign of impending capital controls. They said the directive was a small technical change to a previous requirement for citizens to show identification at foreign exchange offices, arguing that it was actually a liberalising measure that lifted the minimum transaction amount for such a requirement to $100.
151  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
152  Brussels is planning to create US-style central databases that hold information on publicly listed companies and trading activity as part of a push to boost integration of its capital markets.According to draft documents seen by the Financial Times, the measures will include changes to make it easier for investors to access information on companies operating in the EU and for EU banks and fund managers to find prices of stocks and bonds throughout the single market.The proposals, set to be formally announced next week, are intended to make the EU more attractive to international investors following the UK’s departure from the single market.“The EU’s global competitiveness is weakened by the fragmentation of its capital markets,” the draft documents say. Reforms to build a capital markets union “will in turn help companies tap into larger pools of capital held by institutional and retail investors across the EU”, they add.The EU corporate reporting system, known as the European single access point, would consist of common, free public information about companies and products. At present, most information is scattered across multiple jurisdictions.The project, aiming to go live in 2024, is likely to be paid for from the EU budget and overseen by Esma, the securities regulator, the documents say.Authorities want to reproduce some of the benefits of services widely used in the US, the world’s biggest capital market, in many of its reforms. They include the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Edgar system for reporting corporate information and marketwide tapes that record trading information on stock and bond markets.The European Commission envisages tapes that bundle together information collected from Europe’s patchwork of more than 470 exchanges and trading venues. Europe has long sought a “consolidated tape” but private efforts to build one have failed due to competing commercial interests, as well as slow and patchy data feeds.“The total cost [to investors] of not having an accurate view of the equities markets can be as high as €10.6bn annually,” the document says.Regulators have acknowledged that the last attempt to create a consolidated tape, in the 2018 Mifid legislation, failed. Brussels is planning to mandate that data providers supply standardised information to the tapes. Contributors would get “fair remuneration” and a minimum revenue in return, it said.“Policymaking has typically focused on the needs of the intermediaries and we welcome the increased focus that policymakers now also have on end investors,” said Stephen Fisher, managing director of the global public policy group at BlackRock, at a conference in London on Thursday.The proposed changes to market infrastructure addressed what he saw as Europe’s main weakness — trading that was fragmented along national lines and that “has held back capital raising and investor participation in capital markets”.The proposals also include a formal ban on payment for order flow, a controversial practice in which retail brokers hand their orders to market makers in return for a fee. This is widely used in the US and Germany, but effectively banned in most EU countries.Markus Ferber, a German MEP, welcomed the commission’s decision to address the issue but questioned whether an “outright ban” was the right approach.The commission also wants to change the caps on the amount of business that can be executed in dark pools — off-exchange venues that fund managers to buy and sell large blocks of shares without disturbing the price on the market.In addition, there are plans to tighten the rules on “systematic internalisers” — more lightly regulated invitation-only markets run largely by banks and high-frequency traders.Other proposals include scrapping rules that require clearing houses to clear derivatives on rival exchanges, to build clearing capacity in the bloc after Brexit. Most of the euro clearing business is based in London.Next year the commission will propose changes to the corporate insolvency framework and make it easier for companies to raise funds on exchanges, according to the draft documents.
153  It’s not quite yet possible to declare a Christmas Day truce in the Brexit trenches, but after several weeks of tension ratcheting ever upwards, there has now been a clear decision to push the rhetorical “pause” button in the row over Northern Ireland’s trade arrangements.The question now is whether a deal can be forged from this lull in hostilities which actually heralds (finally) the start of serious negotiations after several weeks of stand-off in which — to quote EU negotiator Maros Sefcovic — the UK side did not “sincerely engage” with the EU.This was deeply frustrating to the EU side because — as even officials from Lord David Frost’s team acknowledged when the European Commission published its proposals to reduce Irish Sea border frictions in October — the EU had gone further than expected.It is true that the four technical papers published by the Commission fell short of the headline claims that the EU’s proposals could reduce customs checks by half, and agrifood regulatory checks by up to 80 per cent.But as one EU diplomat put it, the Commission was never going to put all its cards on the table and let the UK pocket the concession and then demand more. No, the EU kept some negotiating space and expected the UK to come and plumb their true bottom line.After last week’s meeting in London between Sefcovic and his UK counterpart Frost, at which the EU negotiator welcomed the UK’s “change of tone”, the two sides agreed to engage properly on medicines and customs checks, with a view to injecting some momentum into the talks.Medicines is the first file to be tackled, since it is the one where the two sides are closest. Because medicines are controlled substances their supply chains are tightly audited, opening the door to greater flexibility from the EU.The key end result is that Northern Ireland gets equal access to medicines as Great Britain, including those on the EU’s “centralised procedure” which covers modern drugs that treat Aids, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders or diabetes — and which the UK says are at risk of getting to NI slower than the rest of GB if UK regulators issue faster approvals for drugs than the EU.Get this fixed — and it should be possible, say EU officials, if the UK is interested in pragmatic compromise — and you can then start to negotiate on the customs and regulatory processes that are currently too onerous according to UK representatives from industry and retailers.In essence, that second negotiation will be about narrowing the gap between the Commission’s claims to reduce customs and agrifood checks by 50 and 80 per cent respectively and the reality on the ground.A proposal to enshrine that “50 per cent” commitment in law via a decision of the Joint Committee governing the Withdrawal Agreement is intriguing. That might be too cute a move for the UK to accept, given the equally legally binding conditions that might accompany such an offer, but it does perhaps speak to pressure towards a deal.Whitehall insiders say that when senior Cabinet members discussed this at last week’s Global Britain — Strategy meeting, it was clearly decided that Frost should go and make a proper effort to reach a compromise.This will not be easy, and we shouldn’t get ahead of ourselves, but there seems now to be at least a serious attempt to engage. The word from Brussels this week is that the talks have been “very active” compared to previous ones. Frost and Sefcovic are due to meet again in Brussels tomorrow.The UK will want the EU to go further than its initial headline proposals, particularly on issues like the requirement to supply underlying attestations and so-called ‘rules of origin’ data for goods clearly moving only into Northern Ireland in auditable supply chains.That leaves the difficult area of wholesale goods and manufacturing inputs that are going to be processed and redistributed, but that will be the point of the negotiation — to really discover how pared back the Irish Sea border can be, always bearing in mind that NI is part of the EU single market for goods.Unless the process breaks down very quickly — and that seems unlikely given the clear signals from the cabinet to Frost to make sincere efforts to find a deal and a generalised fear of Brexit ruining Christmas (again) — there must be a growing chance that this discussion will roll into January, if a deal cannot be reached before.At which point, as the Christmas hangovers clear to be replaced with rising inflation (see below), higher energy prices, persistent supply chain problems and labour shortages, the case for a destructive triggering of Article 16 will get harder for Frost to make.There may be an internal argument to trigger Article 16 as a means of deepening the deal, but given the scale of the EU’s threatened retaliation (which already forced the UK to take a step back) that would, as last week’s briefing explained, be a huge gamble.The final step in a durable deal would, however, still need to address the question of how the protocol was governed, and the role of the European Court of Justice in the deal which the UK wants to see withdrawn or at the very least diluted.For now the European Commission has not broached this subject, sticking to the line that demands by Frost in the July Command Paper to completely remove the ECJ and replace it with an international arbitration mechanism of the kind that governs the Trade and Cooperation Agreement is impossible.But there are other ways to potentially thread the needle — removing the ECJ from the direct role in ruling on disputes in the protocol and confining it to interpreting points of EU law.This, to be clear, is far short of Frost’s demands but if Boris Johnson was in the mood for a “compromise, claim victory and move on” type manoeuvre, it might yet prove a serviceable solution.Such a deal would essentially mirror the governance of the rest of the Withdrawal Agreement, extending it across to the protocol. And crucially, from an EU perspective, those ECJ interpretations would need to be binding.There are, of course, plenty of politics on the European side. Brussels is adamant it will not reopen the protocol. And given current tussles with Poland at the moment over EU law there is no appetite to do something that risks undermining the role of the ECJ.But there already are ideas kicking around, in Whitehall at least, on how such a ‘fix’ might be applied to the protocol without formally reopening it, by using the mechanism in the Withdrawal Agreement that allows the parties to address “deficiencies”. Lawyers will tell you that it would be a stretch to use this mechanism in the Withdrawal Agreement — Article 164(5)(d) — in order to do this. It may also be open to legal challenge. But the reality is that the alternative — no deal — is infinitely worse for both sides.It would also detoxify a governance mechanism that, given the British government’s positioning, is now almost too toxic for the EU side to use without instantly being accused of destabilising the region’s delicate political balance.The legal view on the UK side is summed up as “if both sides wanted to make it happen, they could”. On the EU side, this discussion still feels a long way off. But if a satisfactory deal could be reached on the border modalities, then as one EU diplomat put it “never say never”.Ultimately, if such a fix was the price of a durable solution on Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit trading arrangements, it would surely make sense to do it.The “will-he-won’t-he” Whitehall parlour game of guessing whether Boris Johnson will trigger the Article 16 safeguards clause has moved on this week, after it became clear that Frost has been told to go and seriously see if he could get a deal.As my colleague George Parker and I report, there is a strong sense in Westminster that Brexit mustn’t be allowed to ruin another Christmas, which begs the question of whether the decision to trigger Article 16 has merely been deferred to the New Year.On that, one question worth pondering is whether, if a desire not to ruin Christmas prevented the trigger in November or December, the cabinet top table won’t be faced with equally difficult concerns come January.The challenges of supply chain shortages (which half the senior members of cabinet are actively working at addressing), labour market tightness, inflation, cost of living squeeze, and rising energy prices and taxes will not simply have gone away.The members of the Global Britain Strategy cabinet committee — Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Priti Patel, Michael Gove, Stephen Barclay and David Frost — will still have a difficult choice to make, Christmas or not.After all, Boris Johnson’s face is on the front cover of the 2019 Tory election manifesto, giving the thumbs up, promising to “Get Brexit Done” and “unleash Britain’s potential”. A trade spat with Europe that risks turning Kent into a car park overnight might seem an odd approach to achieving both those goals.The other concern is inflation, which according to figures this week hit the highest level for a decade in October, adding to pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates. The Bank currently expects inflation to peak at 5 per cent in April.That would make January an interesting moment to trigger a trade confrontation with Europe that risks a fall in the value of the pound, higher import costs and, as a result, higher inflation.How much higher? Well, we know from work done by Thomas Sampson, associate professor of economics at the London School of Economics, that in 2016 a 10 per cent fall in the value of sterling fed through to a 2.9 per cent rise in inflation over two years.That was off a very low base, and the Bank of England was prepared to live with that temporary increase. The Bank may again, but this time we are starting (see chart above) from a much higher base.There are clearly many variables here. How harshly the EU reacts to an Article 16 trigger and how quickly the risk of a return to WTO trading terms would determine how quickly markets reacted — sterling might only fall by 2 or 3 per cent, it might be more.If the EU rammed home that the UK, post Brexit and now with a trade spat to boot, was in a much worse position to address inflation — and the Bank of England was prevented from putting up rates by political considerations — there is a risk sterling could conceivably fall further and faster than predicted.The point is, the decision to trigger Article 16, if it comes, will not be made in a vacuum. For a prime minister to deliberately make a move that risks boosting inflation just at the moment the Bank is trying to tamp it down would pose a risk to the government’s credibility.And, finally, three more unmissable Brexit storiesThe arguments for triggering Article 16 rely on measuring the economic impact of the current trade arrangements on Northern Ireland. So it is worrying, as Ireland correspondent Jude Webber found, that official data is totally unreliable.There may be differences of opinion in the EU but if push comes to shove — and the UK triggers Article 16 — the divisions are not as stark as London imagines. Read why.Post-Brexit changes to immigration rules mean EU schoolchildren can no longer travel to the UK on group passports and non-EU students require expensive individual visas. This is having a big impact on school exchanges as I reported this week.
154  Trade links between Great Britain and Northern Ireland are being “worn away” by post-Brexit rules with the EU, says Lord David Frost, Britain’s Brexit minister. But try finding the data to prove that. Official Northern Irish statistics for trade stop at 2019.At a conference I attended shortly after moving to Ireland this summer, the audience of academics, diplomats and officials issued a collective groan when the topic of Northern Ireland’s patchy economic data came up. Businesspeople describe being sent between departments on a quest for seemingly impossible-to-extract information about an economy once famous for the Titanic and linen and now focused on agriculture, construction and manufacturing. But the lack of timely data on exports and imports seems particularly odd, not least because of the prospect of a trade war with Brussels over UK demands to rewrite the rules for Northern Ireland.Frost has rowed back, for now, on firing the first salvo — triggering Article 16 of the post-Brexit Northern Ireland protocol, a clause allowing either side to suspend key parts of the deal if it were deemed to be causing severe economic harm or diverting trade. But he has made it clear that option is still on the table if Brussels refuses to budge on his demands for greater concessions.“Wouldn’t it be terrible to trigger Article 16 and find when the figures come out that there had been no difference, when the whole justification for doing so was that it was affecting trade,” said one business leader who asked not to be named. “They’d have egg on their face — but the damage would be done.”Northern Ireland’s unique post-Brexit access to both the UK internal market and the EU single market is billed by Brussels as a significant advantage for the tiny region of 1.9m people, which in 2019 exported £11.3bn in goods to Britain and just £4.5bn to Ireland and £2.4bn to the rest of the EU.According to official data published in Ireland this week, the republic’s imports from Northern Ireland rose 60 per cent between January and September, compared with the same period last year. But real-time data on trade between Northern Ireland and the British mainland is harder to come by; economists are left piecing together information from ports and other sources.The lack of official figures is frustrating, but not the fault of Belfast’s small statistics agency, Nisra, argues Neil Gibson, chief economist for Ireland at EY. After all, Northern Ireland is far smaller, in both population and economic terms, than big UK urban centres such as Greater Manchester and “we don’t know how much Manchester trades with London, or what County Donegal trades with Dublin”, he said.An initiative by Irish think-tank the Economic and Social Research Institute and the UK’s National Institute of Economic and Social Research, launched this week, will model economic statistics across the island of Ireland to inform policy decisions. But it needs numbers.“In Northern Ireland, it does seem that the data are either lagging or absent in too many areas,” said Paul Mortimer-Lee, deputy director of NIESR. “I don’t fully understand the reason for that.but it’s difficult to make data-based decisions without any good data. What you can’t measure, you can’t manage.”ESRI director Alan Barrett found that “very, very often [the data] does exist somewhere”. But, he added, statistical agencies may not publish the more obscure data on a regular basis. Indeed, ESRI’s models had “generated a market” for some numbers from Ireland’s statistics office, he said, predicting the same could happen in Northern Ireland.“My view is that lots of data is gathered, but Nisra and the [UK’s] Office for National Statistics lack a kind of joined-up approach in presentation,” said Graham Brownlow, a senior lecturer at Queen’s University in Belfast. The region’s statisticians defend their output, saying their trade data depends on an annual survey. Fresher numbers — for 2020 — are out on December 15.When it comes to data collection and analysis, Brexit uncertainty is exhausting enough. As one Northern Irish business figure put it: “You don’t want to wait 18 months to find there’s a problem.”
155  The euro struck its lowest level in 16 months this week as traders bet that the European Central Bank would stick to its accommodative policies even though widespread inflation is prompting US and UK policymakers to raise interest rates.Traders are dialling up their wagers that the Federal Reserve and Bank of England will lift rates from historic lows over the next year at a time when the ECB is pushing back against market expectations that it too will lift borrowing costs in 2022.The result has been a sharp decline in the euro against the dollar — the most heavily traded exchange rate — ending a period in which currencies had largely shrugged off the turmoil raging in bond markets.“The market is positioning for a divergence between the Fed and the ECB,” said Athanasios Vamvakidis, head of G10 forex strategy at Bank of America.The euro sank below $1.13 on Wednesday, its weakest level since July last year and a swift decline from almost $1.16 in the middle of last week.Although part of the euro’s recent weakness is the flipside of a broad rally for the dollar, the single currency has also lost ground against peers benefiting from the prospect of higher interest rates.Against the pound, it has reversed a rally in early November and continued falling to its weakest level since the early stages of the pandemic in February 2020.The latest losses against sterling were triggered by data on Wednesday showing that UK inflation hit 4.2 per cent in October.Investors, who were blindsided by the BoE’s surprise decision to keep interest rates on hold this month, are betting that UK rates will rise to 0.25 per cent in December, from 0.1 per cent currently, in a bid to tame the faster-than-expected price increases.Eurozone consumer prices have also accelerated, with annual gains reaching a 13-year high of 4.1 per cent in October, according to Wednesday’s figures. But investors have more subdued expectations for longer-term inflation — in part a legacy of the ECB’s years of undershooting its 2 per cent inflation target.As a result, ECB president Christine Lagarde’s repeated insistence that wagers on 2022 eurozone rate rises are not in line with the central bank’s guidance is beginning to get through to investors, according to analysts.Markets are now pricing in just a single tenth of a point rate rise in early 2023 after Lagarde told the European parliament on Monday that tightening monetary policy now would do “more harm than good” and conditions for a rate rise were “very unlikely to be satisfied next year”.“Finally markets have cottoned on to the fact that central banks won’t all move together at the same pace,” said Jane Foley, Rabobank’s head of FX strategy.ECB staff are due on December 16 to publish their inflation forecast for 2024. While the weaker euro will boost the competitiveness of exporters in the euro area, it will push up the price of imports that have already been rising rapidly. Isabel Schnabel, an ECB executive board member, told a Goldman Sachs event on Wednesday that the weaker euro would add about 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points to inflation in the bloc.Meanwhile, the ECB is also expected to announce in December that its flagship €1.85tn bond-buying programme, which it launched last year in response to the pandemic, will come to an end in March 2022. However, investors expect the central bank to step up its longer standing asset purchase programme at the same time to support the economic recovery and limit any sell-off in bond markets. The central bank has committed not to raise rates before it stops primary bond purchases. Currency traders will be watching December’s announcements closely for any signs that the ECB could end asset purchases earlier than markets anticipate, which could indicate a rate rise is nearer than expected and trigger an appreciation of the euro.Schnabel told the event on Wednesday that the ECB needed to keep “a watchful eye on the upside risks to inflation”, and said it should “retain optionality to be able to act if needed”, so as to “maintain trust in our determination to defend price stability in a symmetric way and prevent a de-anchoring of inflation expectations in both directions”.In recent weeks, expectations of interest rate rises from the BoE, along with the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of Canada, have sparked bouts of selling pressures in global bond markets as investors bet that other central banks would respond similarly to inflation pressures.“Perhaps the surprise is that these moves didn’t happen sooner,” Rabobank’s Foley said. “Up until a week ago investors seemed to be assuming that all these economies were similar. You had global markets getting dragged around by the UK, or Canada, or Australia. It all seemed a little bit backward.”The ECB is also likely to tread carefully in tightening policy so as not to trigger any rise in borrowing costs for more indebted eurozone members such as Italy, according to Leandro Galli, a senior portfolio manager at Amundi.“The Fed always tries not to sound too hawkish, but it’s moving in that direction,” said Galli, who is betting on further gains for the dollar against the euro. “But it’s more difficult for the ECB to walk away from its stimulus, and they have more time.”
156  Albania on Thursday poured scorn on reports the country could be preparing to host an offshore centre to hold people seeking asylum protection in the UK, in the latest blow to London’s efforts to find a solution to a surge in clandestine immigration in small boats.Olta Xhaçka, Albania’s foreign minister, criticised a story on the issue in The Times — which mistakenly referred to her as a man — as “fake news”. Edi Rama, prime minister, said Albania would “never” be a country where rich countries could set up camps for their refugees.Priti Patel, UK home secretary, is under significant pressure from prime minister Boris Johnson and some Conservative MPs to halt the influx of people on small boats, which they insist is a bigger political issue than the “sleaze” scandal over MPs’ second jobs.Johnson’s advisers have warned him that the migrant issue will hit the Conservatives at the polls unless it is addressed.Groups representing refugees point out that, while the number of people arriving in the UK by boat has increased significantly, a decline in the numbers arriving by other routes means overall arrivals have fallen. The UK received asylum applications from 37,235 people in the year to June, a 4 per cent drop on the same period a year earlier.The Times reported that “discreet talks” were under way between London and Tirana over the possible establishment of a hub there for migrants to be held while their claims were considered.Media reports earlier this year suggested offshore centres could be established in Morocco, Turkey, Rwanda, Gibraltar or the Isle of Man. The authorities in all of those territories denied being open to hosting such a centre. Home Office officials last year considered setting up a processing centre on Ascension Island or St Helena, British territories in the south Atlantic, although the plans were abandoned.Albania in July became the first European country to sign an agreement with the UK to take back its own citizens who had made unsuccessful asylum claims in the UK, as well as its nationals who faced deportation as foreign national offenders and Albanians who had overstayed their UK visas.The nationality and borders bill, currently going through parliament, would for the first time curb the rights of people who made successful asylum claims in the UK after breaking immigration rules to enter the country. UK courts have generally interpreted the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention as barring the country from discriminating against people who broke immigration law to claim asylum in the UK.Rama said: “Albania will never be a country where very rich countries set up camps for their refugees — never!”Xhaçka wrote on Twitter: “Same old fake news this time in the front page of a respected paper as The Times! And btw I am not a ‘he’ but a ‘she’ who has always admired the quality of British media. Sad.”Some 23,500 people have reached the UK in small boats so far this year, more than twice the number for the whole of 2020. On some days in excess of 1,000 people have arrived as part of an apparent tactic by smugglers to overwhelm France’s efforts to stop sailings.The Home Office said migrants making the crossings were putting their lives at risk and that it was “vital” to do everything possible to “break the business model” of smuggling gangs. It reiterated its view that migrants should seek asylum in the first safe country they reached.“As part of our response, it is important we have a maritime deterrent in the Channel and work with international partners to put an end to these dangerous journeys,” it said.
157  Even as a new Covid-19 wave is washing over the European continent, the EU economy has been delivering a stream of uplifting data. When the September figures recently came out, they showed that eurozone unemployment had fallen back to pre-pandemic levels. Employment numbers for the third quarter, out this week, prove that this is not because many Europeans have given up looking for work altogether: total EU employment returned to its end-2019 level, and the eurozone was only just below the pre-pandemic record.On top of this good news, the EU and the eurozone recorded a second quarter of above-2 per cent quarterly growth in economic output, or more than 8 per cent on an annualised basis.This experience on both growth and jobs is better than anyone could have hoped for. It could not be further from Europe’s lamentable record after the global financial crisis. Back then, growth fizzled and went into reverse for a second recession. The eurozone debt crisis left much of the bloc with a lost decade of low growth and high unemployment.This month’s benign figures, then, prove that the EU can learn. The policy responses were everything the previous round was not: decisive, swift, and of sufficient scale. Monetary policymakers left little doubt they would stabilise markets and loosen financial conditions. Fiscal policy broke new ground with a pan-EU recovery fund, in addition to suspending the fiscal straitjacket of the bloc’s normal rules for national budgets.In addition, the EU can with some confidence say its social model has stood it in good stead. Its labour market systems were well set up for furlough schemes to support workers and businesses through enforced lockdowns. Where the UK and the US had to scramble to get assistance to those needing it, many European countries could rely more on scaling up existing schemes.While the UK has managed its quickly-patched-together furlough scheme well, its third-quarter employment rate was still 1.1 percentage points lower than before the pandemic. The US, which chose to let unemployment soar and pay enhanced benefits to jobless workers rather than subsidise furloughed employment, still has more than 4m fewer people employed today than in February 2020 (almost 3 per cent of pre-pandemic employment).The danger for the EU is that success could breed complacency. The contrast with the US may look flattering today. But both economies face significant restructuring. Europe’s success in protecting employment relationships could yet turn out to be a hindrance in shifting workers to the jobs needed once the pandemic is truly in the past.For now, the pandemic is still very much with us. The past 18 months have shown that jobs and growth in Europe ebb and flow with the pandemic waves. All the positive indicators could soon be pointing down again.What is more, aggregate pan-European data obscure sometimes surprising differences between national economies. Some still lag their pre-pandemic employment. While many expected this from countries such as Spain and Italy, with their large tourism sectors and already challenged public finances, fewer may realise that German employment has been lagging too. Portugal, in contrast, exceeded its pre-pandemic employment already in the second quarter.All this means EU policymakers cannot take their eyes off the ball. Their deserved satisfaction with what has been achieved should motivate them to keep successful policies active wherever and for as long as necessary.
158  Speaking in 1952, Charles de Gaulle observed: “Every French person was, is and will be a Gaullist.” As a description of French society from the military defeat of 1940 to the political convulsions of the Fourth Republic, the general’s statement was a considerable exaggeration. But as a prophecy of how French politicians would honour him 69 years later, in the build-up to next April’s presidential election, it was uncannily accurate.From the far right to the left, most candidates for the presidency are paying homage to de Gaulle. The reasons are to be found in a yearning for reassuring historical myths. On one hand, de Gaulle stands for a national unity all too elusive amid today’s rancorous disputes over France’s future and declining respect for political parties and professional politicians.On the other hand, de Gaulle symbolises a happier age when France under his leadership regained self-respect and pursued a distinctive path in the world that enabled the country to be true to its higher self. Few if any French politicians are unaware of the famous words on the first page of his war memoirs: “France cannot be France without grandeur.”For much of the French public, de Gaulle is the greatest person in the nation’s history, and the further his era recedes into the past the taller he stands in comparison with his successors. Or as the leftist intellectual Régis Debray wrote in 1994: “For a long time to come, his name alone will serve as a giant India rubber to erase mediocrity.”So it was that tributes poured out earlier this month from across the political spectrum on the 51st anniversary of de Gaulle’s death. He was a wartime hero and in 1958 almost single-handedly founded the Fifth Republic, which has a good claim to being France’s most stable political system since the absolute monarchy of the 18th century. Yet the reverence for de Gaulle is full of contradictions and selective uses of history.In her quest for the presidency, Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right Rassemblement National, has long tried to detoxify her party’s image. Showing respect for de Gaulle is part of that effort. Under its original name of the Front National, however, the party was ferociously anti-Gaullist, not least because de Gaulle, as the Fifth Republic’s first president, oversaw independence for the French colony of Algeria.For several decades, French leftwingers were no less scathing about de Gaulle. François Mitterrand, elected in 1981 as the Fifth Republic’s first Socialist president, wrote a pamphlet in 1964 that condemned de Gaulle’s system of government as a “permanent coup d’état”. Twenty years later, Mitterrand conspicuously avoided mentioning de Gaulle by name when he marked the 40th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy that led to France’s liberation. The pleasures of controlling the presidency created by de Gaulle served in the end to change the Socialists’ tune.President Emmanuel Macron, who is seeking re-election next year, makes more unashamed use of Gaullist imagery than any of his predecessors. In his official photo De Gaulle’s memoirs lie open on his desk at the Elysée Palace. Macron has also added a Cross of Lorraine, a symbol of Gaullist patriotism, to the presidency’s logo.Not content with that, it emerged this month that Macron has altered the French flag that hangs at the Elysée, darkening the tricolour’s blue so that it recalls the flag used in France’s direst moments of wartime peril in the 1790s, 1914 and the 1940s. In 1976 President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing switched to a lighter blue that matched the official European flag. Is this a sign that Macron is losing his faith in the EU? Hardly.For no one will know better than Macron that de Gaulle once mused: “It is while being fully French that one is the most European. France, when she succeeds in developing her interests, does it in the interest of all.”
159  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.After lengthy squabbles over the scope of a new piece of legislation spelling out the dos and don’ts for online platforms, the European parliament last night finally agreed on its position for the last leg of negotiations before the Digital Markets Act is finally approved. We’ll look at what the deal entails and how Google is already amping up its outreach to EU regulators.In keeping with our Thursday’s profile tradition, today we look at a figure well-known in Brussels and London alike — Michel Barnier — and how realistic his presidential ambitions in France are.And with another round of Brexit talks tomorrow, we explore what the business community in Northern Ireland has to say after their recent meetings with UK Brexit minister Lord David Frost.Just a week after Google lost its appeal against a €2.42bn antitrust fine, the tech giant is stepping up its outreach to EU regulators, amid progress on a controversial piece of tech regulation, writes Javier Espinoza in Brussels.Yesterday, Google’s chief executive Sundar Pichai held a virtual meeting with EU competition and digital policy chief Margrethe Vestager. By the end of this year, the company’s chief legal officer, Kent Walker, is expected to come to Brussels to speak to regulators and lawmakers.The most pressing issue for Google doesn’t seem to revolve as much around past competition cases Vestager launched — though the company is still fighting those in EU courts — as it is about fresh legislation, particularly the Digital Markets Act, which is inching towards the final stages of negotiations after a deal in the European parliament last night.The DMA is aimed at forcing tech giants to change their business models and allow smaller rivals a more prominent role on their platforms instead of pushing the company’s own services and products.Vestager has stated publicly the legislation was inspired by the cases she brought against Google. And, as part of the parliament’s position agreed last night, the law will apply to any company with a market capitalisation of at least €80bn and offering at least one internet service — meaning that Google will definitely be among them.Google’s lobbying efforts (which already rather clumsily sought to target EU internal markets commissioner Thierry Breton, for which Pichai apologised publicly) are likely to continue throughout the final stage of DMA negotiations between parliament, European Commission and EU governments in the coming months. The French EU presidency has stated its ambition to wrap up the negotiations in the first half of 2022.On the opposition side, Google’s plaintiffs who are arguing against the search engine’s dominance, have also stepped up their lobbying with the commission.FairSearch, a group representing smaller search engines that were behind the initial case leading to the €2.4bn fine, sent a letter to Vestager, arguing that “decisive enforcement of the decision is overdue”.The letter, seen by Europe Express, argues that the remedies in place in shopping search have been ineffective and called on Brussels to force the US tech group to stop favouring its own products and start following the EU decision, confirmed by the Luxembourg-based court.“Google continues to harm consumers and continues to favour results that economically benefit it, which is akin to favouring its own results, and starves providers of traffic and hence revenue that would allow them to compete on the merits,” the letter warned.Separately, a new study by Thomas Höppner at law firm Hausfeld, which represents complainants against the company, showed that the search giant was not complying with what it needed to do to fix its anti-competitive behaviour. “Google will have to change the design of general search pages fundamentally — immediately,” Hoppner wrote.But Vestager is sticking to the line that Google is complying with the decision and allowing for more competitors to be shown prominently in search results.A Google spokesperson said: “The changes we made are working successfully, generating billions of clicks for more than 700 comparison shopping services and are subject to intensive monitoring.”A rise in infections across Europe is prompting several governments to reintroduce Covid-19 restrictions. Ireland will put up a midnight curfew for pubs and clubs and return to working from home wherever possible, while Belgium is making teleworking mandatory four days a week. Slovakia and the Czech Republic are also set to introduce new restrictions after both countries yesterday recorded their highest daily infection figures since the start of the pandemic. (More here)Michel Barnier is a household name to longstanding Brexit observers in Brussels and London. As the EU’s former Brexit negotiator, he became famous for sayings such as “no cherry picking” and “no single market à la carte”, whenever his British counterparts were seeking one or the other exemption from EU rules. The four freedoms of the EU — of people, of capital, of services and of goods — were “indivisible”, in Barnier’s own words.Now that dogma is out the window, with Barnier running his French presidential bid on a topic familiar to Brexit ears: a moratorium of up to five years on immigration to France and the suspension of the supremacy of EU over French law in this area.Judging by his popularity in the party, he seems to have a shot at winning the Les Républicains nomination on December 4, writes Victor Mallet in Paris. (Full story here).Here are a few of the reasons why French voters may find him compelling:Emmanuel Macron, who was a surprise winner in 2017 with the promise to be “neither right nor left”, remains a strong incumbent to beat in April. But if Barnier secures the nomination of his party, he may emerge as Macron’s more plausible challenger, compared to the far-right’s Marine Le Pen or Éric Zemmour.Barnier’s discussions with former colleagues in Brussels, however, were he to become president, would be awkward if he followed through on his campaign promises.A week ago, optimism was in the air as the UK’s Brexit negotiator, Lord David Frost, pulled back from the brink of triggering a trade war with the EU. When he and his opposite number in Brussels, Maros Sefcovic, meet again tomorrow, will the mood still be upbeat? Judging from Frost’s trip this week to Northern Ireland, that looks like a safe bet, writes Jude Webber in Dublin.One business leader, who attended a dinner with Frost in Belfast on Tuesday night, said it had been “definitely the best engagement we’ve had”.Up until last week, it had appeared that London was on the brink of triggering Article 16 of the withdrawal agreement governing post-Brexit trade — and provoking a trade war with the EU in the process. (Here is a detailed explainer of what that move would entail).In Belfast, Frost made clear Article 16 was still on the table. He called its use “legitimate” unless Brussels makes more concessions that go beyond those that Sefcovic already proposed last month to facilitate trade between Britain and Northern Ireland.But Frost at least said reaching a deal with the bloc by Christmas “can be done” — even if he swiftly added the caveat “whether it will be done is a different question”.Triggering Article 16 is a risky gambit: the EU’s response would probably be fast and furious and could lead to the suspension of the bloc’s trade deal with the UK (as we wrote here). London may attempt to trigger it as a lever, but to backtrack quickly — is an equally high-stakes move, said one veteran of Brexit negotiations in Dublin.No one would lay bets on Article 16 not being used now, but businesses told Frost loud and clear in Belfast that they were fed up.As Glyn Roberts, chief executive of Retail NI, which groups 1,800 independent retailers and wholesalers in the region, put it: “What business wants is stability, certainty and an end to this endless process of negotiations.”
160  First came the unexplained space objects over New Zealand. Then came the debris over Costa Rica and Texas. By Wednesday, California-based LeoLabs, which uses radars to track objects in space to prevent collisions, had identified a total of 243 new pieces of debris orbiting the Earth — all from an anti-satellite missile test that Russia had launched two days earlier, to widespread condemnation. “They basically set off a bomb in the middle of the new space race,” said Daniel Ceperley, LeoLabs chief executive and co-founder, of the Russian test’s impact on the burgeoning commercial space sector, which is situated in the same low-earth orbit as the new debris.“The primary altitudes that most of these satellites are using are right where this new debris has been created,” he added.Over the coming weeks, scientists, investors and policymakers will monitor the spread of the debris cloud, which forced Russian and American personnel aboard the International Space Station 400km above the Earth to take cover in their hatches on Monday.It now threatens to affect hundreds of commercial satellites including from SpaceX and the US imaging company Planet, and refocus rising tensions between Russia and the US on the escalating weaponisation of space.“Bottom line is that the Kremlin could likely have postponed this and chose not to do so,” said Samuel Charap, Russia expert at Rand Corporation, noting that Russia launched the probably long-scheduled test amid a building geopolitical crisis over Ukraine.Russia is not the first state to conduct such a test. China, the US and India have previously conducted similar launches, also creating debris.The Biden administration, which heavily censured the test, is predicting that the number of “trackable” pieces of debris caused by it will surpass 1,500, alongside hundreds of thousands of smaller pieces that could still shatter a satellite.If that number is accurate, that would increase the existing total of tracked space debris caused by weapons tests by close to half, said Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics at Harvard and Smithsonian who tracks the materials. Before this week, he added, there were already 3,158 pieces of tracked debris in orbit as a result of past weapons tests — out of a total 18,646 tracked objects in space.While most debris from this test would probably decay within five years, McDowell said, perhaps a fifth would endure for a decade, and some debris from the 1,750kg satellite exploded by Russia might venture as high as 2,000km and take closer to 15 years to decay. US Space Command told the Financial Times its initial count of 1,500 large debris objects relied on Department of Defense sensors and was “expected to grow”, adding that “it will take weeks, if not months, to fully analyse all the data provided by multiple sensors and confidently catalogue each object”.Ceperley said small commercial satellites would now have to track the debris continuously and be prepared to change course to avoid collisions for years to come, adding that the additional risk and cost was a setback for the new commercial space economy.“Some of this debris was kicked pretty far away from the satellite [that the Russian missile exploded] so it’s probably even in other parts of space that we have to go check,” he said.Russian officials have shrugged off the new debris, arguing that it was harmless and blaming the US for instigating a space race amid reports the Pentagon is preparing to unveil new space programmes.Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research, said Russia’s military felt it needed the capability to counteract what it believed were US plans to develop weapons that could attack it from space.“If you are in the business of building anti-satellite systems, you would probably make an argument that, look, what if the US starts deploying missile defence components in space? So Russia will need this kind of anti-satellite capability to target those,” Podvig said.The US has itself already conducted two anti-satellite tests, in 1985 and 2008, and is planning new missile-defence sensors in space that Russia and China would probably perceive as a direct threat.Most significantly, Moscow also sees the US Air Force’s X-37B, a secretive “space plane” that orbits the Earth, as a major threat, said Ruslan Pukhov, director of the Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, a Moscow think-tank.He added Russia’s weapons test this week was designed to target the X-37B, and so carrying out the test at that altitude had been essential.A US defence official described the X-37B as an “experimental” programme designed to demonstrate technologies for a reliable, reusable, unmanned space test platform for the US Space Force, adding it was “proving next-generation technologies for use in space”.Russia’s 2014 military doctrine sees outer space as a domain for possible conflict. Some in the US military establishment have also argued for the development of weapons in space. “The US’s large number of classified ‘dark’ space projects suggests that the US is actively developing space weaponry, and that the Americans already have more than one anti-satellite system,” Pukhov said. Jeffrey Lewis, arms control expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, said US actions had stoked Russia. “The Russians are practising shooting down satellites precisely because the US is deploying satellites for missile-defence missions,” he said.A US defence official said: “The United States prefers that space remain free of conflict, but we will be prepared to protect US interests in space just as we do in other domains.”Planet, a LeoLabs customer that operates a constellation of 200 satellites for earth observation about 500km above Earth, said it was working to understand potential risks from the increased debris and called for a ban on such tests, adding that the Russian launch added to “a worrying and irresponsible trend”, citing past tests by China in 2007, the US in 2008 and India in 2019. McDowell said only one piece remains in orbit from India’s 2019 anti-satellite test, which produced 131 tracked objects at the time but was conducted at a fairly low altitude and so decayed quickly, and none from the two US tests.However, it took more than a decade for all the debris from the 1985 US test to decay, and more than a year for debris from the second US test in 2008. Meanwhile, 2,735 pieces still remain from China’s controversial 2007 high-altitude test. Yet according to Ankit Panda, arms control expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, despite its criticism of the Russian missile, Washington had consistently rebuffed efforts to ban such tests. “It can’t only be not OK when Russia and China do it; it needs to be not OK when our friends do it too,” he said.
161  Even Michel Barnier’s friends and political allies did not give him much chance of winning the presidential nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains party when he declared himself a candidate in the summer — let alone think him capable of beating Emmanuel Macron next April.In recent weeks, however, the prospects for the EU’s former Brexit negotiator, who for the past five years was better known in Brussels and across the Channel than he was in his native France, have started to improve.Barnier’s popularity within the party, and the perception among some voters that he seems more “presidential” than his rivals, has given him a fighting chance of victory when LR members choose their candidate on December 4.For months the leading LR candidates have been Xavier Bertrand, who heads the Hauts-de-France region in the north, and Valérie Pécresse from the Ile-de-France region around Paris.But Barnier — who describes himself as “passionately reasonable” — “could emerge as the conciliator [in the LR]”, said Virginie Martin, a politics professor at Kedge Business School in Paris.Whoever wins the party vote has been promised the support of the losers, putting him or her on track to challenge Macron and far-right politicians Marine Le Pen and Éric Zemmour for the Elysée Palace.Ideologically, little separates Barnier from the other four LR hopefuls, with a rightwing manifesto of deficit reduction and immigration controls. But party activists contrast his loyalty to the LR with the opportunism of Bertrand and Pécresse, who both abandoned the party temporarily in pursuit of their wider political ambitions.“People regard with some scepticism the return of those who slammed the door,” said François-Xavier Bellamy, a member of the European Parliament for the party.One poll showed Barnier’s loyalty gave him the edge among the 80,000 LR supporters who were members before the vote was announced.But since then a further 60,000 have paid €30 each to join so they can vote for their favourite next month. No one is quite sure who has the most support among these newcomers.Barnier’s other advantage is that he is increasingly recognised as the most classically “presidential” of the LR candidates. He has long experience in France and abroad as a government minister (environment, Europe, foreign affairs, agriculture) and European commissioner.“If you talk about seriousness, then he’s ahead,” said Patrick Hetzel, a member of the National Assembly, who supports the 70-year-old.“[With Macron elected at 39] everyone said we have a young president of the republic, and now everyone sees the limits of having someone so young and perhaps lacking experience.The successful candidate must create a real contrast with Mr Macron and he’s best placed to do that. We need a different kind of governing.”Vincent Martigny, politics professor at Nice University, agreed that Barnier — tall and imposing, albeit not reaching the lofty heights of the republican movement’s hero Charles de Gaulle — is seen as having the qualities of a president.“People think he’s got the shoulders for it, he’s got the right stuff,” Martigny said. “Barnier has something of the nature of a statesman. He’s been a high-flying negotiator.”But the recent sharp rightward shift of the LR and all its candidates as they seek to stanch the haemorrhaging of voter support to the populist, anti-Muslim Zemmour could pose problems for the party in the broader national campaign that will begin in earnest in January, said Martigny.That is because a traditional moderate such as Barnier would either have to stick to unfamiliar hardline policies on issues such as immigration and Europe, and so alienate French voters from the left and centre, or disappoint his own party’s militants by watering down his earlier rhetoric.“If you listen to what they [the LR candidates] say now in the campaign, most of them qualify as compatible with the extreme rightwing,” Martigny said.Barnier began his campaign by calling for a three- to five-year moratorium on immigration to France, then stunned his former EU colleagues by questioning the primacy of European law and calling for French “juridical sovereignty” on matters of migration. That prompted one member of Macron’s government to remark acidly that “Barnier will never convince LR Eurosceptics that he’s anti-European”.LR voters, however, seem to like Barnier’s plans and reject the idea that they put him in the same camp as Eurosceptic Polish nationalists or Brexit Britain, arguing instead that his dealings with the UK have made him aware of the EU’s failings.The LR’s Bellamy said: “For him, Brexit was a warning that the Europeans have not sufficiently heeded — especially on migration.”“Barnier is playing the radical because he needs to be elected,” countered Martigny, adding that the danger for the LR was that its militants had become so radicalised on the right “that they leave an amazing corridor to power for any candidate from the centre”.Macron, who shook up French politics and won in 2017 with the promise to be “neither right nor left”, therefore remains the candidate to beat in April — but Barnier will have a strong chance of becoming his most plausible challenger if he can win the support of his party next month.
162  The writer is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow CenterThe simultaneous energy crunch in Europe and China — the two biggest markets for Russian hydrocarbons — has provided Moscow with an opportunity to lock in a lucrative new gas deal with Beijing. The arrangement will enable Russia to sell gas to China from the same fields that supply its European customers. This poses a challenge for EU energy security. Yet over time, a growing reliance on the Chinese market will create challenges for the Kremlin, too, if it wants to avoid a one-sided dependence on Beijing.With gas prices going through the roof in Europe, the Kremlin has once again demonstrated how much leverage it has on the European energy market. This remains true despite temporary setbacks for Moscow such as this week’s decision by the German energy regulator to suspend certification of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Berlin’s move immediately drove up gas prices in Europe by 15 per cent.True, the disruption might be shortlived as Nord Stream 2 is already busy meeting the regulator’s requirements. But Moscow also knows that, in the long run, concerted efforts will be made in EU capitals to curb the influence of Gazprom, the state-run Russian energy group, in Europe. In order to keep Russia’s gas leverage in Europe, therefore, and to capitalise on the country’s enormous gas reserves for as long as they can be monetised, President Vladimir Putin is looking in the direction of Beijing.Gazprom has announced that it is finalising an agreement on a gas pipeline from Siberia to China. Power of Siberia 2, as the project is known, is likely to be signed off early next year.The Kremlin knows it needs to seize the opportunity presented by the current energy crisis in China. Beijing sees natural gas as part of the answer in transforming its coal-dependent economy into a decarbonised future.In the next decade, China intends to double its gas-generating capacity to about 200 gigawatts, so Gazprom has a time window for getting into the market. The energy crunch is creating a sense of urgency in Beijing. Moscow is eager to capitalise on China’s growing obsession with energy security and its preference for a pipeline from a friendly state over vulnerable maritime routes patrolled by US warships.Unlike the existing Power of Siberia gas pipeline, which was agreed by Putin and President Xi Jinping in 2014 and launched in 2019, the new Sino-Russian project could pose a real threat to the EU.The original Power of Siberia pumps gas from two fields in eastern Siberia — Kovykta and Chayanda — for which China is the only market. The construction of a 3,000km pipeline through the taiga with annual capacity of 38bn cubic metres has not provided Gazprom with real leverage over Europe.Nevertheless, it has given the Kremlin an additional source of revenue. It has also served to vastly enrich two Gazprom contractors owned by Gennady Timchenko and Arkady Rotenberg. This pair are longtime friends of Putin and they have both been under US sanctions since 2014.Power of Siberia 2, however, will use the same gasfields in the Yamal Peninsula that are Gazprom’s resource base for its European contracts. With a maximum annual volume of 50 bcm — comparable with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that runs under the Baltic Sea — a new pipeline to China will provide Russia with an option for really diversifying its gas flows, giving Gazprom an even stronger hand when bargaining with Europe.Yet this approach will, in the longer run, inevitably have unintended downsides for Russia itself. If Moscow doubles down on building more pipelines to China as a counterweight to its reliance on energy exports to Europe, it might find within a decade that it is highly dependent on a sole consumer at the other end of the pipeline.China has diversified its sources of hydrocarbon imports, and it will be able to leverage market access in order to extract commercial and political concessions, just as it does already with Australia and other countries.If one day, for example, Beijing wants Russia to stop arming India and Vietnam, how will Moscow refuse if the Chinese market is the major source of revenues filling the Kremlin’s coffers?Arguably, the Russian leadership might be aware of this risk. All the same, long-term thinking appears to be in short supply in Moscow — rather like gas in Europe right now.Those Russian policymakers who voice caution are likely to lose the internal battles in the Kremlin’s corridors of power. The winners will be the people whose overriding goal is to build a pipeline through half of Eurasia at an inflated price.
163  Boris Johnson wants a quiet Christmas. Allies say he is “psychologically scarred” by what happened last year, when Covid forced him to cancel the nation’s festivities at the last minute. And what Johnson does not want for Christmas this year is a trade war with Europe.When Johnson convened senior cabinet ministers for a Global Britain (Strategy) committee meeting last week to discuss the country’s continuing Brexit drama, they surveyed a fractured political relationship between Britain and the EU, defined by broken trust, threats and a toxic dispute over trade in Northern Ireland.The mood was sombre. Johnson, weakened by a row over his handling of a parliamentary “sleaze” scandal, his poll ratings falling, has fretted in recent weeks over how to stop the global supply chain crisis disrupting Christmas.Rishi Sunak, chancellor of the exchequer, warned that provoking the EU into a trade dispute in the row over the so-called Northern Ireland protocol would hardly help. “Empty shelves this Christmas would be a disaster,” says one senior British official. “Nobody wants to be the person who screws up Christmas.”Rather than force a confrontation with Brussels, Johnson ordered his chief negotiator, Lord David Frost, to return to the table with renewed vigour to try to resolve the post-Brexit dispute over Northern Ireland. UK government insiders said the meeting marked a significant shift in approach.“There’s enough going on,” sighs one adviser to Johnson. The combination of a cost of living squeeze, a warning of persistent inflation from the Bank of England, increased energy prices and public services still facing Covid-19 pressures all presented an unappetising backdrop for a new confrontation with Europe.In a sign of the new tone, Ireland’s foreign minister Simon Coveney insisted that — with goodwill — a deal on Northern Ireland could be reached by Christmas. Frost sounded sceptical but said on Wednesday: “I think it can be done — whether it will be done is a different question.”The issue now is whether this Christmas Brexit truce will provide negotiators with the space to resolve the Northern Ireland dispute and to start normalising UK-EU relations. Many Tory MPs hope so. “If Brexit is the issue at the next election, we will be seen as being incompetent for not having dealt with it,” says one.The past few months have seen escalating tensions between London and the EU over Northern Ireland, a region of the UK granted special status in the 2019 Brexit withdrawal deal. The region’s bloody history and volatile politics have preoccupied politicians in London and Brussels as they attempt to create a stable deal which underpins the progress made since the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement.The unresolved issue of the functioning of the Northern Ireland protocol, which left it uniquely part of the UK market but also inside the EU single market for goods, is a running sore for Johnson, who won the 2019 UK election promising to “get Brexit done”.Johnson and Frost signed the protocol in 2019 but have been trying to disown parts of it ever since. Frost last month said in a speech in Lisbon that the original deal was “a moment of EU over-reach when the UK’s negotiating hand was tied”, arguing that an enfeebled UK was forced to accept a lopsided agreement on Northern Ireland as a price for negotiating an overall Brexit deal.The deal leaves Northern Ireland inside the EU’s customs area and single market for goods — thus ensuring no border checks on the island of Ireland. But the price for that is that Johnson accepted the need for some checks on goods travelling to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.Johnson argues that the EU has been overzealous in its inspection regime on the Irish Sea, inflaming tensions in the pro-UK unionist community, which hates the idea of an internal UK trade border. In July, Frost added to the list of grievances in London about the protocol by insisting that the European Court of Justice — which oversees EU single market disputes — should be taken out of the dispute mechanism, ending jurisdiction of a “foreign” court over a corner of the UK.Whitehall insiders say Frost has since the beginning of the year been itching to activate Article 16, the part of the protocol that allows either side to temporarily suspend parts of the deal, on the grounds that it is causing economic and social disruption or diversion of trade. His threat still hangs over negotiations over how to reform the deal.Frost is viewed in the UK’s traditionally Europhile Foreign Office as “a renegade”, a former diplomat in Brussels who came to dislike the EU project. However, Johnson reveres “Frosty” and his bruising negotiating style. Even Frost’s critics inside the UK government admit that his threat to invoke Article 16 and his demands for a fundamental rewrite of the protocol have already helped to secure concessions from Brussels over the operation of the Irish Sea border.But in Brussels and in European capitals, the former head of the Scotch Whisky Association is widely blamed for a breakdown in trust between the two sides. “This negotiator always chooses confrontation over co-operation,” says one EU diplomat. Frost’s references to Britain’s near 50-year EU membership as a “long bad dream” were particularly poorly received.“People say they don’t understand London any more,” says one diplomat, speaking of an “air of exhaustion” when it comes to dealing with the UK. However, Frost and Maros Sefcovic, European Commission vice-president, have now committed to make renewed efforts to break the deadlock on Northern Ireland.The question in Brussels is how durable will this change in tone prove to be. Few are optimistic. “We do not see signs of a general detente by the UK or that they want to move towards a better relationship with the EU. That could still be quite some time away, maybe even years,” says one senior EU diplomat. Any prospect of a more profound shift in attitudes towards Johnson and his government remains remote. “Trust is so low,” says an EU official. “The whole positive agenda is basically in the freezer.”That means, for instance, that a memorandum of understanding on financial regulatory co-operation has remained unsigned all year, despite being one of the easiest “wins” flowing from the EU-UK Brexit trade deal — the Trade and Cooperation Agreement.The UK has failed to gain entrance to the new Horizon Europe research and innovation programme, something officials say might otherwise have been in place by now. The UK would also benefit from a deeper and more stable arrangement with the EU on data transfers, but this remains a distant prospect.“We clearly have an interest in having a close relationship with the UK, but given that the UK government’s priority is still Brexit, the time doesn’t seem ripe just yet,” says the senior EU diplomat. “Their approach is very ideological. They even accept that their actions make Britain poorer and see this as a necessary price to be paid for a purist Brexit. They are pursuing the illusion of being completely independent. They live in their own Brexit world.”The answer on the EU’s side, the diplomat says, was “strategic patience”. They add: “Outlooks in the UK may change, more pragmatic leaders may emerge.”Some EU officials see the UK’s decision to intensify discussions over how to improve the protocol primarily as a sign of London’s desire to avoid a breakdown in relations in the lead-up to Christmas. Many fear the improved dialogue will prove only temporary and that the UK may return to its practice of brandishing Article 16 late this year or early next.That may turn out to be the case. One British official says that “Article 16 has not gone away” and that Johnson may still trigger the override mechanism if the new round of Frost/Sefcovic talks fails to engineer a breakthrough. Contingency planning for A16 activation is continuing.But the widespread belief in European capitals that Johnson is itching for another confrontation with Brussels for domestic political reasons is discounted by some of the prime minister’s allies.For a start, Johnson is acutely aware he would have some explaining to do to Joe Biden, the US president, whose Irish roots were on display this month when he phoned the Ireland rugby team after its victory over the New Zealand All Blacks.Johnson’s advisers concede there is some political mileage in limited “skirmishes” with Europe — for example, the recent spat with French president Emmanuel Macron over fishing permits — but that the public would not be so forgiving if a dispute over Northern Ireland escalated into trade disruption and shortages.“Most people think Brexit is done,” says one ally of the prime minister. “The danger is if there’s a big blow up and there’s a perception it isn’t done. It goes to questions of grip and competence.”Brexit is already taking an economic toll on Britain. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the official forecasting body, said last month the long-term hit to the British economy of Brexit would be twice that of the Covid pandemic, causing a “4 per cent reduction in long-run potential productivity”. The OBR assumes that total UK imports and exports would “eventually be 15 per cent lower than had we stayed in the EU”.And while Johnson is being urged by Brexit hardliners in his party to rewrite the protocol, their influence in the Conservative party has been damaged this month by the row over sleaze, which saw Johnson attempt to protect a Brexiter former cabinet minister, Owen Paterson, who broke House of Commons lobbying rules. Johnson was later forced to retreat — Paterson quit as an MP — and many of the new generation of Tory MPs want a break with the party’s Brexit past.One forty-something minister says: “The idea that anyone in my constituency is talking about Northern Ireland and Article 16 is laughable. We’ve got to stop talking about Brexit and move on.”Simon Hoare, Conservative chair of the Commons Northern Ireland committee, says Tory MPs would be “far more questioning” now of decisions taken by Johnson on the advice of Brexiters.He adds: “No business in Northern Ireland has ever raised the European Court of Justice issue with me or with my committee. There is an idea that triggering Article 16 would free you from everything, that the whole border issue will disappear. It doesn’t. It’s not a panacea.” Hoare says most businesses just want stability and a chance to make a profit, not more uncertainty.If there is to be a deal on Northern Ireland, it will come in two stages. The first would see Britain trying to nail down the details of Sefcovic’s “far reaching” offer in October to cut up to 80 per cent of checks on animal and plant-based products and halve the customs paperwork on the Irish Sea border. “It’s not quite what it seems,” said one British official.Raoul Ruparel, a former Europe adviser to ex-prime minister Theresa May, says: “The difference between the EU’s headline offer of reducing agrifood regulatory checks by 80 per cent, and the reality of what is in the commission technical papers is quite large.”To reduce the Irish Sea border checks to an acceptable level to the UK, the EU would need to maximise those headline flexibilities to a point that would stretch the legal orthodoxies in EU directorates governing health rules and tax, Ruparel added.Then, if the friction at the border could be sharply scaled back, there is a question of whether Johnson and the EU can settle their differences on the “governance” of the deal and — in particular — whether judges in Luxembourg should continue to have a role in settling disputes on UK territory in Northern Ireland.Frost has demanded the ECJ should be removed from having oversight of the Northern Ireland protocol and be replaced with a “treaty-based” international arbitration mechanism of the kind used in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement.Sefcovic has already ruled out any such move, arguing that since the protocol leaves Northern Ireland following EU laws and regulations as part of the EU single market for goods, it must be subject to oversight by the EU’s top court — just like the rest of the EU.However, there is a possible compromise mechanism, according to Catherine Barnard, a professor of EU law at Cambridge university. This would be to extend the application of the dispute resolution mechanism used in the EU-UK withdrawal agreement to the Northern Ireland protocol.“It would be a compromise because it would take direct enforcement proceedings out of the hands of the ECJ and create a consultation and arbitration stage in any dispute mechanism. The ECJ would then only rule on points of EU law,” she says.In practice — since most of the disputes would be over the application of EU law as regards to the implementation of the Irish Sea border — this would leave the ECJ at the apex of the protocol dispute system, falling far short of Frost’s demands. “If that was the price of a deal, and the EU was clear it would bring a durable settlement to the Northern Ireland issue, then it should be possible,” says a senior UK official. An EU diplomat with knowledge of the talks also did not rule the idea out.Both sides, therefore, can see a possible route out of the Brexit morass, but the question is whether they will take it — either before or after Christmas. Will Johnson, politically weakened and facing a daunting array of political and economic challenges, decide it is worth the risk of triggering Article 16 with all the unpredictable consequences that it could unleash?One unlikely person urging him to pull back from the brink is Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s former chief adviser and architect of the Vote Leave victory in 2016, who wrote this month: “I do not want this government to trigger Article 16. The PM is incapable of handling it. If he does, it’s bound to be a debacle that damages the economy and relations with allies.”Cummings, who refers to his former boss as a broken supermarket trolley veering wildly, added pointedly: “If you are a Tory MP looking at the chaos around you created by the trolley, you have got to ask yourself a key question. Do you feel lucky?”
164  Aachen is close to the town of Heinsberg, which became one of the country’s early infection hotspots as coronavirus swept across Europe. “It was the first pandemic experience for all of us,” Marx says. “The concern was also very high that you could become infected and get sick yourself.we had big problems at first.”There were shortages of personal protective equipment, as in many other developed countries. But the main problem was that Germany’s decentralised healthcare system was not well connected or co-ordinated.Early on, no one could put a precise figure on the number of intensive care beds in the country, let alone on how many were occupied. A reporting system was soon established “so that patients could be transferred to areas with excess capacity,” says Marx, who is also president of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine (DIVI). “You could say this should have been in place in the first place.”Nonetheless, the benefits of Germany’s diversified system — built on a form of “solidarity” insurance introduced by chancellor Otto von Bismarck in 1883 — became apparent in the second and third waves of the pandemic, during which doctors in hotspots were able to send patients to less busy hospitals, and take advantage of the country’s comparatively large network of public and private treatment centres.Germany has about 1,900 public and private hospitals for its 83m inhabitants, compared with the UK’s 1,200 for a population of 67m. It also spends more than €1bn a day on its healthcare system, according to the health ministry — the highest in any large European country. Consequently, it had far more acute care beds available than neighbouring states as the virus ran rampant.Economists and rightwing politicians who had been calling for the number of hospitals to be cut largely fell silent once the pandemic hit, although private operator Helios maintained its stance that fewer, better equipped institutions would benefit patients.While Armin Laschet, the centre-right Christian Democratic Union’s candidate for chancellor in September’s general election, defended the German system as better than Britain’s and Denmark’s, the leaders of the Social Democrats and the Greens called for a fundamental change to healthcare funding.Their manifestos called for a “citizen’s insurance”, which would move the country towards a single-payer system akin to Britain’s National Health Service. It would replace the current two-tier system in which those earning below roughly €5,000 a month pay into a social insurance system, while those earning above that, and civil servants, can take out private insurance instead.“Usually, the people that are part of the private system have better health and better education and, of course, high income,” says Mujaheed Shaikh, professor of health governance at the Hertie School in Berlin, and a contributor to a report by the Bosch Foundation, a charity, on healthcare in Germany. “This essentially creates this inequality within the insurance system, where risk pooling is affected.”The current structure has resulted in more private facilities being built. While they enable patients to be treated sooner and in greater comfort, they also tend to produce poorer outcomes than public hospitals, Shaikh says. “[Private practitioners] get paid faster and they get paid much more.I think, if you change this reimbursement scheme, things will automatically change.”But while a poll by public broadcaster ARD found that almost 70 per cent of citizens were in favour of a “citizens’ insurance”, the move has now been ruled out in talks between the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Free Democrats, as they try to put together a coalition to succeed Angela Merkel’s government.One in five general practitioners still communicates by fax machineInstead, the trio has committed to improving Germany’s system by accelerating the digitisation of healthcare in the country, where one in five general practitioners still communicates by fax machine, and where gathering patient data lags behind most developed nations.An OECD ranking of the health information available to policymakers in individual countries found that only Ireland was worse than Germany, among European countries. It ranked last in the percentage of key data sets available.“Zero per cent of the data which is extracted is extracted automatically from electronic claims or billing records in Germany,” says Shaikh.Part of the reason a register of unoccupied intensive care beds was not available at the start of the pandemic was that the relevant IT systems had not been universally updated.However, the crisis has helped accelerate the technological shift. Some 86 per cent of clinical doctors surveyed by the market research arm of Bitkom — a Berlin-based association that promotes the digitalisation of business — said they were broadly in favour of video consultations, electronic filing systems and app-based healthcare.Marx is among them. A longstanding advocate of telemedicine, he has been part of a project in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, in which doctors at Aachen treated patients in smaller hospitals — with less specialist expertise — remotely during the pandemic.Thousands of “televisits” took place and, as a result, the mortality rate of Covid patients on ventilators was around 30 per cent, compared with 50 per cent nationwide, Marx says. This bridged the outcome gap between urban and rural clinics.“We have seen that digital structures are absolutely essential for successfully coping with the corona pandemic, especially in intensive care,” he adds. “We must continue to expand [these services].”Even with such encouraging results, though, Germany’s funding system could prove a hurdle.“We had to transfer far fewer patients [thanks to the scheme],” Marx says. But while the virtual visits made during the Covid-19 pandemic were covered by the statutory system, the initial pre-pandemic pilot programme had to be funded by local government — because insurers balked at the extra cost.
165  EU lawmakers have reached a breakthrough on how to target tech companies, including Apple and Google, as part of moves by Brussels to curb anti-competitive practices in the digital economy.The European Parliament’s main political parties agreed on Wednesday to a deal that would apply to companies with a market capitalisation of at least €80bn and offering at least one internet service, such as online search, according to four people with direct knowledge of the discussions.It means the rules would draw more companies than thought into the EU’s planned Digital Markets Act (DMA), a wide-ranging effort to rein in Big Tech. Brussels hopes to implement the act next year.Companies including Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft would fall under its scope, alongside Netherlands’ Booking and China’s Alibaba.The agreement reached by a group of MEPs on Wednesday paves the way for EU lawmakers to vote on the package next week. Their plans would then have to be agreed with EU member states before becoming law.The act is aimed at banning anti-competitive behaviour, such as taking advantage of a dominant position in a sector to undermine rivals’ services.The proposed rules will also boost the power of national competition authorities to scrutinise tech companies’ acquisitions of smaller rivals, following fears that they are buying competitors on the cheap to ‘kill’ challengers.The Socialists & Democrats, the second-largest political party in the European Parliament, had been pushing for the rules to be widely drawn so that more companies would be subject to regulation.The centre-right European People’s party, whose members include Germany’s chancellor Angela Merkel and the president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, wanted a more focused regulation targeting only the largest tech companies.Andreas Schwab, the EPP MEP leading the negotiations over the DMA said: “I am satisfied that the parliament is sending a united message to the market which is ‘game over with unfair business practices in digital markets’.”Lawmakers have also been involved in long negotiations over whether to ban targeted advertising, which is a big source of revenue particularly for Google and Facebook.As part of their compromise this week, MEPs have agreed not to ban the practice but to impose severe restrictions, including protection for children and tougher transparency requirements.Lawmakers have yet to agree on their common position on the Digital Services Act, another draft legislation that aims to clarify how big tech should deal with illegal or harmful content online, which could still be delayed until next year.EU regulators hope to agree a common position of the parliament, the commission and member states early next year before France, which will hold the rotating presidency of the EU from January, heads into presidential elections in April.“The political wind is behind these set of new rules,” said a person directly involved in the discussions. “The new rules aim to answer the fundamental question of how we think the modern internet should be regulated.”
166  UK and European gas prices surged on Wednesday, building on sharp gains over the past week, as a fresh jolt of concerns over supplies of the key fuel for power generation and heating swept the market.The renewed increase in gas prices has been triggered by disappointment over Russian exports that remain well below their pre-pandemic level, while Germany paused the certification process for the politically sensitive Nord Stream 2 pipeline this week. Traders and analysts now expect that its start-up will not be approved until the second half of next year.Prices had eased slightly from all-time peaks in October after Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, indicated that state-owned Gazprom would increase supplies this month, following criticism that Moscow had exacerbated the gas crisis by limiting sales to western Europe this year.The UK gas benchmark for delivery in December rose 5 per cent on Wednesday to £2.51 a therm, from £1.79 a week ago, with most of the gains coming in the past two days. The European benchmark gained about 7 per cent to a high of €101.60 per megawatt hour, up from €64 last week.Prices eased later in the session, with the European benchmark pulling back to €95.50 and the UK price to £2.38.More than a third of the EU’s gas supplies come from Russia, but this year exports have fallen, with Gazprom restricting sales only to those covered by long-term contracts while letting its own storage facilities in the continent drop to unusually low levels.Gazprom has lifted exports slightly in November and added some supplies to its own storage sites, but levels remain well below where they were in 2019 and 2020, despite Russia having completed filling its domestic storage facilities ahead of the winter.“The suspension of Nord Stream 2’s certification process has let bullish momentum take hold again,” said Zongqiang Luo at Rystad Energy, a consultancy. “Russian flows to Europe through Ukraine and Poland have marginally increased on the week, though they remain far short of an adequate level for a cold winter.”On Wednesday, Gas Intensive, an industry group in Italy, asked the Italian government to consider tapping the country’s strategic gas reserves in light of the most recent price surge following the suspension of the Nord Stream 2 process.“It is no longer tolerable for Italian industrial companies to pay the bill for international geopolitical dynamics,” Gas Intensive said.Russia has been accused by some European legislators of trying to press Germany and the European Commission to accelerate the approval of Nord Stream 2, which will redivert supplies through Ukraine direct to Germany through the Baltic Sea. Some analysts say Moscow is exploiting the gas crunch as part of a broader push to destabilise European economies.Gazprom has repeatedly declined to substantially boost exports to western Europe through Ukraine, where officials have accused Moscow of attempting to “blackmail” Europe. Putin has dismissed the complaints as politically motivated.Ukraine is also concerned about the build-up of Russian military forces near its border, while the refugee crisis on the Belarus-Poland border is viewed by some officials as a Moscow-supported attempt to spread unrest.Global gas markets remain tight as demand rebounds from the pandemic, with Asia buying up additional cargoes of liquefied natural gas.Mike Muller, head of Asia at Vitol, the world’s largest independent oil trader, told a Financial Times conference on Wednesday that “we’ve seen a very marked depletion in Chinese onshore inventories, which tells you that globally now we have very low stocks”.He added: “It is quite plausible that the market will keep going higher.”
167  One of the UK’s leading food retailers has warned the British government that EU proposals to try to solve the dispute over Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit trade rules threatened to increase rather than ease the administrative burden on goods imported into the region.Archie Norman, chair of Marks and Spencer, said in a letter to UK Brexit minister Lord David Frost, seen by the Financial Times, that the offer from Brussels “could result in worsening friction and cost and a high level of ambiguity and scope for dispute”.Frost is leading talks with EU Brexit commissioner Maros Sefcovic to try to resolve the stand-off. The UK is seeking to rewrite the agreement’s protocol for Northern Ireland, which left the region in the EU’s single market for goods in order to prevent the return of a north-south trade border on the island of Ireland.If there is no resolution, the UK has threatened to trigger Article 16, the safeguard clause either side can use if they believe the Brexit agreement has caused “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties” or the “diversion of trade”.In proposals tabled in October the European Commission offered lighter checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, but only if they were clearly labelled for consumption only in the region.Norman said the labelling requirement would add £9m in extra costs annually for the 90m products M&S ships to Northern Ireland from the mainland. The letter also warned that under the EU proposals, a vet would still have to certify 95 per cent of the food it sends across the Irish Sea to prove it complied, adding “a minimum of four hours per day” to transit times.Along with other checks, that would result in fresh goods taking 45 hours longer to get to stores than when the UK was an EU member, Norman said. He added that as a result M&S might have to stop sending some product lines to Northern Ireland.“Detailed examination suggests to us that the proposals could end up being more costly to implement than full EU customs controls,” Norman said. Instead he called for a “risk-based regime” with limited checks on goods that would make extensive use of digital technology.The comments from Norman, who was a Conservative MP from 1997 to 2005, come as UK and EU officials continue talks aimed at avoiding the UK triggering Article 16.Speaking during a visit to the region on Wednesday, Frost said that Article 16, which would suspend many checks on goods, was still very much on the table and urged the EU not to retaliate if it were triggered.“If we use Article 16, it’s about making trade flow more freely within the United Kingdom and I don’t see how it would help for the response to that from the European Union to be sanctions, retaliation, making trade more difficult. I don’t understand why that would help the situation,” Frost told BBC Radio Ulster.M&S, along with two other UK-based food retailers — Tesco and Iceland — has stores in both the Republic of Ireland and the north. They are supplied largely from the British mainland but M&S handles proportionately more of the bureaucratic workload than their two rivals because it sells overwhelmingly own-label products.UK-based retailers are currently supplying stores in Northern Ireland under a set of temporary “easements” unilaterally extended by the UK government to reduce border friction, and reluctantly agreed to by Brussels. Norman wants these extended until the middle of next year.Frost has been courting business support for his tough line. But while many in Northern Ireland agree that the Sefcovic proposals require significant improvement, there is far less agreement on the merits of triggering Article 16.“It’s very clear that Article 16 does not give the stability and certainty that Northern Ireland needs,” said Aodhán Connolly, head of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium. “Where there’s talk, there’s hope.”Glyn Roberts, chief executive of Retail NI, which groups 1,800 independent retailers and wholesalers in Northern Ireland, said there was a danger that invoking the article “would poison the well”.Frost, when asked if he shared Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney’s optimism that the protocol row could be resolved by Christmas, said: “I think it can be done. Whether it will be done is a different question.”
168  Disentangling the corporate web of Royal Dutch Shell should have happened sooner. A hangover from its 2005 Anglo-Dutch merger, the company is currently incorporated in the UK but has Dutch tax residency, and a dual-class share structure that trades in London, Amsterdam and New York. Several factors have combined to push the company to now want to simplify itself by moving its tax base and chief executive to the UK. While elements of the move are not an unalloyed good, if overall the restructuring means the company can move faster towards a greener future with sustainable earnings, it should be welcomed.From Shell’s perspective, the simplification makes perfect sense. At a stroke, it weakens its ties to an increasingly hostile environment in the Netherlands — it will jettison the “Royal Dutch” part of its name for the first time in 114 years — eases its ability to acquire and dispose of assets, and boosts its ability to return money to investors. An activist investor, Third Point, which wants Shell to split its legacy “brown” and future green assets, has also pushed for simplification.There are clear reasons why Shell wants to leave the Netherlands, where climate activism led to a May court judgment ordering Shell to cut more emissions by 2030. A separate government decision meant it must close its Groningen gasfield by next year to limit seismic risks. Then, one of the largest Dutch pension funds has said it will divest its fossil fuel holdings, including Shell.But just as important a factor in Shell’s decision as Dutch climate activism is the country’s tax code, and in particular a 15 per cent withholding tax on share repurchase schemes. This also played a role in Unilever’s decision to abandon Rotterdam and become solely a UK business. An additional exit tax, mooted by Dutch opposition politicians as a way to penalise Shell, may have the effect of precipitating its departure.By issuing only UK shares, Shell will no longer have to worry about the withholding tax, which makes buybacks of its Dutch A shares uneconomic. A single pool of shares would enable it to double the amount of cash it can return to shareholders via share repurchases to more than $5bn a quarter, Shell reckons. It needs to find $7bn quickly to keep its promise to return money to shareholders from the recent sale of a shale oil business. Oil and gas companies are particularly fond of buybacks because they keep investors sweet while the industry shifts to greener and renewable (but as yet mainly unprofitable) energy.The flipside is that buybacks can be used to artificially inflate share prices — to which executive compensation is often tied — and deprive companies of reinvestment necessary to create sustainable future earnings. A company choosing a more tax-friendly jurisdiction for payouts to appease shareholders is not an unequivocally positive move, particularly when at least some of that money could be reinvested to boost green energy. Shell’s 2021 capital expenditure strategy called for putting $12bn into oil and gas versus just $2bn-$3bn into renewables.Shell’s investors have competing interests to weigh: balancing the quest for decent returns, which ultimately are the lifeblood of pension funds, charities and foundations, against the need to ensure the company keeps to pledges around its green transition. Shareholders need to hold on to their investments to effect change. Buybacks may help them to do this. Far better that oil majors be under the watchful eye of shareholders than go private after mass divestment.
169  Good eveningThe UK’s inflation rate rose to 4.2 per cent last month, the highest monthly inflation figure since November 2011. It was propelled by the hospitality sector and a rise in the cost of fuel and second-hand cars. The news pushed sterling to its highest rate against the euro since February 2020.It comes a day after the UK’s Office for National Statistics published stronger than expected employment figures, further strengthening the case for the Bank of England to raise interest rates to curb inflation.Inflation is being fuelled by economic recovery from lockdowns in nations across the world, but is causing different challenges in different countries.The rebound of eurozone economies from the pandemic nadir has reduced short-term risks to the financial system, but it has also led to a growth in longer-term risks, due to “exuberance” among investors, the European Central Bank said.Figures published by Eurostat today confirmed previous reports that eurozone inflation rose to a 13-year high of 4.1 per cent in October — well above the ECB’s 2 per cent target.A bigger danger from inflation is that today’s temporary inflationary forces become entrenched, sparking a wage-price spiral akin to the 1970s, according to FT columnist Martin Wolf, who writes that the US Federal Reserve and central banks in other countries are being too timid in tackling current inflationary pressures.Spiralling inflation in Turkey shows no sign of abating. The country’s central bank, under pressure from growing interference by president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is expected to cut its main interest rate again tomorrow.It is a different story in Australia, where a combination of cheap electricity and strong labour supply have kept inflation lower than in other countries, according to the governor of the Reserve Bank.The success of Australia, dubbed the lucky country for its previous economic good fortune, adds weight to arguments that rapid price increases in some economies were due to supply disruptions from the Covid-19 pandemic, rather than a global shift towards high inflation.For up-to-the-minute coronavirus updates, visit our live blogBrussels is seeking to ban imports of foods including beef and coffee from areas at risk of deforestation, in a landmark regulation designed to protect the world’s most vulnerable forests.

170  German chancellor Angela Merkel spoke to Belarus’s authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko for the second time in three days on Wednesday, part of a flurry of diplomatic activity aimed at de-escalating the migrant crisis on Belarus’s borders with the EU.Lukashenko’s press service said the two had reached “a certain understanding on how to move forward and solve existing issues”. Merkel’s spokesman said merely that the chancellor had “underlined the need to provide humanitarian care and return options” for the migrants stranded at the border, and added that UN agencies and the European Commission should be involved.The talks between Merkel and Lukashenko follow a burst of diplomatic contacts that have raised tentative hopes that it could be possible to alleviate the crisis. Thousands of migrants, mainly from the Middle East, are camped at the Belarus-Poland border as winter approaches.On Tuesday about 100 migrants clashed with Polish forces in an attempt to force their way across the Bruzgi-Kuznica border crossing that Poland said was “co-ordinated” by Belarusian forces.EU officials have accused Lukashenko’s regime of orchestrating the crisis in retaliation for the EU’s support for the Belarusian opposition, and the bloc’s foreign ministers agreed this week on the legal basis for a new round of sanctions against Minsk.But there has also been an increase in contacts with the Belarusian leadership. As well as Merkel’s conversations with Lukashenko, the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has spoken twice to Belarusian foreign minister Vladimir Makei, and French president Emmanuel Macron has talked to Lukashenko’s main ally, Russian president Vladimir Putin.EU diplomats said the talks with Lukashenko’s regime stemmed from a calculation that the pressure on him was starting to build. European lobbying efforts to cut flights ferrying migrants from the Middle East to Belarus have begun to bear fruit. And Putin’s public chiding of Lukashenko over a threat he made last week to cut off Russian gas supplies to the EU was viewed as a sign of a possible shift in the mood in Moscow.“Putin has started to rein Lukashenko in publicly on the gas transit. He [Lukashenko] is under a lot of pressure and we are now possibly seeing first signs of de-escalation from the regime,” said a senior EU diplomat.Merkel’s direct contact with Lukashenko has sparked unease in Poland and the Baltic states, and outright criticism from Belarus’s opposition, which worries that, rather than seeking to resolve the crisis, Lukashenko could merely exploit the talks for domestic propaganda purposes.“I think it was a mistake,” said Franak Viacorka, an aide to Belarus’s exiled opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, after Merkel first spoke to Lukashenko. “Right now it is too toxic to talk to Lukashenko.”But others said the gambit was worth trying if it offered a chance of easing the crisis. “Any conflict resolution requires a compromise. We can’t solve it not letting [Lukashenko] win something,” said an EU diplomat.Eva-Maria Liimets, Estonia’s foreign minister, said on Tuesday that, during his first conversation with Merkel, Lukashenko had demanded he be recognised as Belarusian president — something the EU had refused to do since last year’s election — and that sanctions on his regime be lifted in exchange for ending the migrant crisis.European officials said a wholesale removal of existing sanctions was unrealistic. “We should not accept blackmail or threats to change the position of the EU. Should we close our eyes to the fact that there are still 800 political prisoners in Belarus, that people are repressed, tortured and beaten? No,” said Marcin Przydacz, Poland’s deputy foreign minister. “Without a change in that regard, there can be no change in EU policy.”Diplomats were also doubtful that the new sanctions being drawn up against Minsk could be staved off. “I think it’s too late. A lot would need to happen in a very short period of time to prevent this from happening,” said one western diplomat.A more realistic deal, the diplomat added, would be one in which the EU provided financial or logistical support to ease the humanitarian crisis. The European Commission said on Wednesday that it had allocated €700,000 in assistance for people at the border.Katia Glod, an expert on Belarus from the Center for European Policy Analysis, a think-tank, said that apart from trying to remove sanctions, Lukashenko had an incentive to de-escalate.“With these migrants coming to Minsk and other cities, they might stir up tension among the electorate of Lukashenko,” she added. “So I think there is also motivation from the regime side in Belarus to finish the crisis.”But others are less hopeful. Although Polish officials said on Wednesday that the situation at the Kuznica border crossing had improved after Belarusian forces led migrants away to an unknown location, they estimate there are still several thousand migrants in Belarus. Poland’s defence minister warned on Wednesday that the crisis could continue for “months”.“There is maybe a 30 or 40 per cent chance of success,” said the western diplomat. “There is still a bigger likelihood that it doesn’t work. But the chances have increased in the last few days. [Before the recent diplomacy] it was zero.”
171  Ireland is to reintroduce Covid-19 restrictions this week, including a return to working from home wherever possible and a midnight curfew for pubs and clubs, in an effort to curb a fourth wave of the virus that has pushed infections to their highest level in nearly a year.It is one of three European countries that will implement measures in the coming days. Slovakia and the Czech Republic are also set to introduce new restrictions after both countries on Wednesday recorded their highest daily infection figures since the start of the pandemic.Taoiseach Micheál Martin, who said the grim picture in Ireland and across Europe was of “deep concern”, also announced a ramp-up of booster vaccines to all over-50s and vulnerable people.Without Ireland’s vaccination success — 89 per cent of over-12s are now double jabbed — “there is no doubt that we would now be in a full-scale lockdown”, he said in an address to the nation on Tuesday evening.In the Czech Republic, where just 58 per cent of the population is fully vaccinated, prime minister Andrej Babis said that from next Monday, people who had not been vaccinated or recovered from Covid-19 would be banned from attending public events.Meanwhile, in Slovakia, where hospitals in the east of the country are stretched to their limits, the government will decide on Thursday the extent of the restrictions they will implement. Proposals include banning the unvaccinated from non-essential shops, sports facilities and public mass gatherings.The new Irish restrictions, which take effect on Friday, mark a reversal of a full reopening in the hospitality sector that had been under way for less than a month.Irish hospitals over the past week saw the second highest rate of admissions this year. Ireland reported 4,407 cases on November 16, the highest level since January, and 634 people in hospital with Covid-19, a level not seen since February.Ireland’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said there had been 55,000 confirmed cases in the past two weeks and “this case level is unsustainable”.Writing on Twitter, he added: “Unfortunately, we do expect this figure to increase.”He told RTÉ Radio there could be 200,000 infections in December.Pub and club owners, who have been able to open in full since October 22, demanded Covid-19 support for the hard-hit sector, so close to Christmas, and warned that jobs would be lost. Despite the clampdown in the hospitality sector, sporting events will still be able to go ahead.Belgian authorities on Wednesday decided to reintroduce mask mandates not just for indoor venues and public transport, but also for large outdoor gatherings.Last week, the Netherlands became the first EU country to introduce sweeping nationwide lockdown measures for at least three weeks.While a number of European countries have resolved to implement restrictions, changes in Germany are still being discussed. The country’s political leaders are considering tighter restrictions on unvaccinated people as cases soar, with the seven-day incidence rate rising to another all-time high of 319 per 100,000 on Wednesday.But handling the fourth wave has been hampered by the fact that a new coalition is aiming to take over governing from Angela Merkel in the coming weeks following the country’s September 26 parliamentary election.The expected coalition of centre-left Social Democrats, Greens, and pro-business Free Democrats is aiming to pass a new law for pandemic measures through the Bundestag on Thursday. If passed, it would for the first time require people in the workplace or using public transportation to provide proof of a negative test, vaccination, or recovery.
172  The author is managing director for Europe at Eurasia GroupIn threatening the EU on the Northern Ireland protocol, the UK once again risks mistaking its wishes for reality. There may be differences of opinion in the EU. There will not be — if push comes to shove — the stark divisions that London imagines.Despite a commitment to intensify negotiations and a slightly softer tone last week from Brexit minister Lord David Frost and European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic, Brussels fears that the UK government will notify its intention to suspend parts of the protocol, probably in December.The British calculation is that member states will be united in making a fuss in public but much less aggressive in practice. London believes that the Irish and French are isolated and that the Dutch, Germans and Poles will oppose any suspension of the UK-EU trade deal.While it is true that persisting Brexit issues create the risk of “Irish fatigue” — something that Dublin is acutely aware of — the UK government’s assessment of potential EU splits is mistaken.First, its characterisation of the German and Dutch position is simply wrong. Second, Poland understands that it cannot expect the EU’s support over its borders with Belarus and not support Ireland over its border issues with the UK.There is a strong current of thinking in Whitehall that member states are not particularly bothered about Northern Ireland — certainly not enough to risk their commercial interests. British officials believe that many EU capitals see little objective risk to the single market if unchecked goods flow from Britain into Northern Ireland. There is also a belief in London that member states are frustrated with the commission for failing to deliver the constructive strategic relationship with the UK that they seek.The government is betting that the deal it can secure with an Article 16 notification will be better than anything it can secure without one. It wants a controlled explosion, allowing an agreement to come together in 30 days of talks after notification. It would never have to suspend the parts of the protocol that it claims are causing “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties” and a “diversion of trade”.This is a huge gamble.The EU will view the government’s use of Article 16 as the culmination of a process of “bad faith” which began with the Internal Market Bill, the unilateral extension of grace periods to ease trade between Britain and Northern Ireland and the command paper in July setting out the UK’s plans to rewrite the protocol. The latter, EU officials believe, would require a fundamental reconstruction of it — much more than the “renegotiation” Lord Frost demands, and which the EU refuses to entertain.Brussels suspects the ultimate British objective is to establish facts on the ground. The aim would be to show there is little risk to the EU single market’s integrity if goods from Britain destined for Northern Ireland remain free of customs and regulatory controls.As the commission will not force Dublin to impose a border on the island of Ireland, pressure will build over time to implement checks on goods heading onward from Ireland to the rest of the EU. But the EU is determined never to let Ireland be separated from the single market. It will be confronted with what it regards as British blackmail — forced to accept the risk of an unchecked, open Irish border or jeopardising Ireland’s place in the single market.The EU will not allow either to create a new reality which member states believe is contrary to their interests — especially if Britain diverges from EU regulations and standards in the future.Starting a process to terminate the post-Brexit trade deal — or an announcement to consider such a move — is possible. But while it has been a useful rallying cry in recent weeks, and the reason why many in the EU believe Lord Frost is engaging more constructively in negotiations, building consensus on full termination will not be easy. Partly terminating the trade deal — except for chapters on social security and police co-operation — is more plausible.Brussels and member states are also exploring more subtle, legally creative ways to strike immediately against the UK, without waiting months for arbitration or a European Court of Justice ruling. This could involve tariffs on sensitive UK goods, putting London under pressure to respond in kind. An explosion might be difficult to control.UK officials argue that they will not be undermining the protocol if they issue an Article 16 notification. But the state of UK-EU relations is dire. The EU will see it as a hostile act and give a quick, forceful response. It would take a brave, perhaps foolish prime minister, to wager the opposite.
173  This year’s rebound in the eurozone economy from the coronavirus pandemic has reduced short-term risks to the financial system, but it has also led to a build-up of longer term risks, the ECB said on Wednesday in its twice-yearly financial stability review.“Concerns particularly relate to pockets of exuberance in credit, asset and housing markets as well as higher debt levels in the corporate and public sectors,” the ECB said.Rising inflation and falling real interest rates have prompted investors to take greater risks in their search for yield, which has left parts of the property, debt and crypto asset markets “increasingly susceptible to corrections”, it warned.“A correction in markets could be triggered by a weaker than expected economic recovery, spillovers from adverse developments in emerging market economies, a re-intensification of stress in the non-financial corporate sector or abrupt adjustments in market expectations regarding the prospective path of monetary policy normalisation,” it said.Eurozone inflation rose to a 13-year high of 4.1 per cent in October, well above the ECB’s 2 per cent target. The central bank, however, has predicted inflation will fall back below its target in the next few years and said it did not expect to raise rates next year.But it noted on Wednesday there was “a risk that recent strains in global supply chains and the spike in energy prices could have longer-lasting effects on inflation than expected”.The ECB’s warning has echoes of how former US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan described the dotcom bubble of the 1990s as “irrational exuberance”. Luis de Guindos, vice-president of the ECB, told reporters that he did not think markets were irrational, but he said “it is a risk” because the current low interest rate environment will “not be there forever”EU house prices increased 7.3 per cent year on year in the second quarter, the fastest rise since just before the 2008 financial crisis. The ECB said there were “growing signs of overvaluation” that left many European housing markets “prone to a correction” and warned of a “deterioration in lending standards”.It said these developments “strengthened the case” for national authorities to introduce more “macroprudential policy measures”, such as limits on bank lending or higher capital requirements on mortgages.The ECB said “more exotic market segments, such as crypto asset markets, also remain subject to speculative bouts of volatility”. It also expressed concern about interlinkages between conventional financial markets and stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency that is nominally pegged to underlying assets to limit price fluctuations.Rapid growth in the size and usage of stablecoins “call for urgent implementation of regulatory, supervisory and oversight frameworks”, it said.For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT with one clickThe ECB said the non-bank financial sector “continues to face elevated credit risk” owing to increased investments in riskier “junk bonds” that are rated below investment grade. It added: “Were bond yields to rise, valuation losses could trigger outflows from investment funds which — when coupled with the low liquidity buffers — could force bond funds to liquidate assets to meet investor redemptions.”The central bank said its own ultra-loose monetary policy, under which it cut interest rates deep into negative territory and bought trillions of euros of bonds, had increased “incentives to engage in more risk-taking which could become excessive and lead to the build-up of systemic risk”.However, it said the main tools for tackling these risks were macroprudential rules rather than “leaning against the wind” by tightening monetary policy more than is needed to achieve its inflation target.Earlier this month, the US Federal Reserve warned that stresses in the Chinese real estate sector caused by financial difficulties at heavily indebted property group Evergrande “posed some risk to the US financial system”. But the ECB played down these worries, saying: “So far, the impact on global growth projections and financial markets has been limited, as foreign exposure seems relatively small.”
174  Brussels is seeking to ban imports of foods including beef and coffee from areas at risk of deforestation, in a landmark regulation designed to protect the world’s most vulnerable forests.Virginijus Sinkevicius, the EU’s commissioner for the environment and oceans, told the Financial Times that Brussels would target six agricultural products — beef, soy, palm oil, coffee, cacao and timber — in a draft anti-deforestation law due to be published on Wednesday.The regulation would force companies to prove that products they sold into the EU’s single market did not contribute to legal and illegal deforestation or forest degradation through agricultural use. “This regulation showcases our global responsibility and that the EU is walking the talk,” said Sinkevicius.The draft law, which will need to be approved by EU governments and the European parliament, comes weeks after more than 100 world leaders promised to end global deforestation by 2030 at the UN COP26 summit.The six products account for around 19 per cent of commodity imports into the EU, with the ban designed to reduce the impact of European consumer demand on the world’s forests and indigenous communities.“The EU is sending a clear message to major supermarkets and agricultural commodities traders: one of the largest economies in the world won’t accept agricultural products linked to deforestation”, said Nico Muzi, Europe director of Mighty Earth, a non-governmental organisation.Under the draft law, companies must show that products they sell into the single market are not linked to any deforestation or degradation activity dating from December 31 2020. Those failing to provide accurate information to national authorities via satellite images could face fines worth up to 4 per cent of their annual turnover.“We don’t think this will place a big bureaucratic burden on companies. The cost of compliance and due diligence will not be dramatic. The costs of the measures will be much lower than the expected benefits,” said Sinkevicius.Some environmental activists have welcomed the scope of the draft law, which encompasses legal and illegal forms of land use, as the boldest attempt by any regulator to crack down on deforestation. “The law represents a major leap forward in the fight against deforestation,” said Muzi.But it has been criticised by others for not including rubber among the listed commodities. Soaring demand for the material, which is used in products such as car tyres, is seen as a big new driver for deforestation. One study published in the journal Current Biology found that 5m hectares of tropical forests were cleared across mainland south-east Asia and sub-Saharan Africa for rubber plantations between 2003 and 2017.Sinkevicius said Brussels had chosen the commodities based on an impact assessment targeting products with the worst so-called “embedded deforestation”. However, he added that the law would be regularly updated in future years to “take account of changing deforestation patterns in case there is a shift towards rubber”. Rubber may also be included in the law during negotiations on the draft with the European parliament and member states, some MEPs have said.The anti-deforestation law is the EU’s latest attempt to raise scrutiny of product supply chains by cracking down on practices that harm the environment. Next month, the European Commission will propose a wider ranging due-diligence regulation that seeks to make companies liable for potential human rights abuses in their supply chains.Brussels will also on Wednesday propose anti-waste rules to prevent EU countries from exporting waste to poorer countries unless they have given their explicit consent and guarantees that they can process the material.
175  Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has expressed confidence that the EU will overhaul its debt and deficit rules in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, giving governments more leeway to invest.In an interview with the Financial Times, Mitsotakis said: “There will be a change in the framework and it’s not going to work against us. Any improvement is going to work in our favour.”The European Commission has launched a consultation on how to amend the rules surrounding the Stability and Growth Pact ahead of what is expected to be a fierce debate among EU capitals about how far an overhaul should go. The rules were suspended last year as the pandemic struck but are likely to be reimposed in 2023.Greece’s public debt to gross domestic product ratio climbed to 207 per cent after the pandemic, far in excess of the EU’s 60 per cent limit and the highest in the eurozone.The EU’s southern member states are pushing for more flexibility in the rules so they can continue to invest. But debate will not start in earnest until a new coalition government takes office in Germany. An agreement could take several months and would be followed by legislation enacting any amendments.Some fiscally hawkish northern countries and Germany’s Free Democrats, who are likely to take over the finance ministry as part of the coalition, are opposed to wholesale changes.Without going into detail, Mitsotakis said he was confident that the “pact will change, will incorporate the lessons of the pandemic and the eurozone crisis”.But he added that Greece’s high debt was not a worry and that the country was borrowing at historically low rates. “Investors seem to be comfortable with the political situation — we are a stable one-party government with a strong majority and a high probability of winning the next elections.”One hotly debated question is whether changed EU spending rules could reclassify certain types of government spending as investment benefiting the whole EU. Mitsotakis suggested there should be more leeway over Greek spending on its military and on immigration enforcement.Greek defence spending has risen to 3.82 per cent of GDP this year, the highest of any Nato member, because of concerns about the threat Turkey poses to its security. Athens has ramped up spending on naval ships and fighter jets. Mitsotakis has been under fire from the opposition over his defence spree, which has added about €10bn to Greece’s high debt.Greece, one of the main EU entry points during the 2015-16 migrant crisis, has also beefed up its border controls, including more intensive maritime patrols and construction of a wall along its land border with Turkey. Athens says its extra efforts benefit the EU.“I’m not very keen on spending more than 2 per cent of GDP on defence but we have to do it,” Mitsotakis said. “Migration, who pays for what. is another thorny issue.”Mitsotakis said Greece was unusual in that its greatest security threat came from fellow Nato member Turkey. If Greece were attacked by Turkey it would not be able to invoke the alliance’s Article 5 mutual defence clause.“So we need a different security guarantee and we made it clear that Europe should offer us that security guarantee,” he added.In September, Greece signed a defence pact with France, which included the purchase of three French-built frigates and 24 Rafale fighter jets.Under their “strategic partnership”, France would commit to backing Greece if tensions resurfaced with Turkey.The accord with France was sealed days after Paris was blindsided by Washington and London, its closest Nato partners, over their nuclear submarine deal with Australia.The EU treaties contain an “obligation of aid and assistance” for member states if one of them is attacked, a looser guarantee than Nato.Mitsotakis said: “We made it much firmer with the alliance with the French.this alliance is possibly the first step for a broader group of willing countries that would, within the concept of strategic autonomy, also include a much stronger mutual assistance clause at the EU level.” He added that the EU needed to adopt “aggressive deterrence” against Russia over its military threats towards Ukraine or risk losing its credibility as a foreign policy actor.Mitsotakis said it was unlikely the EU would be ready to deploy troops to bolster Ukrainian security but it needed to “explore options” for additional sanctions against Moscow in light of its renewed build-up of military hardware and troops close to the Ukrainian border. “At some point, if we want to be credible our threats need to be credible.”
176  Over the course of 37 years as a carpenter, Ahmet has witnessed many ups and downs in Turkey’s economy. But none has been as challenging as the backdrop he faces today, with runaway inflation and the ever-weakening lira crushing his small business.“Input costs have gone up so much that we cannot keep up with them,” said the woodworker, who makes kitchen cupboards, wardrobes and doors from his workshop in an industrial district in Ankara, the Turkish capital.“Just before the pandemic, chipboard — our main input — was 94 lira [per panel]. Now it’s 380 lira,” said Ahmet, who asked to be identified only by his first name.Soaring consumer price inflation, which in October stood at an annual rate of 20 per cent, has dominated the discourse of Turkey’s opposition parties and media because of its impact on struggling households.But for businesses, the acceleration is even worse. The country’s producer price index rose 46 per cent year on year in October — the worst rate in President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s 19 years in power, and a warning sign that further consumer price rises are likely to be coming down the tracks.Yet the central bank, which has faced growing interference from Erdogan, is widely expected to cut its main interest rate yet again on Thursday even as the lira — down 28 per cent against the dollar since the start of the year — has plunged to new record lows. In recent days it has been trading at more than 10 to the dollar.Erdogan is a notorious opponent of high interest rates and has repeatedly pushed the central bank to lower the cost of borrowing to stimulate growth, despite warnings from economists that inflation risks spiralling out of control.Selva Demiralp, a professor of economics at Istanbul’s Koc University, said that as an importer of energy and intermediate goods, Turkey was already exposed to global inflationary pressures caused by a rise in oil and gas prices, disruptions to international supply chains and a move towards normalisation of life after coronavirus lockdowns.“Unlike the rest of the world, our central bank is not really helping because higher input prices are multiplied with a weaker exchange rate to reach an even higher domestic price,” she said.Some analysts have raised questions about the gulf between producer and consumer prices, which have historically tracked each other closely, amid accusations that Turkish authorities could be manipulating consumer price inflation data, a claim that they deny.The disparity may be at least partly explained by businesses choosing to absorb some of the costs for fear of killing consumer demand.“We can only reflect half of the rising prices [in the costs quoted to customers],” said Ahmet, the carpenter. “We take the work at a loss or just at cost sometimes, just for the cash flow. People come and ask for a price and when they hear it, they can’t believe it.”Large companies, too, have had to search for a “sweet spot” on prices, said Mustafa Gorkem Elverici, chief executive of the publicly listed glass producer Sisecam. “We have the market power to be able to reflect [rising input costs in] prices — that’s our advantage. But if you reflect them too sharply then in the end this starts to ruin demand.”Exporters such as Sisecam have at least been able to take advantage of strong demand in Europe, Turkey’s most important market.Bigger companies “have the tools to navigate” choppy waters, such as using hedging instruments to insure themselves against rising input costs and currency fluctuations, according to Ece Mandaci, an analyst at the Istanbul-based advisory group Unlu & Co. They were also able to pass on much of the rise in input costs to their customers, she added, and saved money through cost-cutting efforts since the onset of the pandemic.A boom in exports, which were up 60 per cent year on year in the second quarter of 2021, is expected to push overall growth in gross domestic product to above 9 per cent this year.Yet even Tusiad, a business association whose members account for 85 per cent of the country’s foreign trade, excluding energy, has called on the government to prioritise tackling inflation rather than short-term growth.Gizem Oztok Altinsac, the group’s chief economist, said inflation concerns — and the accompanying financial instability — meant that recent rate cuts by the central bank had not translated into cheaper long-term loans for businesses. She added that, with European manufacturing growth losing momentum and domestic demand showing signs of slowing, “there is a big question mark over the sustainability of growth right now”.Meanwhile, small businesses and tradesmen say they are already being suffocated.“How is our business doing? I can barely stop myself from crying,” said Fatih, who runs a laundry serving the hotel industry. “It is very, very difficult.”“Every single day the cost of our inputs is rising. One day it is natural gas, the next day water, the next day power, detergent, gas. Bags for wrapping [clean laundry] were 12 lira at the beginning of the pandemic. Now they are 30 lira.”Like many in the business world, Fatih is braced for the government to announce a sharp rise in the minimum wage — currently set at a take-home rate of TL2,800 ($270) a month — at the start of next year. He does not know how he would be able to afford to keep paying his nine staff if, as widely expected, the level is increased by 25 or even 30 per cent.“Small businesses are in real trouble,” he said. “We are thinking twice about every single penny that we spend.”
177  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
178  Russia’s deliberate destruction of a failed satellite this week was rightly condemned by the US as reckless, dangerous and irresponsible.Hundreds of thousands of new fragments — most too small to trace — are now hurtling through space at 25,000km an hour, threatening human space flight and the 5,000 active satellites in orbit. In 2016, a fleck of paint cracked a window in the International Space Station. Imagine what larger fragments could do.With the Russian test, the risks of a Kessler syndrome — a chain reaction of collisions sparked by debris breaking up a satellite — have multiplied. So, too, has the urgency for new rules to govern behaviour in space — and not just in the military realm. The risk of debris and collisions was already spiralling in the commercial sphere before the Russians fired their missile.Since 2019 the number of working satellites has increased 50 per cent, largely because new commercial players are exploiting lower launch costs to build businesses in space. Last year the Satellite Industry Association estimated there could be more than 100,000 commercial spacecraft in orbit by 2029.That number may even be too conservative. Just three private companies — Elon Musk’s Starlink, Jeff Bezos’s Kuiper Systems and Britain’s OneWeb — have registered interest in launching close to 60,000 satellites combined. China has plans for multiple mega-constellations, and Rwanda last month revealed ambitions to launch more than 300,000 satellites.The more satellites, the greater the chance of collision, especially in low earth orbits of up to 2,000km altitude, where most of these commercial satellites will be flying. But the regulations for governing the use of this space, designed in the 1960s, are woefully inadequate.For instance, rules exist about interfering with the broadcast frequencies of other satellites, but there is no international system of space traffic control. Nor is there an independent global body providing data on satellite positioning and trajectories. That job is currently done by the US military, but some information is still classified. There are no binding regulations to help others avoid your spacecraft — or for who should move out of the way first — and no common enforcement principles.In 2019 the European Space Agency was forced to move a satellite out of Starlink’s way when it became clear the SpaceX team did not plan to adjust their own trajectory, despite indications of a potential collision. “If you were an operator in low earth orbit five years ago, you mostly cared about avoiding debris,” says Stijn Lemmens, senior space debris mitigation analyst at the ESA. “Now you have to care about avoiding other operators, too. There is no international co-ordination mechanism for where you deploy your constellation.”Efforts over the years to develop sustainable space practices have floundered in multilateral organisations such as the UN. National governments, responsible for regulating their own industries, have little interest in imposing burdens on their companies. Some may prefer to see domestic players stake claims to the new space economy while they can.In the US, Musk has set a pace that few can match. Earlier this year Starlink was allowed to modify the altitude of thousands of satellites without penalty, to the outrage of rivals who had designed their systems around its initial route. With close to 2,000 satellites, Musk controls more than a third of all active spacecraft. And he is on course for even more.Rivals complain light-touch oversight has helped Starlink to grab the best of low earth orbit, ignoring the concerns of others in a region considered to be a global common good. That may be true. But it may also be sniping from those who would like to do just as Musk does if they had the means. After all, there has been no collision yet.However, there is a legitimate question about how many satellites low earth orbit can support before collisions are inevitable. According to ESA’s last space environment report, even if all launches were stopped today, the amount of space debris in low earth orbit would still be “likely to increase”. As traffic accelerates, more investment is urgently needed in better infrastructure and regulation. This requires the support of all nations and commercial actors. If a civil regime has been developed for international aviation, it should be possible in space.Moscow may not have intended to spur better governance with its test, but it should be a wake-up call. There will be no prosperous global space economy if the environment is trashed before most of the world gets off the ground.
179  In the UK, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a think-tank, said last year that only a third of workers over 50 who had lost jobs during the pandemic had found a new one within six months.But generally, the workforce in major advanced economies around the world is ageing. A 2020 report by the OECD, a club of mostly rich nations, said the share of the population aged 50 and over would increase from 37 per cent in 2020 to 45 per cent by 2050, and mean greater numbers of older workers were in paid work.Older workers are likely to constitute a greater part of the workforce because people are healthier and living longer, and in some cases have less generous pension provision and cannot afford to retire. Yet, often, they struggle to find or keep a job even though age discrimination is prohibited under EU and UK law.The EU’s Employment Framework Directive was adopted in 2000 and led to the introduction of age discrimination law in many states. But, 20 years later, some have questioned whether enough is being done to allow older workers to participate in employment and whether the legislation is effective in eliminating covert age discrimination in the labour market.A recent report by Age Platform Europe, a network of non-profit organisations that represents older workers, concluded that the EU framework still leaves older workers behind. It said rulings from European and national courts still seem to reflect “biased and outdated views” of older people’s ability to work.Jo Keddie, partner at law firm Winckworth Sherwood, says both EU and national courts appear to consider ageism as the least important form of discrimination.“This may result in a shift towards self-employment for older workers which.takes away many of the advantages that the experience, corporate knowledge and nurturing and mentoring those employees offer to the younger members of the workforce,” she says.Age discrimination differs from other forms, such as race or gender, in that the courts will allow certain exemptions if judges believe it can be “objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim” — particularly where health and safety are involved.In 2010, in a case brought by German dentist Domnica Petersen, the European Court of Justice ruled that an age limit of 68 for dentists in the German health service could be justified. It accepted arguments that dentists’ skills declined with age.Academics say the ECJ has been viewed as much more robust on age discrimination since 2006. In what was known as the Mangold ruling, it found that German employment laws flouted EU age discrimination directives, by lowering protection for workers aged 52 or older on fixed-term contracts. It said the legislation was “disproportionate” as it applied to older workers whether or not they had difficulty finding a job.Hermès shoots to top of FT diversity rankingUK firms grapple with ethnicity pay gap reportingDiversity policies bestow greatest benefit to the most privilegedIlunion leading by example on disabilityEmployees score Europe’s companies on diversityBusinesses push to tackle class disadvantage in the workplaceThe Mangold ruling “came as a real shock”, says Colm O’Cinneide, professor of constitutional and human rights law at University College London. “Here, the ECJ applied the age discrimination element very strictly and put it on a par with other forms of discrimination such as race and gender.”But he believes the UK courts which, post-Brexit, no longer have to follow ECJ rulings, have been even more robust on such cases and “have applied age discrimination more consistently and strictly than the EU courts”. O’Cinneide expects more legal challenges. “It’s an active stream of anti-discrimination law,” he says.Keddie points out that relatively few age discrimination cases have come before the UK and European courts, partly because many older workers opt not to sue their former employer. “People are coming to the end of their career and have less appetite to challenge and less income to bring a legal challenge,” she says. “Age discrimination is a less visible form of discrimination and yet it is a real issue.”Keddie says the current shift by companies towards a hybrid workplace with more flexible and homeworking could be an opportunity to retain older workers.A 2018 report by PwC, the professional services firm, found that older workers should be encouraged to stay in the workplace longer to offset higher healthcare and pensions costs, as the move would increase gross domestic product and keep older people physically active for longer.OECD countries could increase their total GDP by around $3.5tn, it said, by following New Zealand’s example of having one of the highest employment rates for workers aged 55 and over. For the UK, the potential gain could be around £182bn, the report estimated.Age Platform Europe’s report rejects the idea that younger and older workers are competing for the same jobs and says mixed-age teams in the workplace have been associated with better performance and creativity. Nena Georgantzi, policy co-ordinator in human rights and non-discrimination at Age Platform Europe, argues that more radical changes are required. A binding international instrument such as a UN convention, she says, could catalyse a strong and inclusive interpretation of the universal right to work by courts.“Age discrimination is still embedded in the system and in society,” she says. “There is an imbalance between the rhetoric of policy and the reality.”
180  Shell has been threatened with an exit penalty by Dutch opposition parties after the energy company’s decision to end its dual-share structure and move its tax base to the UK triggered a political backlash in the Netherlands.Tom van der Lee, an MP from the Dutch green party, told the Financial Times that he would expedite a proposal to create an “exit tax” that was initially designed to hit Anglo-Dutch consumer giant Unilever with billions of euros in fees for leaving the country last year.The levy was first proposed by the opposition Dutch green party in 2020 to punish companies that left the Netherlands for jurisdictions with less onerous corporate tax regimes.The private members bill has now been revived after Shell on Monday announced that it would follow Unilever by ending its dual-share structure, relocating its tax base to the UK, and dropping “Royal Dutch” from its name.Van der Lee, the Green MP who is behind the exit tax proposal, said he would request that the Dutch parliament debate the levy ahead of a Shell shareholders’ meeting on December 10.“The exit tax has become a political priority for some opposition parties after Shell’s decision,” said Van der Lee. “The caretaker government has to realise that Shell has made up its mind and it is not possible to keep them in the country.”The exit tax has the support of the Greens and the Labour party but, crucially, will need backing from the liberal Democrats and Christian Union parties that are likely to form the next coalition government.Van der Lee said there was a “window of opportunity” to win broader parliamentary support as coalition bargaining was ongoing between the pro-business party of Prime Minister Mark Rutte, the liberal D66 and left-leaning Christian Union. He added that the draft law had been amended to apply to decisions made on or after November 15 2021, to therefore include Shell.Critics have derided the proposal as a “Hotel California” tax, borrowing from the Eagles’ song where “you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave”. Last year, the Dutch council of state ruled the tax could not be retroactively applied on companies that had already left the country, including Unilever.Shell says that it has received extensive legal advice and concluded that even if the proposed bill were to be in force in its present form at the time of the move, the group would be unlikely to incur any tax penalty.“We looked at a number of pieces of advice from several firms, we considered it ourselves and we thought it was highly unlikely that this would be a material tax or a tax at all that we would have to pay,” Andrew Mackenzie, Shell’s chair, said.The group argues that such a tax would violate the UK-Netherlands tax treaty and could also be challenged under EU law.It declined to comment on the size of any possible tax under the draft bill. Unilever estimated in 2020 that it would be hit with an €11bn penalty if it became law.Zoe Wyatt, partner at Andersen tax advisory in the UK, said that while there was uncertainty over how political parties would respond to the proposed bill, it made sense for Shell to “press the button on relocation”. “All the reasons for wanting to exit the Netherlands remain the same and if you are keen to do so, now is the time.”The exit tax proposal has been resurrected after the Dutch government admitted failure in a last-ditch attempt to abolish a contested dividend withholding tax, which Shell had cited as one reason for its decision and had previously lobbied to remove.The gambit failed after the liberal, green, and centre-left parties said they would not support abolishing the 15 per cent levy.Stef Blok, Dutch economy minister, told parliamentarians on Tuesday that the government would not offer any “concrete” measures to entice Shell to stay in the Netherlands. “It has never been a question of: if you don’t do this, then [we will leave],” he told MPs.
181  Germany’s energy regulator said it had “temporarily suspended” certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, dealing a setback to the Kremlin-backed gas project and sparking a rise in UK and continental European gas prices.The regulator said it could not yet approve the project, led by Russia’s Gazprom, because its owners had chosen to create a German subsidiary branch that was not yet properly set up according to German law.The suspension comes at a critical time for European gas supply, with prices surging across the continent. Gazprom has been accused by some countries of restricting exports to western Europe to increase pressure on Germany and accelerate approval of the project.UK gas contracts for delivery in December rose 17.2 per cent to £2.40 a therm on the news on Tuesday, while the European benchmark gained 15.2 per cent to €94 per megawatt hour, with both contracts trading near their highest level in a month. Having eased slightly in October on hopes of higher Russian supplies, gas prices have gained more than 40 per cent in the last week.The Swiss-based Nord Stream 2 project is creating a German subsidiary to own and operate the German section of the pipeline in response to EU “unbundling” regulations, which require that companies producing, transporting and distributing gas within the bloc are separate entities. The project’s request to be exempted from the rules was rejected by German courts in August.“Our company undertakes this step to ensure compliance with applicable rules and regulations,” Nord Stream 2 told the Financial Times.German regulators said certification would be suspended until all relevant assets and employees were transferred to the subsidiary. It said Nord Stream 2 would then be able to continue the four-month certification process laid out by law.Brussels officials said that once German authorities had finalised their draft certification process, it could be submitted to the European Commission. Brussels has two months to assess the certificate.Alan Riley, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think-tank, argued that the attempt to create a territorial subsidiary for the 33km section of the pipeline in Germany was effectively an attempt to find a loophole in the rules.Even if the commission accepted the plan, he said, a bloc member such as Poland — which opposes Nord Stream 2, arguing it is a threat to European energy security — would sue. He said Nord Stream 2 “will have to test if there is in fact a loophole at the European Court of Justice”.Nord Stream 2 would send 55bn cubic metres of gas per year under the Baltic Sea, allowing Gazprom to reach customers in Germany and elsewhere in Europe without using pipelines running through Ukraine.Officials in Kyiv have warned Russia is in effect blackmailing Europe by restricting gas supplies, and that reducing its reliance on Ukraine could make it easier for Moscow to launch an invasion.Yuriy Vitrenko, chief executive of Ukraine’s state gas company Naftogaz, warned Gazprom was “resorting to legal tricks” with the subsidiary. “This is a mockery of European rules,” he said.Pawel Majewski, chief executive of PGNiG, Poland’s state-controlled gas company, welcomed the German decision as a “good sign for Poland and for Europe”.“It is not possible to certify a subsidiary of Nord Stream 2 AG as an independent operator of the gas pipeline. It is also not possible to establish an operator applying EU law only in the territorial waters of Germany,” he said. “We regard today’s decision as the first step towards ensuring the enforcement of the law.”Gas traders have been looking for signs that Russia will increase exports to western Europe but have seen only piecemeal increases in recent weeks, with flows well below the level of a year ago.Russia’s president Vladimir Putin has consistently linked higher exports to approval of Nord Stream 2. Any delay is likely to increase fears that Russian flows will remain relatively low this winter.“Any remaining hopes that this pipeline would be available for the winter are completely dashed,” said James Waddell at Energy Aspects, a consultancy. “Increasingly it’s looking like it may not start up until the second half of next year.”Waddell said Russia could boost supplies to western Europe through the Ukrainian pipeline system Russia has relied on since Soviet times, but he said this was unlikely given Moscow’s insistence that Nord Stream 2 was the key to boosting exports.
182  Europe’s capital markets are booming. Soaring equity prices, an economic recovery and the accelerating shift to the internet have put 2021 on track for a record year for fundraisings.Bankers should spare a thought for colleagues in Italy where new listings have been scarce. Hot water and heating group Ariston will soon join the Italian market, valued at up to €4bn. It will stand out as the country’s largest deal since payment group Nexi listed in 2019.Europe-wide, initial public offerings are expected to burst through a high water mark of $115bn by the year end. The UK leads that tally having brought technology, finance and other new companies to market. Deals in Italy remain subdued. The addition of Ariston and Eni’s renewable energy division next year will do little to move the needle.The reasons are largely cultural. Northern Italy has a large stable of well-run family businesses. Entrepreneurs like passing on control to the next generation. Banks are generous with loan capital.Ariston exemplifies this. It is raising just €300m in new money against a larger secondary sale by the controlling Merloni family. Others such as coffee family Illy — reportedly pondering an IPO of their own — have used private equity for partial exits. A full private sale is another option.Markets reflect the low appetite for outside capital from Italy’s profitable mid-caps. Local brokers channel domestic funds into smaller growth ventures instead. International banks are focused on the needs of blue-chips and state-controlled businesses.Deals on Italy’s junior Aim remain strong but valuations are tiny. Growth capital for larger ventures is sparse. Automotive sales tech group MotorK picked Amsterdam for its listing in November. Vaccine vial maker Stevanato chose New York in July.Bankers see a gap in the market for mid-cap corporate financings. Italy should play catch-up in 2022, according to Berenberg’s Clarence Nahan. But a proportion of Italy’s mighty mid-caps will stay forever family-owned. That status has given them a flexibility and longevity of which bosses of quoted mid-caps can only dream.
183  The Greek prime minister has urged Boris Johnson to return priceless ancient sculptures to Greece during his official visit to the UK saying the move would strengthen Britain’s global standing post-Brexit.“It’s a topic I really care about and not just a footnote in my visit to the UK,” said Kyriakos Mitsotakis during an interview with the Financial Times on Tuesday, referring to the “Elgin Marbles” taken from the Parthenon in Athens in the early 19th century. “There is a very strong reunification argument which I consider particularly important.”“If I were in the PM’s shoes and I were thinking out of the box in terms of global Britannia, and the idea of Britain really playing a role in the post-Brexit world, [it] would be a fantastic coup for public diplomacy if they were to look at this from a different perspective,” he said.The return of the Elgin Marbles has been a subject of contentious debate for more than 200 years during which time Greece has repeatedly called for their repatriation.Seventeen figures and almost half of the frieze that adorned the fifth century BC Parthenon were removed by Lord Thomas Elgin, a British diplomat and art collector, when Greece was under Ottoman rule, who then sold them to the British Museum.Greece’s leader on Tuesday met with Johnson to discuss a number of foreign policy issues including the repatriation of the historical objects.Johnson has previously rejected calls to return the marbles to Greece, insisting they were “legally acquired”. Speaking to the Greek daily Ta Nea earlier this year, he said: “The UK government has a firm, longstanding position on the sculptures, which is that they were legally acquired by Lord Elgin under the appropriate laws of the time and have been legally owned by the British Museum’s trustees since their acquisition.”According to Mitsotakis, in 1986 Melina Mercouri, the Greek culture minister and fervent campaigner for the return of the marbles, was invited by Johnson to the Oxford Union to talk on the issue and at the time he was a passionate supporter of returning the marbles.For years the main argument against the return of the sculptures was Greece’s lack of a suitable location for their display but in 2009 Greece inaugurated a state of the art museum at the foot of the Acropolis.“If you go to visit the new Acropolis museum you will understand what I mean. That’s where you need to see the sculptures,” said Mitsotakis, referring to the plaster casts of the sculptures housed in London next to original pieces Elgin left behind. He stressed that the Elgin Marbles are a significant monument and not just any artefact.The Greek PM said he understood the position of the British Museum that a possible return of the statue could lead to “everyone asking for everything there is in the museum” but insisted that the Elgin Marbles were a “special case”.In exchange for the return, Mitsotakis said he was very open to offering the British Museum access to antiquities and treasures that have never before left Greece as part of a rotating exhibition in the future.Johnson on Tuesday said the possession of the marbles was a matter for the museum and not the UK government.“Any decisions relating to the collections are taken by the museum’s trustees and any question about the location for the Parthenon sculptures is a matter for them,” Downing Street said.But Mitsotakis insisted he would continue to engage both the government and the museum on the issue.Letters in response to this article:Parliament has powers to return the Elgin Marbles / From Derek Wyatt, Former Labour MP Member, Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Parliamentary Select Committee 1998-2005, Aldeburgh, Suffolk, UKJohnson and Greek PM play Elgin Marbles / From Alessandro Ciravegna, London SW1, UK
184  Russia has denied its recent test of an anti-satellite missile posed any threat to the safety of space crew after the US accused it of a “destructive” move that generated debris and put astronauts on the International Space Station at risk.The missile struck an obsolete Russian satellite “with surgical precision”, said Sergei Shoigu, Russia’s defence minister, on Tuesday, according to the state-run RIA news agency. “The fragments that were produced do not pose any threat to activities in space.”His comments came after Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, said on Monday that Russia had earlier in the day “recklessly conducted a destructive test of a direct-ascent anti-satellite missile against one of its own satellites”.Blinken said the test had generated more than 1,500 pieces of “trackable orbital debris and will likely generate hundreds of thousands of pieces of smaller orbital debris”, threatening people working at the ISS and “other human space flight activities”.The actions “clearly demonstrate that Russia, despite its claims of opposing the weaponisation of outer space, is willing to jeopardise the long-term sustainability of outer space and imperil the exploration and use of outer space by all nations through its reckless and irresponsible behaviour”, Blinken said. He added that the US would work with its allies and partners to respond.Russia’s Roscosmos state space agency said on Tuesday that space crew safety “has always been, and remains, our top priority”. Russia was monitoring the situation “to prevent and counter all possible threats to the safety of the ISS and its crew”, it added.The country’s military on Tuesday confirmed the test. “The Russian ministry of defence is carrying out planned activities to strengthen its defence capabilities,” it said in a statement, adding it had conducted a successful strike on Monday on the non-operational Tselina-D satellite that had been in orbit since 1982.The ministry denied debris produced could pose any threat. It described US statements about safety concerns as “hypocritical”, saying Russian tests were motivated by US actions in space that were “assessed as a threat”. The Pentagon was testing weapons of various kinds in orbit, it said.Following the Russian test, astronauts and cosmonauts on the ISS had to be woken to undertake emergency safety procedures, said Nasa administrator Bill Nelson. The debris also threatened the Chinese space station, he added. “[I]t is unthinkable Russia would endanger not only the American and international partner astronauts on the ISS, but also their own cosmonauts. Their actions are reckless and dangerous,” Nelson said in a statement. Nasa said the ISS was passing through, or near, the debris cloud every 90 minutes.The test comes amid rising tensions between the US and Russia after Washington last week publicly warned Moscow against invading Ukraine, where officials have become alarmed by the presence of up to 114,000 Russian troops on its borders.This is not the first time states have tested missiles on satellites. During the cold war, the US and Russia designed and tested anti-satellite weapons. Such missiles could theoretically shoot down enemy satellites that control intelligence and communications and threaten to turn space into a war zone.More recently, China and India have also tested aspects of anti-satellite systems. In 2007 China drew international condemnation when it blew up one of its own failed satellites, creating more than 35,000 pieces of debris. A recent Rand Corporation report described the event as “the largest debris-generating incident to date”.“This event is a clear risk to the International Space Station but, depending on the energy and angle of the impact, also a risk to other satellite constellations in this portion of low Earth orbit, including elements of the SpaceX Starlink constellation,” said Bruce McClintock of the Rand Space Enterprise Initiative.“This event is a stark reminder of the importance of establishing a ban of debris-generating ASAT testing. Debris generation affects everyone.”Governments are increasingly concerned about the problem of space debris, since fragments as small as a fingernail are capable of inflicting great damage to orbiting spacecraft. Almost 30,000 orbiting objects are regularly tracked, but it is estimated more than 1m are too small to be followed.Many in the space industry are publicly calling for international collaboration on new rules to govern behaviour in space as a record number of satellites are launched into low Earth orbit. Falling launch costs and cheaper satellites have made it possible for private companies to develop commercial space-based businesses.Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics who tracks activity in space, said on Twitter: “I condemned the 2007 Chinese test, the 2008 US test, the 2019 Indian test, and I equally condemn this one. Debris-generating anti-satellite tests are a bad idea and should never be carried out.”
185  The writer is Fritz Stern chair at the Brookings InstitutionWhat with Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko weaponising migrants against Poland, Russia massing troops at Ukraine’s border and China engaged in a massive nuclear arms build-up, it is small wonder that Germany’s allies are looking anxiously for news of the next government coalition in Berlin.The Biden administration last week sent Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a Democrat and presidential confidant, to the German capital. Senior French and British diplomats are likewise in contact with the German politicians forging a coalition programme.Their focus is on Working Group No. 20 — one of 22 groups involved in the negotiations, and the one tasked with “security, defence, development, foreign policy and human rights”. But Germany’s allies are not only exercised by what the coalition dealmakers — the Social Democrats, Greens and Free Democrats — intend to do about defence spending, drones, arms exports or relations with Russia. What they are really worried about is nuclear weapons.Germany has no nuclear weapons of its own, but it stores 20 or fewer US B-61 nuclear gravity bombs at Büchel air base, and maintains a fleet of ageing Tornado fighter bombers to deliver them. This gives it a seat in Nato’s nuclear planning group. The SPD and the Green election platforms demanded the removal of the US bombs from German soil. They also want Germany to join the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons as an observer.The working group drafts were handed last week to the three-party steering group, which has two more weeks to hammer out the final shape of the coalition agreement. Reliable information has it that the foreign policy group recommends that Germany should become a TPNW observer. However, their paper references nuclear participation and calls for a timely decision to acquire new fighter planes. Can allies breathe half a sigh of relief? Alas, no.The nuclear ban treaty is seen by Washington, Paris and London — and Chancellor Angela Merkel’s outgoing government, in which the SPD is a junior partner — largely as a distraction from arms control talks that actually include nuclear powers. But Norway, a Nato founding member, also wants to be an observer. If Germany does the same, the critics fret, other western European countries like Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy might follow. The result: an east-west split in the alliance, and quiet satisfaction in the Kremlin.As for the B-61s, Rolf Mützenich, SPD parliamentary whip and leader of the party’s leftwing, has recently affirmed that he wants “those things” out of the country, and a moratorium of “four or five years” on replacing the fighter planes. (By that time the last Tornado would be a heap of scrap metal, resolving the nuclear participation question by default.) Expect a fight.Mützenich is a longstanding advocate of nuclear disarmament and a redoubtably effective power broker, who sharply reminds cabinet ministers of their obligation to the party. Half of his SPD group in the Bundestag are youngish and left-leaning newcomers. He may aspire to rally the troops around a cause, with himself in command. In the SPD and Green party bases, too, pacifist feelings run strong.Many of Germany’s allies are mystified at a navel-gazing debate that appears remote from reality and tone-deaf towards their concerns. Given the tensions with Russia, Belarus and China, they contend, this is no moment for a key Nato member to distance itself from the alliance’s nuclear deterrence strategy. Some senior politicians in the negotiating parties quietly agree.Conspicuously silent on all this is Germany’s presumptive next chancellor. Olaf Scholz cast himself as Merkel’s natural heir but also wants to be the anti-Merkel: not a perpetual crisis manager, but the architect of an enduring renaissance of social democracy and the state. Unfortunately, it looks as though the crises have other ideas.Scholz might consider the example of his SPD predecessors. Willy Brandt (1969-74) combined detente with a hefty defence budget. Helmut Schmidt (1974-82) was a formidably intellectual proponent of arms control reinforced with deterrence — who was ultimately brought down for it by his own party.Some in Berlin may also recall October 1998, when Gerhard Schröder, the new chancellor, and his Green foreign minister Joschka Fischer found themselves signing off on an “activation order” for Nato air strikes against Serbia before they were even sworn in.All three cases have something in common. A German chancellor does not get to delegate foreign policy to others.
186  But one thing we do think we are pretty good at is homing in on Titanic-sized blind spots before they become broadly acknowledged fact. And one such market blind spot — the potential mother of them all — is that markets are overlooking the risk that an active state of international “hybrid warfare”, which has been in play for a number of months if not more, will soon intensify into a hot war. For now, the idea that World War 3 has arrived in the form of a very active, but largely invisible, shadow hybrid war remains a fringe theory. Nonetheless, in recent weeks, the force of realpolitik has set its sights on converging conflicting narratives about Russia in such a way that they have no choice but to reconcile. When they do, one of those narratives may emerge as more true (or important) than the other, prompting a potential reappraisal of current allegiances. A good analogy for what we mean comes in the shape of a contestant in a TV reality show who plays both sides to get ahead in the game. At some point the separate narratives he’s been feeding fellow contestants can no longer square against reality. His multipolar opponents then begin to compare notes and realise they’re not really each other’s enemies but his.The growing popularisation of the term hybrid warfare (even the Daily Mirror is talking about it) as something distinct to plain old “Russian disinfo” or “Chinese propaganda” is telling in its own right. It implies events going on that are far more strategic in nature.As the FT’s special report on Cyber Warfare noted in a piece penned by Scott Tait, chief executive of Alfa Strategy and managing director for war-games at BlackOps Partner, in October: In simplest terms, hybrid warfare uses capabilities not normally associated with war to coerce or subvert. Such techniques are intended to delay recognition that an attack is under way, paralyse decision making through confusion and discourage the victim from responding forcefully due to the absence of “legitimate” military targets.Since the whole point of hybrid warfare is to disorientate the enemy to ensure the big secret that they are really being attacked never gets out, it stands to reason that every offensive action must be obscured by the cloak of plausible deniability. Indeed, tell the average person that hybrid warfare is a strategic mechanism designed to divert his attention from the fact there’s a war going on at all, and they will probably have a giggle, regarding it beyond belief.A casual stroll through the annals of military history tells us otherwise. Over the grand course of history, hybrid-style tactics have been par for the course. Why should this era — aside from digitising the fundamental rules of warfare as described by Sun Tzu — really be any exception?The purpose ultimately is to ensure the enemy, by not knowing anything for certain, is always likely to give the attacker the benefit of the doubt. In this way the ambiguity can be weaponised to strategically demoralise, confuse and divide the target population, making it impossible for them to defend themselves with conviction.In the current incarnation of hybrid warfare the question is how many of the horrible things that have been happening recently are actually part of a strategic attack intended to demoralise and divide the West? How many have been wrongly rationalised due to strategic ambiguity as accident, a coincidence or a bad interpretation of data. Any hint the enemy is on to what you’re up to (or worse than that, at risk of letting the cat out of the bag) and a strategic policy of deflection and leaning into the lie becomes necessary. Usually by way of projection, demonisation or the presentation of false equivalences. As a case in point, consider what the FT’s Dan McCrum went through with Wirecard. To understand why we think markets should be more concerned than they currently are, look at events on the border between Belarus and Poland. Owing to the Belarus border crisis the term “hybrid warfare” is moving out of the shadows and into popular parlance. In Poland, almost every report over the past few weeks about Belarus has been framed through the prism of hybrid warfare (Google “wojna hybrydowa” (Polish for hybrid warfare) to see what we mean). We’d go so far as to say it’s become the go-to term to explain current affairs, with the Polish news media packed to the brim with explainers and definitional accounts. For many Poles, who have never ceased to fear the Russian bear, the concept is easy to grasp. They still have muscle memory of the last time their consciousness was barraged with propaganda aimed at inhibiting an ability to defend themselves. As the saying goes, fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. This time round, as events at the border reveal, the Poles have sensed early on that everything is not as it seems. This has seen them act quickly and with conviction, rejecting halfhearted diplomatic measures in favour of far more aggressive militarised responses. The Poles have been early to counter hybrid warfare with their own propaganda techniques such as broad-brush text messages to migrants’ phones saying: “The Polish border is sealed. BLR authorities told you lies. Go back to Minsk!” The modern-day equivalent of airborne leaflet propaganda. To control the message further, as is the norm in any theatre of war — and a very good indication of the severity of the confrontation — the Polish Ministry of Defence is now moving from a no-press policy at the conflict zone to a regulated media approach, which will presumably allow for embedded journalism.Unknown digital soldiers, meanwhile, have grouped together to expose the scale of the fakery emanating from the Belarus side. This includes the allegation that migrants have been using smoke to make themselves cry and look more sympathetic to western media reports — à la the plot line of the black comedy Wag the Dog. Others have focused on exposing the expensive branded outdoor clothing the migrants are wearing. The Defence Ministry’s own Twitter account, has focused on revealing the scale of the Belarus military presence at the border. They have also resorted to morale-boosting messages focused on Poland’s historic past. Poland’s Independence Day celebrations, which occurred last week, marked the 103rd anniversary of Poland having its borders reinstated after being off the map geographically for 123 years. These too were seized upon in messaging to help boost morale and rouse patriotic support for the border measures. Controversies surrounding the independence march, however, have also fed right into the popular narrative being carved out about hybrid warfare on the ground.Despite being popularly portrayed in the Western press as a conservative and illiberal stronghold that risks embracing authoritarianism in its own right, domestically, the picture is much more divided. The ruling Law and Justice party faces vocal opposition from supporters of the liberal Civic Platform, including strong criticism for its migrant, minority rights and judicial reform policies. The government is further accused of undermining press freedom and over-influencing state broadcasting, in messaging centred on communicating the fact that it unfairly controls the narrative in Poland. On its part, the government claims the free media has been overly influenced by foreign interests. It wants to dissipate that opposition and unite people to ensure a long-lasting military stand off can be guaranteed against Belarus. Appealing to the average Pole’s deeply entrenched patriotic inclination was an obvious way to do it.Coverage of the recent independence march exists in its own hybrid reality. On one hand, it is portrayed as an outpouring of much needed patriotic pride in the face of external aggressions that threaten Poland’s sovereignty. On the other hand (the opposition’s), it is portrayed as a destabilising show of force by an intolerant and fascistic nationalist movement with a tendency towards occasional violence. Fear of further violence this year saw Warsaw authorities, aligned with the opposition, seek to ban the march via official judicial channels. In doing so, however, they stoked prevailing sensitivities about the government’s even longer standing dispute with the European Union over independence of its judiciary. The Polish government contends that the judicial system remains under the influence of communist-era left-leaning judges. This they say means justice can never be served to those who oppose communism. In their worldview, to get justice, the government had no option but to overturn the ban via a direct intervention — which it ultimately did. And herein lies the true mystery of what’s happened of late. As longtime Poland watchers will testify, it’s been a long time since the European Union has been openly supportive of Polish unilateral action. To the contrary, the EU has been openly issuing fines to Poland and threatening further punitive action for reforms to its judiciary. In response, Poland has alleged that the Union itself has been waging its own hybrid warfare strategy against it. That makes recent headlines like this very confusing to process:In recent weeks, the sentiment surrounding Poland has gone from conspiracy inclined bad boy of the European Union, to white knight. All this, we are told, because the EU has now realised just how big a threat Lukashenko’s Belarus really is.It’s hard to know what’s really driving the about-turn on policy. The simple explanation is that it’s a question of better the devil you know. The more complex explanation is that some optics are more meaningful than others. Poland being seen to be “invaded” represents probably the worst optics of all. In the EU case specifically, such optics are unlikely to help achieve the bigger agenda: getting rid of Poland’s populist strongman protector, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, by democratic means.The more likely explanation is that the EU has only changed sides because it sees Warsaw’s strategy as a means to a decisive end on its much bigger clash with Lukashenko and Putin. The cynical might point out that even this does not make sense. After all, so much of Kaczynski’s strongman action has been propelled by paranoia that Europe hasn’t been taking the Russian threat seriously enough. If the EU was truly serious on facing up to Putin, continuing to withhold Covid recovery funds from Poland to weaken it economically would be hugely counter productive.The alternative view is that if the EU backtracks on penalising Poland, it might inadvertently imply that Kaczynski may have had a point about broader Russian infiltration across the European system. Small surprise the Poles have been seeking help from the British and raising the prospect of Pole-exit.What is clear, we think, is that following the money -- or in this case the gas -- and who it empowers or disempowers, will be more revealing than any formal messaging. It’s worth remembering, the prelude to World War 2 featured similar levels of ambiguity. But it was Churchill’s cunning assessment of money flows in 1935 that convinced him there was more to German activity than simply reviving national self-respect.As he noted to parliament on October 24, 1935:  When we separated in August, the House was concerned about the scale and rapidity of German rearmament. What has happened in the interval? The process has continued remorselessly. The incredible figure of more than £800,000,000 sterling is being spent in the currency of the present year on direct and indirect military preparations by Germany. The whole of Germany is an armed camp. Any Member of the House who has travelled there can add his corroboration of that statement. The industries of Germany are mobilised for war to an extent to which ours were not mobilised even a year after the Great War had begun. The whole population is being trained from childhood up to war. A mighty army is coming into being.If WW3 is likely to be digital as well as geographic, it’s not just physical armies but digital ones that are going to matter.
187  European carbon prices jumped to an all-time peak above €66 a tonne as traders bet that the outcome of the COP26 climate talks was likely to strengthen emissions markets that are seen as a key tool of decarbonisation.The EU Emissions Trading System, which sets the price for utilities and industry for emitting one tonne of carbon in the bloc, climbed 2.6 per cent on Tuesday to €67.65 a tonne — continuing Monday’s rally, when the gauge rose 5.5 per cent. Carbon prices are now more than double their level at the beginning of the year and up from €55 a tonne a month ago.Traders and analysts said the outcome of the COP talks, while not as strong as some had hoped, still pointed to a trajectory whereby governments will need to see the cost of carbon rise to help push heavily polluting fuels like coal off the grid, while encouraging industry to invest in cleaner technologies.Tom Lord at Redshaw Advisors said that while there were some technical factors contributing to the gains, trading in the EU ETS on Monday had been “one-way traffic throughout the day”.“The gains accelerated [Monday] afternoon as the all-time high came into view,” Lord said, “and further technical buying as the all-time high was eclipsed ensured a final flurry.”Mark Lewis at the Andurand Capital hedge fund said there was a “little post-COP euphoria” as “while the outcome wasn’t perhaps as strong as some had hoped, there was still a clear signal that policymakers need to get serious about carbon pricing if we’re going to see emissions falls”.“There is a general feeling that carbon markets come out of the COP process reinforced,” Lewis said, “as what has become clear is there’s now an acceptance among policymakers that the limited amount of space left for carbon in the atmosphere is the scarcest resource of all.”The EU carbon market is politically constructed, with lawmakers able to gradually tighten supply of the allowances to help boost the price. Investors have been rushing into carbon in the past 18 months, believing that stimulus plans and investments in decarbonisation after the pandemic imply carbon prices will need to rise.Projects like carbon capture and storage, green hydrogen produced by electrolysis and other green initiatives all benefit from stronger carbon prices as they make fuels like coal less competitive. In the short term they can also boost natural gas demand as coal, which produces twice as much CO2 when burnt as gas, becomes less attractive.Gains in the carbon market have, however, led to fears in some heavily coal-dependent countries in the EU about the costs — although this has been tempered to an extent in recent months by record gas prices caused by tight supplies globally.Some analysts were more cautious about the influence of the UN Climate talks in the EU, with Energy Aspects cautioning that they thought there was only “an outside chance” of the EU toughening its carbon reduction targets.“The EU will see itself as already having the most aggressive emissions reduction targets and will be putting pressure on others to come closer to its goals,” Energy Aspects said.
188  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.Invade Ukraine once, shame on Russia; invade twice, shame on the West. This seems to be the country’s credo when talking to European (and American) officials. Foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba spoke to Europe Express after a flurry of meetings in Brussels yesterday and we’ll unpack what his takeaways were.Over in the Netherlands, as the Financial Times first reported yesterday, the caretaker government of Mark Rutte is scrambling to keep Shell in the country after the energy group said it would move its headquarters to the UK. To mollify the company, he is seeking a majority in the parliament to ditch a dividend tax that Shell has cited as reason for the move.In other break-up news, Brexit commissioner Maros Sefcovic, who also inherited the EU’s decaying relationship with Switzerland, met the Swiss foreign minister yesterday. I’ll give you the lowdown on the results of the meeting — the first since Bern pulled the plug on negotiations with Brussels in May.The rhetoric from Germany and France when it comes to Russia’s military build-up on Ukraine’s border was forthright. “Serious consequences” would result from any military action, the two countries’ foreign ministers stated last night.Words, however, can only go so far, as the EU capitals are well aware, writes Sam Fleming in Brussels. The question is what concrete steps the Europeans and US can take, to make it clear to Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, that the risks of any military action would far outweigh the rewards.Ukraine’s foreign minister yesterday held discussions with Heiko Maas and Jean-Yves Le Drian, the German and French foreign ministers, as well as with Nato’s secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg, and afterwards he told Europe Express that he expected his country’s allies to take tangible steps to deter Russian aggression.“Everything that can strengthen Ukraine’s capacity to defend itself and demotivate Russia from resorting to military actions is on the table,” Dmytro Kuleba said last night after a day of meetings in Brussels.He declined to lay out specifics, but hinted that allies’ steps could range from military assistance to economic countermeasures.“We know what every partner can do,” he said. “Some can work with us on the military track. Others prefer to act through economic measures. Someone else can only do political messaging. It is important to pool all these elements together and based on the capacity and the political and readiness of every partner to make a contribution.”Kuleba argued a broader pattern was now apparent in which Russia was pursuing attempts on several fronts to weaken Europe.“We think that the use of migrants by Belarus, the situation around Nord Stream 2, the disinformation campaigns, the military build-up by Russia, are all part of a broader picture,” he said. “Russia is involved in all of these situations.”For Ukraine, Putin’s decision earlier this spring to order tens of thousands of troops he had massed near the border to stand down now appears only a temporary reprieve. After the troop withdrawal “they left all this infrastructure in place. It’s like building a house”, said Kuleba. “All they have to do now is to move in, open the windows and start shooting.”“What we have now is the infrastructure that is set up for a large number of troops and a lot of state of the art military equipment that can be deployed against Ukraine or used as leverage,” he explained.All eyes now are on the European powers and US as they consider their response to that threat.A worldwide FT reader survey shows men and women differ on their expectations about time spent at home and at the office. Almost three-quarters (73 per cent) of female respondents predict spending between one and three days in the office once all Covid-related restrictions are lifted, with only 18 per cent opting for four or five days. Among male respondents, however, 63 per cent planned to come to the office for one to three days, with 28 per cent expecting to attend on four or five days. (More here)Swiss-EU relations came to an abrupt halt in May, when the government in Bern officially pulled the plug on years-long negotiations with the EU. Yesterday, the Swiss foreign minister, Ignazio Cassis, rekindled ties during his talks with EU Brexit commissioner Maros Sefcovic (who is now also handling the Swiss file).One peace offering — the Swiss parliament having unblocked the payment of funds for poorer EU member states — was well received, but didn’t translate into any immediate concessions for Bern.Sefcovic has said the last such payment “dates back to 2012, a whole financial framework ago”, even though it’s a requirement for Switzerland’s continued access to the single market and that Swiss commitments for future disbursements are needed.One ask in particular — to have Swiss universities become beneficiaries of EU’s well-funded research programme Horizon — fell on deaf ears. Only when there’s movement on the overall EU-Swiss relations (meaning Bern being willing to return to the now-discarded framework agreement that would replace existing bilateral agreements) could a decision on Horizon be taken, said Sefcovic.Meanwhile, Swiss universities could still participate in joint projects with EU universities as part of the Horizon programme, but they could not receive any EU funding, Sefcovic stressed.What comes next?From the EU point of view, a meeting in Davos in January should focus minds and hopefully offer a way forward. Brussels insists that the only relationship available is the one negotiated for seven years that should have resulted in a framework agreement.“EU-Swiss relations deserve better than the lack of prospects,” Sefcovic said, noting that the EU was Switzerland’s largest trading partner and Switzerland was EU’s fourth-largest.“What we need from Switzerland now is the unambiguous political will to engage with us.”From the Swiss perspective, things are unlikely to move forward that fast. Speaking to journalists after the meeting, Cassis said the talks were “frank and fair”. He had previously suggested that no new deal could be negotiated with the EU before 2024 — a year after federal elections.When asked about that timeframe, Sefcovic replied that would be “too late for the European Commission”.
189  If EU lawmakers were at risk of forgetting that their bloc can be a regulatory superpower, Frances Haugen was quick to remind them. Testifying to the European Parliament last week, the former Facebook data engineer turned whistleblower said: “The Digital Services Act [DSA] that is now before this Parliament has the potential to be a global gold standard. It can inspire other countries including [the US] to pursue new rules that would safeguard our democracies.”That was not the only event last week that illustrated what is at stake in the EU’s push to regulate Big Tech. Two days later, the European Commission won a legal victory against Google. The EU court upheld the €2.4bn fine Brussels had imposed on the tech giant for abusing its market power in search by favouring its own shopping comparison against rival websites. That is precisely the sort of behaviour to be regulated by a proposed new Digital Markets Act [DMA], the companion bill to the DSA.The antitrust verdict “is a major win for EU competition authorities”, says Francesca Bria, president of the Italian National Innovation Fund and innovation adviser to the commission. “Politically it is very important for [competition] commissioner [Margrethe] Vestager, and the DMA is empowered by this judgment.” It proves that Vestager’s policies can withstand court challenges — all the more significant as more antitrust cases are in the pipeline, and Vestager’s prestige had suffered a blow when she lost a high-profile subsidy case about Apple’s tax breaks in Ireland.The content of the ruling supports the commission’s “mantra that ‘self-preferencing’ in digital markets is harmful, that informed the last decade of antitrust action in Brussels”, says Bria. The court will have emboldened this thinking and its justification for more restrictive rules on internet “gatekeepers” in the proposed DMA.As for the Haugen hearing, Christel Schaldemose, an MEP and DSA negotiator for the centre-left group in the European Parliament, says: “I honestly thought having Frances Haugen [testify] would ease the talks [in Parliament]. But when I try to negotiate.it is difficult for me to see it reflected” in what parliamentarians manage to agree.Divisions among party groups include whether targeted advertising should be limited and how to reform exemptions from liability. Still, “I do see progress. We are moving in the right direction,” says Schaldemose.Compromise is emerging between member states as well. One point of contention has been whether digital services should still be regulated by the “country of origin” — where the service provider is based. Some worry that states hosting global tech companies’ EU operations — Ireland is frequently mentioned — are unable or unwilling to hold them to account. Similar concerns are heard in the Parliament. “We cannot repeat what has happened with GDPR,” says Schaldemose, referring to Dublin’s lagging enforcement of EU privacy rules on the US tech giants based there.Member state ambassadors have agreed a compromise version of the DMA and should soon achieve one for the DSA, in which the commission will get direct enforcement powers over the biggest tech companies. By the end of the year both the Council (representing governments) and the Parliament could have adopted their preferred versions, setting the scene for talks between the institutions.There is no time to lose, says Bria: “After 20 years of Big Tech dominance there is an emergency, competition has been killed and the industry moves very fast.” But she worries current drafts do not do enough to limit market power. For example, “the DMA without integrating merger control to deal with killer acquisitions [absorbing rivals that pose a competitive threat] loses efficacy.” Schaldemose points out that public opinion largely supports holding Big Tech accountable for online harm. The question is how — and the answers will reverberate beyond Europe. The US government has reportedly warned EU authorities against data-sharing rules that would hurt its tech companies’ dominant position.“This is the time for EU policymakers to show real leadership,” says Bria. Whether they do will shape the digital world for decades.
190  Last spring, US officials thought they had helped prevent a major geopolitical flare-up when Russia’s President Vladimir Putin ordered tens of thousands of troops he had massed near the Ukrainian border from as far as Siberia to stand down.In recent weeks, however, it has become clear that much of the Russian forces had remained within striking distance of the Ukrainian border and had resumed their build-up, amid undisclosed additional intelligence that would support the assumption Moscow is planning an invasion, western officials say.US intelligence assessments suggest a “high probability” that Russia may be planning further military aggression against the country, according to Ukraine’s deputy defence minister. While Ukraine and other western allies have yet to reach a definitive conclusion, Washington’s warning has raised the level of alert to its highest since 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula from Kyiv.The resurgent risk of military invasion in the heart of Europe underlines the failure of diplomatic Franco-German efforts under the so-called Normandy format to find a peaceful solution to the conflict that has been raging in eastern Ukraine over the past seven years.“It’s become clear in the last half-year that there won’t be any more negotiations according to the old models,” said Fyodor Lukyanov, a Russian foreign policy analyst and adviser to the Kremlin. “If those formats disappear, then a legal vacuum appears amid a serious, unresolved conflict which carries high risks that direct clashes might resume.”Ukraine says Russia is massing as many as 114,000 troops to the north, east, and south of the Donbass, a mostly Russian-speaking region where Russian-backed separatists have fought government forces since a pro-western revolution in Kyiv in 2014.More than 14,000 people have died in the conflict despite a 2015 peace agreement struck in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, between Putin and the then leaders of Ukraine, France and Germany. Russia denies it is a party to the conflict but has provided the separatists with troops, equipment, and logistical support throughout and continues to lead their forces, according to western governments.The renewed tensions are threatening to scupper an outreach between the US and Russia that began when US President Joe Biden told Putin to stand back from the Ukrainian border in April, culminating in the two leaders’ meeting in Geneva in June.Since then, the two countries have held closed-door meetings where they have made tentative progress on issues including nuclear arms control, Iran’s nuclear ambitions and cyber security, according to people briefed on the talks in Moscow and Washington. Tensions over Ukraine are threatening to erase whatever gains have been achieved.“If renewed Russian military intervention in Ukraine were to happen, God forbid, most of the Biden team’s efforts to stabilise US-Russian relations would go out the window,” said Andrew Weiss, a vice-president at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and former Russia director at the US National Security Council.Putin told state television at the weekend that Moscow was concerned about unannounced Nato drills in the Black Sea, which he said presented a “serious challenge” for Russia.Moscow is also concerned that the Ukrainian military may be planning to retake Donbass. The once-ragtag force that failed to repel a vastly superior Russian-led contingent in the early years of the war has made major technological advances thanks to western support.In particular, Putin has protested against Ukraine’s acquisition of Bayraktar drones from Turkey, which have helped inflict battlefield defeats on its allies in Syria, Libya, and Nagorno-Karabakh. Russia has complained about criminal charges brought by Ukrainian authorities against pro-Russian politician Viktor Medvedchuk.“Putin’s obsession with Ukraine reflects the fact this is important unfinished business for him,” Weiss said. “And he surely has registered on the fact that Ukraine looks more and more like a Nato aircraft carrier park just outside the Russian heartland. He also understands that the west is continuing to pour money and resources into the upgrading of Ukraine’s military, intelligence, cyber, and political subversion capabilities and has no intention of putting those efforts on hold simply to mollify Russian concerns.”Underpinning Moscow’s hostility is a sense that negotiations with Ukraine under President Volodymyr Zelensky have reached a dead end. Putin and his senior officials have claimed that Kyiv had become so subservient to US influence as to make talks worthless.Meanwhile, the Kremlin has made it clear that Ukraine’s centuries of imperial and cultural ties to Russia made the issue existential.In July, Putin wrote a 5,000-word article about the “historical unity” of the two countries in which he cast aspersions on Ukraine’s borders and said Moscow would never let it become an “anti-Russia”.“Putin doesn’t think Ukraine’s a country — it’s a territory under external management by foreign forces,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of political consultancy R. Politik. “He thinks you need to talk to the Americans so they recognise Ukraine as a Russian zone of influence and let us do whatever we deem necessary there.”However, as long as Ukraine remains a higher priority for the Kremlin than for the White House, Russia appears prepared to escalate more than the US can do in response.“There’s no appetite to take the Kremlin on because that requires a significant investment in time and resources and they would rather be using those resources on the China challenge,” said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a former senior US intelligence officer.“The White House is trying to create time and space to see where talks can go. But the pressure is slowly mounting, and my sense is in this [diplomatic] mix of engagement and confrontation they need to skew more towards confrontation.”
191  Boris Johnson has warned that the EU faces “a choice” between “sticking up for Ukraine” and approving the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, amid fears that Russia is preparing for a possible invasion of the eastern European country.Hanna Maliar, Kyiv’s deputy defence minister, told the Financial Times over the weekend that western intelligence suggested a “high probability of destabilisation” of Ukraine by Russia as soon as this winter after Moscow massed more than 90,000 troops at its border.Construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will carry Russian gas directly across the Baltic Sea to Germany, was delayed by US sanctions and is strongly opposed by eastern European countries such as Poland, which believe it is designed to starve Ukraine of transit fees for shipping Russian gas.Ukrainian officials also fear the alternative gas route to western Europe could make it easier for Russia to invade the country, where it has supported proxy fighters in the eastern Donbass region since 2014, the same year it annexed Crimea from the country.Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, said in an interview with the Financial Times: “For us Nord Stream 2 is a security issue. We think that the use of migrants by Belarus, the situation around Nord Stream 2, the disinformation campaigns, the military build-up by Russia, are all part of a broader picture. Russia is involved in all of these situations.”In a speech at the Guildhall, London, on Monday evening, Johnson, the UK’s prime minister, said: “When we say that we support the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine that is not because we want to be adversarial to Russia, or that we want in some way strategically to encircle or undermine that great country.“It is because we have a commitment to democracy and freedom that is shared now across the vast mass of the European continent. And when our Polish friends asked for our help to deal with a contrived crisis on their border with Belarus, we were quick to respond.“And we hope that our friends may recognise that a choice is shortly coming between mainlining ever more Russian hydrocarbons in giant new pipelines and sticking up for Ukraine and championing the cause of peace and stability, let me put it that way.”Liz Truss, UK foreign secretary, has also called on Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, to intervene in the mounting migrant crisis on the Belarus-Poland border.The UK has accused Alexander Lukashenko, Belarus’s authoritarian leader, of orchestrating a crisis by funnelling thousands of migrants from the Middle East to Belarus’s borders with the EU and encouraging them to enter the bloc illegally.Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, Truss urged “friends across Europe” to stand together in opposing the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. “It risks undermining European security by allowing Russia to tighten its grip on those nations who rely on its gas,” she wrote.The comments from Johnson and Truss mark a hardening in tone towards the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project from the UK amid a gas supply crunch that has threatened the economic recovery from the pandemic, forced many UK energy suppliers out of business and fed into fears of a growing “cost of living” crisis.Eastern European legislators have blamed tight gas supplies this winter on Russia restricting exports to western Europe in order to press Germany to accelerate the pipeline’s start-up following completion of construction in September.The UK government has offered little direct opposition to the pipeline in the past and has argued that the UK is not reliant on gas imports from Russia, although it has conceded that it is exposed to “volatile” global gas markets. The UK does import gas from the EU, which gets up to 40 per cent of its supplies from Russia.Speaking after the COP26 agreement was watered down in the final minutes at the weekend, Johnson said: “I know how frustrating it was — as we stood on the verge of agreeing to phase out coal — to see that commitment weakened. But I tell you this: I have been watching politics a long time now and I know when a tipping point is reached.“The language does matter but whether you are talking about phasing down or phasing out, the day is now not far off when it will be as politically unacceptable, anywhere in the world, to open a new coal-fired power station as it now is to get on an aeroplane and light a cigar.”
192  Russia will face “serious consequences” if it threatens Ukraine’s territorial integrity, Paris and Berlin have warned, as ministers held meetings to discuss the threat posed by a build-up of troops on the country’s border.In a joint statement, Heiko Maas and Jean-Yves Le Drian, the foreign ministers of Germany and France, pledged “unwavering support for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine” after meeting their counterpart from Kyiv.Their words came after Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary-general, called on Moscow to ease tensions with Ukraine and be transparent about its military activities as he warned of “unusual concentrations” of Russian troops near the country’s borders.The US briefed allies last week on intelligence indicating Moscow was preparing for a possible invasion of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, has dismissed the fears as “alarmist” and accused Nato of inflaming tensions in the region with its own unplanned exercises.In a telephone conversation with Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, on Monday, Putin said the naval exercises in the Black Sea were “provocative” and accused Ukraine of “destructive” military activity in the Donbass region that he said was “designed to break the Minsk accords”.Both sides agreed the conflict in the Donbass was “getting even worse,” according to a Kremlin readout of the call.Kyiv estimates Russia has deployed as many as 114,000 personnel to the north, east and south of Ukraine — including about 92,000 ground soldiers and the rest in air and sea military forces, Kyrylo Budanov, chief of Ukraine’s military intelligence, has told the Financial Times.Speaking to the FT on Monday evening, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, said he expected the country’s allies to begin working on “deterrence” measures aimed at dissuading Putin from taking any military action. He declined to give details.“I’m afraid that a simple expression of concern does not convince Russia, and does not make it behave less aggressively,” he said in an interview following meetings in Brussels. “Everything that can strengthen Ukraine’s capacity to defend itself and demotivate Russia from resorting to military actions is on the table.”Earlier on Monday, Maas said Germany was making it clear to Russia on all diplomatic levels “that we are seeing [the troop build-up on Ukraine’s borders] and that this cannot be the start of a new escalation”.Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, spoke about it “very clearly” on a phone call with Putin, Maas said.Stoltenberg said Nato’s support to Ukraine was “not a threat to Russia” and said exercises by the alliance and its allies in the Black Sea region were “defensive and transparent”.However, Moscow accused the US and its allies of “negative bravado” over the situation in Ukraine. Sergei Ryabkov, deputy foreign minister, told news agency Tass on Monday: “There are fewer and fewer grains of any kind of reason left. It’s full of provocative rhetoric against us and its content is also extremely provocative.”EU foreign ministers met in Brussels on Monday where they also discussed the situation on the eastern border of the EU.The union has accused the regime of Belarus president Alexander Lukashenko of seeking intentionally to attract migrants to its borders as part of a plan to destabilise the EU in retaliation for its support for the political opposition of the country.Asked if there was any connection between Russia’s activities near Ukraine and the situation in Belarus, which has been backed by Russia, Josep Borrell, the EU’s top diplomat, declined to draw any conclusions. “It’s clear Lukashenko is doing what he is doing because he has the strong support of Russia,” he said.
193  The EU is to target airlines, travel agencies and individuals in Belarus involved in an “illegal push of migrants”, the EU’s top diplomat Josep Borrell said on Monday, amid a growing humanitarian crisis that the EU says has been orchestrated by Minsk.Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, also spoke directly to Alexander Lukashenko, Belarus’s president, as part of efforts to defuse the crisis on the EU’s eastern border. It was the first time a western leader had spoken to the Belarusian leader since he began his brutal crackdown against his dubious re-election in August last year.EU foreign ministers agreed on Monday to impose further sanctions against Belarus, which they accuse of intentionally attracting migrants to its borders as part of a plan to destabilise the bloc in retaliation for its support for the Belarusian political opposition. About 33 individuals and businesses will be targeted, according to diplomats.Ireland has also agreed to measures affecting its own aircraft-leasing industry, ordering companies to recall 17 aircraft belonging to Belavia, the Belarusian state airline ferrying many of the migrants to Minsk.Simon Coveney, Ireland’s foreign minister, said: “That is a consequence for us but that is absolutely the right thing to do. The contracts under which they are leased to Belavia will essentially be cut and these planes will have to be returned, or I presume legal action will be taken.”The EU is “doing what it can to put as much pressure as we can” on Lukashenko, he added. Dublin has been under pressure to ground the planes for several weeks. Belavia has about 30 aircraft.Most of the migrants trying to enter the EU from Belarus are from the Middle East. On Monday, Iraq said it would organise a first repatriation flight this week for Iraqi migrants stuck on the Belarus-Poland border.Iraq’s foreign ministry said the country would offer a voluntary evacuation flight back to Baghdad on Thursday.Monday’s call between Merkel and Lukashenko came after talks on Sunday between Borrell and Vladimir Makei, Belarus’s foreign minister.The Kremlin said that Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, had spoken to Lukashenko and Merkel in the hope that they would then speak to each other.Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, also discussed ways to de-escalate the crisis with Putin on Monday, Paris said.Lukashenko, who refused to discuss the post-election crackdown with Merkel last year, has repeatedly said that the EU should negotiate with him directly to end the crisis.Direct flights from Baghdad to Minsk were suspended in August. Travel via Turkey was halted on Friday for citizens of Iraq, Yemen and Syria. A private Syrian airline suspended flights on Saturday. Travel via Dubai was shut to migrants on Monday.The measures undertaken so far have reduced the number of migrants arriving in Belarus, Borrell said on Monday.Monday’s sanctions add to those already imposed on officials in Belarus over last year’s crackdown and the forced landing of a Ryanair flight in Minsk in May.Lukashenko has previously threatened to respond to sanctions by suspending gas transit to Europe.But Russia, which supplies the gas, has said it will not redirect flows, adding that any such move by Minsk would damage relations between the two allies. Moscow also denied having anything to do with the migrant crisis.In Belarus, migrants are living in makeshift tent camps and huts, alongside a barbed wire fence guarded by thousands of Polish soldiers and police.But despite the freezing conditions, many say they will not return home.On Monday, several hundred migrants gathered at the border crossing between Belarus and Poland near the village of Kuznica. Polish police said the migrants had been led there by Belarusian forces who had falsely told them that they would be picked up and taken to Germany.“It looks like preparations for yet another attempt to cross the Polish border by force,” Stanislaw Zaryn, spokesman for the minister co-ordinating Poland’s security services, wrote on Twitter.
194  Seven months ago, Russia amassed more than 100,000 troops on the borders of Ukraine in deeply threatening manoeuvres. After a flurry of diplomacy, some troops went home, but left behind much of their equipment; a summit between Vladimir Putin and US President Joe Biden later aimed to ease tensions. Now, Russian forces are gathering in Ukraine’s environs once more. Putin’s aims are alarmingly opaque. But the fact Europe is again witnessing the possibility of a large-scale invasion shows the urgency of finding ways both to deter renewed Russian aggression, and to strengthen the continent’s longer-term security.Ukraine’s borderlands are not the only current theatre of instability in Europe. Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus is using vulnerable migrants as pawns on the Polish frontier. Tensions are stirring in the Balkans. Moscow is exploiting a gas supply squeeze. Some western officials see Russia’s hands in all these occurrences, in a co-ordinated move to destabilise the continent, or to distract from its intentions in Ukraine.Russian forces, reportedly positioned this time not just east but north of Ukraine, might yet return to barracks. Citing undisclosed intelligence, however, western diplomats warn of a high risk of escalation during the winter. Putin chafes over failures to implement the 2015 Minsk II accord, which would in effect give the breakaway, Russian-backed “republics” of eastern Ukraine a veto over further Ukrainian integration into the west. One possibility is that, as he did through military action before Minsk, Russia’s president is seeking to strengthen his hand in further negotiations, by sabre-rattling — or by changing facts on the ground.Such uncertainty underlines the reality that Europe is, in many ways, more dangerous today than in the Cold War. Much of the continent then was divided into two camps. “Red lines” were clear, the consequences of breaching them known to be cataclysmic.Today, a new category of “in-between” countries exists: ex-Soviet republics over which Moscow and the west jostle for influence. Red lines are hazy and shifting. A perilous ambiguity lurks over how the west would respond if Russia were to invade Ukraine, which is not a Nato member. But over the past two decades, the US and the EU have encouraged ex-Soviet states to democratise and partner more closely with north Atlantic institutions. They have a moral duty to support them, in word and deed, if Russia attempts to pull them back by intimidation or force.While China’s rise is, no doubt, the key challenge of the 21st century, it is misguided to treat Russia as a second-order threat or make dubious concessions intended to placate Moscow so attention can be focused on Beijing. Joe Biden’s agreement with Germany’s Angela Merkel to allow Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to be completed was, in many ways, a betrayal of Kyiv.A second priority is a consistent US and European stance. The SPD, set to lead Germany’s incoming coalition, has long been dovish towards Moscow. But Berlin must show the same firmness as Paris has on this occasion. A package of deterrent steps — including the threat of financial sanctions and pledges of defensive weaponry to Kyiv — is needed to demonstrate to the Kremlin that further incursions into Ukraine would have an unacceptable cost.Experience from 2014-15, when Russia and its proxies considered going further into Ukraine but stopped as sanctions mounted and the going proved unexpectedly tough, suggests Putin will push on until he is challenged. It is time to make clear that if he presses forward again, he will quickly meet resistance — in multiple forms.
195  The Dutch government has launched an eleventh-hour attempt to keep Shell in the Netherlands by seeking to abolish a controversial dividend tax cited by the energy group as a reason to unify its share structure and move its headquarters to the UK.Officials from the Dutch government told the Financial Times that the caretaker government of Mark Rutte was seeking to find a last-minute parliamentary majority to scrap a 15 per cent withholding tax that has long been a source of complaint for Shell and fellow Anglo-Dutch multinational Unilever.The political machinations come hours after Shell announced it would end its dual-share structure and shift its entire tax base to the UK. The Dutch government said the announcement was an “unwelcome surprise” and is scrambling to keep the company from leaving.This year, Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden cited the Netherlands’ failure to abolish the dividend tax as a potential reason for leaving the country. The UK is an exception among most European countries by not having a withholding dividend tax.The 15 per cent tax on Shell’s Dutch A shares in effect restricts share buybacks to its UK B shares, which are subject to no such levy. But Shell’s B share purchases each quarter are capped by regulators at 25 per cent of the average daily trading volume, or roughly $2.5bn.Under the plans, Shell will still be listed in Amsterdam, London and New York but with a single line of shares, widening the pool to which the 25 per cent cap is applied and so allowing it to boost its buybacks.Rutte’s coalition government promised in 2017 to scrap the 15 per cent withholding tax to make the country more business friendly, and encouraged Unilever and Shell to relocate entirely to the Netherlands.But the proposal was shelved after sparking political uproar among green and left parties, which objected to the government offering tax favours to multinationals worth about €1.9bn a year. Unilever announced last year it was moving its headquarters from Rotterdam to London.Dutch economy minister Stef Blok and tax minister Hans Vijlbrief will address MPs in parliament on Tuesday about their plans to scrap the tax.Shell has faced other problems in the Netherlands this year. In May, a court in The Hague ordered the company to make bigger and faster cuts to its carbon emissions than it had planned, a ruling against which the group is appealing. Last month, Dutch pension fund ABP said it was divesting from all fossil fuel companies, including a significant stake in Shell.The energy group is also under fire from US activist hedge fund Third Point, which after having built a large stake is calling for a split of the company, which it accuses it of being bogged down by an incoherent strategy.In announcing its planned move on Monday, Shell said it had always intended to simplify its share structure, a legacy of the 2005 merger of Koninklijke Nederlandsche Petroleum Maatschappij and the Shell Transport and Trading Company.Shell shareholders are set to vote on the company’s planned changes at a general meeting on December 10.The company declined to comment.
196  The parties expected to form Germany’s next government have put forward plans to tighten curbs on unvaccinated residents as coronavirus infection rates in the region climb.The plans from the centre-left Social Democrats, Greens and pro-business Free Democrats include proposals to restrict use of public transport. “This is actually a lockdown for the unvaccinated,” said Dirk Wiese, the deputy head of the SPD parliamentary group.The SPD, Greens and FDP are negotiating to form Germany’s next government to take over from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition and now have a combined majority in the Bundestag after September’s election.Like neighbouring Switzerland and Austria, Germany has some of the highest rates of unvaccinated residents in the EU. About 30 per cent of the population have not been inoculated against Covid-19.Under the parties’ proposal, anyone using buses or trains must provide proof of a negative test, vaccination or full recovery from Covid. They proposed similar restrictions in the workplace.It comes after Austria introduced its own stricter measures on the unvaccinated on Monday.Last week, Germany’s three coalition aspirants introduced a bill in parliament that would end the use of emergency powers to manage the pandemic and loosen restrictions. It also prevents states from shutting down hotels or businesses in their regions.But the proposal came under heavy criticism given the country’s sharp rise in Covid infections. The seven-day incidence rate on Monday reached its highest level of more than 300 per 100,000 people. Intensive care units are under increasing pressure and medics say about 90 per cent of those being treated are unvaccinated.In response, the coalition hopefuls proposed a package of amendments aimed at the unvaccinated, while also offering regional governments options for restricting public events in areas with high infection rates.FDP head Christian Lindner said the plan would strike a balance by allowing the vaccinated to maintain some normality. “Those who have been vaccinated must continue to have the opportunity for social life — anything else would be disproportionate,” he told broadcaster RTL.The makers of the Luca app, which has become the main contact tracing platform used in Germany, said that in October 72 per cent of warnings released on its app were from clubs and bars.On Monday, Germany’s president Frank-Walter Steinmeier asked the unvaccinated to get a jab, saying they were putting their own health and the wider public at risk. “If you are still hesitant about getting vaccinated, I want to ask you directly today: What still has to happen to convince you?” he said.In Austria, all those who have not received a double dose of vaccine or who have recovered from a proven infection of the virus have been ordered to stay at home. The unvaccinated are allowed to leave home once a day and for essential purposes, such as food shopping. The rule applies to those over the age of 12.Authorities warned of police checks and hefty fines of up to €3,600 for non-compliance. “Every citizen can expect to be checked,” said interior minister Karl Nehammer.Health authorities recorded 11,350 new infections on Sunday — making Austria now the worst country in Europe per capita for new coronavirus cases.Health minister Wolfgang Mückstein warned that the new measures were still unlikely to curb rising cases and said the government will announce stricter measures on Wednesday. Among the rules being considered is a 10pm curfew on venues such as bars and restaurants.The political backlash against the restrictions has been pronounced. The leader of Austria’s right wing populist Freedom Party, Herbert Kickl, condemned the restrictions against the unvaccinated as “Corona fascism.” On Monday, Kickl was himself confirmed to have been infected.
197  Shell’s decision to simplify its dual share structure and move its tax base and senior management from the Netherlands to the UK is a sensible strategic move that looks very much like a fit of pique.The company’s current set-up, with two lines of shares, dates back to 2005. Its Dutchness, though, goes back much further: to the merger of Royal Dutch Petroleum Company and the Shell Transport and Trading Company in 1907.However, a mere six months after it suffered a shock defeat in a Dutch court over its plans to cut emissions, the company is asking investors to bless a move to London, albeit one that leaves its shares trading in Amsterdam.The timing, then, is suspect. Shell says the motivation and logic for the move owes nothing to the Milieudefensie case outcome, which instructed the oil company to cut its emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 — a judgment that was immediately enforceable.True, it has adopted a target of cutting its direct emissions, or scope 1 and 2, by half in that timeframe. But it is contesting even a best efforts order to reduce the scope 3 emissions generated by customers burning its products by a similar amount.The restructuring, if approved, will have no impact on this case, or others under way. It could, however, make it less likely that future cases are heard in the Dutch courts, which after Milieudefensie and the Urgenda case against the Dutch government are seen as a favourable jurisdiction for environmental campaigners.Will that make a difference? Not hugely. “There is plenty of creative litigation brought in the UK courts as well,” notes Tessa Khan, a lawyer and the founder of climate campaigning group Uplift. This is now a global phenomenon. The cumulative number of climate change-related cases has more than doubled since 2015, according to analysis by the Grantham Research Institute, with the UK accounting for about 15 per cent of the cases identified outside of the US.Moreover, the UK has a government determined to be seen as a leader in climate transition that has already backtracked over approving the Whitehaven coal mine and is under pressure to reject Shell’s Cambo oil project off the coast of the Shetland Islands. Business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng may see Shell’s move as a “vote of confidence in the British economy”, as he tweeted on Monday, but he will have to fight the appearance of a quid pro quo on new oil and gas development.For all the disappointments of COP26, “global finance is aligning with a 1.5C world — even if it’s still trying to work out what that means”, says Tim Buckley, director of energy finance studies at IEEFA. The news flow from COP, such as the agreements to tackle methane, add up to a tougher time for oil and gas majors, says Buckley. “Investor pressure is only going to build.”The lesson of this year is that existing investors in oil and gas companies can be kept onside — for now — provided the cash from fossil fuel assets is flowing nicely and being returned to them in sufficient quantity. Shell’s restructuring ticks that box: it should double the company’s ability to buy back shares as it flogs assets.The company has also come under pressure from activist hedge fund Third Point to break up. But the reality is that its cleaner energy operations — currently tiny and cash negative — don’t currently merit that treatment. A simpler structure at least gives it more options around splits, spins, deals or fundraising in the future. Tacit acknowledgment perhaps that Shell is, one way or another, going to have to move much, much faster in its transition.
198  The chief executive of Germany’s biggest bank has called on central bankers to tighten monetary policy to provide “countermeasures” against surging inflation, which he warned was producing risky side effects and would last longer than policymakers expected.Deutsche Bank’s chief executive Christian Sewing said: “The supposed cure-all of the past years — low interest rates with seemingly stable prices — has lost its effect, now we are struggling with the side effects. Monetary policy must counteract this — and sooner rather than later.”Speaking at a conference in Frankfurt on Monday, he added: “The consequences of this ultra-loose monetary policy will become increasingly difficult to fix the longer central banks fail to take countermeasures.”Sewing is a longstanding critic of the European Central Bank’s use of negative interest rates to stimulate the economy.His comments reflect the aversion of many German banks to negative interest rates, which they argue have eroded their profit margins. They also highlight growing concern about the recent rise in German inflation to a three-decade high of 4.6 per cent in October.The $27tn rise in global government, corporate and household debt to $226tn last year, based on IMF figures, was “simply unsustainable in the long term and a constant potential trouble spot for the global financial markets”, Sewing warned.The head of Deutsche Bank, one of Europe’s biggest providers of services in debt markets, said: “The ultra-loose spending policies of many governments are only made possible by an equally generous monetary policy that drastically intervenes in pricing on the bond market.”He added: “But this, in turn, has considerable risks and side effects: inflation is on the rise around the world faster than any economist would have anticipated a year ago.”While many central banks around the world are tightening monetary policy by ending asset purchases and raising interest rates, the ECB is expected to continue buying bonds for at least another year and has insisted a rate rise is still a distant prospect.Christine Lagarde, president of the ECB, said on Monday that while rising inflation was a major concern for eurozone citizens, the “outlook for inflation over the medium term remains subdued”. She added in a speech to the European parliament that the conditions for the ECB to raise rates were “very unlikely to be satisfied next year”.In contrast, US Federal Reserve vice-chair Richard Clarida last week said the “necessary conditions” for US interest rates to rise from their current near-zero level will be met by the end of next year should the economy progress as expected.Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has also said the BoE “won’t bottle it” when it comes to potential rate rises, if the economy develops in line with its forecast.
199  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.A packed week is ahead of us, with foreign ministers gathering today to discuss a fresh batch of sanctions against the Belarusian regime and hold talks with their counterparts from other eastern neighbours, amid warnings from Ukraine that Russia is preparing another offensive. After the FT’s scoop on Friday on what the Belarus sanctions will entail, we’ll give you the rundown of what to expect today.On the Brexit front, fisheries ministers are also in Brussels today and will receive an update from the European Commission on the negotiations with the UK for the 2022 shared quotas — including the dispute with France over fishing rights.Having failed to come to a compromise with the European parliament last week, finance ministers are having another attempt today at pushing the bloc’s 2022 budget over the finish line.And the arrival of Santa Claus in Dutch-speaking cities took place over the weekend with a slight change to the character of ‘Black Pete’ following years of anti-racism protests over people wearing blackface. While the actors are now mostly smudging grey paint on their faces to suggest the character’s trip down the chimney, I’ll look at why activists remain unimpressed.EU’s foreign affairs councils are often a hand-wringing exercise, but today’s meetings about the eastern neighbourhood — notably on Belarus — will be more consequential than usual, write Mehreen Khan in Brussels and James Shotter in Warsaw.Foreign ministers today are expected to approve a new legal basis for a fifth round of sanctions against Minsk. As the FT wrote on Friday, more than two dozen Belarusian officials are likely to be added to the sanctions list, as well as Syrian airline Cham Wings for running flights to Belarus, Hotel Minsk for housing migrants in the country, and possibly Minsk airport.Diplomats said the final list of people and entities would take weeks to finalise as the EU co-ordinates the measures with the UK, Canada, and the US.EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said yesterday that foreign ministers are expected to approve the widening of the sanctions framework as part of measures to press authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko to stop the flow of migrants to Europe’s borders.Borrell said he had held a phone call with the Belarus foreign minister Vladimir Makei to raise the “precarious humanitarian situation” at the border with the EU. “The current situation is unacceptable and must stop. People should not be used as weapons,” he tweeted after the call. The Belarusian foreign ministry confirmed the call had taken place and said it was prepared for “mutually respectful dialogue” with the EU.Fears about the humanitarian situation at the border are only growing. Grupa Granica, a group of organisations helping migrants, said that those arriving at the Polish-Belarusian border were subject to disinformation by the Belarusians “who distribute forms which suggest the possibility of settlement in Poland or Germany”. The group added that it had also received information about attempts to force migrants to use violence against Polish forces guarding the border.Later today, ministers will also hold an exchange with their counterparts from the so-called Eastern Partnership countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine). Several of them have been experiencing various degrees of Russian pressure and are looking to the EU for help.Ukraine’s deputy defence minister told the FT that western intelligence suggests a “high probability of destabilisation” of the country by Russia as soon as this winter after Moscow massed more than 100,000 troops at its border.Moldova recently declared a state of emergency after being threatened by Russian state-owned group Gazprom to face a winter with no gas supplies. A new gas contract was signed only when the pro-EU government agreed to delay some EU-inspired reforms to the country’s energy market.Discussions with Georgian officials are likely to be difficult after the country’s former president Mikheil Saakashvili, a strong western ally, was recently taken to hospital while in detention and after files published in local media alleged the country’s secret services had spied on the EU ambassador.Tomorrow, foreign ministers will be joined by defence ministers and Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg to discuss the EU’s new ‘strategic concept’ (We wrote about it here).In recent weeks, Covid-19 cases in Europe have risen to their highest 14-day rolling average for nine months, casting doubts over the region’s economic recovery. While some countries, including Austria and the Netherlands are reimposing lockdowns for the unvaccinated and limiting the opening hours of shops, economists are confident that full-blown lockdowns as seen in 2020 can be avoided.Ten years after the start of a campaign dubbed “Kick out Black Pete”, cities in the Netherlands and Belgium this weekend celebrated the arrival of Santa Claus together with his medieval-era-costumed helpers, who are now in large part rebranded as “Sooty Pete” or just “Pete”.Wearing blackface for Zwarte Piet, complete with curly black wigs and golden ear hoops is still considered an untouchable tradition in rightwing nativist circles (the party of Geert Wilders, for instance here). Pro-Black Pete demonstrators in past years have clashed violently with protesters who say Black Pete is a racist symbol.But after last year’s Black Lives Matter protests in Amsterdam and other major Dutch cities, Prime Minister Mark Rutte has acknowledged publicly that the Black Pete tradition needs to change, and that he himself has been ignorant as to how hurtful this symbol can be to adults and children of colour.Local authorities in major Dutch cities and in the Belgian port of Antwerp have now changed tack and insist the celebrations only include helpers with grey, “soot”-smudged faces.A survey conducted by the Dutch paper AD found that more than 120 municipalities in the Netherlands were using ‘Sooty Petes’, 32 said they were using a mix of both blackface and sooty face; and only 10 said they were hanging on to Black Pete. Just four years ago, nearly 250 Dutch municipalities said they were sticking with Black Pete for the official events.Nevertheless, about 100 anti-racism protesters gathered in the Dutch city of Breda, chanting “Kick Out Black Pete”. Jerry Afriyie, co-founder of the campaign, who was arrested in 2011 when he first protested peacefully against the tradition, said some progress had been made in the decade since. “But we are not there yet,” he told reporters in Bredaand later this week
200  Companies in Portugal will be forbidden from contacting employees outside working hours and must meet their extra energy and communications costs under one of Europe’s most employee-friendly laws for regulating homeworking.The law, due to come into force in the coming weeks, seeks to uphold the rights of remote workers and protect their family lives after the pandemic triggered a shift to working from home.“Remote working has great advantages provided we control the disadvantages,” Ana Mendes Godinho, labour minister, told Lisbon’s Web Summit this month. “The pandemic accelerated the need to regulate what already needed to be regulated.”The law was one of the last pieces of legislation to be approved by Portugal’s minority socialist government, with the support of the anti-capitalist Left Bloc, before a political crisis triggered an election two years ahead of schedule.Under the new regulations, employers who fail to “abstain from contacting” workers outside working hours will be guilty of a serious breach of labour law, except in emergencies.The Confederation of Farmers has criticised the new law for being too hasty a response to pandemic, saying that preventing employers from having any contact with workers outside working hours is an “unreasonable” reaction to the problems caused by coronavirus.To protect privacy, companies will also be prohibited from monitoring home workers in any way. Remote working must be by mutual agreement between employer and employee and based on contracts setting out the hours and location of the work, the law states. Workers can refuse to work at home without giving reasons, but companies must justify in writing why they cannot satisfy an employee’s request to work remotely.Parents or carers looking after children up to eight years old will have the right to work at home without seeking their employer’s agreement, provided their job is compatible with remote working. If both parents are eligible, they are required to alternate periods of homeworking. Businesses with fewer than 10 workers, however, will be exempt from the more stringent rules.Employers will be required to meet the additional costs remote workers incur at home, including communications, energy and equipment maintenance, and any upgrades to their internet connections required for work. Some lawyers have expressed concern over how these costs will be calculated.Under the law, no discrimination is allowed between remote and other workers in terms of holidays, careers, training, health and insurance provisions. Companies will also be expected to organise regular face-to-face meetings to help prevent remote workers from feeling isolated.As well as protecting workers, the new rules are designed to make Portugal more attractive to so-called digital nomads, and will add to existing tax breaks designed to attract tech entrepreneurs and other potential investors.“People can both live in Portugal and work for the best companies in the world,” said Mendes Godinho.
201  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
202  Restrictions on movement to contain a surge in new coronavirus cases across the EU are expected to have a milder impact on growth than during previous waves because they target a smaller section of the population: the unvaccinated.Last winter, the eurozone was plunged back into recession when output contracted for two consecutive quarters after a wave of infections prompted authorities to reimpose strict rules limiting people’s movement.In recent weeks, Covid-19 cases in Europe have risen to their highest 14-day rolling average for nine months and in some countries — including Germany, Austria and the Netherlands — have hit record levels. This has cast doubts over the region’s economic recovery.But economists say a return to strict lockdowns is unlikely now that almost two-thirds of the EU population has been fully vaccinated, which has meant death rates and intensive care occupancy levels have not increased at the same rate as infections.By focusing many of the latest restrictions on unvaccinated people, they believe authorities can avoid crippling the economy again, while also encouraging those who are hesitant to finally get the jab. On Sunday, Alexander Schallenberg, Austria’s chancellor, confirmed that the federal government was imposing a nationwide lockdown on those who have not been jabbed, effective from Monday, adding: “We must raise the vaccination rate. It is shamefully low.” Katharina Utermöhl, economist at Allianz, said of the likely economic impact of the new Covid-19 wave on Europe’s economy: “At this stage we expect a dent in consumption but not a derailment.“It will be a terrible year again for [in-store] Christmas retail sales, but a lot of that will move online and we think restaurants, travel and accommodation will continue to do better.”Shops, eateries and leisure venues have experienced a fall in customers since the latest Covid-19 surge. Footfall in eurozone retail and recreation recently fell back below pre-pandemic levels, while remaining well above the last winter’s lows, according to Google Mobility data.This has contributed to an overall downgrading of short-term growth expectations for the eurozone economy in the final months of 2021. But most economists predict the economy will slow rather than contract. The European Commission last week forecast eurozone growth would dip from 2.3 per cent in the third quarter to 0.8 per cent in the final quarter.Economists believe the main causes of the slowdown are the supply chain bottlenecks that are throttling manufacturing output and a sharp rise in inflation that is eroding people’s disposable income. Eurozone inflation hit a 13-year high of 4.1 per cent in October.“I don’t think restaurants will be half-empty again, as the virus is only going to have a modest impact,” said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg. “The biggest downside risk to growth is the supply chain.”He said the surge in new virus cases — and rules being introduced in some countries restricting unvaccinated people’s access to many venues and activities — could have a “self-correcting” effect by encouraging more people to get inoculated.Parts of Austria and Germany have limited access to restaurants, gyms, cinemas and sports arenas to people who have been vaccinated or who have immunity after recovering from the virus — excluding those with a recent negative test who had previously been granted access.The Netherlands plans to adopt a similar “2G regime” after a three-week limited lockdown in which many public events and leisure venues are forced to close and restaurants and non-essential shops are made to shut by early evening.“Tonight we are bringing a very unpleasant message with very unpleasant and far-reaching measures,” said Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, on Friday. “The virus is everywhere again, and must therefore be fought everywhere.”Austria’s Schallenberg said the restrictions meant that the third of the country’s population who had held out against being inoculated could expect Christmas to be “uncomfortable”. “I don’t see why two-thirds of the population should lose their freedom because another third hesitates,” he added.After new coronavirus cases in Europe hit a record high of 2m last week, German chancellor Angela Merkel said she was “very worried” and urged the third of Germany’s population who had not been vaccinated to “think again”. Merkel and regional leaders will discuss potential nationwide measures to tackle the virus on Thursday.In France, coronavirus cases jumped 40 per cent last week — described as a “warning sign” by President Emmanuel Macron. But Anne-Sophie Alsif, chief economist at the BDO France consultancy, said the recovery would “stay very strong this year and in 2022 because household consumption remains so high, and investment and exports are doing well”.Denmark, which in September became one of the first EU countries to lift all coronavirus curbs, on Friday reintroduced its Covid-19 passport for entry to many indoor spaces and events.But Helge Pedersen, chief economist at Nordea, said he did not expect this would have a “big impact” because most of the population was vaccinated and Denmark had a large testing capacity.Christian Fürtjes, economist at HSBC, said a recent stabilisation of infection numbers at high levels in the UK, where the latest wave of the virus started earlier than in most of Europe, suggested a similar stabilisation could occur in the continent soon.“If that happens then most governments will be very cautious about reimposing strict lockdowns, because they fear the harsh economic impact and they know most people are sick of these restrictions.” 
203  According to ETFGI, a London-based consultancy, about 70 per cent of ETF trades in Europe are currently executed on so-called Request for Quote (RFQ) venues, or in other OTC transactions. By contrast, in the US the majority of ETFs are traded on-exchange.To some, limiting on-exchange ETF trading in this way reduces the temptation to buy and sell too frequently, and incur extra costs. “I’m not sure whether promoting trading ETFs directly via exchanges encourages positive self-directed investor behaviour,” argues Monika Dutt, director of Emea passive strategies research at Morningstar. She points out that John Bogle, who founded Vanguard and championed the use of low-cost index funds, did not like ETFs. “He thought that the wrapper could potentially encourage unnecessary trading activity within the retail segment,” Dutt explains.Even when retail investors’ trading decisions are right, dealing on-exchange in Europe may not be the best way to execute them.James McManus, chief investment officer at Nutmeg — a UK platform that specialises in low-cost portfolios — points out that his company is able to trade OTC as an institutional investor, and therefore access better pricing.“That’s part of the benefit we are bringing our clients — economies of scale in the way that we trade means they benefit from savings relative to the cost on the exchange as a retail investor,” he says. “So we offer retail investors an opportunity to access the institutional terms.”McManus explains there are many ways to trade OTC, including via RFQ platforms, and that Nutmeg will pick the right strategy for the individual circumstance. “Clearly, a key benefit of going OTC is that the European market place is fragmented and liquidity is split across many stock exchanges in different locations,” he says. “That means, by using an OTC liquidity provider, you can benefit from their perspective of liquidity across European exchanges, rather than simply the liquidity available on one exchange alone.”However, to others — such as Lida Eslami, head of exchange traded products business development at the London Stock Exchange Group — there are clear advantages to trading on-exchange.“When trading off-exchange, market participants have to ask themselves if they’ve done adequate pre and post-trade analysis to understand if the broader market could have offered a better price,” she says. Another benefit of on-exchange trading is anonymity, which encourages real competition on pricing, Eslami adds. In addition to that, on-exchange trading ensures the aggregation of liquidity from different providers and central clearing of trades, she says. Stefan Kaba-Ferreiro, head of trading and managing partner at GHCO, an ETF market maker, agrees that on-exchange trading offers advantages. He says GHCO’s “mission” is to drive more and more price discovery to the exchanges.“Shifting ETF trading away from request for quote (RFQ) platforms to exchanges will mean there’s a clearer picture of the true liquidity available,” Kaba-Ferreiro claims. Even so, like McManus, he acknowledges that the situation in Europe poses particular challenges because trading is split across various exchanges without a consolidated “tape” of trades. He says there is also a lack of trust among brokers, who worry that they will not get liquidity on exchange. “If you know the majority of the trading will not happen on exchange, as a market maker, why would you show your hand?” Kaba-Ferreiro asks.Nonetheless, Kaba-Ferreiro and Eslami believe the European market is maturing. ETP trading accounted for a record 12.4 per cent of order book volume on the LSE last year, up from 8.7 per cent in 2019. Eslami says the exchange has maintained those levels.“2020 was a very strong year for ETP trading turnover on exchange and we’ve sustained these volumes throughout 2021,” Eslami says. “In times of uncertainty, the market gravitated to on-exchange trading.” Kaba-Ferreiro says he expects a move to on-exchange trading to continue as demand increases from self-directed retail investors. “Younger generations are learning fast, taking control of their investments and embracing efficiency and low cost,” he observes. “They don’t want to have to call anyone to send an order, or wait to see the execution. They want direct access, transparency and instantaneous reporting. I definitely think you will see more volume come to exchange and spreads [buying and selling costs] will get tighter.”
204  Beijing has accused the EU of risking damage to world supply chains by throwing up regulatory and trade hurdles to foreign businesses, warning “discriminatory” practices could strain the global recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.The Chinese ambassador to the EU said the European Commission’s drive to sharpen its trade toolkit was seen by some businesses as heralding “more inward-looking and unilateral measures” and the creation of “new trade barriers”. “The moves taken by the EU will also have global consequences, and such moves might create further stress to the global supply and industry chain,” said Zhang Ming in an interview with the Financial Times.The ambassador also attacked a recent EU-US deal on steel and aluminium tariffs that seeks to restrict imports from more carbon-intensive producers including China, saying it would “aggravate the tension” in industrial supplies and worsen inflationary pressures.The EU is engaged in what some member states argue is a long overdue effort to bolster its economic self-reliance and respond to unfair trade and investment practices spearheaded by Beijing, such as preferential treatment for state-owned enterprises and forced technology transfers. Among the lengthening list of EU tools are an anti-subsidy instrument, sharpened trade defences and a proposed due diligence mechanism aimed at unearthing labour and environmental abuses in supply chains.The EU in September inaugurated a new Trade and Technology Council in a bid to deepen co-operation with the US in cutting-edge sectors, such as semiconductors and green technology.Zhang declared the EU’s push for strategic autonomy was “in line” with the union’s status as a global power and said that Beijing supported the initiative. But foreign enterprises argued a number of EU policies could have unwelcome side-effects, he said. “They cannot help with the stability of global supply and industrial chains after the pandemic as well as the world economic recovery at large.”He called on the EU to stick to World Trade Organization rules, contending that unilateral measures would distort investment in Europe and increase prices. “Such moves deviate from the original goals of trade and economic policies and are also a distortion of market principles,” said Zhang.In the view of some businesses, he said, “there has been an increasing amount of tailor-made tools targeting other countries and their enterprises. These tools are discriminatory and are also a violation of the market principle of fairness and justice.”The EU has been divided over how hard it should push back against the Chinese Communist party’s aggressive model of state capitalism, as it seeks to position itself between the US and China.After concluding an investment agreement last December, Brussels put it on ice this year after Beijing imposed sanctions on several members of the European parliament. That followed EU sanctions responding to the treatment of Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang.Zhang said China was ready to implement the investment deal, accusing Europe of being the obstacle to ratification. The EU should not permit “political manipulation” to get in the way, he said. “We stand ready to co-operate with partners from the European side to explore possible approaches to achieve the ratification of the agreement.”Nato has also hardened its rhetoric on China in recent months, describing the country as a “systemic challenge”. Its secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg has said countering security threats from China will be an important part of the western alliance’s future rationale.Zhang said China hoped that Nato “can stay within its traditional areas of functions and geographical parameters”, adding: “Do not cross the boundary with China as an excuse.” What the international community should worry about, he continued, was the Aukus defence pact between the US, Australia and the UK. “It has the potential to intensify the risks of nuclear proliferation and might lead to a new arms race,” he said. “It is not in the benefit of global and regional peace and stability.”Asked about US analysis suggesting China is seeking to quadruple its nuclear arsenal, Zhang pointed to the huge size of the American stockpile, saying it was 20 times as large. He also dismissed reports of Chinese tests of a nuclear-capable hypersonic weapon, saying the tests were to verify reusable spacecraft. “We will not pour resources into an unnecessary arms race.”
205  Bulgarians gave an unexpected election boost on Sunday to a new centrist political force, We Continue the Change (PP), which could end a political stalemate that all but paralysed government in the Balkan nation and left it exposed to the world’s deadliest coronavirus wave in recent weeks.After the country’s third parliamentary vote this year, exit polls showed PP with about a quarter of the ballots — level with the centre-right Gerb party of Boyko Borisov. The former prime minister was ousted in April after growing popular protests against corruption during his decade-plus in power.The so-called protest parties and traditional opposition forces were unable to agree a coalition in April and new groups such as chalga singer Slavi Trifonov’s There is Such a People again failed to set up a government after winning elections in July.The poor EU nation of 7m people has struggled to raise the bloc’s lowest vaccination rate against coronavirus, with still fewer than a third of Bulgarians fully vaccinated while a Delta-variant new wave has led to the world’s highest mortality rate.That gave extra momentum to PP, founded by Kiril Petkov and Asen Vasilev, two Harvard graduates who served in the caretaker government nominated by President Rumen Radev and made a name for decisive action, especially against corruption.Radev also won the first round of a concurrent presidential election on Sunday, exit polls showed, although a run-off for the largely ceremonial role is likely to be necessary on November 21 to confirm his re-election.After the last pre-election opinion polls put PP at about 15 per cent, the International Gallup Center said it would probably win 25.8 per cent of the vote, followed by Gerb’s 23.5 per cent. Alpha Research also put PP ahead at 26.1 per cent versus Gerb’s 23.5 per cent. The votes of Bulgarians casting ballots abroad have yet to be counted.While Gerb is shunned by most other parties, PP has several potential coalition partners, including the liberal Democratic Bulgaria; the populist There is Such a People (ITN); and the Socialist party. If combined, the parties would have a parliamentary majority of about 55 per cent, exit polls showed.PP has had preliminary discussions with several of those parties, Petkov, 41, told the Financial Times before the vote. While Democratic Bulgaria was an easy match, the others might be more difficult to draw into a coalition, he acknowledged.“Let’s have a real discussion of what we need to do and achieve,” Petkov said at a campaign stop in central Sofia. “In principle we can work with either ITN or the Socialists, with two conditions.”“One, we will change the chief prosecutor. And two, we will have an anti-corruption agency. A very strong one. I want in the next four years to be a success story of how one small country eradicated corruption in a super short time.”Democratic Bulgaria would co-operate with Petkov, its leader, Hristo Ivanov, said. The Socialists would also consider working together, based on talks on a joint programme, the party said. ITN did not return requests for comment.Movement for Rights and Freedoms, a party whose supporters include a sizeable Turkish minority, won about 10 per cent of the vote. Half a dozen smaller liberal and far-right formations stayed under the parliamentary threshold of 4 per cent, while the nationalist Vazrazhdane (Revival) party could scrape past the threshold for a seat or two, the polls showed.Although a PP-led coalition would probably include four groups, voters have expected politicians to overcome differences and deliver a workable executive in order to tame the pandemic and fight a huge rise in energy prices just as winter sets in.“Overlapping crises, including Covid, the energy crisis, the lack of a budget for next year, all feed a very high level of expectation to be more flexible,” said Boriana Dimitrova, Alpha Research’s director. “It will not be possible to have very strong red lines and lots of conflicts, like in the summer.”She added the coalition would probably be unstable and another election was a strong possibility as soon as next year.“But for the winter at least we should have a government,” she added. “Difficult as the talks may be.”
206  The EU will tighten sanctions on the Belarus regime by targeting those closest to its authoritarian leader, the union’s top diplomat has said, as ministers prepare to step up their response to what Brussels terms a “hybrid attack” at its eastern border.Thousands of people have travelled from the Middle East via Minsk to Belarus’s borders with Poland, Lithuania and Latvia in recent months in the hope of entering the EU. European officials say the surge is being orchestrated by Minsk in retaliation for the bloc’s support for the Belarusian opposition.Josep Borrell, head of the European External Action Service, the EU’s security and diplomatic arm, said foreign ministers meeting on Monday will give the green light to a widening of the legal framework governing sanctions on Belarus, as part of measures to press authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko to stop the flow of migrants to Europe’s borders.Lukashenko “believed that by retaliating in this way he was going to twist our arm and have the sanctions cancelled,” Borrell told French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche. “Quite the opposite is happening.”On Sunday afternoon, Borrell said he had held a phone call with the Belarus foreign minister Vladimir Makei to raise the “precarious humanitarian situation” at the border with the EU. “The current situation is unacceptable and must stop. People should not be used as weapons,” he said on Twitter after the call. The Belarusian foreign ministry confirmed the call had taken place and said it was prepared for “mutually respectful dialogue” with the EU.Borrell’s words came after EU diplomats told the Financial Times on Friday that the bloc was working on drawing up a wide-ranging list of people and entities involved in facilitating the movement of people from regions such as Syria, Yemen and Iraq to the EU-Belarus border.The EU is considering sanctions on two dozen Belarusian officials, a Syrian airline and a hotel in Minsk, diplomats said. The draft list includes Syrian carrier Cham Wings for running flights to Belarus and the Hotel Minsk for housing migrants in the country, and could extend to Minsk airport. Member states were divided on whether the measures should apply to the airport given the legal complexities involved, the diplomats said. They said the final list of people and entities would take weeks to finalise as the EU co-ordinates with allies.In the JDD interview on Sunday, Borrell said: “We strengthen [the sanctions] by targeting precisely those who co-operate with [Lukashenko]. We sanction individuals, but also companies with a strong export presence. We have not exhausted our capacity for sanction against companies, but we do not want this to affect the living conditions of the people.” Poland’s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Sunday that Warsaw had been in dialogue with Lithuania and Latvia about triggering discussions among Nato states over the crisis. He also raised the prospect of completely closing the EU’s border with Belarus, and said the EU should co-finance a wall Poland planned to build on its eastern border.“We already know that in order to stop the Belarusian regime, words alone are not enough,” he said in an interview with Poland’s state news agency. “Lukashenko won’t stop this assault on the border unless we start to act together.”The US secretary of state Antony Blinken spoke on Saturday with Polish foreign minister Zbigniew Rau reaffirming US support for Poland in the face of the Lukashenko regime’s “cynical exploitation of vulnerable migrants”. Blinken said the Lukashenko regime threatened security, sowed division, and aimed to distract from Russia’s activities on the border with Ukraine. The secretary expressed his deep appreciation for Poland’s vocal support for neighbouring Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.Lukashenko warned on Thursday that his country could retaliate against any “unacceptable” sanctions by cutting deliveries of gas or goods to Europe. Russia supplies about 40 per cent of the EU’s gas, with about a fifth transiting through Belarus.Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Saturday that Lukashenko had not discussed the threat with him, and that he hoped Belarus’s president would not try to cut off gas supplies.In fragments of an interview broadcast on state television on Sunday, Putin also said that Moscow was ready to help resolve the border crisis if asked, but laid blame for it on decades of US and Nato intervention in the Middle East.Brussels has been lobbying countries used as migrant transit points on the route to Minsk to help stop the flow of people, which has left thousands stranded in freezing conditions between Belarusian and Polish forces on the bloc’s eastern border.According to data from FlightRadar, Cham Wings has run four flights from Damascus to Minsk since November 7. The airline said on Saturday that it was suspending flights to Belarus “effective immediately”.On Friday, Turkey’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation said it had banned citizens of Iraq, Syria and Yemen from buying tickets from Turkish airports to Belarus until further notice.
207  Western intelligence suggests a “high probability of destabilisation” of Ukraine by Russia as soon as this winter after Moscow massed more than 90,000 troops at its border, according to Kyiv’s deputy defence minister.Hanna Maliar told the Financial Times at the weekend that while interpretations of western intelligence “need further discussion”, they underlined “the high probability of escalation of the situation”.When asked if the risk of Russian military aggression was higher than during the past years, she said: “Information of our [military intelligence services] coincides with the information of partner countries about the high probability of destabilisation of the situation in Ukraine this winter.”Maliar added that allies’ conclusions were “based not only on information about the number of Russian troops along the Ukrainian border”, suggesting Washington had additional intelligence about Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s intentions.The US briefed allies last week about intelligence indicating that Moscow was preparing for a possible invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s president has dismissed the fears as “alarmist” and accused Nato of inflaming tensions in the region with its own unplanned exercises.The Russian troop build-up had been occurring near the breakaway Donbass region in Ukraine’s east, where two Moscow-backed enclaves had fought a proxy war with Kyiv since 2014, as well as in other areas to Ukraine’s north-east and the annexed Crimean peninsula, Maliar said.Kyiv estimates Russia has deployed as many as 114,000 forces to the north, east, and south of Ukraine — including about 92,000 ground soldiers and the rest in air and sea military forces, Kyrylo Budanov, chief of Ukraine’s military intelligence, told the FT.Washington had yet to form a view of Putin’s intentions with the troop surge, based on differing assessments of the Russian threat to Ukraine, said people briefed on the discussions. But the US fears the latest movements are more serious than similar movements in the spring when Moscow massed similar numbers on the border as part of what it said was an unplanned exercise.Putin told state television at the weekend that Moscow was concerned about unannounced Nato drills in the Black Sea involving a “powerful naval group” and planes carrying strategic nuclear weapons, which he said presented a “serious challenge” for Russia.Putin said he had warned his defence ministry away from conducting its own unplanned drills in the region and limited it to accompanying Nato planes and ships because “there’s no need to aggravate the situation further”.“You get the impression they just won’t let us let our guard down. Well, let them know that we’re not letting our guard down,” he added.US secretary of state Antony Blinken told reporters on Friday that the US feared a rerun of the early phase of the conflict after a pro-western revolution in Kyiv in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and fuelled a proxy separatist war in the Donbass region that had since claimed more than 14,000 lives.“[We] do know that we’ve seen in the past Russia mass forces on Ukraine’s borders, claim some kind of provocation by Ukraine and then invade and basically follow on through on something they were planning all along,” Blinken said. “That’s what they did in 2014. And so this raises real concerns about an effort to repeat what was done then,” which, he said, “would be a serious mistake.”Blinken also suggested that the border crisis in neighbouring Belarus over migrants seeking to cross the border into Poland was being used to distract from Russia’s activities on the border with Ukraine.Budanov of Ukraine’s military intelligence said Russian forces “demonstratively left their tanks, combat vehicles, and jet systems near our border” after large-scale joint military exercises with Belarus in September.“This can be seen as preparation for a large-scale invasion and as an attempt at psychological pressure,” he said.Though Russia has always denied its involvement in the conflict, Moscow’s military intervened to support Ukrainian separatists with troops, logistics, and equipment, during the war’s active phase and continues to lead the separatist forces, according to the US and EU countries.Talks over ending the conflict under a 2015 peace plan in Minsk, struck with French and German mediation, have stalled largely over Russia’s refusal to return Ukraine control of its border and Kyiv’s reluctance to give the separatist factions autonomy in its constitution.France’s foreign ministry said this week that Russia had refused to have a ministerial-level meeting with Ukraine and Germany to discuss the peace process in the Donbass.In the interview at the weekend, Putin also complained about Ukraine’s use of Turkish-made drones — which were critical in Azerbaijan’s victory in Nagorno-Karabakh last year — in a skirmish in the Donbass, which he said violated its obligations under the treaty.“But nobody is even reacting to this [.] Europe mumbled something and the US actually supported it. And officials in Ukraine are openly saying they used them and will use them again.”Even if Russia does not invade, border troop movements are destabilising, according to a European official. “The constant pressure by Russia is making it as difficult as possible for Ukraine to develop and strengthen as a country,” the official said.Letter in response to this article: Russia’s Ukraine build-up looks like reprise of Georgia invasion / From Ambassador (ret.)

208  Are real estate prices today the equivalent of bread prices? It’s a question that was recently asked by a trade union leader in Germany, where there has been a push to seize corporate-owned rental units and put them in public ownership. Many Dutch cities want to ban investors from buying cheap homes to rent out.South Korea’s ruling party took a beating in mayoral elections for failing to stop a 90 per cent hike in the average price of a Seoul apartment. China’s president Xi Jinping has made affordable housing a huge part of his common prosperity theme, saying that housing is “for living in, not speculation”.We know home prices are inflated in many places. But a new study from the McKinsey Global Institute, which tallies up the balance sheets of 10 countries that represent 60 per cent of global income (Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Sweden, the UK and the US), has some eye-popping numbers about just how much money is in real estate, and why.The study, entitled “The Rise and Rise of the Global Balance Sheet”, looked at real assets, financial assets and liabilities held by households, governments, banks and non-financial corporations. It found that two-thirds of net worth is stored in residential, corporate and government real estate as well as land. For all the talk of digitalisation, it seems that bricks and mortar are the new bricks and mortar.How did this happen? And what are the implications?The McKinsey study found a strong inverse correlation between net worth relative to gross domestic product and five-year rolling averages of nominal long-term interest rates. The authors believe that declining interest rates have played a decisive role in lifting asset prices of all sorts, but particularly real estate prices. Constrained land supply, zoning issues and over-regulated housing markets also helped push up values. The result is that home prices have tripled on average across the 10 countries.The ramifications are troubling. For starters, asset values are now nearly 50 per cent higher than the long-run average relative to income. Net worth and GDP have traditionally moved in sync with each other at the global level, with some country-specific deviations. Now, wealth and growth are completely disconnected. This is, of course, behind much of the populist anger in politics today. Affordable housing in particular has become a rallying cry for millennials who can’t afford to buy homes and start families as early as a previous generation did.That, in turn, generates a headwind to consumption growth, since they aren’t buying all the things that you put in a house, either. But it also fuels inflation in rents, since so many people can’t afford to buy. That supports the idea that we could be heading into a 1970s stagflation era.Much of the disconnect between wealth and growth stems from too much money in real estate. But another aspect of the problem is that there’s just not enough money moving into more economically productive places. While higher asset prices accounted for about three-quarters of the growth in net worth from $150tn in 2000 to $500tn in 2020, savings and investment made up only 28 per cent of the increase in balance sheets.Given that investments such as infrastructure, industrial equipment, machinery and intangibles are what actually drive productivity and innovation, that’s very bad news. With the exception of China and Japan, non-real estate assets made up a lower share of total real assets in the 10 countries today than 20 years ago. What’s more, despite the fact that digital trade and information flows have grown exponentially over that time, intangibles are a mere 4 per cent of net worth.This may be because, as the authors observe, “for their mostly corporate owners, the value of intangible assets is assumed to decline rapidly due to obsolescence and competition, even if their value to society may have a much longer shelf life”. That’s a bit of a numbers game. The study notes that, by removing any depreciation of amortisation from the measurement of intangibles over the past 20 years, you would quadruple their value (which may actually justify the share prices of certain seemingly frothy technology stocks).Still, for all the talk of blockchain, cryptocurrency and big data, it’s rather amazing that most 21st-century wealth still lives in the oldest asset class of all: bricks and mortar. What lessons should we take from this? First, it seems increasingly clear that low interest rates haven’t done much for business investment. Second, and more encouragingly, the big government spending programmes of the post-Covid era present a new opportunity to try and push money into more productive sectors, which could ultimately bring wealth and growth back into alignment.Third, affordable housing is the most pressing economic issue of the moment. Technology-driven mobility and increasing work flexibility in the post-pandemic era may ease some of the pressure. More likely, we’ll need to rethink urban zoning and encourage more density, as California has already done. We will also have to find ways to tax property based on some combination of capital appreciation but also income, so as not to penalise pensioners. Only by fixing housing can we rebalance our global ledger.
209  Spain’s leftwing government is championing rent controls as property costs rise across Europe, part of a proposed housing law that it says will protect vulnerable tenants against investment funds and other big landlords.Critics say the measure is misguided and will put the country’s supply of accommodation at risk. But Ione Belarra, leader of the radical Podemos party that supports the bill, said it would right the balance in a sector transformed by the eurozone financial crisis over a decade ago and the arrival of institutional funds. Investment group Blackstone is now Spain’s biggest landlord.“The big investment funds saw a niche here to speculate in the housing business,” Belarra, who is also Spain’s social affairs minister, told the Financial Times in an interview.“Now we are beginning to put limits to this and say to the big landlords that they can keep doing housing business, but not at any price,” she added. “Not at the price that there are evictions, or that people have to pay more than 30 per cent of their income in rent.”Blackstone, which now owns close to 30,000 homes in Spain, declined to comment.The proposals come at a time of concern across much of Europe at rising rents and property prices. In Germany, Berlin’s citizens voted in September to expropriate big landlords to reduce rents.The bill casts light on negotiations over the economy within the ruling coalition, with Podemos pushing for a more radical line than the bigger Socialists of prime minister Pedro Sánchez.Podemos insisted on the text of the housing bill as a condition of its support for the 2022 budget, the Socialists’ legislative priority.Among many other moves the bill seeks to ban the sale of social housing to investment funds. In 2013, when local authorities were desperate to balance their books in the wake of the financial crisis, Blackstone bought 1,860 flats from the city of Madrid for €129m. They are now part of the group’s €5bn portfolio of Spanish property, which includes hotels and offices.Blackstone’s accumulation of those assets has coincided with deep structural changes in the Spanish property market.Before the crisis the economy revolved around the construction sector, which drove the banking system, the job market and even government revenues. After the crash, mortgages became far harder to obtain and hundreds of thousands lost their homes.As a result, more people sought to rent, reversing a trend in which housing ownership had risen for decades — although owner-occupiers still account for more than three-quarters of homes.Increased demand has pushed up costs. According to calculations by EY, the consultancy, average rent has risen more than 40 per cent over the past five years, despite a dip during the pandemic.The issue is all the more powerful among Podemos supporters because of Spain’s youth unemployment rate of more than 30 per cent — more than half of 25 to 29 year olds still live with their parents.Against such a backdrop, the housing bill, whose backers hope will become law in the first half of next year, is politically charged.One measure would allow regional governments to force big landlords — defined as those holding more than 10 properties — to cap rents in so-called “stressed areas”, where rent has risen significantly above inflation. The legislation would also allow regions to implement tax incentives for smaller owners to reduce rents or impose penalties to prevent them from keeping properties vacant.Javier García-Mateo, partner for real estate at EY in Spain, said rental properties’ share of the country’s total housing inventory had risen from less than 10 per cent in 2010 to 15-20 per cent today, but argued the proposed law threatens future supply.“In any market in which you intervene with a cap, you will disincentivise developers,” he said. According to his estimates, of a pipeline of 28,000-29,000 flats that developers were preparing to build for rental, some 8,000 have been put on hold until the consequences of the law become clearer.Spain’s Association of Rental Property Owners also contends that the bill would limit housing supply and reduce investment.“This government, and in particular Podemos’s proposals always have the same assessment from the economic elites — whatever measure it is, we always hear that it will sink the economy, that the country is headed for disaster,” said Belarra, who took over in June from founder Pablo Iglesias as Podemos’ leader. “This argument is beginning to wear out.”The Socialists strike a more emollient note. David Lucas, the government’s top official for housing policy, emphasised that 85 per cent of landlords are smaller property owners, for whom tax incentives rather than obligatory caps will apply.He notes that, according to the current draft, caps would not come into force for 18 months, to allow time to compile a new index of rental prices.In any case, regions governed by the opposition centre right People’s party have vowed not to apply the curbs permitted by the law should it be approved by parliament.But Lucas also argued that the legislation is long due. “Each time there was a crisis, it was difficult for many citizens to get housing, while many others lost their homes,” he said. “This was an unsolved problem.” Many voters are unconvinced. “Rents are going higher and higher,” said Casandra, who leases a 30-square-metre flat in Vallecas, a traditional working class district of Madrid where rents have risen markedly. “I don’t think this law will stop that.

210  Belarus’s authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko said that he wanted Russia’s Iskander missile system stationed in his country, amid mounting tensions over the migrant crisis on the Belarusian-Polish border.The EU has accused Lukashenko’s regime of orchestrating the crisis by funnelling thousands of migrants from the Middle East to Belarus’s borders with the EU and encouraging them to enter the bloc illegally. The EU is preparing to respond with a new round of sanctions on Minsk.Lukashenko has already threatened to retaliate against any sanctions that are “unacceptable” for Minsk, raising the prospect earlier this week of cutting the transit of gas and goods through Belarus to Europe.In an interview with a Russian magazine published on Saturday, he continued in his bellicose vein, saying that he wanted Russia’s Iskander missile system, which has a range of 500km and can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads, to be deployed to Belarus.“At the moment, I am bothering your president [Vladimir Putin], that I need these . rocket launchers here,” he told National Defence. “I need several divisions in the west, in the south, let them stand there.”“I say to Putin: ‘the main thing is that you don’t flinch. So that I know that if it gets difficult, I have an older brother at my back, who will not allow his younger [brother] to be hurt’,” Lukashenko added, when asked by the magazine how Russia could support his regime.Russia’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Lukashenko’s remarks. A former defence ministry official, Yevgeny Buzhinsky, told Russia’s Interfax news agency that he thought it was unlikely that Russia would accede.“It is not in our interests to escalate the situation now,” he said. “If we start deploying now, then what prevents the Americans from deploying their missiles somewhere in Poland or in the Baltic states?”Analysts say that Belarus lacks the funds to purchase expensive Russian military equipment outright, meaning that Russia would have to supply it at a discount or in exchange for political concessions.Dmitry Shugayev, head of Russia’s military co-operation organisation, said on Sunday that Belarus had still not made a formal bid for Russia’s S-400 air defence system despite Lukashenko announcing plans to buy them two months earlier.The Kremlin has long been Lukashenko’s closest international ally, and as tension over the migrant crisis rose this week, it twice sent nuclear-capable bombers on patrols in Belarusian airspace. On Friday, Russian and Belarusian paratroopers carried out joint drills near the Polish border.However, Putin has distanced himself from Lukashenko’s threats to cut off Russian gas supplies through Belarus to Europe, saying in an interview on Saturday with Russian TV that Lukashenko had not mentioned the idea to him, and that he hoped it would not happen.“There is nothing good in this, and I of course will talk to [Lukashenko] about it,” Putin said. “Perhaps he said it in anger.”The migrant crisis has left thousands of people, from countries including Iraq, Syria and Yemen, stranded between Belarusian and Polish forces on the countries’ border as the freezing eastern European winter approaches.Polish officials said on Saturday that the body of a young Syrian man had been found the previous day near Wolka Terechowska, bringing the official number of migrants who have died in Poland, since the crisis erupted, to seven.Polish officials said earlier this week that between 3,000 and 4,000 migrants were estimated to be at the border.
211  Austria has unveiled contentious plans to impose strict coronavirus curbs on the unvaccinated and the Netherlands is imposing another nationwide lockdown, becoming the first western EU nation to restore sweeping restrictions since the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines, as countries across Europe rush to contain surging infections.Austria’s chancellor Alexander Schallenberg on Friday said the federal government was seeking a nationwide lockdown for those who have not been jabbed, to apply from Monday.The measures were needed to protect the rights of those who had been vaccinated or recovered from the virus, Schallenberg told reporters earlier. “I don’t see why two-thirds of the population should lose their freedom because another third hesitates,” he said.More than 33 per cent of Austrians have yet to have a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine — one of the lowest rates in the EU — public health data show.In the Netherlands, non-essential shops and close-contact services such as hairdressers will be forced to shut by 6pm from Saturday, with essential shops like supermarkets, bars and restaurants closing at 8pm.Other measures will include teleworking for all sectors where possible, a limit of four guests per household, no spectators at sporting events and the reimposition of 1.5m social distancing in public spaces.Mark Rutte, caretaker prime minister, called the restrictions a “hard blow” at a press conference on Friday evening. “We have an unpleasant message tonight. Fortunately, the vast majority of people in our country have now been vaccinated. Otherwise the misery in the hospitals would be incalculable. But the pressure in healthcare is still extremely high,” he said.The Netherlands public health authority recorded 16,287 new Covid-19 cases on Friday — 44 lower than the previous day, when the toll was the highest recorded since the outbreak of the pandemic.Austria this week recorded its highest infection numbers of the entire pandemic, with a rolling seven-day average of 9,593 daily infections reached on Thursday. The previous high, almost exactly a year ago, was 7,464.Austrian state governors will meet federal government officials on Sunday to thrash out details of the proposed lockdown.Despite Schallenberg’s call, the consensus between states is far from clear. Upper Austria and Salzburg have said they will enforce strict measures regardless of what is decided on Sunday, but other state governors have been more equivocal. Any new measures are likely to meet legal challenges.Unvaccinated people are already banned from Austria’s restaurants, bars and entertainment venues.Officials in the chancellery said measures would almost certainly mirror the harsh lockdown restrictions in Austria during autumn last year and spring. If so, unvaccinated people will be able to leave their homes only once a day for a short period for “essential” reasons, such as buying food.Police would be deployed to conduct spot checks in public places to check people’s vaccination status, the interior ministry said. Rule breakers would face hefty fines.Germany on Friday added Austria to its list of “high-risk” countries, caretaker health minister Jens Spahn said. Under that classification, anyone entering Germany from Austria who has not been vaccinated or recovered from the virus must quarantine for 10 days.Friday’s announcements sparked a swift backlash in both countries. Herbert Kickl, leader of Austria’s far-right Freedom party — which won a quarter of votes in the 2019 federal elections — accused the government of “corona fascism” and said “all forms of resistance.are now needed”.In the Netherlands, protesters threw stones and fireworks outside the Rutte press conference in The Hague, with police dispersing crowds with water cannons.Other EU countries are also seeking to tighten coronavirus curbs. Authorities in Germany proposed tougher measures as the seven-day incidence rate — which reached 263 people per 100,000 — hit a historic high for the fifth consecutive day.Spahn called for access to public events to be restricted to the vaccinated or recovered and for all to be tested before entry. The Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s main public health authority, called for a cut in the numbers allowed into large events or for them to be cancelled, and for some bars and clubs to be closed.In Latvia, from Monday, lawmakers in the national parliament and all municipal councils will be able to work and be paid only if they have been jabbed or are recovering from a Covid-19 infection. The Baltic country had the world’s highest number of coronavirus cases per capita last month.
212  Dino, an Iraqi Kurd, knew he was taking a risk trying to slip into the EU via Belarus. But desperate for a new life, he paid $4,000 to a travel agent who arranged a visa and plane ticket to the capital Minsk.He finally reached the Polish border last weekend, to be met with barbed wire fences, sub-zero temperatures and heavily armed soldiers dispatched to prevent people like him from crossing.“It’s so cold.we’re sitting here and running out of food,” the 47-year-old told the Financial Times by video call from a makeshift border camp this week, the barrier separating him from Poland visible in the background. “If we could get a visa to Poland, if we could get a visa to Germany. I would go there and work.”He and the thousands of other migrants shunted towards the border are pawns in an escalating crisis that EU officials say has been orchestrated by the regime of Belarus’ strongman president Alexander Lukashenko, as part of a plan to destabilise the EU in retaliation for its support for Belarus’s opposition.The stand-off escalated dramatically this week as the biggest ever group of migrants moved to the border, sparking a warning from the EU of fresh sanctions on Belarus and a threat from Lukashenko to shut off gas transits to the bloc.At the centre of the crisis are the migrants themselves, squeezed into a thin strip of land, Polish security services on one side and Belarusian forces on the other. In video calls from the forest camps this week, they spoke of the lack of food and water and pointed out the many children at the camp, huddled around campfires on the freezing ground.“We can’t sleep, because it’s so cold,” one woman said by phone this week. “We’re going to die here.”There have been six fatalities, according to the Polish border guard, who only have information about cases on their side of the frontier.During the past six months, the number of people attempting to enter the EU illegally via its eastern border has surged as Belarus allowed migrants from countries including Iraq, Syria, Somalia and Yemen to enter its territory and travel to its frontier with Poland, as well as those with Latvia and Lithuania.Those who spoke to the FT this week told similar stories of how they came to be in Belarus. A 26-year-old factory worker, also from Kurdistan, who arrived in Minsk a week ago, said Iraqis could not secure visas at home and local agents would source them at Belarusian consulates in other countries.A Kurdish agent offering online to organise visas for migrants said he secured Belarus visas for Iraqis in Turkey. The factory worker said he flew via Istanbul.Despite the difficulties, the route remains popular. “Facebook, social media — they were all talking about it,” the young man said. “In every family, one [person] is trying to get to Belarus.”After arriving in Minsk he travelled to the border in taxis with a group of about 25 others, led by a people-smuggler. But in the forest the group was ambushed and robbed, so he returned to the capital to prepare for another attempt.With just days left on his visa, he feels let down by the company he paid $3,500 to organise his trip. “They say ‘we can get you to the border and get over easily’. But when we get to Minsk it’s not like that.”He feels duped by the Belarusian side, too. “The government uses us in the border regions as a weapon. Lukashenko uses us against the EU,” he said, speaking by phone from Minsk.Dino said the smugglers offered to guide people across the border for as much as $6,000. Then, he added, the migrants were given instructions to walk through the Polish forest to a specific point where they would be met by smugglers in a car.Migrants in Belarus contacted by the FT said that while some Belarusian taxi drivers had taken people from Minsk to the border region, local authorities had not provided them with any formal assistance or organisation for that trip.But at one makeshift border camp, located close to the Belarusian town of Grodno, migrants described Belarusian police trying to direct people, including moving them to other places along the border. Police have also tried to escalate the situation and foster violence, one migrant said.“The Belarusian police fight us and say, ‘go to Poland’,” said Binar, a 25-year-old Iraqi, speaking by phone from a tent on the border. “You’re like a football. between the Belarus police, Poland and Lithuania.”Binar left his home in northern Iraq over a month ago, travelling first to Baghdad and then to Damascus in Syria, where the company that organised his travel secured him a Belarus visa and put him on a flight.So far, he has tried six times to cross into Poland, on one occasion walking 16 hours through the forest at night with two dozen other migrants led by a smuggler. Each time he has failed or been turned back.Anna Dabrowska from Grupa Granica, a collective that help migrants, said the situation in the camps was desperate. “These are people experiencing an absolute human catastrophe. There’s no access to food, running water or medicines,” she said.“We have testimonies from refugees [in Belarus] of them being beaten, of being chased with dogs. On the other side of the border is the Polish army and the police, which also don’t spare violence.”But Binar said he had no plans to give up on his quest to reach Europe. “Even if 100 people die here, our people won’t go back,” he said. “Because we don’t want the old life, we want a better life.”
213  The EU is considering imposing sweeping sanctions on scores of Belarusian officials, a Syrian airline and a hotel in Minsk as part of measures to press authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko to stop the flow of migrants to Europe’s borders.EU diplomats told the Financial Times that the bloc was working on drawing up a wide-ranging list of people and entities involved in facilitating the movement of people from regions such as Syria, Yemen and Iraq to the EU-Belarus border, in a move that Brussels has called a “hybrid attack” from the Lukashenko regime.The draft list includes Syrian airline Cham Wings for running flights to Belarus and the Hotel Minsk for housing migrants in the country, diplomats said. The list also includes more than two dozen Belarusian officials and could extend to Minsk airport.Thousands of people have travelled from the Middle East via Minsk to Belarus’s borders with Poland, Lithuania and Latvia in recent months in the hope of entering the EU. European officials say the surge is being orchestrated by Minsk in retaliation for the bloc’s support for the Belarusian opposition.EU foreign affairs ministers will discuss the scope of fresh sanctions at a meeting in Brussels on Monday, where they are expected to approve a new legal basis for a fifth sanctions package against Minsk. Diplomats said the final list of people and entities would take weeks to finalise as the EU co-ordinates the measures with the UK, Canada, and the US.Lukashenko warned on Thursday that his country could retaliate against any “unacceptable” sanctions by cutting deliveries of gas or goods to Europe. Russia supplies about 40 per cent of the EU’s gas, with about a fifth transiting through Belarus.According to data from FlightRadar, Cham Wings has run four flights from Damascus to Minsk since November 7. On Friday, Turkey’s Civil Aviation Authority said it had banned citizens of Iraq, Syria and Yemen from buying tickets from Turkish airports to Belarus until further notice.Brussels has been lobbying countries used as transit points on the route to Minsk to help stop the flow of people, which has left thousands stranded in freezing conditions between Belarusian and Polish forces on the bloc’s eastern border.“When applied, these measures will have a tangible impact on the current situation,” said a senior EU official ahead of the official announcement. “We continue our outreach to countries of origin and transit. Other contacts are planned over the next days.”Istanbul has become an important travel hub connecting Europe with the Middle East and Africa as Turkish Airlines has dramatically increased its international footprint in recent years.Turkey’s national flag carrier enacted its own ban on passengers from Syria, Iraq and Yemen on Thursday night, according to a person familiar with the matter. The airline also reduced the number of weekly flights from 14 to 10, the person added.Margaritis Schinas, vice-president of the European Commission, on Friday visited Beirut, capital of Lebanon, as part of a wider tour of the region aimed at persuading countries to help stem the number of migrants. He is due to travel to Iraq next.The Kremlin said on Friday that Lukashenko had not consulted Moscow before threatening to limit gas supplies, and that Russia was a reliable supplier. However, in a show of strength, Russia also deployed paratroopers for an exercise near Belarus’s western border.Poland’s defence minister said on Friday that Polish forces would receive support from British military engineers in securing the fence on the border with Belarus. He did not specify how many British personnel were involved.Ankara, which has a close but complex relationship with Moscow, had reacted angrily to claims from Poland in recent days that Turkey was acting in a “synchronised” fashion with Russia and Belarus to stoke the crisis.The country’s foreign ministry said it rejected efforts to “portray it as part of the problem”.Turkey is host to almost 4m refugees, the vast majority of whom are Syrian but also a sizeable number of Afghans.
214  Boris Johnson has called on elderly and vulnerable Britons to come forward for Covid-19 booster shots, as he warned of “storm clouds” gathering over continental Europe after a fast-rising wave of coronavirus infections prompted several nations to reimpose restrictions.“I’m looking at what’s happening overseas, and I’m simply saying to the British people.this is the moment to get your booster,” the UK prime minister said on Friday.Some 370,000 booster shots were administered across the UK on Thursday, bringing the number of people who have received a third dose of a Covid-19 vaccine to more than 11.8m. About 63 per cent of people in the UK eligible for a booster shot — healthcare workers, the over-50s and those considered vulnerable — have received the jab.Despite having had some of the highest infection rates in Europe for much of the autumn, Covid-19 infections, hospital admissions and deaths have fallen across the UK in recent weeks.A total of 1,077,100 people were infected with Covid across the UK in the week ending November 6, down around 15 per cent on the week before, according to the Office for National Statistics infection survey.However, since Thursday, daily cases have begun to edge up again. On Friday, 40,375 new Covid cases were recorded, up 19 per cent from the same day last week when around 34,000 people tested positive.But the number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test in the week to November 12 dropped by nearly 9 per cent to 1,090.“We’ve got some encouraging numbers in the sense that they’ve been drifting down for a while, but it’s not clear that that drift is going to continue,” Johnson said.The prime minister has resisted calls from leaders in the health sector to implement “plan B” measures of compulsory mask-wearing in public spaces, work from home orders and vaccine passports to reduce infection rates and ease the pressure on hospitals in England.But Johnson added: “I’m seeing the storm clouds gathering over parts of the European continent and I’ve got to be absolutely frank with people: we’ve been here before. We remember what happens when the wave starts rolling in.”Covid case rates in Austria, Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands outstrip those recorded in the UK. In Germany and Denmark, per capita caseloads are nearing UK levels and growing rapidly.In Austria, an average of 107 daily cases per 100,000 were recorded in the latest week, while in the Netherlands an average of 70 daily cases per 100,000 were reported. That compares to around 53 cases per 100,000 recorded across the UK in the week to November 12.The Netherlands will impose a three-week partial lockdown from Saturday evening. Hospitality venues, supermarkets and non-essential shops will close early, home gatherings will be restricted to four people and home-working will be strongly encouraged, as part of a suite of measures announced by prime minister Mark Rutte.The Austrian government plans to impose strict lockdown measures on all unvaccinated citizens from Monday. Germany’s public health authority, the Robert Koch Institute, called on Friday for capacity limits to be introduced for large events, and bars and nightclubs in Covid hotspots to be closed.Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at Southampton university, argued that several EU nations were facing issues with patchy vaccine coverage as well as waning immunity which the UK began experiencing “a few months back” because of its faster primary vaccination rollout.He added that rapidly implemented booster campaigns could help suppress infections rates. However, Head warned: “We are seeing that while vaccines do a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to keeping Covid-19 under control, other interventions are also required to prevent case numbers rising.”
215  The US has warned Moscow that military aggression against Ukraine would be a “serious mistake” following western intelligence that showed a Russian troop build-up at the Ukrainian border.Speaking to reporters on Friday, Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, said Washington was “very concerned about the irregular movements of forces that we see on.Ukraine’s borders”.“It would be a serious mistake for Russia to engage in a repeat of what it did in 2014,” he added, referring to Moscow’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine.The warning came after Washington and Kyiv briefed EU allies this week that the troop surge could indicate preparations for a Russian invasion of Ukraine. Moscow has been fuelling a proxy separatist war in the country’s eastern region of Donbass. Kyiv says the conflict has killed more than 14,000 people.Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, on Friday dismissed those concerns, saying that Russia was “not a threat to anyone”.“We have repeatedly said that the movement of our armed forces on our territory should not be of concern to anyone,” he added.In a statement released on Friday, France’s foreign and defence ministers, Jean-Yves Le Drian and Florence Parly, expressed similar specific concerns about a Russian military attack on Ukraine after meeting their Russian counterparts in Paris.“The two ministers expressed their concerns about the deteriorating security situation in Ukraine and clearly warned of the serious consequences of any further possible damage to the territorial integrity of Ukraine,” the statement said.A senior EU official said the bloc had asked Russian authorities for information about the troop build-up, after having been informed by US officials on developments in the past week.“We are again seeing a build-up [of troops] and are consulting with our partners in the US and UK on their assessment. This is a worrying development and we are following with concern,” the official added.An adviser to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky told the Financial Times on Friday that Ukraine’s defence minister Oleksiy Reznikov is travelling to Washington early next week for further consultations.“The real question is what will the US and Nato do to deter any such planned Russian aggression,” the adviser added.Ukraine has asked the US for urgent security support, including intelligence sharing, or air defence systems, “or anything”, said Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, on Wednesday after meeting Blinken in Washington.The Biden administration is concerned that Moscow’s intentions towards Ukraine could derail tentative US-Russia talks on cyber attacks and arms control. Bill Burns, CIA director, led a US delegation to Moscow this month to discuss Ukraine, among other subjects.Meanwhile, relations between Russia and the EU have been strained in recent months over what European policymakers have said is Moscow’s refusal to make additional gas supplies available amid a continent-wide shortage and record prices.Tensions were exacerbated this week when the EU accused Russian ally Belarus of deploying “gangster” tactics on its border with Poland, encouraging migrants to travel to the area in order to provoke instability on the EU’s borders.Russia has sent two strategic bombers on patrol missions to Belarus, the Russian defence ministry said on Thursday, and launched joint military drills in the country, close to the Polish border.
216  François Hollande had just finished four hours of testimony in the terrorism trial of 20 men accused of carrying out the November 13 2015 attacks in Paris when one of them stood up as if to address the packed courtroom.It was Salah Abdeslam, the only surviving alleged member of the Isis-backed extremists who struck targets in the French capital, killing 130 people. A showdown loomed between the former president and the defendant, who had earlier in the trial justified the attacks as a moral response to French air strikes in Syria and blamed Hollande directly for them.“Ah no, Mr Abdeslam, if you have questions you can go through your lawyers!” Jean-Louis Périès, the presiding judge, interjected to cut short the confrontation and end a marathon day of hearings.Hollande’s presence and his stand-off with one of the alleged protagonists encapsulated how the criminal trial, now in its third month, has been acting as a cathartic moment for France. Not only is the country trying the individuals accused of the attacks at the Bataclan theatre, café terraces and Stade de France, it is also having a public reckoning over the events, and the damage they inflicted on French society.A purpose-built courtroom in a heavily fortified Palais de Justice in Paris has become a stage for the accused, investigators, survivors and politicians in power at the time to give testimony, and for experts in psychology and sociology to explain the context.The attacks were part of a traumatic period for France when Isis fighters returning from Syria and Iraq and French citizens who adhered to their cause carried out a series of deadly acts. They included killing journalists at Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015 and the truck rampage in Nice in July 2016.Hollande on Wednesday appeared as a witness called by a victims’ group as is permitted in France, not by the prosecution or the defence, and neither he nor the state are on trial. They wanted him to recall his experiences that night when he was in the Stade de France crowd for a football match, his decision to order the assault to end the Bataclan siege and the government’s actions before and afterwards.Sharon Weill, a law professor specialising in terrorism trials at the American University of Paris, said having the former president appear was “a fascinating exercise” that showed how the trial was taking on a bigger role beyond simply judging the accused.“This is not only a criminal proceeding, it is also a truth commission where the victims can come to speak, and now the political context in which these attacks occurred is also being explored,” she said. “Of course the state is not on trial here but the president did have to respond to questions. The courtroom has become a bit like a democratic forum.”The French media often call the trial hors norme, meaning abnormal or exceptional. The term reflects the scale and drama of the proceedings that are expected to run until next May. France is aiming to prove that its judicial institutions are up to the challenge of trying the men accused of perpetrating the deadliest peacetime attacks on its soil.Most of the November 13 attackers died that night or soon after in police raids, except for Abdeslam, who allegedly had an explosive vest that night that he never detonated. The other defendants are accused of helping him escape to Brussels, providing logistical support such as fake identity papers, or being part of Isis cells plotting attacks in Europe.The first month of testimony was from investigators about the attacks and the subsequent manhunt; then came five weeks of emotional accounts from survivors and their families.Last week, the accused gave so-called personality testimony about their upbringing and character. In contrast to his earlier aggressive statements, Abdeslam was conciliatory as he recounted a peaceful childhood in Brussels’ Molenbeek neighbourhood and admitted a penchant for gambling and nightclubs. His mother and sister are also expected to testify. Evidence about the defendants’ religious views and radicalisation will be heard at a later stage.It was Mohamed Abrini, Abdeslam’s childhood friend and co-defendant, who delivered the most memorable line when he said: “We did not come out of our mothers’ wombs holding Kalashnikovs.”There was little such levity on Wednesday when some defence lawyers sought to block Hollande’s appearance and those of sociologists specialising in Islamic extremism, arguing that they had no value as evidence. “Do not let this trial be used as a political platform,” pleaded one. The judges overruled them.Lawyers representing the victims asked Hollande several times whether everything possible had been done to prevent the attacks. Some implied that intelligence services had not followed up warnings in summer 2015 that attacks were being planned against unspecified concert halls.“We did not know where, when or how they would strike,” said Hollande, although he admitted that they did know Isis wanted to carry out attacks in Europe.Defence lawyers demanded an explanation of how France legally justified air strikes on Isis targets in 2014-15, while another contemplated whether the “war on terror” waged by the US and its allies since September 11 2001 had merely served to create more extremists.“I see that the defence lawyers are into international politics and not criminal justice,” said Hollande with characteristic irony.Xavier Nogueras, a veteran defence lawyer in terror cases, asked the day’s last question: “If everything that could have been done was done, what went wrong in your view? Is terrorism inevitable?”Hollande replied: “There will be other terrorist acts, and democracies must find answers to them, in the law.”
217  Everyone who is anyone has a favourite product. Parisians have been devotees since Catherine de’ Medici commissioned a scent that came to be known as Acqua della Regina (and is still sold today, from €75) on her marriage to Henry II of France in the 16th century; a New York architect swears by Tabacco Toscano; and English novelist Kate Lord Brown (author of The Perfume Garden) scents her desk drawers with the addictively subtle and mysterious pot-pourri (€19). Jade Jagger loves Garofano; Penélope Cruz wears the brand’s musk; in real life as in character (as Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale), Eva Green keeps Melograno – the pharmacy’s deliciously refined pomegranate fragrance – in her handbag. With more than 600 products, from terracotta pomegranates steeped in Melograno (€45) to almond hand cream (€35) or tiny lacquered boxes of Carta d’Armenia paper (€15), there is something here for everyone.Following the opening of the original shop in 1612, there are now more than 75 outlets around the world, from Barcelona to Seoul. But the great enterprise – and for many, the love affair – begins in Florence and the original pharmacy, which looks into the magnificent Great Cloister of the church of Santa Maria Novella. Even here, the brand is discreet, and the entrance on the unprepossessing Via della Scala does not proclaim itself: on his own first pilgrimage (“long before the iPhone and Google Maps”), the company’s CEO Gian Luca Perris found himself wandering up and down the street for some time before he found his way inside. Once the threshold is crossed, however, the genius loci is in command. The marble-floored lobby leads into a succession of loftily beautiful and atmospheric spaces. Every room has its story, from the panelled cabinets and old glass of the pharmacy to the vaulted ceilings of the chapel of San Niccolò. The cool, frescoed sacristy is the place products would have been stored, and patients taken to rest; the secret window is where one of the Officina’s former directors is said to have spied on his employees. Its reputation is built on quality, indomitable industry, Renaissance brilliance and sound business sense – the only time in its history that the pharmacy closed to the public was during the pandemic lockdown of 2020, although production was able to continue and the company used its supplies of sanitising alcohol to support Florence’s hospitals. Although some processes are still carried out by hand, around 30 years ago production was moved from the original terracotta-floored laboratory in Via della Scala to a streamlined factory on the edge of the city.Even with new ownership and the appointment of Perris as CEO in 2020, there will be fine-tuning but no change for change’s sake. The firm remains entirely Italian-owned (investment firm Italmobiliare has an 80 per cent stake), and Roman-born Perris is adamant that this has been “a year of study” – of the company’s extraordinarily rich resources and of the formulas and “codes” it has registered for the products’ raw materials. There’s no rush to change things here. “If we work on developing a fragrance,” says Perris, “we don’t launch it next year, we launch it when it’s ready.” Rosa Gardenia, a new fragrance created for the anniversary, draws on a similar scent in the archive. The new CEO learned his craft at the French house Houbigant (makers of scents so distinctive they reportedly gave Marie Antoinette away as she fled the sans-culottes in disguise) and is the founder of his namesake perfume brand. Perris is a “nose” to his core; his enthusiasm and expertise are palpable, whether he is explaining essential-oil extraction or identifying the wood used to make the pharmacy’s 18th-century fittings (walnut); he brings a welcome hint of Rome’s warmth to the outfit’s Florentine reserve. But in the end, the scents of Santa Maria Novella belong to Florence, in all its subtle, complex, lovely austerity, from the thyme, bay and iris of the Florentine hills to the cool shadowy recesses of an ancient church.
218  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.The European Commission’s latest economic forecast paints a somewhat better picture of how public finances will fare after the pandemic hangover. We’ll take a look at the major caveats to that outlook, including the spectre of pandemic restrictions returning.EU Brexit commissioner Maros Sefcovic meets his British counterpart in London today, amid continued verbal threats. (Our sister newsletter Britain after Brexit has the latest.)As we flagged in yesterday’s Europe Express, trade ministers did express their exasperation at the French for stalling EU’s trade deals, particularly the one with Chile. We’ll discuss what they argued about and the way forward.And as Bulgarian voters are heading to the polls for a third time this year on Sunday, we’ll explore what chances there are for Sofia to have a functioning government any time soon.One of the consequences of punchy growth predictions from the European Commission yesterday is a somewhat quicker improvement in public finances than Brussels was expecting, writes Sam Fleming in Brussels.The overall budget deficit in the EU is now forecast to narrow to (a still-lofty) 6.6 per cent of GDP this year compared with 2020, rather than widening as was previously forecast. The budget gap will go on to roughly halve next year to about 3.6 per cent of GDP before declining below 3 per cent in 2023.The improving numbers are driven by a confluence of factors, including most obviously the speed of the EU’s economic recovery. Brussels now predicts 5 per cent growth in the EU for 2021 and 4.3 per cent growth in 2022 (a hearty upgrade from its outlook this time last year, when it was pencilling in growth of 4.1 per cent and 3 per cent in 2021 and 22 respectively).Expanding activity, with more people in work and consumer spending unleashed by the end of lockdowns, will drive healthier government revenues. At the same time, emergency support measures are set to be curtailed early next year, easing demands on finance ministries.Member states are also tucking into the €800bn NextGenerationEU recovery fund, a large chunk of which is comprised of grants from Brussels. This external assistance will help drive an improvement in the investment-to-GDP ratio from 3 per cent of GDP in 2019 to 3.5 per cent in 2023, the commission reckons.So far so good. But there is inevitably a sting in the tail. Firstly, the commission’s outlook contains a number of “downside” risks which could cast a shadow over the rosy growth predictions. They include the ever-present danger of a resurgence of Covid-19, which might necessitate tighter pandemic rules and weaker growth in a number of member states.In addition, it will be harder to sustain rapid improvements in public finances once the rebound loses its ruddy early glow.Indeed, the commission is anxious for member states not to seek to pare back fiscal support too aggressively, and for targeted measures to remain in place.No fewer than 10 countries are on track to carry budget deficits exceeding the EU’s 3 per cent threshold at the end of its forecast horizon. And getting overall public debt mountains down will represent a vertiginous longer-term challenge.Overall debt-to-GDP ratios subside only incrementally by 2023 under the latest forecasts. And by the end of 2023, the debt ratio is predicted to remain above 100 per cent of GDP in six member states (Belgium, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, and Portugal), compared with three member states on the eve of the crisis.A slightly better picture for public finances in the next year or two is a welcome side-effect of the EU’s stronger growth performance. But that doesn’t mean the onerous legacy of the Covid-19 crisis on public finances has suddenly gone away.In the euro area, only Luxembourg is projected to reach a marginal budget surplus in 2022, with most countries deep in the red after deploying public funds to help struggling households and whole economic sectors in the pandemic. Outside the eurozone, Denmark and Sweden are also set to go black next year, according to the commission’s autumn forecast. (More here)EU trade ministers showed little understanding yesterday for France’s decision to block EU trade deals that could be finalised within weeks, notably the one with Chile, write Valentina Pop and Andy Bounds in Brussels.“All countries rallied against France on Chile,” said a senior diplomat familiar with the talks. One factor on ministers’ minds is an upcoming election in Chile, with the current conservative government hoping to capitalise on the trade deal. “If they are voted out, then the whole effort was for nothing,” the diplomat said. Elections are on November 21.Several countries, including Germany, will ask commission chief Ursula von der Leyen to broach the trade topic with Emmanuel Macron, president of France, in the hope that the deal can still be signed.It allows Chile to send 18,000 tonnes of chicken tariff-free to the EU annually, less than 0.2 per cent of the bloc’s annual consumption.Macron fears a farmer backlash in elections in April.Franck Riester, the French junior minister for trade, came out fighting, with a statement saying he had “defended French positions”.“Trade agreements should not destabilise our sensitive agricultural sectors,” Riester said. “We are very vigilant in the current negotiations, especially at a time when our farmers are faced with high market volatility in the context of the global economic recovery.”But Slovenia’s economy minister Zdravko Pocivalsek, who chaired the meeting, said many member states were pressing the commission to simply sign the deal.Valdis Dombrovskis, EU trade commissioner, agreed that the technical work was done but “there are political discussions ongoing”. “Any trade agreement needs approval by the member states and the European parliament,” he pointed out.But the prospects now look cloudy for other hoped-for deals with Mexico, New Zealand, which will want to sell more lamb to the EU, and Mercosur, a trading bloc of some South American nations, which has been offered a tariff-free poultry quota of 180,000 tonnes.On a brighter note, Dombrovskis said talks with Australia would restart early next year. Paris had blocked them after Canberra cancelled a submarine contract as part of a new defence deal with the UK and US.He said the recent commitment by Australia to a net-zero carbon economy had helped matters.Bulgaria will attempt for a third time this year to elect a government after a drawn-out executive paralysis, with politicians under increased pressure to focus on concurrent health and energy crises, writes Marton Dunai in Budapest. As a consequence, the likelihood for a compromise is somewhat higher than in April or July.The decade-long rule of conservative leader Boyko Borisov came to an end in the spring as he was seen as the main culprit behind endemic corruption, which has contributed to keeping the Balkan nation of 7m firmly in place as the EU’s poorest.Borisov’s Gerb party won the April vote but failed to gather any allies to form a government — but neither could other parties, leading to a repeat vote in July.The anti-establishment ITN party of pop star Slavi Trifonov edged out Gerb for a win in July but its opaque and unpredictable politics led to failure once again to form a majority political platform, leaving the country in the hands of caretaker governments for several more months.Two caretaker cabinet members even struck out on their own, forming a new party called We Continue the Change, which has gained enough support to be a potentially important building block for a new government.In the latest opinion polls, Gerb has been the clear leader again at about 24 per cent support, with the Socialist party and We Continue the Change each around 15-16 per cent, and the ITN party just below 10 per cent. Democratic Bulgaria also polled at about 10 per cent, as did the ethnic Turkish party MRF.Analysts say it may again be difficult to reach an agreement but pressure has grown on the political elite as energy prices soar and Bulgaria racks up record Covid-19 infection and death numbers while having the lowest vaccination rates in the EU.
219  Sweden no longer stands out in the pandemic, according to the country’s chief epidemiologist who championed its unique approach in the early phase of the crisis, as the Scandinavian nation prepares for a rise in new cases and hospitalisations.Anders Tegnell told the Financial Times that the sharp rise in cases in neighbouring countries such as Denmark and Germany, particularly among the unvaccinated, was “definitely worrying and we really take that very seriously”.But the architect of the policy to have no formal lockdown stressed that Sweden had one of the lower excess mortality levels in Europe, while on other pandemic measures it was closer to average.“Now, we’re two years into this and Sweden doesn’t really stand out. We’re not the best, but we’re definitely not the worst. That’s what I hear now: how much good did all these draconian [measures] do for anybody?”Tegnell’s strategy in the early stage of the crisis is facing growing criticism in Sweden. The official commission investigating the country’s response has criticised the slow reaction at the start of 2020 and noted that Sweden let the virus spread faster than other Nordic countries. But the commission will not pronounce on the wisdom of the no formal lockdown strategy until next year.Mattias Karlsson, former leader of the populist Sweden Democrats, told the FT that Tegnell had been “completely wrong” on several issues and that the judgment on him would be “very harsh”. He added: “Especially in the early phase of the pandemic there were a lot of things we could have done that would have made a difference.”But Tegnell himself is unapologetic. He stressed that “Sweden did close down enormously” despite the lack of a formal lockdown. It had empty streets for much of 2020 and almost no cases of flu and other respiratory diseases as people worked from home and avoided travel and social contact, he said.While his employer, Sweden’s public health agency, and others were still evaluating the commission’s reports, he said there was still little agreement on what worked against Covid-19 apart from vaccinations.“What they’re not talking about is what kinds of things did make a difference. That’s what we’re still struggling to understand. Some measures work sometimes in some places, but it’s very difficult to see a clear pattern,” he added.Sweden’s current infection rate is lower than much of central and eastern Europe, but higher than France, Spain and Italy. Tegnell said Sweden tended to have a resurgence in cases later than others and that he strongly believed the recent increase would continue in the coming months.He stressed that the authorities needed to look carefully at where the spread of the virus was happening fastest this winter and bring in focused measures accordingly.“Do we need to close restaurants? Do we need to close theatres? Do we need to tell people to work a bit more from home again? Because these blanket closing downs of everything, I don’t think there’s going to be much of an acceptance of that any longer,” he said.Sweden’s government took a more active role in the pandemic during the second Covid-19 wave in December and January, imposing new restrictions that moved the country closer to the rest of Europe, just as much of the EU followed Stockholm in declining to close schools in more recent outbreaks.And while Sweden has fared better than many European countries during the pandemic, it has done worse than all of its Nordic neighbours. Tegnell claimed that Sweden stood out more from the likes of Norway and Finland because it had more migrants from outside the EU and more poorer people.“Swedish society is very different from the society in Norway and Finland, which we tend to disregard because we share a long history together and have similar languages. Covid doesn’t care about history or language, it cares about socio-economic status or migrant backgrounds or crowded housing. That’s where Sweden stands out in a Nordic context, but not so much in a EU context,” he said.
220  The main Valsesia valley branches off into secondary valleys and in one lies the little village of Rima. My grandmother’s house – a typical stone and wood structure in the Walser style – still stands, and it is one of 50 or so original buildings. I spent my summers here hiking, swimming in the rivers and learning to sail in the nearby lake. Autumn is equally beautiful, with foliage that is so dramatic it’s like being in Japan. The mountainous trails are steep and challenging – regardless of the season – so whether you are deer hunting or climbing up for virgin powder runs, I highly recommend a guide to help navigate the challenging terrain.Rima is magical and you can completely disconnect from the rest of the world; it’s one of the few places left that are so far removed. I love to stop by Ristorante Alpino (+39 347 416 0781) in the main piazza to eat la miaccia – flatbread stuffed with local Toma cheese and pancetta. On the way down the valley, stop at the restaurant Il Giacomaccio if you want a hearty dinner – they serve the area’s speciality, polenta with deer, as well as the local Travaglini wines. I bought my first mountain bike here at Locca and love to ride the 100-mile trail almost year-round. It’s likely you’ll never run into anyone along the Balmuccia-Alagna trail that runs along the valley of the river Sesia. This is also a top-notch spot for rafting and fly fishing. In fact, Yvon Chouinard, the founder of Patagonia, came here to learn from local fly-fisherman Mauro Mazzo. He uses a very specific technique called Tenkara, using just a rod and a fixed line, and makes special reels. There are rustic, family-run places to stay nearby including Locanda Margherita in Rassa and the Ristorante Residence Giardini in Piode. But for real local colour, try one of the remote refugios – some are accessible only by helicopter. One of the most spectacular is the Margherita Hut, at 4,600m. You can hike up – it takes at least nine hours – and spend the night in Europe’s highest refugio, then ski down at dawn. For something a little more comfortable, try the chalet-style MH Cristallo.On the west side of the valley, the village of Mera is set right on the slopes and reachable only by walking or by cable car. Sleeping on the slopes in a mountain hut is a unique feeling. I learned to ski here, and have had magical winter nights ski-touring with the full moon lighting the way. In the past few years, I’ve returned to ski touring and I like to hike up – with the deer, foxes, rabbits and birds – before descending from 2,000m at the top of the mountain down to the village that sits at 1,000m. After a full day of skiing, you can’t miss a sunset aperitivo on the slopes at Il Baretto (+39 328 908 9493) – just grab a beer and enjoy the majesty of the Monte Rosa, which sits right in front of you in multiple shades of pink. Keep going up the valley, along the river Sesia, and you’ll find the towns of Scopello, Piode and Riva Valdobbia, all leading up to the main village of Alagna, where the road ends. Alagna is the most important ski area in the western Alps, with more than 95km of amazing slopes and a cable car that takes you up to the glacier at 3,000m. The area is known for its very technical, off-piste terrain that draws skiers from as far afield as Sweden and Norway.Malfatta is one of the best lines here and a guide is a must for the 50-degree chutes. There are some legendary guides like Silvio Mondinelli, who has hiked up K2 and Mount Everest, but Guide Alpine Alagna will also find you an expert who knows every corner of this complicated terrain. The legendary La Balma is another favourite run for fresh powder on the glacier. For a nice ski break, stop at a slopeside hut called Der Shoppf (+39 348 330 7292) to enjoy local food and get some sun on the terrace. There’s also a little bar for the end of the day – Caffè delle Guide (+39 0163 923 209) – where the guides hang out. Or try Cà Nosta in the piazza for a simple dinner before heading to Da Mario (+39 0163 910 28) for an epic gin and tonic to end the night. At the bottom of the valley is Lake Orta. It’s west of Lake Maggiore and about one-eighth the size of Lake Como, but there is still so much to do, including exploring the town of Orta San Giulio, which is full of piazzas and cafés but with few cars. Don’t miss a meal at Villa Crespi’s two-Michelin-starred restaurant, helmed by chef Antonino Cannavacciuolo – it’s worth booking well ahead.In the middle of the lake is the Isola di San Giulio, an island that is home to a 12th-century basilica and a 19th-century monastery. One of the most amazing things here is the Sacro Monte di Orta (part of a Unesco World Heritage Site of 20 chapels) that has incredible frescoes and overlooks Lake Orta and the town.This part of Piedmont is blossoming, with a new generation coming in and supporting growth. Like many regions in Italy, it is still under the radar, but its beauty and authenticity, as well as its proximity to the cities, makes it very special.
221  Hungary will cap the prices of petrol and diesel from Monday as the country tries to control rising inflation, prime minister Viktor Orban’s chief of staff said on Thursday, ahead of what is expected to be a closely fought election next year.“We have made a decision: the price of gasoline and diesel cannot exceed 480 forints [€1.30],” Orban said on his Facebook page. The caps on petrol and diesel will last for three months.European consumers have faced rising energy prices amid tighter supplies in recent months. Petrol prices in Hungary have hit records, climbing by about a third since the start of this year. Annual inflation has also crept up steadily despite a series of central bank interest rate increases, to reach 6.5 per cent in October.The energy price caps will help Orban claim ahead of April’s elections that he is curbing inflation, analysts say.“Fuel is a huge part of the inflation mix, and this quick move means that the lower prices will already show up in the November inflation reading, which can stay below an annual 7 per cent this way,” said David Nemeth, an economist at Hungary’s K&H Bank.“Then from December onward it can help keep a constant lid on inflation, which also helps monetary policy. Of course the elections are also a factor as voters feel fuel prices acutely.”Orban, who has often imposed tough measures on international businesses and challenged core EU policies, has employed energy price caps for a long time. Households in the EU member state pay a limited amount for natural gas and electricity and Orban has often said he will “stop the price increases at the border”.Nemeth said energy price caps could become unaffordable for Hungary if market prices remained high in the medium term, but added that any revision was likely only after the elections.Shares in Hungarian refiner MOL, which operates the country’s largest network of petrol stations and is the second-most liquid stock on the Budapest Stock Exchange, plunged as much as 6 per cent after the news, before stabilising at a 4 per cent loss for the day.Lajos Torok, of brokerage Equilor, told national news agency MTI that the price cap could cost MOL as much as €120m-€180m, depending on global oil prices.MOL declined to comment before details were announced on how the price reductions would be achieved. The government decree, which will come into force on November 15, is expected to be published on Friday.According to the European Environment Agency, Hungarians already pay the second-lowest excise taxes on petrol and the fifth-lowest on diesel in the EU. They also paid less than the EU average at the pump: about €1.40 a litre vs an EU average of €1.66, said Eurostat.The price cap would bring pump prices to the second-lowest level in the EU behind Bulgaria.“Energy matters are in a bad shape in Europe,” said Orban’s chief of staff Gergely Gulyas, noting that natural gas prices had grown fivefold in a year while electricity prices had doubled. “This led to a utility price crisis that European countries, with the exception of Hungary, have been unable to avoid.”Croatia introduced a similar fuel price cap in October, limiting the retail price of petrol and diesel to about €1.50 a litre. The decree was extended for a month on Thursday.
222  Alexander Lukashenko has threatened to cut the transit of gas and goods through Belarus to Europe if the EU imposes further sanctions on his regime over the migrant crisis on the Belarusian-Polish border.The Belarus president was responding to an announcement by Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, on Wednesday that the bloc would widen its sanctions on Lukashenko’s regime, accusing Minsk of a “cynical geopolitical powerplay” in funnelling migrants to the EU’s borders in an attempt to destabilise it.Lukashenko on Thursday warned Minsk would respond to any “unacceptable” sanctions.“We are heating Europe, and they are threatening to close the border,” he said, according to Belarus state news agency Belta. “What if we cut off gas to them? Therefore I recommend that the leaders of Poland, Lithuania and the other headless people think before speaking. We should not stop at anything to defend our sovereignty and independence.”European gas prices have soared this year amid concerns over low supplies ahead of winter. Global availability has tightened as economies rebound from the Covid-19 pandemic, with Europe competing with Asia for shipments of liquefied natural gas from suppliers such as the US, Qatar and Australia, while pipeline shipments to western Europe from Russia have been lower than usual.Prices eased this week amid signs that Russia’s state-backed gas giant Gazprom was beginning to refill its storage facilities in Europe. But they rose on Thursday, with the European benchmark gaining more than 5 per cent to €75.25 per megawatt hour.As much as 40 per cent of the EU’s gas comes from Russia, with about a fifth passing through Belarus in 2020, according to analysts. But EU lawmakers have accused Moscow of withholding supplies to the bloc in an attempt to speed up approval of the controversial new Nord Stream 2 pipeline through the Baltic Sea.Thierry Bros, a former oil and gas adviser at the French economy ministry and a professor at Sciences Po in Paris, said Russia and Gazprom would ultimately determine whether Lukashenko carried out his threat.“They control the transit through Belarus and if Lukashenko was to try and cut supplies, they have significant leverage over his regime and the option of rerouting gas supplies,” he said. “The key question is therefore whether Vladimir Putin supports Belarus in this threat.”James Waddell at Energy Aspects, a consultancy, said Lukashenko’s threat did not look credible: “[It would be] very hard for the Kremlin not to be politically tied to any Belarus transit crisis and that would provoke an EU response.”Lukashenko’s salvo comes amid growing international concern over the situation on the Belarus-Poland border, where thousands of migrants have gathered in recent days. Many arrived in Belarus by air from countries including Iraq, Syria and Yemen, and European officials say the surge is being orchestrated by Minsk in an effort to destabilise the EU.Polish officials said on Thursday that several hundred migrants had attempted to force their way across the border in the area of Bialowieza the previous day.Migrant smuggling experts from Europol, the international law enforcement body, are travelling to Poland after Warsaw requested their assistance, the European Commission said.Asked about reports that Poland was pushing migrants back across the border, a commission spokesman said governments should act in line with “fundamental rights” and that Brussels was “looking into humanitarian options and [migrants’] safe return to their countries of origin”.Von der Leyen has discussed the situation with US President Joe Biden. Russia has, meanwhile, taken an increasingly assertive stance, accusing the EU of fuelling “humanitarian disaster” for not letting the migrants in.On Thursday, for the second day in a row, Russia sent nuclear-capable bombers into Belarusian airspace. Lukashenko said the move had been agreed with Moscow. “We have to constantly monitor the situation on the border,” he added.The defence ministers of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania said in a joint statement that the situation on the border posed “serious threats to European security”, warning of a risk of “provocations and serious incidents that could also spill over into military domain”.
223  If it wasn’t so potentially serious, there has been something of the playground in this week’s exchanges between the UK and the EU in the brewing row over the future of the post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland.The Irish deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar warned again that the EU could have “no option” but to suspend the EU-UK trade deal if the UK triggered the Article 16 safeguards clause. There was even some talk that the EU was mulling immediate, pre-emptive tariff retaliation against the UK, although the specifics of that idea was fairly quickly shot down in Brussels and ascribed to French over-enthusiasm.At the same time UK Brexit minister Lord David Frost, in a statement to the Lords, took the approach that is guaranteed to wind up any antsy adversary: suggesting in gently taunting tones that the European Union “stay calm” and “keep things in proportion”.But the attempt by Frost to depict the EU defensive messaging as overwrought and disproportionate speaks to the fact that the two sides are viewing this dispute from opposite ends of a telescope.Frost is seeking to fundamentally upend the basis of the Northern Ireland protocol which left the region in the EU single market for goods — but he wants to frame this as mere necessary tinkering for the sake of the Good Friday Agreement.The EU has offered what it believes is the tinkering necessary to reduce Irish Sea border controls that are a core function of the deal — but wants to frame Frost’s attempts to upend the agreement as a breach of trust that destroys the foundation on which the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) is based.Given the scale of this gap, there was little in Frost’s statement that offered substantive encouragement that progress is being made.Frost said that the EU’s offer of some additional flexibilities on the border, while welcome, did not address what he called “the interlinked issues of the imposition of EU law and the Court of Justice, state aid, VAT, goods standards” that were raised in the July command paper.But that speaks again to the problem: unless you buy Frost’s new narrative that the Northern Ireland protocol (which he and Boris Johnson publicly celebrated at the time) was signed under political duress, then EU law was not “imposed” on Northern Ireland. It was mutually agreed, by both sides, in order to avoid the return of a north-south trade border. The point that the EU is trying to convey, therefore, with its sabre-rattling is that a UK attempt to resile from that agreement via Article 16 is not some minor bureaucratic event. It risks triggering an earthquake in EU-UK relations.Because, to the EU, the rejection of the package of flexibilities from the EU’s Brexit negotiator Maros Sefcovic would speak to a UK decision to eschew negotiation in order to tackle the practical issues raised by the protocol, and choose the path of provocation and confrontation. EU diplomats say that, in those circumstances, the UK could not expect “business as usual”; the Sefcovic package will have fallen, negotiations will have failed and the conversation among member states will have shifted into a new “enforcement phase”.If EU unity collectively holds on this point — and that is still to be seen — then the discussions over precisely how expansively the UK uses Article 16 may be somewhat moot.Keep up to date with the latest developments, post-Brexit, with original weekly insights from our public policy editor Peter Foster and senior FT writers. .Frost, in his statement, warns against a “disproportionate” response, alluding to the basic concept of proportionality that governs trade disagreements and requires any countermeasures, like tariffs, to be proportionate to the damage caused.This would be the case if the EU went down that route, but the blanket termination clause in the TCA (Article 779) does not require a reason.Article 763 of the TCA says that “the parties shall continue to uphold the shared values and principles of democracy, the rule of law.which underpin their domestic and international policies”. This is listed as one of the three “essential elements” of the deal in Article 771. The next article (772) then says that a “serious and substantial” failure to uphold any of those “essential elements” can allow either side to “terminate or suspend” the agreement “in whole or in part” after 30 days’ notice. There are, of course, other options — elegantly set out here in a flow diagram by Professor Catherine Barnard of Cambridge university — but termination or suspension is by far the cleanest.It remains to be seen whether the EU can muster the unity to take this route, but by threatening this ‘nuclear option’ the bloc signals that it has no intention of being salami-sliced by Frost’s tacticsFrost told the Lords that there is now a “short number of weeks” to reach an agreement. The next update will come on Friday when he meets his opposite number Sefcovic in London. The key thing to watch is whether the EU says it sees any “engagement” from the UK — something Sefcovic said last week was still missing — which might suggest that Frost is at least playing for time, even if he doesn’t believe ‘flexibilities’ will ultimately address the problem. But big decisions lie ahead. As today’s gross domestic product figures from the Office for National Statistics showed, inflationary pressures are building in the UK, with Brexit deepening the supply-side crunch that is slowing the country’s Covid-19 recovery relative to other economies. Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce warned that “surging inflation” was increasingly stifling economic output and the UK was likely facing “a sustained period of sluggish growth” with the economy returning to its pre-pandemic level next year, “behind many of our international competitors”.In Brussels the calculation is that it would be an odd moment indeed for the UK to start a trade war with Europe that risks weakening sterling and raising the cost of UK imports from food to fuel, increasing those already-damaging inflationary pressures overnight.Perhaps, as my colleague Robert Shrimsley bets, Johnson will ultimately retreat for that very reason; or perhaps he will roll the dice and bet the EU will not really go there; and then if it does, retreat after the fact.Either way, once again it looks like a rocky Brexit road to Christmas.The Financial Times is bringing together government and business leaders, public policy experts and investors to discuss the policies, strategies and investments needed to drive innovation, skills and jobs for Europe’s recovery.  to join the Future of Europe webinar on November 17.Many aspects of Brexit’s implementation, particularly by the Johnson government, have thrust aside the concerns of business in the name of delivering on the political mandate of the 2016 referendum. This is particularly true of the ending of free movement of people. But this week, as the rhetoric on Northern Ireland soured on both sides, the publication of the investment barometer by the Spanish chamber of commerce was a reminder that despite these new legal realities, business now just wants to get on with it — if it is allowed to.Spanish investment supports more than 150,000 British jobs, total trade is worth £36bn a year and — as the numbers in the barometer show — investment has been recovering since 2020 after dropping off in 2018 and 2019 because of uncertainty caused by Brexit.Lord Gerry Grimstone, the UK’s investment minister, spoke at the event to launch the barometer and was rightly full of warm words of encouragement for Spanish investors in the UK — as was his Spanish counterpart Xiana Méndez.The mood was positive and forward-looking, with a palpable desire not to slide back into more destabilising disputes, and yet there could be no avoiding the concerns among businesses that Brexit is far from ‘done’.As the above chart shows, the challenges businesses are facing as a result of Brexit are not subsiding — labour shortages, bureaucratic costs and logistics are all still combining to crimp growth, profits and investment. The event heard from a sobering panel of senior executives of four Spanish businesses — Santander Bank, Cellnex (mobile phone infrastructure), Exolum (liquid transport and storage) and Gestamp (car part maker) — who did not flinch about expressing their concerns.It is not just a lack of UK workers that troubles them, but the cost and bureaucracy of bringing in high-skilled workers from Spain — which is the other, often under-reported side of the UK’s new immigration rules.There was frustration but also real regret that so many decades of deep and fruitful co-operation between two close neighbours had appeared to count for nothing in the trade deal negotiated by the UK. Senior and skilled Spanish workers now face a full-on third-country visa process which is costly, cumbersome and — according to the panellists — risks negatively influencing investment decisions over time. What the executives wanted, first and foremost, was stability of decision making between governments, followed by greater efforts to reduce the barriers thrown up by the EU-UK trade deal.Top of these was a desire to improve mobility provisions in the TCA; and more broadly to move on from confrontation to co-operation and try to deepen the recovery in investment already seen in 2020. Surprise to report, no one could see the upside in an EU-UK trade war.And, finally, three unmissable Brexit storiesEarlier this week I wrote an Article 16 explainer, on why it has become so controversial, how it could affect relations between London and Brussels more broadly and which parts of the protocol the UK want to change and why. Read it by clicking here. In his column this week Martin Wolf writes about what he calls a “game of chicken” between the EU and the UK over the Northern Ireland protocol, which he predicts will end badly. Not wanting to stoke EU-UK tensions further, the European Commission has agreed to give European banks and asset managers more time to access UK clearing houses for the trading of euro-denominated derivatives.

224  Three of Austria’s most powerful businessmen have been charged with bribing a Green party politician to secure lucrative building permissions for property development in Vienna.Billionaire property developers Rene Benko, Michael Tojner and Erwin Soravia were among 12 individuals named in a criminal indictment filed by prosecutors on Wednesday — a copy of which has been seen by the Financial Times.The Austrian state prosecutor for economic crimes and corruption [WKStA] accuses the individuals — some of central Europe’s most prominent, and politically well-connected entrepreneurs — of bribery and abuse of office.The WKStA’s indictment states that property developers made more than €1.7m in donations to an Austrian-South African educational charity, S2Arch, founded and run by the Austrian Green Party’s Christoph Chorherr, in exchange for political favours.The indictment also names 21 companies, including Benko’s Signa Group, the joint owner of the Chrysler Building in New York, and calls for hefty corporate fines against them for facilitating the alleged scheme.The charges come just weeks after Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz was forced to resign in a corruption scandal, and amid a series of high-profile linked investigations into the role of dirty money in Austrian public life.Austria’s Greens are the junior coalition partners in the federal government, and have hitherto positioned themselves as a bulwark against corruption as allegations have swirled around their senior coalition partner, Kurz’s People’s Party.Chorherr, a former national spokesperson for the Greens, served as the deputy head of the committee for housing and urban renewal for Vienna from 2010 to 2019, a role in which prosecutors said he “had a major influence on building and zoning issues in the city.”Chorherr, 60, no longer holds political office.A spokesperson for the Green party said the party had “great confidence in the work of the judiciary in Austria and [we] are glad it can investigate freely.”The WKStA alleges that Chorherr, one of the individuals named in the indictment, intervened to secure positive outcomes on planning decisions on at least 15 major property developments in Vienna on behalf of donors to his charity.The projects includethe controversial “Heumarkt Neu” development in central Vienna — a glass and concrete modernist mini campus featuring a luxury hotel, apartments and a cultural centre that critics say endangers Vienna’s Unesco world heritage status.The donations to Chorherr’s S2Arch were routed via third parties in an apparent effort to disguise their origins, the WKStA said.“Regardless of how they were labelled, whether as sponsorships, donations, auction proceeds, licensing fees etc, they were in every case recognised by both sides as being connected to Chorherr in his role as a member of the Vienna city government and the projects.with the expectation of official approval for these projects.”In a statement, Chorherr said he was confident that the charges would not stand up in court. He said prosecutors had already questioned 16 officials from Vienna’s planning office, “[who] confirmed that. no illegal interventions by politicians, superiors or other persons interested in the [building] projects concerned took place.”S2Arch has received millions of euros in donations from more than 400 organisations and businesses, including the City of Vienna and some of Austria’s biggest banks, an adviser to one of the defendants pointed out, speaking on condition of anonymity. The WKStA was engaged in a witch-hunt, he said, and was keen to prove its mettle after its credibility had recently been called into question following its explosive allegations against former chancellor Kurz.Karl Liebenwein, a lawyer for Tojner, said that his client’s building projects in Vienna — which include the Heumarkt development — had been “carried out properly and without any [undue] influence whatsoever.”“We are convinced that the [charitable] donations made by our client is not punishable and trust that the court will clarify the matter in a positive manner for out client,” he added.A spokesperson for the Soravia Group meanwhile pointed out that the company and its chief executive, Erwin Soravia, operated “a comprehensive corporate social responsibility programme” and have donated over €5m to charities in the past 10 years, just €45,000 of which went to S2Arch.“We are confident that our donations have been performed appropriately and in the spirit of our social responsibility, which we believe will be confirmed by the court as well,” they said.A spokesperson for Benko and Signa rejected the allegations against them: “As part of its social commitment, Signa regularly supports national and international projects, particularly in the area of promoting children.The donation to this non-profit school project was one of many other contributions to non-profit organisations made by Signa; it is fully unrelated and unconnected to any official business.”
225  Supply chain bottlenecks and rising energy costs threaten to constrain the EU’s recovery from the pandemic despite a recent pick-up in growth, the European Commission has warned.Economic growth in the EU and euro area would reach 5 per cent this year, the commission said in its autumn report on the economy, quicker than the 4.8 per cent pace it previously expected.But it warned of “mounting headwinds” as a result of logistics logjams, strained supply chains and shortages of raw materials, which are hitting Germany, Europe’s largest economy, and other manufacturing centres.Brussels is also worried that an acceleration in Covid-19 cases could mar the EU’s economic prospects, especially in countries where vaccination rates are low.The balance of risks to growth had “tilted to the downside”, the commission warned.“The European economy is moving from recovery to expansion but is now facing some headwinds,” said Paolo Gentiloni, the EU’s economics commissioner. “There are three key threats to this positive picture: a marked increase in Covid cases, most acute in areas where vaccinations are relatively low; rising inflation, driven largely by a spike in energy prices; and supply chain disruptions that are weighing on numerous sectors.” The EU’s powerful economic rebound follows its unprecedented decline in 2020, with post-Covid reopenings enabling higher consumer spending and freer travel. Meanwhile, public investment is on track to hit its highest levels in a decade.The revival in demand has been so strong that supply is struggling to keep up.The report singled out logistics disruptions, shortages of semiconductors, and problems sourcing a range of commodities and raw materials as key constraints for industrial recovery. EU surveys suggest that roughly 43 per cent of the manufacturing sector has been affected by “severe shortages” of material or equipment, while services companies are far less concerned.The overall growth outlook should remain strong, with both the EU and eurozone forecast to sustain a 4.3 per cent expansion in 2022. However, the outlook was more unpredictable, the commission said.The EU’s industrial core risks being most heavily affected by shortages of components and materials. Germany’s economy is predicted to grow 2.7 per cent this year, slower than the overall EU rate, before it accelerates to 4.6 per cent in 2022.France, the EU’s second-biggest economy, will expand 6.5 per cent this year and 3.8 per cent in 2022, according to the commission. Italy will grow 6.2 per cent in 2021 and 4.3 per cent next year.Sectors where activity was surging most were beginning to experience labour shortages, the commission found. About 3.4m jobs are projected to be created in 2022 and 2023, bringing the unemployment rate in the EU down to 6.5 per cent in 2023 compared with 7.1 per cent this year.However, overall, the report did not find signs of mounting wage pressures from pay negotiations. In the second quarter of this year, negotiated wages in the euro area grew at a rate below 2 per cent, more moderately than in the period before the Covid recession, the commission said.
226  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.With EU trade ministers gathering in Brussels today to discuss the bloc’s state of play on trade deals with other countries — many eyes will turn to France. We’ll give you the low-down as to why Paris has postponed two agreements until after next spring and what other topics ministers will discuss.Rekindling our Thursday profile tradition, today we’re looking at Petr Fiala, who is likely to replace Andrej Babis as Czech prime minister — and who couldn’t be more different from his predecessor.And with the months-long consultation process on the bloc’s future strategy for defence and security finally resulting in a draft paper, I’ll unpack what the so-called Strategic Compass is all about.Trade ministers are preparing for a lively lunch when they discuss the bloc’s recent lack of trade deals today.Chicken and lamb are unlikely to be on the menu after worries about meat imports prompted France to hold up plans to conclude talks with Chile and New Zealand, writes Andy Bounds in Brussels.Emmanuel Macron, president of France, has an election to win in April and does not want headlines about cheap foreign food putting farmers out of business.He had personally lobbied Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, to ensure the deals were not signed until after the polls, two diplomats told Europe Express. When word reached Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s prime minister and many European leaders’ favourite leader outside the bloc, she scrapped plans to visit Brussels this month.That has sparked a backlash from other member states, which feel French electoral sensitivities could gum up Brussels’ policymaking wheels for the next five months, especially as Paris takes over the council presidency on January 1.“It is going to be heated,” said one diplomat, criticising the European Commission for agreeing to delay the deals. “Trade is an EU competence. There is a mandate and the commission should not be stopped by one member state.”“What is the purpose of EU trade policy? We are good at opening talks but not good at closing them,” mused another EU diplomat. The EU’s Comprehensive Agreement on Investment with China was shelved when Beijing put sanctions on some MEPs.Talks with Mercosur, a trading bloc of some South American nations, have dragged on for more than a decade and those with Australia are stalled by Canberra’s decision to cancel a French submarine contract to work with the UK and US instead.It adds to a sense that the EU’s sleek trade cruiser is being encrusted with barnacles slowing it down. In return for access to their consumers, who are becoming more hostile to globalisation, EU leaders say they must ask overseas countries to improve labour and environmental laws.The parliament and many voters are pushing for more and more conditions in deals on issues such as climate change and forced labour in non-EU countries. The Mercosur deal has been delayed as the EU tries to find a way to commit Brazil to protect the Amazon rainforest.Today’s discussion includes a request by the Netherlands, backed by Belgium, Luxembourg and France, to debate how the EU can better enforce sustainability clauses about labour rights and other issues in countries that are part of negotiations.“Is the Christmas tree getting too many balls?” wondered one diplomat in festive mood.Petr Fiala could not be a much bigger contrast to the man he is set to replace as Czech prime minister, writes FT’s Central Europe correspondent, James Shotter.For the last four years, the country has been run by Andrej Babis, a combustible, extroverted billionaire-turned politician. But if all goes according to plan, the central European nation’s next leader will be a mild-mannered former academic, who has authored publications on everything from secularisation to the theory of political parties.Like Babis, however, Fiala is a relative latecomer to politics.The bespectacled 57-year-old began his political career in 2011 as chief science adviser to the then prime minister, before becoming a non-partisan education minister. He only joined ODS, the biggest party in the rightwing coalition he led to a surprise victory in last month’s parliamentary election, in 2013.“He was not part of the political establishment. He entered politics a decade ago.as somebody from the new generation,” said Milan Nic, senior fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations. “This will be a new style, he seems to be consensus-orientated.”He will need to be.To oust Babis, Fiala’s three-party Together coalition has teamed up with a second coalition of the Mayors and Independents, and Pirate party. Between them, the five parties control 108 seats in the Czech Republic’s 200-member parliament. But keeping them together over a four-year term will not be straightforward.“I would say they are all centrist or centre-right parties. But there are different approaches, more conservative or more liberal,” said Vladimira Dvorakova, a political scientist at the University of Economics in Prague. “What could be a problem for Fiala is ODS itself. There are different factions, and for some, Fiala is too moderate.”Managing his coalition is not the only challenge Fiala will face.Even before Fiala takes office, there is speculation that President Milos Zeman, who asked Fiala to lead talks on forming a new government earlier this week, could still complicate the process by objecting to some of the proposed cabinet ministers.Assuming that Fiala can navigate that process, he will then have the small matters of a ferocious surge in Covid-19 cases, as well as vaulting inflation, a yawning budget deficit, and problems in the energy market to deal with. “He’s taking over in a crisis,” said Nic.Switzerland, Austria and Germany — all German-speaking countries — are experiencing surging case numbers far worse than those of their western neighbours. (More here)Forget FOMO (fear of missing out). Brussels has come up with a new phobia: fear of strategic insignificance. Or as they put it, in the latest draft of the bloc’s Strategic Compass seen by Europe Express: “to prevent the major risk the EU is facing: that of ‘strategic shrinkage’, or the risk of being always principled but seldom relevant”.The “compass” — a defence and security strategy paper — “is neither a crystal ball for predicting the future, nor a ‘silver bullet’ that will magically enable Europe to develop a common defence policy overnight,” the draft paper reads.Nevertheless, it puts forward proposals and assessments that will be discussed by foreign ministers on Monday, with the aim of adopting the new strategy in March, under French EU presidency — this being yet another Paris initiative with little buy-in from countries in the east and south which fear this will be seen as a side-project challenging or duplicating Nato.Here are a few of the ideas in the “compass”:
227  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
228  The author is a Polish novelist and playwrightDistressing images of mostly Middle Eastern migrants marched by Belarusian police to the Polish frontier are shaking Europe. Belarusian guards watch as migrants cut barbed wire to cross into Poland — and, if they are lucky, from there to Germany or beyond.Lithuania, facing a similar assault, declared a state of emergency on Tuesday. These scenes mark the escalation of a crisis that began in the summer. Several thousand migrants have made it across the Polish border and into Germany, but many have been pushed back into Belarus. As winter sets in, several have frozen to death in the forests that straddle the two countries.The use of human “cannon fodder” fired against the gates of Europe — poor migrants who yearn for a better life — is a despicable act. Its author is Alexander Lukashenko, the leader of what the EU rightly calls a “gangster state”. Behind him lurks Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, who has already signed an “integration plan” with Belarus aimed at unifying their defence and financial polices.Lukashenko’s aims are threefold: to distract attention from his political problems at home, to destabilise Poland and Lithuania and to sow discord in Europe. Distressingly, he is making inroads on all fronts, though the EU has backed Warsaw’s right to defend its borders. Still, Poland and Europe need a more co-ordinated, rational and above all humane policy to counter Lukashenko’s execrable actions.The story began last year when Lukashenko, fearing he would lose a presidential election, cracked down violently on the democratic opposition. In May, Belarus hijacked a passenger plane so it could arrest a journalist critical of his regime.By becoming a human trafficker, Lukashenko is lashing out at the European sanctions that followed. Since summer, planes have brought migrants from the Middle East and other regions to Minsk with the promise of an onward ticket to Europe.People fleeing poverty and conflict pay thousands of dollars for a “sightseeing trip” that they hope will lead to a better life. In Belarus, they are fleeced out of more money. For Lukashenko’s cash-strapped regime, refugee trafficking has become a source of loot.The Polish government is on the horns of a dilemma. Let the refugees in and Lukashenko will be more than happy to send more. Push them back and Poland violates international laws.The daily sight of refugees trying to enter the country has polarised Polish society. Some show contempt for migrants, while others defend their rights — even rushing to the border to help them.Poland’s government wants to construct a Trump-style fence and has dispatched 15,000 troops to the border. Each night guards are involved in ugly clashes with desperate migrants, darkening Poland’s image as an upholder of human rights.Anti-immigrant feeling in Poland is not new. In 2015 the rightwing Law and Justice party came to power after the refugee and migrant crisis, using Angela Merkel’s admission of 1m Syrians and others to scare Polish voters.Sadly, such tactics still work. The party is using Lukashenko’s “human wave” to stir up its base. Some of the language applied to migrants is shocking and dehumanising. But refugees cannot be blamed for trying to improve their life, nor know that they are pawns in a larger game.Though Lukashenko has scored some victories, his policy may yet backfire. Refugees flown to Belarus are sleeping on the streets of Minsk. He must be made to pay in other ways.Lukashenko hopes to blackmail Europe into stopping sanctions. The EU should ratchet them up instead. Diplomatic and economic pressure should be put on states and companies, including airlines, that have become accessories to trafficking. Other Belarusian officials responsible should be identified.As for the migrants, those who make it through to Poland should be processed according to international law and humanitarian principles. Those with no right to stay should be swiftly repatriated, those who qualify given asylum.Poland should work more closely with its EU partners, including the Frontex border control agency. It should lift an exclusion zone so international personnel and journalists can operate near the border. Such actions will not show weakness. They will demonstrate that Poland and the EU will have no truck with Lukashenko’s methods.The Polish government claims to be on top of things. It clearly is not. It should stop posing as the lone saviour of Poland and Europe from an alien horde. Only by acting legally, humanely and firmly can it call the gangster’s bluff.Letter in response to this article:Belarus border blackmail is the cost of EU sanctions / From Michael Williams, Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, UK
229  As Switzerland kicked off a mass Covid-19 vaccination drive, riot police formed lines around Zurich’s main train station. Their mission: to protect a new “vaccination village” in the station hall from angry protesters.“We are a civil rights movement,” said Nicolas A Rimoldi, a 26-year-old protester from the city of Lucerne who was one of several people arrested during the Monday protests but later released without charge. “The huge pressure that is being put on people, against morality, against the constitution, is just not right.”Some protesters carried Trycheln, the giant cowbells that are a symbol of rural Switzerland, where vaccine hesitancy is high.Despite being one of the wealthiest countries in the world, Switzerland has the lowest Covid-19 vaccination rate in western Europe. More than one-third of the Swiss population — 33.6 per cent — have not had a first dose of a Covid vaccine.Switzerland is part of a cluster of wealthy — and predominantly German-speaking — European nations at the heart of Europe with surprisingly poor vaccination rates. In neighbouring Austria, 33.1 per cent have yet to take a single shot of the vaccine, and in Germany it is 30.4 per cent. Case numbers are surging in all three countries.The high levels of hesitancy, evident among adults of all age groups and political persuasions, have increased scrutiny of the factors driving vaccine scepticism in German-speaking countries.In Germany, resistance to the vaccine is marked in the affluent southern states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg as well as in eastern regions such as Saxony. Markus Söder, the Bavarian prime minister, said the three regions had a large proportion of Querdenker (“lateral thinkers”) — members of a protest movement that form the loudest voice against the government’s pandemic curbs.“We have two viruses in the country,” Söder told a German talk-show. “We have coronavirus and we have this poison [of vaccine scepticism], which is being spread on a massive scale by the Querdenker and by parties like the [far-right] Alternative for Germany [AfD]”.In Switzerland, vaccine uptake in rural, German-speaking eastern cantons is often far lower than in the country’s French-speaking west and Italian-speaking south. In Appenzell Innerrhoden, 45 per cent of the population is still completely unvaccinated. But the pattern is not clear-cut. The mountainous, German-speaking canton of Graubünden has administered more first doses than urban, French-speaking Geneva.Suzanne Suggs, professor of communication at the University of Lugano’s public health institute, suggests that authorities in German-speaking countries have tended to be far more dispassionate in their health messaging. “It has been functional rather than emotional,” she said. The lack of emotionally resonant pro-vaccine messaging “has meant conspiracy theories have filled that void — they are often easier for [uninformed] people to believe”, Suggs added.Daily cases in Austria and Germany hit their highest levels of the entire pandemic on Tuesday. The province of Upper Austria — a centre of vaccine scepticism, with a population of 1.5m — has recorded more new coronavirus cases this week than the whole of the Iberian peninsula.In Germany, 14m people who are eligible to receive the jab have so far decided not to. In the Berlin suburb of Hohenschönhausen, locals queueing for injections at a pop-up “vaccination bus” gave a range of reasons for having waited.“I am generally a champion of vaccination, but I’m just not sure that this one is safe,” said Jutta, who declined to give her surname. She said she was still opposed to the Covid vaccine, “but I have no choice any more. They’re saying I won’t be able to go to work unless I’ve received the jab.”Polling by Erfurt University gives some indication why many Germans don’t want jabs: 80 per cent of unvaccinated respondents said they needed to weigh up the risks and benefits first, and 41 per cent simply considered vaccination “unnecessary”.Anti-vaccine sentiment intersects strongly with anti-establishment and populist politics. A Forsa poll conducted on behalf of the German health ministry found that half of unvaccinated respondents had voted for the rightwing populist AfD in the recent federal election.In Austria, the rightwing populist Freedom party has become vociferous in its opposition to vaccination measures. Last month party boss Herbert Kickl spoke about “terrifying” links between vaccines and tumours.Switzerland is gearing up for a November 28 referendum that will codify the federal government’s emergency pandemic powers. The populist Swiss People’s party — the country’s largest — is openly campaigning against the government. According to an October poll by Sotomo, 51 per cent of its supporters are unvaccinated.While it has become convenient for the German-speaking political mainstream to deride vaccine-sceptics as Schwurbler — which loosely translates in this context as “burbling yokels” — the reality is more complex.When MFG, a newly established vaccine-sceptic party, won seats in an Austrian regional election in September, 30 per cent of its voters were previous supporters of the far-right. But another 30 per cent were former moderate conservative voters, while 16 per cent were former socialists and 12 per cent ex-Greens.Many young people in the three countries are also opposed to Covid-19 vaccination — and government measures to encourage it. In Austria, around 37 per cent of adults under the age of 35 are unvaccinated.The average age of supporters of the Mass-Voll! (“Enough is Enough”) protest group that organised Monday’s demonstration in Zurich is just 20. It already has more followers on Instagram than the youth movement of Switzerland’s Green party or its Social Democrats.“This is about the future of a younger generation,” said Rimoldi.
230  Poland’s judicial reforms have put it on a collision course with the EU over human rights and the rule of law. Can the bloc adapt to accommodate its more awkward members or should it take a hard line? 
231  France has persuaded the EU to postpone signing two new trade agreements until after its presidential elections in April, angering other member states which want the deals to be concluded.The EU had hoped to finalise trade pacts with Chile and New Zealand this year but Paris has convinced the European Commission — which negotiates such deals on behalf of the union’s 27 member states — to delay the deals.EU diplomats said Emmanuel Macron, president of France, feared a surge in imports of chicken from Chile and lamb from New Zealand, which opposition candidates could use to mobilise farmers and groups opposed to globalisation as he campaigns for re-election.French officials confirmed Paris was not ready to accept the two deals as complete, on the grounds that farm export quotas and wording on environmental concerns still needed to be finalised.“We need to fully take into account sustainable development issues and agricultural sensitivities,” said Franck Riester, France’s foreign trade minister.The resistance from France has sparked concern among other EU countries, which will pressure the commission at a meeting of trade ministers in Brussels on Thursday.“We got very positive noises about Chile for the last couple of weeks and then suddenly nothing. We hope for a full update from the commission,” said one EU diplomat.Member states give mandates to commission negotiators to conclude trade deals, which are then ratified by national parliaments. Several member states believe the commission should have rejected the French request, the diplomat said.The deal with Chile would update a looser association agreement, and would give the EU easier access to secure supplies of lithium to boost its electric car industry and reduce dependence on China.One EU official said there was a “small window of opportunity” for a deal with Chile, with talks having started in 2017. “It is a really good deal,” they Said. “But the French are against it over some chicken.”The EU is a net exporter of poultry. It consumed 11.6m tonnes in 2020, with 650,000 tonnes imported. Chile, already the bloc’s fourth biggest source of imports, would get an 18,000 tonne tariff-free quota for chicken.Brussels started trade talks with New Zealand in 2018 and still has outstanding issues including data sharing and the protection of European cheeses. The EU wants New Zealand farmers to stop labelling cheese as feta, Gruyère and other famous marques.Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand prime minister, postponed a trip to Brussels this month because of the lack of progress.Her spokesperson blamed a “range of reasons, including the best timing of negotiations”.The UK concluded a deal with New Zealand last month.The commission said: “We do not comment on the trade negotiations with third countries until they are concluded. We also do not comment on comments or speculation.”
232  Brussels has vowed to broaden its sanctions on Belarus as it accused the country of seeking to destabilise its democratic neighbours by engaging in a “cynical” power play over migration on its borders with EU member states.Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said during a visit to Washington DC that Brussels would widen its measures early next week, targeting both individuals and also “entities”. She warned that Belarus’s authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, needed to understand his behaviour carried a price.Thousands of migrants have attempted to enter the EU via its eastern border in recent months, many of them having arrived in Belarus by air from countries including Iraq, Syria and Yemen, some via hubs such as Dubai.European officials say the surge is being orchestrated by Minsk in an effort to destabilise the EU, describing it as a “hybrid attack” on the union.Emerging from a meeting with US president Joe Biden on Wednesday, von der Leyen said the situation was a challenge to the whole of the EU, adding that “we have to protect our democracies from this kind of cynical geopolitical power-play”.“We will widen our sanctions against Belarus very rapidly at the beginning of next week,” she said. There would also be an examination of the possibility of sanctioning airlines that facilitate human trafficking into Minsk and then onwards towards the EU-Belarus border, she added.Earlier, Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki accused Belarus of “state terrorism” for engineering a migration crisis on its border and called for EU action against the airlines bringing migrants to the region.Morawiecki said the EU had to discuss “an effective blockade of flights from the east to the west”, without specifying what form that might take. “There is no doubt that Lukashenko is responsible for this crisis. We have to increase the pressure [on him] through the mechanism of sanctions,” Morawiecki added.EU officials are expected to finalise more sanctions on Minsk in the coming days. Belarus is already under EU sanctions after Lukashenko cracked down on protests last year following his disputed re-election.Morawiecki was speaking after a meeting with European Council president Charles Michel, who said it was legitimate for Poland and other countries to ask for EU funds to be spent on border fences and walls.“It is legally possible for the EU to have a physical infrastructure. But that is a decision that the EU commission has to make,” said Michel.Von der Leyen has previously said “there will be no funding of barbed wire and walls” from the EU budget after coming under fire from leaders including Hungary’s Viktor Orban and Denmark’s Mette Frederiksen at a tense summit last month.The commission has said EU funds can support member states’ border infrastructure such as surveillance and the use of drones, but ruled out barbed-wire fences.Earlier, German chancellor Angela Merkel urged Russian president Vladimir Putin to pressure the Belarus regime to stop “instrumentalising” migrants, branding this “inhuman” and unacceptable. Poland has accused Russia, an ally of Belarus, of “masterminding” the crisis.The Kremlin said Putin had proposed that EU and Belarusian representatives meet to discuss the surge of migrants. But Russian officials also accused the EU of creating a “humanitarian disaster” and trying to “smother” Belarus by planning to close the border.Putin told the Europeans to talk directly to Lukashenko, said a senior EU official familiar with the Merkel-Putin call on Wednesday.“He insists on direct contacts with the EU,” the official said. EU officials have not been able to talk directly to Lukashenko since the crackdown following the 2020 elections.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Poland’s claim that Russia was behind the crisis was “absolutely irresponsible and unacceptable”, but added that Moscow was “already providing all necessary assistance to Belarus”, according to Interfax.The crisis on the Poland border has been smouldering for months, but erupted on Monday when a group of hundreds of migrants attempted to break through the border near the village of Kuznica en masse.Mariusz Blaszczak, Poland’s defence minister, said on Wednesday that it had “not been a calm night” at the border. The border guard said 599 attempts were made to breach the frontier, with nine people arrested and 48 expelled from Poland.Polish officials estimate there are about 3,000 to 4,000 migrants on the border, many in makeshift camps.Human rights groups have criticised the Polish government for passing legislation allowing migrants found on its territory to be pushed back into Belarus.
233  China and other big polluters are resisting a push to bring forward the submission of new emissions targets to the UN as negotiations enter the final stretch of the COP26 summit.The UK, US and EU are among those demanding that all countries come up with new targets by the end of 2022, a significant acceleration from the 2025 deadline in the Paris climate accord.But China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and other big emitters are insisting on staying with the original five-year timeframes in the 2015 Paris pact.The UK, as the COP host country, aims to address the issue as one of the major sticking points in the final texts that will sum up the conclusions of the COP26 when negotiations end, according to officials.The first versions of those texts were published on Wednesday morning. The texts will still undergo significant revisions as countries fight over the language in the coming days.The document “urges parties to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in what is known as nationally determined contributions, as necessary to align with the Paris agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022”.The documents also propose to “accelerate” the phase out of coal, and of fossil fuel subsidies, but some negotiators warned those provisions were unlikely to survive negotiations in coming days.Significant rifts remained between countries over how to approach the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C, set down as ideal in the Paris accord.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the negotiations had entered the “hard yards” and were “getting tough”, in a low-key press conference on a one-day visit to Glasgow that was overshadowed by questions about sleaze allegations in his party.The climate summit was in the “nuts and bolts of international climate diplomacy”, he said, but there was “a huge amount to do.”“We’ve made a difference I hope.we’ve moved the ball some way down the pitch but we need a determined push to get us over the line.”Johnson said countries that had spent six years since the Paris Agreement “patting themselves on the back” were now trying to wriggle out of concrete commitments.“There’s really no excuse because we know what’s at stake here. We have been hearing it all week,” he said, quoting the leader of one island nation who had told him “if the big countries don’t do more we might as well bomb his islands”.Current national pledges that were submitted by 152 countries ahead of and during the Glasgow summit, put the world on course for between 2.5C and 2.7C of warming by the end of the century.To address the shortfall of the existing pledges, the UK and others had hoped to persuade countries to come back with updated climate targets, known as nationally determined contributions, next year.EU climate chief Frans Timmermans threw his support behind that goal on Wednesday, calling for countries to “come together next year” to demonstrate how they might reach the 1.5C target.“The EU and its progressive allies will continue to advocate for a call on all parties to deliver ambitious NDCs [climate targets] and mid-century net zero strategies, in line with a 1.5C trajectory,” Timmermans said.However developing countries say the text focuses too much on cutting emissions, and not enough on funding for adaptation to climate change.The 2015 Paris climate accord, approved by 197 countries, aims to limit global warming to well below 2C. However, as the climate impacts of 2C become starker, an increasing number of countries believe that capping warming at 1.5C, the much more difficult goal, is imperative.“The big piece that is missing is finance,” said Jennifer Tollmann, senior policy adviser at European think-tank E3G, referring to the need for rich countries to finance developing countries.Greenhouse gas emissions would need to fall by roughly half this decade from roughly 50bn tonnes presently, to keep the world on a pathway for 1.5C of warming, according to the UN Environment Program.The summit is due to end at 6pm on Friday, but could run into overtime if negotiators fail to agree on items including the timing of new targets, as well as rules for implementing the Paris accord.
234  UK Brexit minister Lord David Frost has called on Brussels to “stay calm and keep things in proportion” if the UK goes ahead with threats to suspend parts of the Brexit deal for Northern Ireland.The UK is seeking to rewrite the agreement’s protocol for Northern Ireland, which left the region in the EU’s single market for goods in order to prevent the return of a north-south trade border on the island of Ireland.The two sides have been in a stand-off for months over post-Brexit trade rules for the region, with the UK threatening to trigger Article 16, the safeguard clause either side can use if they believe the arrangement has caused “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties” or the “diversion of trade”.After inconclusive talks last week the EU’s Brexit negotiator Maros Sefcovic warned of “serious consequences” if the UK carried through its threats. These could include slowing cross-Channel trade with more intensive customs and health checks, or even ending the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which permits tariff- and quota-free goods trade between the EU and UK.Sefcovic met EU ambassadors in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss possible retaliatory measures that could be taken if Article 16 is triggered. The two sides will meet for a fourth round of talks on Friday.During a visit to Washington DC, also on Wednesday, Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said she and US President Joe Biden shared the assessment that keeping the withdrawal agreement and sticking to the Northern Ireland protocol was important for peace and stability on the island of Ireland.The EU had shown the “utmost flexibility” within the parameters of the protocol, she said, adding “it is important to stick to what we have agreed and signed together”.Speaking in the House of Lords on Wednesday, Frost said triggering Article 16 to suspend some parts of the so-called Northern Ireland protocol was the UK’s “only option” if negotiations fail.He said Brussels has suggested the UK can only take this action at the price of “massive and disproportionate retaliation”. He added: “I gently suggest that our European friends should stay calm and keep things in proportion. They might remind themselves that no government and no country has a greater interest in stability and security in Northern Ireland, in the Belfast Agreement, than we do.”Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, which is part of the Northern Ireland power-sharing executive, told the EU to focus on negotiations, not briefings, and urged Dublin to use its influence to squeeze more concessions out of Brussels for the benefit of Northern Ireland.In a statement issued after a “useful” telephone conversation with Micheál Martin, Ireland’s Taoiseach, Donaldson said: “Brussels’ devotion and loyalty to the protocol should not overshadow the wider interests of peace and stability here.”Donaldson has supported the use of Article 16 and wants the Irish Sea border scrapped. “We need to see progress or else the government must step in to safeguard the United Kingdom internal market,” he said. “Our opposition to the protocol remains resolute.”Frost has said since July that the threshold has been reached to justify using Article 16 because of the economic and political disruption the protocol has caused.But in an apparent softening of his tone on Wednesday, Frost insisted talks were continuing between the two sides and implied the UK was still weeks away from unilaterally suspending parts of the protocol.“There is still a real opportunity to turn away from confrontation, to move beyond these current difficulties and put in place a new and better equilibrium,” Frost told peers.He added: “There is more to do and I will certainly not give up on this process unless and until it is abundantly clear that nothing more can be done. We are certainly not there yet. If, however, we do in due course reach that point, the Article 16 safeguards will be our only option.”In a warning shot at the EU, he added: “If the EU were to choose to react in a disproportionate way, and decide to aggravate the problems in Northern Ireland rather than reduce them, that is of course a matter for them.”His remarks came as four senior Democratic congressmen in Washington published a joint statement warning that the UK’s threat to trigger Article 16 was “dangerous”.“In threatening to invoke Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol, the United Kingdom threatens to not only destabilise trade relations, but also that hard-earned peace. We call on the UK to abandon this dangerous path, and to commit to implementing the Northern Ireland protocol in full,” they said.
235  Brussels will extend its temporary permit allowing European banks to access UK clearing houses, heading off a potential threat to financial market stability when the arrangement lapses next summer.Mairead McGuinness, European commissioner for financial services, said on Wednesday the decision would be formally announced early next year to help avoid “a cliff edge” for EU banks when the permit expires in June 2022.The move is intended to give banks, other financial companies and asset managers more time to move more of their euro-denominated contracts out of the City and to the eurozone. Clearing houses are central to staving off market instability, sitting between parties on deals and preventing defaults from cascading through the financial system. London’s LCH still handles about 90 per cent of all euro-denominated derivatives, according to data provider Osttra.Brussels signalled its intent to award the extension as relations between the UK and EU have frayed over the Northern Ireland protocol, with the UK government threatening to trigger an Article 16 clause in protest at the Brexit trade arrangements for the region.EU diplomats said the move on clearing houses was made this week to avoid getting snarled up in broader tensions and possible retaliatory measures over the protocol.The commission, however, wants to see derivatives clearing business shifted back to the EU because it is unhappy about the financial stability risks of seeing up to €80tn of open contracts being handled in a market that is no longer subject to its direct oversight.McGuinness told the Financial Times last month she was determined to avoid any market instability over the clearing decision, which had raised investors’ expectations that Brussels was preparing an extension to its permit.The market has been unwilling to move from London because users can concentrate their portfolios in one place, net their positions and save millions of dollars a day on the insurance required to back their deals.But McGuiness admitted the June 2022 expiry date “was too short” to build up capacity over the medium term.“This proposed way forward strikes a balance between safeguarding financial stability in the short term — which requires taking an equivalence decision to avoid a cliff edge for EU market participants — and safeguarding financial stability in the medium term, which requires us to reduce this risky over-reliance on a third country”, she said.The extension will also give EU regulators time to assess the risks to the bloc from UK clearing houses such as LCH and ICE Clear Europe.“The EU has at last accepted that it underestimated how vital UK-located clearing services were to the EU,” said Michael McKee, financial services regulatory partner at DLA Piper. “Longer term, however, the EU will want to develop its own clearing capacity.”McGuinness said she would announce measures in the new year to incentivise clearing to go to the EU. The commission will also build up the bloc’s supervisory framework.The Bank of England earlier this week unveiled its long-term plans to monitor overseas clearing houses that affect the UK’s financial stability. The BoE said its plans would be based on rules agreed when the UK was in the EU and also on the depth of relationship it enjoyed with another supervisor, said Christina Segal-Knowles, head of financial market infrastructure at the BoE.“We’re trying to take an approach that is technocratic and risk-based.It’s very important for us at the BoE that these things are not politicised,” she said.
236  When Northern Irish politician Austin Currie smashed a window to break into a council house in the village of Caledon in June 1968, he was making both trouble, and history.With that act, Currie, who has died aged 82, helped launch the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland.His aim was to fight discrimination against Catholics by the region’s Protestant majority — a cause that even then, a year before the three decades-long sectarian strife known as the Troubles erupted, was to prove highly dangerous.“Some dramatic action was required,” was how he described his act of civil disobedience.Currie and two companions barricaded themselves in the house to protest against the fact that it had been assigned to a single 19-year-old Protestant woman, secretary to a unionist politician, when 269 other people were on the housing waiting list and many Catholics living in cramped conditions. The decision was motivated by a “very strong feeling of injustice”, he said.All the same, a politician hailed as courageous and principled during a 40-year career that saw him become the first person to serve in government on both sides of the Irish border, later admitted to being nervous at the prospect of staying overnight in case of attacks by Protestant thugs.He and his family were to suffer 30 attacks at their home outside Dungannon as Northern Ireland descended into brutal sectarian conflict. During one in 1972, his wife Annita was beaten unconscious and had the letters UVF — standing for Protestant paramilitary group Ulster Volunteer Force — carved into her breast.Although only 28 at the time of the Caledon sit-in, Currie, who with the late John Hume went on to found the Social Democratic and Labour party, was no stranger to conviction politics and controversy.The previous day, he had been thrown out of the Northern Ireland Assembly for calling John Taylor, a leading Unionist now Lord Kilcooney, a liar. “All hell will break loose, and by God, I will lead it,” he yelled at the jeering Unionist benches in Stormont as he marched out of the chamber. He used that phrase for the title of his 2004 memoir.The Caledon protest lasted only a few hours but made headline news. Building on the momentum, he led nonsectarian civil rights marches. The first, from Coalisland to Dungannon in August 1968, passed off peacefully. But the second, in the city known to unionists as Londonderry and nationalists as Derry, in October that year, swiftly descended into violence as police used batons on protesters.“It was like the charge of the Light Brigade,” Currie later said. “Police to the front of us, police to the back of us, no way out.” Nearly 100 people were injured.Two years after the outbreak of the Troubles, he took his campaign for justice to Downing Street, staging a two-day sit-in and hunger strike with other protesters in 1971 to demand an inquiry into the treatment of detainees in Northern Ireland.Tributes poured in both sides of the border for Currie, who died peacefully in his sleep at his home in County Kildare in the Irish Republic.He had moved south to join Ireland’s Fine Gael party at the invitation of its leader, Garret FitzGerald, winning a seat in the Dáil parliament in 1989.The eldest of 11 children, Currie was born in County Tyrone. His political career began when he lashed out at discrimination of Catholics in a speech while a student at Queen’s University Belfast, where he studied history and politics.He was elected to Stormont in 1964 for the Nationalist party headed by Eddie McAteer.John McDowell, Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland, called Currie a “responsible radical” who pursued justice and peace and noted that “in his early political life he did so at a time when it was not only unpopular, but positively dangerous, to speak truth to power”.He was a housing minister in 1974 in Northern Ireland’s shortlived power-sharing executive and struggled on in politics after it collapsed later that year, with no salary or seat.He later served as junior minister for children in Ireland’s 1994-97 coalition and made a failed presidential bid in 1990 having been prevailed upon to run, according to one former party colleague. He lost his seat and retired from politics in 2002, but remained in Ireland, raising greyhounds at his home in Kildare.Currie recalled the 1968-69 civil rights movement as “the most successful political action we’ve had in Northern Ireland”.Ireland’s Taoisoeach, Micheál Martin, hailed him as a “peacemaker”. President Michael D. Higgins called him a “dedicated, sincere and very committed politician”.For SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood, he was simply “a leader at a time when leaders were required”.
237  Germany risks becoming the eurozone’s economic laggard, as economists worry that restrictions to contain a fresh surge in Covid-19 infections will hit consumer activity and compound the supply chain problems already throttling industrial output.The German Council of Economic Experts, which advises the government, became the latest group to cut its forecasts for growth in Europe’s largest economy on Wednesday, warning that supply problems are taking a greater toll than expected on manufacturers.“These supply-side bottlenecks are slowing down industrial production above all, and Germany is affected particularly badly by this, more than countries in which industry makes up a smaller share of GDP,” said Volker Wieland, professor of monetary economy at Frankfurt’s Goethe university. Wieland said the country’s economic recovery remained intact, although it “will be a little delayed until the bottlenecks are gradually resolved”. The council cut its growth forecast for this year from 3.1 to 2.7 per cent, but raised its prediction for growth next year from 4 to 4.6 per cent.That would give Germany one of the slowest 2021 growth rates in the eurozone, where overall output is expected to be 4 per cent higher this year. Although the German economy declined less than most eurozone countries last year, it is expected to take longer to return to pre-pandemic levels than the bloc overall — although Spain remains further behind.For the fourth quarter, the council forecast the German economy would grow only 0.4 per cent, down from 1.8 per cent in the third quarter and well below the 1.2 per cent the European Central Bank forecast for the overall eurozone in the final three months of 2021.“Germany is increasingly looking like the laggard of the euro area,” said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg.Another factor that economists see weighing is the steep rise in Covid-19 infections, with almost 40,000 new daily cases reported on Wednesday, taking the seven-day infection rate to a new record high of 232 per 100,000 people.“The government must remove all the restrictions on growth imposed during the pandemic, by successfully stepping up the vaccination campaign,” the BDI, Germany’s main business lobby, said in statement in response to the economic council’s report.“The authorities must do all in their power to ensure that the vaccination numbers rise again,” it added. “We cannot allow a small group of anti-vaxxers to paralyse society as a whole.”Some regional governments, such as Hamburg and Saxony, are stepping up pressure on people to get jabbed by restricting access to restaurants, gyms and other indoor public spaces to those who have been vaccinated or recovered from the virus.Oliver Rakau, economist at Oxford Economics, said rising Covid-19 infections were one reason he recently cut his German growth forecast.“I think it is a bit under-appreciated that the services sector might struggle into the fourth quarter because if you look at the Google Mobility data, there are already signs that higher Covid infections are causing a slowdown in consumer services,” said Rakau.Just over 66 per cent of Germany’s population has been fully vaccinated.Wieland, however, played down the risk that another lockdown could paralyse the economy, saying: “If businesses are closed down, that will lead to a slowdown in winter. But I don’t think it’s likely that it will come to that.”He said so-called “2G rules”, preventing unvaccinated people from accessing indoor spaces, had spurred an increase in vaccination rates in other countries. “It can even accelerate growth,” he added.Katharina Utermöhl, economist at Allianz, said rising German inflation, which reached a 28-year-high of 4.6 per cent in October, would also reduce disposable income for households. “Consumption remains our last hope for growth in the winter months, but the downside risks to that are growing,” she said.The council raised its forecast for annualised German inflation from 2.1 to 3.1 per cent this year and from 1.9 to 2.6 per cent next year.
238  In another life Boris Johnson might have spent his days trying the handles of parked cars. The UK prime minister is a chancer, a man who believes in pushing his luck. He worries little about consequences because he trusts himself to get out of any scrape and conducts his politics with a smirk as if we are all in on the joke. It has been a winning formula.Yet there are costs, as Tory MPs reading unflattering news reports about their outside earnings can now attest. They know they have the Owen Paterson standards debacle to thank for the unwelcome scrutiny. Johnson’s half-formed wheeze to dilute the independent scrutiny of MPs and get his colleague Paterson off the hook for blatant breaches of parliamentary rules created a painful Newtonian backlash.Johnson’s rapid retreat also reminds his troops that for all the Churchillian rhetoric, he is often the first one heading for the hills when he deems the fight no longer worth his while. This is not always a weakness. Johnson feels no obligation to defend a losing position. But at least two Tory MPs are now facing calls for new standards inquiries because he did not game the consequences of his gambit.This offers larger lessons both for his allies at home and his adversaries in the EU as he heads into a new fight with Brussels over the Northern Ireland protocol, which, to the rage of Unionists, created a trade barrier between Britain and the province.No matter that he knew its import when he signed it, to Johnson this is unfinished business and he is determined to change it. He and his Brexit minister, Lord Frost, have thus far played a weak hand well. The protocol is unquestionably having adverse effects on trade between Northern Ireland and Britain and their uncompromising stance has secured concessions on goods checks, which they can argue would not otherwise have materialised. Another leader might have declared victory already, but the first lesson is that Johnson doesn’t throw in his hand while there are still cards in the deck.There is much in the current row that suits his style. For most of the year, he brandished the threat to trigger Article 16 of the protocol, which allows a side to suspend part of the agreement if it is causing serious “social or economic damage”. What should be an escape valve for specific problems is seen by Johnson as a lever to try to rewrite the deal.This moment is moving closer and has provoked bellicose retaliatory threats from the EU, though Frost has said the UK “is not there yet”. But if and when Johnson triggers the process, he can start small and ratchet up. The mechanisms allow for delays before each EU response, which means he can back away if the price, be it targeted retaliatory tariffs or more disruptive checks at Calais, seems too high. Even the nuclear option floated by Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney — of terminating the UK/EU trade deal — requires a year’s notice, giving Johnson time, though at the price of economic uncertainty.The second lesson is that Johnson will retreat when outgunned. The history of his Brexit negotiations is of talking tough and then giving in. The fight over the protocol highlights just how thoroughly he caved in when he signed it in 2019. A year later he accepted a trade agreement that secured few advantages. For all his fighting talk of walking away with no deal, Johnson never did. Since his core demands go beyond what the EU is prepared to grant, it is a reasonable bet that the same will be true again.The third unhappy lesson for the UK is that the sooner the EU responds with disproportionate force, the faster he will back down. Some in the EU clearly see this, talking of the need to show “escalation dominance”. Johnson will not long jeopardise votes on the British mainland for a trade war over Northern Ireland. His allies may cheer a premier battling Brussels but they and the media could quickly turn in the face of economic damage and empty shelves.This means his own cheerleaders need to give him the room to retreat when he is ready. And here is another warning from the Paterson saga. While blame lies with Johnson, a common factor in Brexit agitation and the Paterson episode are those Tory MPs, the “Spartans” who egg him on to hardline positions. Johnson fears and placates this rebellious old guard of former ministers and life-long backbenchers — the has-beens and never-weres — who destroyed Theresa May.Driven by an insurgent mindset, they convinced themselves and Johnson that Paterson was the victim of an anti-Brexit, left-leaning standards commissioner and a rigged process — rather than his own foolishness. Since the greatest risk to Johnson’s premiership will come when his MPs no longer see him as a winner, there is a price to alienating voters to appease unreliable allies who often have poor political judgment.Johnson takes a puckish pleasure in poking the EU bear. But it risks economic and political consequences which, as with the Paterson case, far outweigh the potential gain. The danger is more miscalculation. The EU, France especially, is losing patience with a man it sees as a bad faith actor. It too is capable of mistakes, pushing him into a corner with no line of retreat.Johnson will keep trying the handles of the car until it is against his interests. There is, of course, a price to be paid in instability in Northern Ireland. But where he is indulged he will keep pushing. It is not a bad tactic for the weaker party, as long as he knows when to walk away.
239  Brussels has approved a deal to buy up to 60m doses of Valneva’s Covid-19 vaccine over two years, boosting the jab’s fortunes after the UK government’s cancellation this year of a 100m-dose contract worth up to €1.4bn.Shares in the French vaccine maker jumped as much as 24 per cent on the news of the initial agreement, touching record highs reached earlier this year.Under the contract, which is subject to national reviews and approval by the EU medicines regulator, member states will be able to purchase a total of almost 27m doses in 2022. Crucially, it “includes the possibility to adapt the vaccines to new variant strains”, the European Commission said.Thomas Lingelbach, Valneva chief executive, said the company was grateful to the commission for its support.“We continue to receive messages from people across the world who are waiting for an inactivated vaccine,” he added. “We are deeply committed to bringing an alternative vaccine solution to the market as quickly as possible and continue to work tirelessly to achieve that.”The UK in September rescinded a deal for at least 100m doses of the shot, saying the company was in breach of its obligations under the deal — an accusation the company “strenuously” denied. People close to the matter said this was because the shot performed less well than others as boosters in a trial whose results have yet to be published.Valneva said last month that its vaccine elicited a stronger immune response with fewer side-effects than the Oxford/AstraZeneca shot. The announcement renewed concerns about whether the UK should have abandoned the contract, which has also been designed to increase domestic vaccine production capabilities.Officials close to the European negotiations said in September a deal with the bloc had been put on ice because of a glut of vaccines, with the EU having secured up to a total of 2.1bn doses of the Moderna and BioNTech/Pfizer shots for the coming years. Since then, however, Europe has suffered a resurgence in Covid-19 cases and hospital admissions.No money will be paid until a final contract is signed, which will be subject to regulatory approval by the European Medicines Agency, according to one person with knowledge of the matter.The shot, currently not medically approved anywhere in the world, hinges on the deployment of an inactivated virus. In theory, these types of vaccines could elicit a broader type of immunity against the virus. Vaccines currently used in the UK and EU target only one of its components, the so-called spike protein.Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the agreement “allows for the vaccine to be adapted to new variants. Our broad portfolio will help us to fight Covid and its variants in Europe and beyond.”European member states would be able to donate the vaccine to poorer countries, or to redirect shipments within the bloc, the commission said, adding that it had taken “a decision to support this vaccine based on a sound scientific assessment, the technology used, the company’s experience in vaccine development and its production capacity to supply all EU member states”.
240  Google has lost its appeal against a €2.42bn EU competition fine over its Shopping service, in a ruling that is likely to re-energise antitrust investigators looking at how Big Tech promotes its own businesses.The European General Court in Luxembourg ruled on Wednesday that Google favours “its own comparison shopping service over competing services” in its search results, rather than delivering the “better result”.Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s antitrust chief, accused Google in 2017, after a seven-year investigation, of abusing its market power to give an “illegal advantage” to another arm of its business. Some price comparison websites have gone bust since Google engaged in this behaviour.Shivaun Raff, co-founder of Foundem, a now defunct shopping comparison website that was an original plaintiff in the EU’s investigation, said: “While we welcome today’s judgment, it does not undo the considerable consumer and anti-competitive harm caused by more than a decade of Google’s insidious search manipulation practices.”Google said the judgment on Wednesday related to a “very specific set of facts” and that it made changes in 2017 to comply with the European Commission’s decision.The ruling is likely to be appealed. But it marks the first time that a European court has ruled against Google on an antitrust case.It also strengthens the hands of antitrust investigators looking to take on similar cases where tech companies have used their dominance in one field to successfully move into another. The practice is known as “self-preferencing”.“The rules gives new and immediate vigour to straightforward enforcement of existing competition rules without the need to await the new legislation being adopted and coming into force,” said Alec Burnside, a partner at Dechert in Brussels who has worked with complainants against Google.He added: “The ruling infuses more oxygen to Vestager’s move to tackle big tech. The commission took the Shopping case decision to establish a precedent and that has now been validated.”Nevertheless Raff said the EU was moving too slowly to rein in Big Tech, saying that in the 12 years since Foundem submitted its initial competition complaint, Google has not yet been forced to “end or mitigate its unlawful conduct.”Richard Stables, chief executive of comparison shopping site Kelkoo, said it had lost “millions of euros of revenue during this abuse and we are not seeing a fraction of that coming back”.The European Commission said that it would “continue to use all the tools at its disposal” to try to address problems in the market.Google is also contesting another two multibillion euro fines for alleged anti-competitive behaviour. It has been accused of abusing its dominance in the Android operating system and allegedly forcing users to use its services over rivals, and is also appealing a €1.5bn fine for blocking competitors in the online advertising market.The cases come as the European Parliament and member states are debating how to enact new tech regulation to hold Big Tech to account.Andreas Schwab, the MEP leading the debate on the Digital Markets Act at the European Parliament, said: “The decision of the court proves that the EU is on the right track.“Unfortunately we have lost a lot of time for imposing our rules on the gatekeepers. This will change soon with the DMA. In the future it will be the authority to apply the law again in time — and not too late any more.”This article has been amended since publication to correct the number of years Foundem’s competition complaint from 16 to 12.
241  In the forests on the Belarus-Poland border, a humanitarian crisis is in the making. President Alexander Lukashenko has escalated his contemptible tactic of “instrumentalising” migrants to press the EU to ease sanctions on Belarus. Video footage has shown Belarusian guards escorting columns of mostly Middle Eastern people towards the fences on the Polish border. Warsaw has accused Minsk of pushing the migrants across the frontier, and refuses to accept them; Belarus will not take them back. Thousands of vulnerable people are now on the border. With temperatures plummeting, many lives are at stake.Lukashenko’s broader aims are clear, and cleverly targeted: to widen fissures in the EU. Poland was one of several EU countries to reject “quotas” of migrants during the mass influx from Syria and the Middle East in 2015. It is locked in a deepening struggle with the EU over rule of law. Its conservative-nationalist government has publicly refused assistance from the EU’s Frontex border force in dealing with the crisis. A former foreign minister in the PiS-led government has accused the EU of “pushing to take control of our border”.The most pressing priorities are to prevent a calamity in the border area, and preserve EU unity. One aim can reinforce the other. Brussels should make clear through public and private channels that it is ready to provide support in handling and providing shelter for migrants, resettling those who qualify as asylum seekers, and returning to their country of origin those who do not. Both Brussels and Warsaw are wary of being seen to yield to blackmail. But a Warsaw government that touts its Christian values should make safeguarding human life its guiding principle, accept EU help, and during this crisis period allow those stranded to cross into its territory.The next imperative, however, is for EU institutions and capitals to step up efforts to stem the flow of desperate people being lured under false pretences to Belarus, as quickly as possible. Preventing migrants from reaching a landlocked country in central Europe ought not to be hard, but measures to date have clearly proved inadequate.EU diplomats must press countries of origin such as Iraq to clamp down on people traffickers and pause flights carrying migrants to Minsk — pointing out that their safety cannot be guaranteed and many may ultimately be returned. Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, says the EU will seek to target “third country airlines” helping to ferry migrants to Belarus; this should extend to charter and aircraft leasing companies.There are concerns in western capitals, too, that meetings between senior Belarusian and Central Asian officials may indicate Minsk is attempting to open a new front by attracting those fleeing the mounting human disaster in Afghanistan. That makes it all the more important for the EU to be ready to accept credible numbers of Afghan refugees — and avoid them instead being funnelled towards a Belarusian state that intends only to exploit them.The EU, finally, should be clear that Lukashenko’s stratagems will lead not to a loosening of sanctions over his assaults on democracy in Belarus, but to a tightening. The bloc has already targeted senior officials and the national carrier Belavia; it should be ready to toughen restrictions on lucrative Belarusian exports such as petroleum products and potash, even if this does some harm to EU economic interests. Above all, the EU and its member states must defend their values — by not sinking to the same level of indifference to human suffering on their borders as that being displayed by the regime in Minsk.Letter in response to this editorial:Belarus border blackmail is the cost of EU sanctions / From Michael Williams, Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, UK
242  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.The Brexit sabre-rattling over the Northern Ireland Protocol (and what the EU would do in retaliation) is getting louder as commission officials head to London on Friday. We’ll unpack the options to be discussed over lunch today by EU ambassadors, and look at why capitals are divided over how hard to hit back if the UK triggers Article 16.Also on the agenda of EU ambassadors today: Belarus and a fifth round of sanctions aimed at the regime of Alexander Lukashenko who is showing no intention in stopping shuttling migrants to EU borders. I’ll bring you up to speed with the latest thinking and what reservations persist among EU diplomats.And in transatlantic news, EU commission chief Ursula von der Leyen will meet US President Joe Biden in Washington today. With cyber security top of the Biden agenda, we’ll give you the download of one of his administration’s senior officials meetings in Brussels yesterday.Retaliation is the talk of the town ahead of crunch Brexit talks on Friday between the EU and UK’s chief negotiators — although for the time being the EU is keeping its powder dry, write Mehreen Khan and Andy Bounds in Brussels.Europe’s Brexit commissioner Maros Sefcovic will meet Lord David Frost on Friday in London amid talk of EU countermeasures if the UK triggers Article 16 to suspend parts of the Northern Ireland protocol. (Here’s the FT’s excellent explainer on what a post-Article 16 world looks like).Irish deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar yesterday echoed threats from his foreign minister Simon Coveney in calling for a suspension of the EU-UK deal that guarantees tariff and quota-free trade, if the Brits seek to rewrite the protocol on the grounds that it has caused serious disruption to trade within the UK.“If Britain were to act in such a way that it was resigning from the protocol, resigning from the withdrawal agreement.the EU would have no option other than to introduce what we call rebalancing measures to respond,” Varadkar said.Sefcovic will brief EU ambassadors and MEPs this afternoon ahead of his visit to London. But EU officials and diplomats have been quick to dismiss talk that there is already a fully cooked action plan for retaliatory action to deter the UK from triggering Article 16.Today’s meeting with ambassadors will be used to concentrate minds on the possible fallout from the UK’s withdrawal from the protocol and a gearing up of contingency planning in that event. “For many member states, Brexit has not been at the top of their radar. The commission wants them to start thinking about it now,” said one diplomat.EU governments are divided over whether to suspend the trade accord — a process that could take nine to 12 months depending on the legal basis. That would delay the economic impact, as the EU’s post-pandemic economic recovery is still fragile. But there would still be job losses and a financial hit, especially in France, Belgium and the Netherlands.Such a drastic step might end up getting escalated to EU heads of government. Ursula von der Leyen, commission president, would only recommend it if she was confident she had broad support, so the move is some way off yet.The EU also has retaliatory tools it can wield beyond suspending the trade deal.One possible punishment could be to overturn the granting of a data adequacy agreement that allows the free flow of personal information from the EU to the UK. The commission has the power to unilaterally renege on the decision that was granted earlier this year.The commission has tried to use leverage with little apparent success in forcing the UK to climb down. The UK’s application to join Horizon Europe, an EU-funded network of academic research projects, has yet to be approved. London has said Brussels has delayed approval to pressure it over Northern Ireland and hinted that it could go it alone on science spending instead.A spokesperson for the UK government told Europe Express that “disappointingly, there have been persistent delays from the EU. We have always been clear that our priority is to support the UK’s research and development sector and we will continue to do this in all future scenarios.”The UK’s Office for Budget Responsibility last month restated its estimations that the post-Brexit drop in total UK imports and exports would be 15 per cent lower than if the country had stayed in the EU. As FT’s Martin Wolf writes, this is twice the estimated long-run costs of the Covid-19 pandemic and, in today’s value, £80bn a year. (More here)With the situation at the Belarus-Polish border aggravating and Lithuania declaring a state of emergency, EU ambassadors today are set to discuss a fifth round of sanctions against Belarus, and hope that this time, they will work.Top EU officials, including European Council President Charles Michel in a speech yesterday, are now equating the situation at EU’s borders with Belarus with a “hybrid attack” and are considering including this on the list of reasons for sanctioning the Lukashenko regime.Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg also chimed in on Twitter yesterday after speaking with Poland’s president and said that “Belarus using migrants as a hybrid tactic is unacceptable”.In addition to more Belarusian officials and companies being included on the sanctions list, the EU is also considering punishing airlines from other countries, including Russia and Turkey, which are helping the Lukashenko regime in bringing migrants from the Middle East.This idea was first floated by Warsaw and picked up by European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen (their relationship still seems to work despite the frozen EU funds over the rule of law dispute) — but is being met with some scepticism among EU diplomats. Their main questions are: can the bloc really afford to ban airlines such as Aeroflot or Turkish Airlines? What would be the legal reasoning? (As a reminder, sanctions are often challenged in court — and sometimes the plaintiffs win.)A spokeswoman for the commission yesterday said they are still in the process of “exploring” the legal avenues for an extension to airlines from other countries.Peter Stano, the commission’s foreign affairs spokesperson, insisted that the four rounds of sanctions currently in place against Belarus individuals and companies are working, because Lukashenko “really feels the pressure from sanctions”.A top Biden administration official is in Brussels urging Nato and EU officials to beef up their responses to cyber threats as the administration tries to corral allies to better defend themselves against Chinese and Russian hacking, writes Katrina Manson in Washington.The visit to Brussels from Anne Neuberger, deputy US national security adviser for cyber, comes as the Biden administration seeks to elevate cyber security as a central, strategic plank at the heart of the Nato alliance. The topic may also feature in today’s talks between Joe Biden, US president, and commission president Ursula von der Leyen in Washington.“Both Nato and the EU bring significant contributions to addressing cyber security and indeed, we believe that each can mutually reinforce each other’s contributions,” Neuberger told reporters after her meetings.She said the EU could help with efforts to improve the security of both software and hardware and to establish standards for critical infrastructure. Nato, for its part, could establish norms for acceptable behaviour in cyber space, determine how to attribute malicious cyber activity and then hold perpetrators accountable, Neuberger said.The US helped rally Nato to update its cyber defence policy for the first time in seven years. The alliance this summer affirmed cyber incidents could trigger its mutual defence clause under Article V. Neuberger said the alliance needed to incorporate cyber into strategic planning and conduct resilience exercises and incident planning.Nato for the first time in June issued a co-ordinated statement about China and cyber attacks, when it acknowledged national statements by Canada, the UK and the US that attributed responsibility for the Microsoft Exchange Server compromise to Beijing. The EU also issued a statement, with weaker language.Erica Lonergan at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace is among those who have detected divisions between the forward-leaning US approach and European reticence. It was “not clear whether the United States has sufficient political capital to convince European states to sign on to Chinese sanctions”, she said in this note.The US has had more success developing joint responses to Russia. US authorities on Monday brought criminal charges against a Ukrainian and a Russian national for their roles in high-profile ransomware attacks, as part of a sprawling global crackdown on digital extortion groups.“The Europeans are further along when it comes to taking a stand against Russia, and this [effort] is to encourage them to bring China up to the same level,” said James Lewis, cyber security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.“The hope is the [effort] will help move things a bit faster,” he said.
243  For five months, the regime of Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko has been central to a game of cat and mouse on the fringes of the EU, with migrants funnelled to his country’s border with Poland and trying to slip across in small groups unnoticed by Warsaw’s border guards.This week the stand-off flared into something far more volatile, as a group of hundreds of migrants used uprooted trees, spades and shears to try to force a way across the border en masse. It has intensified a crisis that the EU says is being engineered by Lukashenko and which has put eastern Europe on edge.Polish officials fear Belarus could try to provoke a further armed escalation. Lithuania has declared a state of emergency. Kalle Laanet, Estonia’s defence minister, called the situation the “most difficult security crisis for our region, Nato and the European Union” since the fall of the Soviet Union 30 years ago.EU and Polish officials believe the surge in migrants arriving via Minsk on the bloc’s eastern border is retaliation by Lukashenko for the EU’s support for the Belarusian opposition, which has been the subject of a vicious crackdown since huge protests against his regime last year. Belarus denies fuelling the migration.Officials in Poland also suspect the pressure on their border also has at least the tacit backing of Russia, which helped to shore up Lukashenko during last year’s protests and is at odds with the west over everything from gas prices to the political situation in Ukraine and Moldova.“The narrow interests of the Belarusian regime don’t explain this,” said one senior Polish official. “It is going on with Russian consent.”Lured by simplified visa rules and extra flights to Minsk, tens of thousands of migrants from countries including Iraq, Syria and Yemen have attempted to enter the EU via its eastern border in recent months. Polish officials said last week that more than half of the 28,500 attempts to enter the country illegally since the crisis began took place in October.“Lukashenko’s tactical goal is to heat up the debate about migrants in Poland and other EU member states and take revenge on Poland for the support we offered to Belarus’s civil society and independent media,” Marcin Przydacz, Poland’s deputy foreign minister, told the Financial Times.“His strategic goal — and that of his patron in Moscow — is to destabilise the eastern border of the EU and Nato, to test the unity of Nato and the EU.”Russian president Vladimir Putin and Lukashenko discussed the situation on the Polish border on Tuesday. But while the Kremlin has warned Belarus to ensure the migrants stay away from Russia, it has refrained from publicly criticising Minsk as it moves to secure its hold over its smaller neighbour.Instead, on Tuesday, Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov floated the idea that the EU should provide financial assistance to Belarus to encourage it to stop the surge in migrants, comparing the situation to a deal that Brussels struck with Turkey during the 2016 migrant crisis.The Kremlin’s support during last year’s protests has forced Lukashenko, who for more than two decades has played off east and west, closer to Moscow.Last week Putin and Lukashenko signed a series of agreements, including plans to integrate Belarus’s financial and gas markets with Russia — though they were significantly watered down from original plans for Russia to essentially subsume large parts of the Belarusian state.Artyom Shraibman, a Kyiv-based Belarusian political analyst, said that by escalating the border crisis Lukashenko was trying both to force the EU to lift sanctions it imposed in the wake of the crackdown on the Belarusian opposition, and distract from his domestic unpopularity.“When you’ve got problems with your rating at home, you need to generate this threat on steroids and find new ways to force conflicts with your neighbours so that your own security apparatus remains well-toned,” said Shraibman.Maxim Samorukov, a fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center, said Lukashenko was using the migrant crisis to try to exert more influence over the EU and restore his balancing act between the west and Russia.“Lukashenko.thinks the only way to start a dialogue is by force,” Samorukov said.So far the EU has given no sign that it will give ground. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, has called for member states to approve further sanctions on Minsk, and said the bloc would target airlines helping ferry migrants to Belarus.Przydacz, the Polish deputy foreign minister, said the recent escalation of the crisis at the border could also suggest concern on the part of Lukashenko that too many migrants were stuck in Belarus — further eroding his own support. Polish officials estimate more than 10,000 migrants are in Belarus.“There are already quite a significant number of migrants who. didn’t manage to cross the border,” he said. “It started to be problematic internally for Lukashenko.”However, western diplomats remain sceptical that Lukashenko will back down unless he comes under pressure from the Kremlin.“Lukashenko knows that [the border crisis].will lead to further sanctions but he doesn’t care,” said one western diplomat, who said there were suspicions Belarus was looking for new sources of migrants to bring to Europe.“I guess if he is not being told — either by actions or sharp words from the Kremlin — to stop this, then he will probably continue for a while and see how successful it is.”
244  Hungary’s opposition leader plans to overhaul the constitution in a referendum after next year’s general election, saying the move was vital to loosen Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s grip on the remaining levers of power.Peter Marki-Zay said that within 60 days of taking office he would hold a vote on reforms to restore democratic checks and balances, despite fears that this would itself breach the constitution and spark a legal and political crisis.“We are talking about regime change,” Marki-Zay, who was chosen in a popular primary contest to lead the opposition in April’s poll, told the Financial Times in an interview. “It is not a regular election.”Marki-Zay, a 49-year-old conservative mayor from a small town in southern Hungary, could lead his six-party alliance to victory against the governing Fidesz, according to recent opinion polls.But the polls also suggest he could fall short of the two-thirds majority in parliament needed to change rules that have allowed Orban to exert tight control over practically all state institutions.That would almost certainly trigger an institutional crisis. The office of Janos Ader, Hungary’s president, and the constitutional court are both controlled by Fidesz loyalists and they would be likely to defend the status quo against any challenge.The government and some independent experts say so-called supermajority rules can only be changed by a two-thirds vote in parliament, not by a referendum as Marki-Zay and other members of the opposition platform propose.Andras Jakab, a constitutional lawyer at the University of Salzburg and a former director of the legal institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, said Orban was building a deep state but added “breaking legal continuity (was) a dangerous game”.“There is a risk that this would lead to a full stalemate in the state organisation, and possibly even to violent acts and serious social unrest on the streets. the solution proposed by the opposition is misguided.”Critics in the opposition, EU institutions and some European capitals say Orban has used two-thirds majority laws to limit checks on his power, safeguard his appointments to the public prosecutor’s office, the media regulator and the central bank and entrench ordinary legislation.They could obstruct a new government and prevent it from prosecuting corruption unless it also has a two-thirds majority in parliament, Marki-Zay and his allies have argued.“Orban perpetrated a coup,” Marki-Zay said in an interview in his home town of Hodmezovasarhely. “He went against his own constitution. He has already built up a system which grants him exclusive power and which makes him pretty much irreplaceable and invincible.”Marki-Zay said the opposition’s proposed constitutional changes were legitimate because Orban’s politicisation of public bodies itself breached principles enshrined in the constitution while corruption had also become widespread.Marki-Zay said he expected the proposed reforms to “come up in discussions” when he meets EU officials and lawmakers in Brussels this week.Tensions between the EU and Hungary have intensified in recent months over the Fidesz government’s respect for rights and the rule of law. Brussels is withholding approval for €7bn in EU recovery funds for Hungary and is under pressure from MEPs to trigger a new mechanism suspending EU financial transfers to Budapest.Defeat for Orban, a self-styled champion of illiberal democracy and a friend of Moscow and Beijing, would be celebrated in many European capitals. But if a new government were to trigger a constitutional crisis in Hungary it could leave the EU in an awkward position given its insistence on due process.However, Marki-Zay said the EU should no longer regard the Hungarian leader as an ally. “It is ridiculous to play by his rules,” he said.Marki-Zay is a political novice next to Orban, who has served for 16 years as premier. The opposition candidate began his political career in 2017 after decades in the private sector, including stints in the US and Canada. He is fluent in English, French and German.Marki-Zay pitches himself as a churchgoing family man (he has seven children) and a small-town conservative, with more appeal to most Hungarians outside Budapest than more liberal opposition figures.He secured the opposition nomination with a shoestring campaign financed by small individual donations. After edging out better-known contenders he also persuaded Budapest mayor Gergely Karacsony, to step down on his behalf, leading to a clear victory over the centre-left’s Klara Dobrev.A disillusioned former Fidesz voter, Marki-Zay was the first politician to unify the opposition against the governing party, winning a 2018 by-election in his hometown, a Fidesz stronghold. Local corruption turned him against Orban, he said.Running for national office, he faces a tougher job holding together an opposition coalition that spans greens, socialists and rightwingers. However, he said all six parties were united behind restoring Hungarian democracy, which trumped other policy differences.“When you are in a quasi dictatorship, liberty is the most important fundamental issue of all,” he said.
245  The writer is international policy director at Stanford University’s Cyber Policy CenterAfter more than a decade, democratic governments are finally waking up to the hazards of commercial spyware. Recent media coverage has exposed how authoritarian regimes are using NSO Group’s Pegasus software to spy on journalists and politicians. The EU has now tightened its rules on the export of surveillance technology, and the US Department of Commerce last week determined that Israel-based NSO Group and three other hacking companies were “engaging in activities that are contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States”. However, these modest steps do not go far enough: what’s needed is a global standard to reign in technologies that violate the rights to privacy, free assembly as well as free expression.From crippling ransomware to questionable neural algorithms which use AI to identify suspicious non-verbal activity, to face and emotion-detecting technologies, there is a proliferation of software applications which conflict with liberal democratic values.Traditionally, export controls are imposed on products that threaten national security, such as those that could boost the manufacture of nuclear weapons. The EU has recently extended its export regime to include spyware technologies, and added human rights violations as a criterion for potential harm. But since the NSO Group is based outside the EU, it lies outside Brussels’ jurisdiction. Without a wider international agreement, options for curbing these companies are limited.The absence of global restrictions brings further credibility risks: how can liberal democracies lobby against human rights abuses by authoritarian regimes, when they are in effect permitting the development and marketing of digital weapons?While restricting exports may help prevent the flow of intrusive technologies from democracies to dictatorships, imports and domestic uses remain unaddressed. The Pegasus Project revealed how, in the heart of the EU, Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban has deployed commercial surveillance systems to target the few remaining independent media outlets within his own country.Even some democratic states, such as the Netherlands, are guilty of procuring hacking and surveillance systems, but do not disclose which ones. Undoubtedly, they will claim these are only ever used to track down the most serious criminal and terror suspects. Yet this lends credibility and capital to an exceedingly harmful industry. If democracies are serious about curbing surveillance, they should exercise greater transparency and lead by example.More than ad hoc measures or restrictions applied to individual companies, the US should partner with the EU and other willing countries to set a new international standard for the use of, and trade in, spyware. This would be a tangible outcome for President Biden’s upcoming Summit for Democracy, a US-led virtual meeting in early December aimed at preventing authoritarianism, fighting corruption, and promoting human rights.Beyond spyware, a variety of other technologies deserve greater scrutiny and regulation. Illegitimate mass surveillance systems, facial recognition software and tools used for illegal cyber operations are traded across borders to facilitate repression, conflict, and instability. Poor cyber security is now a source of systematic risk which threatens national resilience. Greater co-ordination is necessary to ensure that technologies which are currently legal do not provide the means for widespread rights violations.Moreover, an international agreement between democratic states against malicious uses of technology will help set multilateral norms. UN human rights experts this week raised the alarm once more about how tech companies serve as modern-day “mercenaries”. “Private actors provide a wide range of military and security services in cyber space, including data collection, intelligence and surveillance,” they warned.In the future, a licensing requirement should be the default for tech companies that contravene the human rights standard of democratic states. This would ensure better controls of end use and exports. Regulation would also allow for mapping of how software is being deployed, and enable greater transparency. Equally, companies should strengthen their own risk-management. The very credibility of democracies is at stake when tech companies can undermine global security unhindered.
246  President Emmanuel Macron has announced that French over-65s will need Covid-19 booster jabs if they want to eat out or make long-distance journeys from next month, in a move that suggests all adults will eventually require a third injection against the virus if they want to continue to live normally.In a half-hour television address to the nation — his ninth since the start of the pandemic last year — Macron said the country needed to accelerate the rollout of boosters, injections that are currently available only for the vulnerable and those aged over 65 but whose adoption by those eligible has been slow.Anyone vaccinated more than six months previously will from December 15 need a booster to validate the “health pass” on mobile phones that is needed to get into bars, cafés and other public venues as well as to board flights. The booster rollout will meanwhile be extended to include the over-50s.France has one of the strictest regimes for persuading its citizens to adopt the vaccine, and has fully covered over 50m people, or 87 per cent of the over-12s. Vaccinations are obligatory for health workers.“Get vaccinated,” Macron urged the 6m French who have so far refused even one dose, noting that the unvaccinated were 11 times more likely than the vaccinated to need intensive care in hospital for Covid-19. “Get vaccinated to live normally.Being free in a nation such as France also means being responsible.”Macron, who is expected to stand for re-election to the presidency in April next year, also boasted of his administration’s economic record and its programmes to protect businesses and employees from the effects of the pandemic. The size of France’s economy has returned to its pre-pandemic level and unemployment is at its lowest for nearly 15 years.“Our economy is creating jobs as never before,” he said. “For the last four years, work has been better rewarded.” Macron defended stricter conditions being introduced for unemployment benefits and declared that he would continue next year with controversial reforms to France’s costly, complicated and unequal pensions systems. He did not shy away from insisting that this would mean increasing the retirement age. “Work is our compass,” he said. “It’s through work that we can preserve our social model.” He also implicitly criticised political rivals from the right who have come out against wind farms and those from the ecological left who want to stop the building of more nuclear power stations. “We will for the first time in decades relaunch the construction of nuclear reactors in our country and continue to develop renewable energies,” Macron said.
247  The EU will have “no option” but to retaliate if the UK goes ahead with threats to suspend parts of the Brexit deal for Northern Ireland in the coming days, Ireland’s deputy prime minister has warned.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said Ireland had begun to “dust down” contingency preparations in case London acts unilaterally to suspend some parts of the so-called Northern Ireland protocol, fuelling concerns that disagreements over Brexit may spark an EU-UK trade war.Relations between London and Brussels have soured rapidly as the UK seeks to rewrite the post-Brexit trade deal for Northern Ireland, which left the region in the EU’s customs union and single market in order to prevent the return of a north-south trade border in Ireland.That arrangement, which the UK now says is “not sustainable”, was agreed to preserve the landmark 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which ended three decades of sectarian conflict. All of the region’s mainly Protestant Unionist parties have rejected the protocol, saying the arrangements undermine their place within the UK.London says concessions made last month by Brussels to reduce the impact of checks on goods travelling between the Great Britain and Northern Ireland across a new customs border in the Irish Sea do not go far enough.Varadkar told RTÉ radio on Tuesday that if Britain triggered Article 16 clause of the protocol to unilaterally suspend key parts of the deal, the European Commission could be forced to scrap the post-Brexit Trade and Cooperation Agreement.However, that hardline stance has split EU member states. Countries such as France and Ireland are pushing for tougher measures, but EU officials and diplomats have played down talk of pre-emptive measures against the UK. “We are not there yet,” said one official.Brexit commissioner Maros Sefcovic will brief EU ambassadors and MEPs on Wednesday ahead of a meeting with Lord David Frost, the UK Brexit minister, on Friday.“I don’t think anybody wants to see the European Union suspending the Trade and Cooperation Agreement with Britain, but if Britain were to act in such a way that it was resigning from the protocol, resigning from the withdrawal agreement, I think the European Union would have no option other than to.respond,” Varadkar said.Legal experts said a UK decision to suspend parts of the deal on Northern Ireland would undermine the basis on which the EU had agreed the zero-tariff, zero-quota trade deal.“If the UK is pulling the plug on substantive provisions of that withdrawal agreement, the EU could argue it gives them grounds to terminate [the TCA],” said Catherine Barnard, professor of EU law at Cambridge university.Frost has said since July that the threshold has already been reached to justify using Article 16 because of the economic and political disruption the protocol has caused.One diplomat described a meeting last week between Frost and Sefcovic in Brussels last week as “cold” and “their worst ever.They’re just talking past each other”.Senior EU diplomats said consensus was growing among member states that it could not be “business as usual” if the UK resorted to Article 16. “No short-term measures have been decided but there will be talks about potentially suspending the TCA,” said one EU diplomat.
248  A new scorecard from the UN has found that countries’ 2030 climate targets are still far off track from Paris climate accord goals and would lead to a temperature increase of up to 2.7C by the end of the century, despite dozens of new pledges in recent days.With many last-minute targets submitted during the opening days of the COP26 climate summit, the new UN tally finds that 152 countries have now published new climate targets, covering 88 per cent of global emissions.But when the current climate targets are taken into account, a temperature increase of between 2.5C and 2.7C is projected by 2100, according to an updated Emissions Gap Report published on Tuesday.In the 2015 Paris climate accord, signatories committed to limiting the global temperature rise to well below 2C, ideally around 1.5C, compared with pre-industrial times. Global temperatures have already risen around 1.1C.Those targets will lead to emissions of about 51.5bn tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030, which is about 500m tonnes lower than previously projected before the update.Frans Timmermans, the EU’s vice-president for green policy, told the conference on Wednesday: “The honest truth is we are not where we need to be, not even close.” He said that the promises and deals struck during the first week were still not enough to limit warming to 1.5C. “The rhetoric, sadly, is not followed by action. We all need to get cracking and we all need to do it now,” he said.Separately, new calculations from Climate Action Tracker found that existing 2030 climate targets equate to around 2.4C of warming, although this would drop to 2.1C if long-term net zero targets were included.The non-profit scientific analysis group said many net zero targets announced recently lacked credibility and implementation plans. “These net zero targets are just lip service to real climate action,” said Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics, which is behind the tracker.The Climate Action Tracker study projects that global greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 will be about double what would be necessary to curb warming to a maximum of 1.5C.As part of our coverage of COP26 we want to hear from you.

249  Russian state gas group Gazprom has begun to fill some of its storage facilities in Europe in the first significant sign it is prepared to act on a promise by President Vladimir Putin to help assuage the continent’s energy crisis.Gazprom on Tuesday said it had “determined the volumes and routes for transporting the gas” to four sites in Germany and one in Austria, without adding any further details.Putin had promised the company would this week start filling some of its depleted storage sites in Europe after it let volumes of gas there fall to unusually low levels.The move is the first tentative sign Russia may increase exports to western Europe as soaring gas prices have pushed the region to the brink of a full-blown energy crisis. Some European lawmakers have blamed the problems on Moscow limiting supplies.Strong demand globally, a drop in wind power generation and rising consumption of liquefied natural gas in Asia have left European consumers hoping for help from Russia, which provides 40 per cent of the continent’s gas.But markets reacted tepidly after it became clear Russia would not increase supply volumes enough to stave off worries that even a slightly colder winter than expected could create gas shortages in Europe.The European benchmark contract was down only 1 per cent in early afternoon trading on Tuesday to €77.75 per megawatt hour, while the UK contract for December delivery slipped almost 3 per cent to £1.97 per therm.Prices fell further later in the session after Gazprom booked additional pipeline capacity through Ukraine, allowing it to further boost exports on Wednesday, although still by a relatively small amount.“The market must be assuming these bookings continue to rise,” said James Huckstepp at S&P Global Platts.Other analysts agreed there was still reason for caution, with Russian exports to western Europe lower than last year.“It’s a start, but the volumes delivered [from Gazprom] so far are underwhelming and not nearly enough to significantly lower prices,” said Tom Marzec-Manser at ICIS, a consultancy.“On both the Polish and Ukrainian routes Gazprom is still delivering below their booked capacity — they are sending more than the very low levels in September and October but it’s still nowhere near comparable to 2020 or 2019.”Putin had ordered Gazprom to start filling its European storage facilities by this week after it finished stocking Russian inventories. But the president has said any further gas supplies would have to come via the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which bypasses traditional transit routes via Ukraine to supply Germany through the Baltic Sea.Moscow has denied claims by some European policymakers that Gazprom was exacerbating the gas crisis by limiting export volumes to speed the pipeline’s regulatory approval, which is not expected before the end of the year at the earliest.Sergiy Makogon, head of the Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine, said Gazprom had booked an extra 20m cubic metres a day of pipeline capacity through Ukraine, taking total supplies to about 110m cubic metres a day. But the increase in volume was nowhere near the level needed, he added.“The figure at the same time last year was about 180m cubic metres a day and 2020 was a low gas-demand year in Europe due to Covid,” Makogon said. “Now we have high demand, low storage, highest prices ever, but the volumes are half of what they were.”Gazprom has eight European underground storage sites outside Russia, including four in Germany — Jemgum, Katharina, Rehden and Etzel — and one in Austria, Haidach.Mitch Jennings, oil and gas analyst at Sova Capital, said data to be released in the next few days would show whether Gazprom was withholding gas deliberately by revealing how much the state energy company had topped up storage.Data from industry body Gas Infrastructure Europe show that as of November 7, storage at the Rehden site in Germany was significantly below historic levels — only 9.6 per cent full.Jennings estimated that filling the Haidach, Jemgum and Katharina sites would require about 9.2bn cubic metres, whereas Rehden needed almost 40bn cubic metres. “Clearly Rehden can’t be filled this year,” he said.
250  The EU has accused autocratic Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko’s regime of “gangster” behaviour for luring migrants to Europe under “false pretences” and encouraging them to enter the bloc illegally.Tens of thousands of migrants have attempted to enter the EU via Belarus in recent months, in a surge that officials believe is orchestrated by Minsk in retaliation for the bloc’s support for Belarus’s opposition.The crisis, which has smouldered since the summer, erupted on Monday after a group of hundreds of migrants used tree trunks, spades and shears to try to force their way into Poland near the border village of Kuznica, where they were repelled by Polish security forces.“The way Lukashenko’s regime is conducting this operation is very inhuman, unacceptable and actually illegal,” EU commission spokesperson Peter Stano said on Tuesday. “The Lukashenko regime is starting to behave as a gangster regime.”Poland has deployed thousands of troops to its eastern frontier to reinforce the border guard and on Tuesday morning it closed the check point at Kuznica, one of three crossings into Belarus. Officials estimate between 3,000 and 4,000 migrants are at the border.Lithuania on Tuesday declared a state of emergency at its own border with Belarus to prevent migrants from entering.Warsaw has received backing from across the EU, with commission president Ursula von der Leyen calling for member states to impose further sanctions on Lukashenko. Germany’s interior minister Horst Seehofer has urged the bloc to help Poland cope with the surge in migrants.“What is happening now [is] a hybrid threat,” Seehofer said in an interview with Germany’s Bild newspaper. “We want controlled migration to Europe, not politically organised migration.”Commission officials are also considering imposing sanctions on airlines from countries such as Turkey and Russia that they believe are involved in “migrant trafficking” to Belarus.However, Lukashenko appeared to be emboldened by support from his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin after talking with him on the phone on Tuesday and sending his foreign minister for two days of talks in Moscow.Russian support was crucial for Lukashenko in staving off a huge wave of protests against his dubious re-election last summer. In return, Moscow has pushed Minsk to adopt a number of economic agreements that bind the two countries closer together, several of which the two presidents signed last week.In an interview broadcast on Belarusian state media on Tuesday, Lukashenko said the EU was attempting to divert attention from its own domestic problems by blaming Belarus for the crisis and suggested that the border tensions could be a prelude to full-on military conflict.“They have problems going through the roof. Nothing to do with us. People are upset,” Lukashenko said. “How do you sweep it under the rug? By calling someone an idiot, a low-life, a scumbag, who’s going to attack Poland tomorrow.”In a sign of Russian support, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov in turn said that Belarusian forces were treating the migrants “very responsibly” and claimed the crisis was blowback from western interventionist policy in the Middle East.Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov suggested that the EU should provide financial assistance to Belarus to encourage it to stop the surge in migrants, comparing the situation to Brussels’ deal with Turkey during the 2015 migrant crisis. He added that Europe had a responsibility to accept the migrants.“They don’t want to stay in Belarus, they want to go to Europe, that same Europe that has been advertising and promoting its way of life for may years. You need to answer for your own words and deeds,” Lavrov said, according to Interfax.
251  France has handed back 26 royal treasures and works of art looted from its former colony of Benin, in part fulfilment of a promise by President Emmanuel Macron four years ago to forge a new relationship with Africa.In a ceremony at the Elysée Palace on Tuesday, Roselyne Bachelot and Jean-Michel Abimbola, culture ministers of the two countries, signed an agreement to transfer ownership of a royal throne, statues of kings and other objects to Benin after 130 years in France.France, like other colonial powers such as Britain, has struggled for decades with the questions of whether and how to return the spoils of war to the places from which they were taken.Patrice Talon, Benin’s president, was in Paris to witness the handover and expressed his country’s gratitude to Macron, but he also said the return of the 26 artefacts was “just the first stage”. He added: “How can you expect my enthusiasm to be complete when works such as the [image of the] god Gou and the Fâ divination tablet are still held here in France, to the detriment of their real owners?”Macron called the ceremony “a symbolic moment, moving and historic, which was so long awaited and unexpected”. Six months after he was elected in 2017, Macron gave a speech at the University of Ouagadougou in the west African state of Burkina Faso in which he declared the end of “Françafrique”, the old French strategy of exerting military, political and commercial influence over its former colonies.French troops today remain bogged down in anti-Islamist operations in the Sahel, but France has now made a first step in implementing Macron’s pledge on cultural heritage.Among other promises, Macron said in Ouagadougou that he wanted “the conditions to be right in five years for the temporary or permanent restitution of African heritage to Africa.[It] can be displayed in Paris but also in Dakar, Lagos and Cotonou — that will be one of my priorities.”Among the objects from the 18th and 19th century kingdom of Abomey, known at the time in Europe as Dahomey, to be flown back on Wednesday for display in Benin are the throne of King Ghézo and a totemic statue of King Béhanzin as half-man, half-fish, looted by French colonial troops when they sacked the royal palace in 1892. They have been on display at the Quai Branly Jacques Chirac museum in Paris.Emmanuel Kasarhérou, the museum’s president, said in an interview with the Libération newspaper that he was a little nostalgic about losing artefacts that had been almost constantly on display since they were received by the Trocadero ethnographic museum in 1895.But he added: “It is no longer acceptable at an institution like ours to present to the public objects acquired in a context of violence.”
252  Seán FitzPatrick, the banker who came to symbolise Ireland’s Celtic Tiger boom-and-bust, has died of a heart attack aged 73.The blunt-speaking financier, who built Anglo Irish Bank into a financial juggernaut that spectacularly crashed after reckless loans and dubious accounting practices, was rushed to hospital last week after suddenly taking ill. He died on Monday, according to his family.FitzPatrick remained unrepentant about his role in precipitating a crisis that plunged the banking sector into a €64bn bailout after the global financial crisis exposed a colossal liquidity crunch.“He went from being the poster boy of the Celtic Tiger to the whipping boy of the country’s crash,” Simon Carswell, author of Anglo Republic, Inside the Bank that Broke Ireland, told the Financial Times. “He was the emblem of Ireland’s banking-driven boom and bust.”FitzPatrick — known as “Seánie” to his friends and “Fitzie” behind his back at work — joined what grew into Ireland’s third-biggest bank in 1974. He swiftly rose to the top as the bank expanded, running Anglo Irish Bank Corporation as chief executive from 1986 to 2005 and chair from 2005 until leaving in disgrace in 2008 as the bank fell apart.He had championed a speedy loan approval model that saw Anglo Irish Bank, then the country’s third biggest institution, behind AIB and Bank of Ireland, rocket from a valuation of about €600m in 2000 to more than €13bn in 2007 at its peak.Property developers, whose flashy projects were transforming Ireland from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s in a period that earned the country the Celtic Tiger moniker, became the bank’s biggest customers. Anglo Irish earned a reputation as the developers’ favourite institution as the nation’s economy skyrocketed.But his success speedily unravelled. It emerged that FitzPatrick had for several years been concealing tens of millions of euros in personal loans by shunting them off the books — a practice that was deemed immoral, but not illegal. Unlike his successor as chief executive, David Drumm, and other senior banking figures, FitzPatrick was never convicted or jailed.He was acquitted in 2017 after a 127-day trial of criminal charges relating to allegedly misleading auditors.Patrick Honohan, former central bank governor, said in 2015 it was “unwise, rather than criminal” actions by bankers that precipitated the crisis, and that their “unrestrained and reckless” behaviour had been behind Ireland’s economic crash.When the financial crisis bit, Anglo Irish’s reckless lending caught up with it and it was losing €1bn a day, Carswell said, prompting the government to step in. FitzPatrick had by then made a fortune amassing stock in the bank, though he was declared bankrupt in 2010.The Irish Times newspaper said the bank “lost money the old-fashioned way by making one crappy loan after another”. It needed a €29.3bn bailout — nearly half the total that was pumped into the nation’s banks to stop them from going under.But FitzPatrick told an interviewer in 2011 he could not “say sorry with any sincerity or decency” for a banking collapse he blamed on global problems.A rugby player in his youth and an avid golfer, FitzPatrick kept a low profile in recent years.Many figures in the Irish financial world declined to comment for fear of speaking ill of the dead. Ultimately, “he was an almost tragic figure, for himself and the country”, said one.This article has been amended to reflect the fact that Patrick Honohan’s tenure as central bank governor began in 2009
253  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
254  Boris Johnson won the general election of 2019 on the promise that he would get Brexit done. But it has not been done. Instead of stabilising, post-divorce relations are worsening. Not surprisingly, they are most fraught where the responsibilities remain shared. Fisheries are one such point of contention. But the most dangerous by far is Northern Ireland. Back in October 2019, Johnson declared he had reached a “great new deal”. Now he would like to tear it up. That is characteristic, alas. But it is dangerous not just for the UK, but also for the EU and wider west.In one sense, Brexit could never have been “done” by now. The ending of a marriage transforms the prospects of the partners into the future. Other things equal, the more economically dependent partner will also suffer more.In its Economic and Fiscal Outlook last month, the Office for Budget Responsibility concluded that “since.November 2016, our forecasts have assumed that total UK imports and exports will eventually both be 15 per cent lower than had we stayed in the EU. This reduction in trade intensity drives the 4 per cent reduction in long-run potential productivity we assume will eventually result from our departure from the EU.” To put this in context, this is twice the estimated long-run costs of Covid and, in today’s value, is £80bn a year.So far, outcomes are close to the earlier forecasts. The UK’s trade with the EU is shrinking relative to what would otherwise have happened. This will not be offset by other trade. That will impose costs in perpetuity. (See charts.)Yet it could be far worse even than this. Suppose traders and investors, foreign and domestic, concluded they could not rely on the negotiated framework for relations between the UK and its most important economic partners. Suppose, even worse, that the credibility of the UK’s government as a partner is destroyed. Then the losses for the UK might substantially exceed those indicated by the OBR. They would also go far beyond merely economic costs.How realistic are such fears? In a broadcast over the weekend, Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister, suggested that the EU might repudiate its post-Brexit trade agreement if the British government went through with its threat to suspend parts of the deal on Northern Ireland. He warned that the UK was pushing for a deal it knew it could not get. The UK is indeed pushing for radical change. In a combative speech in October, Johnson’s bantam cock, Lord David Frost, argued: “For the EU now to say that the protocol — drawn up in extreme haste in a time of great uncertainty — can never be improved upon, when it is so self-evidently causing such significant problems, would be a historic misjudgment.”This is the language of repudiation. Particularly striking is the implication that this protocol — consciously and, one must assume, knowingly agreed by Johnson himself two years ago — was somehow “uncertain” and drawn up in “extreme haste”. In fact, its consequences were quite foreseeable. That is why Theresa May, his predecessor, rejected the idea of splitting Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK in this way. If Johnson did not understand what he was signing he was incompetent. If he did, but had no intention of abiding by the deal he signed, he was dishonest.This is not to argue that the administration of this protocol could not be improved. The European Commission has made significant proposals on this. But the UK’s insistence on being able to deviate from EU standards in foodstuffs was sure to create problems in its trade with Northern Ireland. It duly did.Now, in pursuit of a radical change in the agreement it knowingly signed, the UK government is proposing to take “safeguard” measures. Such measures are permitted under Article 16 of the protocol. But, the latter explains, such “measures shall be restricted with regard to their scope and duration to what is strictly necessary in order to remedy the situation”. The UK’s desire to remove the role of the European Court of Justice in settling the EU law that governs the single market is far from “strictly necessary”. Moreover, the EU would be entitled to take its own rebalancing measures in response to such an action by the UK. Where such a cycle of retaliation between these neighbours would finish nobody knows.The optimistic view is that this “game of chicken” will end, as it has done before, with a patched-up agreement: the EU will give a bit and the UK will fail to get all it wants. Yet there are obvious difficulties with this cheerful view. The first is that the endless attempts to renegotiate the most contentious part of the withdrawal have soured relations and, still worse, will continue to do so: after all, Ireland, Northern Ireland, the EU and the UK are not going away. The second is that such finagling fatally undermines the trust in its commitments that any government needs. The UK can no longer hope to get away with a reputation for being “perfidious Albion”. The last is that the game of chicken might end up in a crash of just the sort suggested by Coveney. Maybe that will not happen this time. But it looks increasingly as though the UK government will keep on at this until the EU folds totally or the crash happens. In the long run, the latter seems far more likely.So, what happens if core parts of the deals between the UK and the EU collapsed? The economic effects would certainly be damaging. But far worse would be the breakdown of trust among leading democracies and eternal neighbours at a time of enormous challenges for such countries. These are risks nobody sane would dare to run. This dangerous “game” must stop. We have to move on.
255  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.It’s not exactly the government shutdown the US Congress has triggered several times in the past few years, but the European parliament and member states are locked in a dispute over the bloc’s budget for 2022. We’ll explore what the sticking points are and what is at stake.In Poland (and Hungary) news, the European Commission has been considering when to take its next steps in response to fraying of the rule of law in the countries. Yesterday, EU budget commissioner Johannes Hahn said the commission will “very soon” submit letters to capitals to seek “clarifications” on the situation.This would be a very preliminary step that comes before any decision to formally trigger the so-called conditionality mechanism linking EU funds to rule of law issues. It is up to commission president Ursula von der Leyen to decide when to act. She is in Washington, where she’s set to meet US President Joe Biden tomorrow, before heading back to Brussels on Thursday.Turning to Luxembourg, the bloc’s General Court is set to rule tomorrow on a landmark case against Google, reaffirming or dealing a blow to the commission’s reputation as a tough enforcer of antitrust law.And a report on anti-Semitism by EU’s fundamental rights agency in Vienna shows that the phenomenon has only got stronger in the pandemic.The EU’s landmark deal last year setting its €1.2tn seven-year budget plus a €800bn recovery fund by no means marked the end of legislative wrangling over the union’s spending plans, write Sam Fleming and Mehreen Khan in Brussels.The latest scuffle concerns the specific plans for the 2022 budget, as the European parliament haggles with member states over spending priorities for the annual pot worth about €170bn.MEPs meet this morning and EU capitals will do the same on Friday to discuss their respective positions as the clock ticks in the “conciliation” process that is meant to deliver an agreement. If a deal is not struck by November 15, the commission will have to table a new draft budget proposal for 2022.The talks are part of a traditional end-of-year bunfight in Brussels where penny-pitching member states try to find as many savings as possible, while MEPs demand more cash. This year’s talks take on extra spice after institutional tensions between the parliament and European Council have been supercharged by disputes over the rule of law and demand from MEPs for Brussels to boost its revenue-raising powers.Numerous points of difference exist between the two sides, but the most contentious, according to some capitals, is the sensitive topic of staffing. In its budget draft, the European parliament has sought a significant expansion in its own staffing numbers, in part to bolster its ability to closely scrutinise member states’ recovery plans.EU diplomats say the parliament is seeking to add 142 staffers, plus another 180 contract agents — a push that would add millions to its personnel spending. “We don’t see the need for the additional posts,” said one diplomat. “The European parliament has not been able to properly explain the need for these posts.”Parliament officials told Europe Express they disputed the figures and did not expect the internal staffing needs of any of the institutions to become sticking points in the talks. “The parliament’s budget is not on the table,” said Damian Boeselager, an MEP from the Greens who is part of the negotiations.The EP has defended itself against charges of profligacy by pointing out that it has only a handful of staff currently working on policing hundreds of billions in budgetary spending. MEPs also want more spending on the Erasmus student exchange, science and research programmes, and humanitarian aid for refugees — demands adding up to nearly €3bn more than the council’s position.A senior EU diplomat said there was a “significant gap” that needed to be bridged in the next week. “We are cautiously optimistic that both sides are aware of the need to conclude negotiations in time to have a proper functioning budget for the next year.”The surge in inflation is leaving the world’s leading economies with their lowest real interest rates in decades, as central banks delay any abrupt tightening of the extra-loose monetary policy used to help weather the coronavirus crisis, arguing that the recent rise in prices is transitory. (More here)The EU’s General Court tomorrow will rule on the European Commission’s decision to fine Google €2.4bn for alleged anti-competitive practices, a judgment with significant stakes for the reputation of antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, writes Javier Espinoza in Brussels.Over the past decade Vestager has issued billions of euros of fines against Google for allegedly breaking EU law, with the largest of the fines on the docket of the Luxembourg-based court tomorrow.Either way the verdict will go, the losing party is almost certainly likely to appeal against the decision at the European Court of Justice.For Google the fine was a mere slap on the wrist — €2.4bn was the equivalent of 3 per cent of its turnover at the time — so what matters more to the company is the commission’s charge that the tech giant is undermining competitors.As for Vestager, what is at stake is whether or not she has been right in using the commission’s core competence as antitrust enforcer when going after Big Tech. As a reminder, she lost a significant tax case against Apple (read about it here).But while in the Apple case Vestager argued that she lost because EU state aid law had its limitations when it came to national tax deals, the ruling on Google would be directly related to her bread and butter — antitrust.“If you are going after such big fines, then you are asking for it,” said a lawyer working on the Google side of the case.Other legal experts say the commission could use a potential loss to argue that this is why there is a need for tough rules against Big Tech. The European parliament has been dragging its feet when it comes to agreeing on a long-overdue update to the existing rule book and Vestager may use this as an opportunity to call for speedy action.Not everyone thinks it will be bad news for Vestager. “The court will be sensitive to the commission’s need for enforcement,” said Alec Burnside, a partner with Dechert in Brussels. “The court doesn’t exist in a vacuum.”Luther Lowe, senior vice-president of public policy at Yelp, one of the plaintiffs in the case, said her actions had signalled to other jurisdictions that Vestager “can square shoulders with these giants” as “the matriarch of the techlash”.Asked about what he thought would be the damage to her reputation if she lost the case, Lowe said: “Call me on Wednesday. We are optimistic.”Anti-Semitic incidents, especially online, have grown during the pandemic and just about half of EU’s 27 states have put in place national strategies against the phenomenon, according to the latest report by the EU agency for fundamental rights.In Germany, police recorded 2,351 crimes with an anti-Semitic motive last year — the highest number in 10 years. More than half of those cases involved the dissemination of offensive material, while the rest were related to harassment and incitement to hate crimes, according to the Vienna-based EU agency.Neighbouring Denmark also registered a record number of crimes motivated by anti-Semitism. According to police records 79 such cases occurred in 2020, the highest number in 10 years.In Belgium, incidents trivialising or denying the Holocaust doubled last year compared with 2019, with official complaints for anti-Semitism at a five-year high, according to official data. A slight increase in anti-Semitic incidents was also registered in Italy, the Czech Republic and Romania.In France, meanwhile, the number of anti-Semitic actions and threats halved last year compared with 2019 and in Poland and the Netherlands, too, fewer incidents were recorded.A number of countries, however, only keep limited or even no records at all, the EU agency says, and even those that do collect data differently.“Antisemitism is a serious problem. But without the data, we do not know how serious it is,” said the director of the agency, Michael O’Flaherty. “EU countries need to step up their efforts to encourage reporting and improve recording and data collection.”Join us in partnership with ETNO for our Tech & Politics Forum on November 29 to debate the new transatlantic tech playbook, the infrastructure investment challenge and the role of cloud and data services.

256  Take back control. Xavier Bertrand, a contender for the centre-right nomination for France’s presidential election, may not be explicitly copying the winning formula of the Brexit campaign across the Channel. But he is hoping the policy he announced for clamping down on immigration at a rally near Calais last week will resonate with conservative voters ahead of the primary election on December 4.Bertrand is the latest presidential hopeful to set out his stall in a pre-campaign phase that is increasingly dominated by the immigration issue following a surge in support for Eric Zemmour, the hard-right polemicist who contends that France is under threat from Muslim immigration.An opinion poll published on Sunday put support for Zemmour in the first round of the presidential election at 17 per cent, enough to edge out Marine Le Pen, the established far-right leader, and to earn a run-off place against President Emmanuel Macron in the second round on April 24.Opinion surveys suggest Bertrand, president of the Hauts-de-France region, is the frontrunner of the five people vying for the nomination of Les Républicains, a party he previously abandoned to build his own brand. But even he musters only 13 per cent in national polls. It is a measure of the uphill battle the centre-right faces in this election even though, paradoxically, the political centre of gravity of French voters has shifted decisively to the right in recent years as terrorism, crime and the threat of Islamism to secular traditions became the most pressing concerns. With Zemmour now eclipsing the more moderate Le Pen, immigration has become the defining issue.Even the left is not immune: Arnaud Montebourg, a former socialist industry minister who is running as an independent, said he favoured a ban on remittance transfers from France to countries that refused to readmit their nationals.Like his mainstream rivals — former chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and Valérie Pécresse, president of the Ile-de-France region — Bertrand wants a quota system for legal migration, an end to regularisation of illegal entrants and reduced access to welfare benefits for irregular migrants. Unlike Barnier and Pécresse, he did not explicitly call for France to challenge the jurisdiction of European courts over French immigration policy — although it is hard to see how he would achieve a target of cutting immigration for reasons of family reunion by two-thirds without a clash over the right to family life.Barnier and Pécresse have both called for changes to the constitution to reassert French legal sovereignty over European courts. The moves echo Poland’s tussle with the EU over its judicial reforms although Patrick Stefanini, a veteran strategist who is Pécresse’s campaign manager, argues that France will not be breaching fundamental treaty principles.Rather than take aim at the EU, Bertrand has trained his sights on Britain. He accused London of failing to police its maritime border while making it too easy for illegal immigrants to work for low pay and vowed to rip up the so-called Le Touquet accord under which Britain and France in effect share responsibility for migrant flows towards English shores.The problem for the centre-right candidates is how to compete with Zemmour’s much harder line, which seems to seduce a slice of their voters. He subscribes to the far-right theory of the “great replacement” under which France will be majority Muslim by 2050 and on the verge of a civil war — a stance too extreme even for Le Pen. Zemmour wants to end all immigration for 10 years by scrapping the right to asylum and changing the constitution so that it offers no legal protection to would-be migrants.On the BFMTV news channel on Sunday, Zemmour scoffed at his mainstream rivals as “centrist pro-European grandees who have never seriously tackled immigration, never. And they are waking up now they see that their electorate is in uproar up about the subject.”A strong showing in regional elections in June appeared to give the centre-right a launchpad for the presidential campaign. But they have spent the time since arguing among themselves over selection procedures.“They made a huge mistake, focusing on internal process and not on the agenda,” said Laurent Bigorgne, director of the Institut Montaigne think-tank. “They have left Zemmour to define the battlefield. They can say whatever they want but it is too late.”
257  German publishing giant Axel Springer plans to require its nearly 16,000 employees to disclose sexual relationships between managers and subordinates, in the wake of a scandal that led to the ousting of the editor of its flagship newspaper Bild.Chief executive Mathias Döpfner, facing questions over his handling of the incident, wants to impose such rules for the first time in the media group’s 75-year history.But the plan has been met with scepticism from the company’s powerful worker representatives in Germany. It also stops short of prohibiting the company’s most powerful executives from pursuing relationships with junior staff.Döpfner said the company has come to realise the standards regarding workplace relationships were stricter in the US, a critical market for Axel Springer as it aims to become a global media player.“We cannot accept double standards. We are going to apply a global rule that is based on the Anglo-Saxon versuslooser, lower European standards,” he told the Financial Times.Yet an outright ban on top executives pursuing relationships at work is increasingly common in the US. Chief executives of companies including McDonald's, Intel and Boeing have been forced to resign over consensual affairs with subordinates. Axel Springer said it would seek to address potential conflicts of interest by moving people to different roles.The German media group has come under heavy scrutiny since female employees earlier this year accused Bild editor-in-chief Julian Reichelt of having frequent affairs with interns and subordinates, and handing out promotions in return. Springer mandated law firm Freshfields to investigate the allegations.Der Spiegel made the probe public in March in an article headlined “Screw, Promote, Fire”. Reichelt was briefly suspended from Bild, but returned to work after he was cleared of criminal misconduct. He was fired last month, a day after The New York Times revealed details about his alleged conduct.Axel Springer said the dismissal was based on “new insights”, saying Reichelt “did not clearly separate [his] private and professional affairs” even after the investigation.Around the same time, the company finalised its $1bn acquisition of Politico, part of its efforts to become a major player in the US. “Our goal is to become the leading digital publisher in the democratic world,” Döpfner said. The Bild scandal, however, has underlined how diverging workplace cultures between Axel Springer’s German operations and the US companies it has acquired could prove an obstacle to fulfilling its global ambitions.Döpfner said workers’ representatives prevented the company from introducing a company-wide policy on disclosing relationships four years ago, adding they were still resisting it. “We just learned today that our labour representatives still do not approve a formal rule on romantic and sexual relationships in a hierarchy,” Döpfner told the FT last week. If a compromise could not be reached, “what we simply would then do is say: there is a code of conduct principle we expect from our employees around the world. Whoever is not behaving appropriately needs to leave the company.”Linda Paczkowski-Diering, head of Axel Springer’s workers’ council, confirmed that talks were ongoing but would not comment on the union’s position.“We will soon sit down with the management board to discuss the ideas, concepts and suggestions that are best suited to shape the company’s future tasks,” she told the FT, adding that diverse business models and internal culture at Axel Springer’s 260 different global business units needed to be considered.Forcing disclosure of personal relationships across an entire company is difficult in Germany, where employee representatives wield significant power and where the right to privacy ranks high in employment law.“For German employers, it is legally all but impossible to impose a blanket ban on relationships between managers and subordinates,” said Peter Krebühl, a Frankfurt-based labour lawyer, pointing to a landmark ruling from 2005, in which a German court struck down Walmart’s code of conduct that prohibited consensual relationships between staff. Employers in Germany are legally obliged to protect employees from predatory bosses, but according to Krebühl sometimes still have a tendency to look the other way. “Sexually abusive employees who are deemed important for the company — for instance because they generate a lot of revenue — are often deliberately protected,” he said.In the US, the Me Too debate has fundamentally changed employers’ attitudes. There is increasingly a zero tolerance for relationships between senior bosses and subordinates, said Davia Temin, who runs a crisis-management company in New York.“The world is changing,” she said. “What is acceptable is changing, abuse of power and the concept of that is changing.”At a growing number of US companies, top executives now had clauses in their contracts saying there can be no relationship whatsoever with more junior colleagues, said Jennifer Kennedy Park, a partner at Cleary Gottlieb, who has written about “anti-fraternisation” policies.“At the most senior level, the argument about consent becomes the hardest to judge because the person at the top of the organisation has power over everyone,” she added. While requiring disclosure across entire workforces could raise questions about intrusion into employees’ private lives, she said, a growing number of companies had decided “you can justify intrusion into senior people’s lives because it’s the cost of being very senior”. 
258  A year after launching a €1bn investment company to boost European tech, Spotify’s co-founder Daniel Ek has placed his first bet with a stake in Helsing, a defence tech start-up that produces live maps of battlefields.The start-up, which was founded this year and plans to have offices in Germany, Britain and France, received €100m from Ek’s Prima Materia, at a valuation just over €400m. Ek said he had founded Prima Materia in September 2020 to “identify society’s most difficult problems”.The software developed by Helsing will use artificial intelligence to integrate data from infrared, video, sonar and radio frequencies, gleaned from sensors on military vehicles, to create a real-time picture of battlefields.Possible applications include helping troops to detect swarming drones, enemy forces or camouflaged vehicles more accurately than the human eye.“When it comes to building globally relevant tech companies, it’s no secret that Europe has underperformed regions like the US and China,” said Ek.But he added that Helsing was a “perfect example” of how Europe had a “tremendous opportunity” to lead in new areas, such as building dynamic AI systems “in an ethical, transparent and responsible manner”.Torsten Reil, Helsing’s chief executive, met Ek after selling a UK gaming start-up called NaturalMotion to Zynga for just over half a billion dollars.Reil said Europe had been lagging “behind the world” in AI warfare capabilities, and Helsing’s goal was to provide state of the art defence and national security AI capabilities to liberal democracies that have “shared values” around the rule of law and public accountability.“It’s not even about any particular countries,” he said. “We need AI to serve our democracies.We’ve overall been lagging behind.And that has to change.”Helsing, whose name derives from the German word hellsicht, or clairvoyance, plans to concentrate initially on selling direct to British, French and German militaries.Gundbert Scherf, Helsing’s chief operational officer, previously worked in the digital directorate at the German ministry of defence. He emphasised that, while the start-up would focus initially on supplying individual countries, there would be potential in future to link systems together to provide a “common operational picture and technology platform” for use in allied operations.Other tech start-ups are working on similar systems: for instance, UK-based Improbable is developing a “live geospatial dashboard” for use by the armed forces.Last month, Airbus announced it was working with Helsing, saying that it would jointly develop AI capabilities for “manned and unmanned platforms and systems of systems in Airbus’s product portfolio” supported by Germany’s MoD.Western allies are increasingly concerned that their conventional military superiority will be eclipsed as China embraces newer combat technologies.Eric Schmidt, the former Google chief executive who chairs the US National Security Commission on AI, warned this year that while America was “unprepared” for the migration to digital warfare, Beijing was already training AI algorithms “in military games designed around real-world scenarios”.Last month, Nicolas Chaillan, who was the Pentagon’s first chief software officer, told the Financial Times that he had resigned from his post after concluding that the US had already lost out to China in the competition over AI.Spurred by China’s advances, the Nato military alliance launched an accelerator programme and €1bn investment fund this summer that will focus on deeptech start-ups in AI, autonomy and quantum technologies. The Nato initiative, which will be similar in structure to the CIA’s venture capital arm In-Q-Tel, is expected to be operational in 2023.Scherf said the Helsing team had “observed very carefully” the recent publication of Nato’s AI strategy, and would seek to “engage with all key players” in the accelerator scheme.
259  Polish officials have accused Belarus of trying to engineer a confrontation on their common border as a large group of migrants attempted to force its way into Poland from its eastern neighbour.Poland’s defence ministry on Monday shared aerial footage of migrants gathering on the Belarusian side of the border fence near the Polish village of Kuznica, after videos on social media appeared to show a column of hundreds of migrants walking towards Poland. The interior ministry subsequently said an initial attempt to enter the country had been prevented.“It’s clear that the [Belarusian] regime is not stopping its provocations, and is moving to the worst possible ones,” Poland’s deputy foreign minister, Piotr Wawrzyk, told state radio.Polish officials estimated that there were between 3,000 and 4,000 migrants near the Belarusian border with Poland, and a further 10,000 elsewhere in Belarus.The interior minister of neighbouring Lithuania said her country was considering a state of emergency for its border area with Belarus after watching events on the Polish border. Agne Bilotaite said the “really serious situation” meant the Baltic country was on “maximum alert”.The warnings from Polish and Lithuanian officials come after a surge in attempts to enter the two countries illegally from Belarus. The EU says this is being orchestrated by Belarus’s dictatorial leader Alexander Lukashenko in retaliation for Brussels’ support for Belarus’s opposition.Lukashenko was on the brink of being toppled by street protests against his flawed re-election last year before he launched a crackdown on dissent and secured support from Russia.Since the summer, thousands of migrants from countries including Iraq, Syria and Somalia have flown to the Belarusian capital, Minsk, before travelling to the country’s border with the EU.According to Poland’s border guard, there have been 28,500 attempts to enter the country illegally via Belarus since the beginning of August, including 17,300 last month.Ursula von der Leyen, head of the European Commission, on Monday evening condemned the Belarusian authorities for “instrumentalising migrants” and called on the EU’s members to approve further sanctions against Minsk. She added that the bloc would look into how to target “third country airlines” that were helping ferry the migrants to Belarus.In recent days, Poland has also accused Belarus of a series of other provocations on the border, including one case of three armed and uniformed Belarusians spotted inside Polish territory.Belarus said at the time that it had not provoked any border incidents. It confirmed on Monday that “a large group of refugees” was moving towards Poland but said Warsaw was responsible for “forcing out thousands of migrants” that it had sent back to Belarus.“The refugees’ desperate step was provoked by the indifference and inhuman attitude of the Polish authorities,” it added.Russia appeared to endorse Belarus’s actions. “We have no doubt here that the Belarusian migration services are taking all necessary measures to keep the situation in the legal field,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, according to Interfax.Since the number of migrants at its eastern border began to climb this summer, Poland has deployed 12,000 troops to reinforce the border guard, declared a state of emergency in land adjoining the frontier and laid barbed-wire fencing.However, Warsaw has also been criticised for passing legislation that human rights groups say allows border guards to push migrants back into Belarus, leaving them trapped in forests along the frontier between Polish and Belarusian security forces.Despite the measures, the number of migrants managing to enter has risen steadily. In Germany, police said last week that there had been more than 8,400 “unauthorised entries” this year by people who came via Belarus.“This is payback for Poland’s [support for the Belarusian opposition], but this is also the direct route to Germany,” said an EU diplomat.
260  Tensions between the UK and the EU are rising again over the implementation of post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland, with talks on possible reforms seemingly deadlocked.Ireland’s foreign minister Simon Coveney warned at the weekend that the entire EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement could be terminated if the UK made good on its threats to trigger Article 16 and fundamentally rewrite the protocol on Northern Ireland. The protocol, part of the EU-UK withdrawal agreement, was agreed in order to avoid the return of a north-south trade border on the island of Ireland.At the same time tensions are growing in Northern Ireland, where the mainly Protestant Unionist parties have rejected the agreement. Two buses have been set on fire in the past week, in apparent protests over the protocol.Why has Article 16 become so controversial? And how could it affect EU-UK relations more broadly?This is a safeguard clause in the Northern Ireland protocol which either side can trigger if they believe the arrangement has caused “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties” or the “diversion of trade”.The UK says this threshold has already been reached as a result of the trade frictions caused by the protocol, which requires all goods travelling from Great Britain into Northern Ireland to conform to EU rules.Although the arrangement was agreed by Boris Johnson in October 2019 the British government now says it has caused far greater disruption than anticipated at the time and needs to be fundamentally rewritten.UK ministers also argue that the unionist community has lost confidence in the protocol and its continued application could destabilise the already fragile politics of the region.There are five main areas that the UK wishes to change, which were set out in a formal command paper published last July.In order to reduce friction on the Irish Sea border that the protocol has created, the UK asked for an “honesty box” approach to checking goods entering from Great Britain. This would mean only goods travelling south to the Republic of Ireland would face checks. London also asked for the scrapping of any paperwork on goods travelling from Northern Ireland to Great Britain.In addition, London demanded that the European Court of Justice should no longer have the right to enforce main elements of the protocol and wanted it to be replaced with a “treaty-based” arbitration mechanism. The EU has rejected this request, arguing that since Northern Ireland is following EU rules and regulations for goods, only the ECJ can rule on their application.The bloc has offered to reduce customs and health checks on the Irish Sea border, but the UK says this offer does not go far enough.If the UK fails to maintain an effective border in the Irish Sea, and there is no north-south trade border in Ireland — as both sides agree is necessary to preserve the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to the Island — then this creates a backdoor into the EU single market.Brussels argues that without full legal controls on animal and plant products, Ireland’s place in the EU single market is undermined because its goods can no longer be trusted, so may require checks as they enter the EU. The UK would therefore be threatening Ireland’s economic rights as an EU member. This may be seen as intolerable by the 26 other EU member states.For its part, the UK says this concern is overstated. It argues that in-market surveillance by both sides can address concerns about any non-compliant goods flowing into Ireland via Northern Ireland, and that the actual risks to the EU single market from UK goods are negligible.Once the UK notifies the European Commission of its intention to trigger Article 16, including what measures it intends to take to address the “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties”, the two sides immediately enter into consultations to discuss the British proposals.These cannot come into force for a month, except under “exceptional circumstances”, where the UK argues that immediate action is required. Crucially, Article 16 says any action taken must be limited to what is “strictly necessary in order to remedy the situation”.The response from Brussels would therefore depend on how expansively the UK used Article 16. If London identified specific problems with the protocol — for example the ability to trade in chilled meats or plant products with Northern Ireland — the EU would likely take limited steps to address the fallout in those areas.But if the UK used Article 16 to suspend key parts of the protocol — for example Articles 5 and 7, which form the basis for leaving Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods — then Brussels has suggested it could take far more draconian action.For instance, it could argue that because the EU-UK trade deal was always predicated on London first addressing the Northern Ireland border issue, any UK decision to unravel the protocol would therefore be undermining the entire basis for the Trade and Cooperation Agreement with the EU.Under the TCA, either side must give 12 months’ notice of termination, before they would revert to trading on World Trade Organization terms. This would effectively create another “no deal” cliff-edge during which Brussels hopes the UK would return to the negotiating table.Alternatively, Brussels could take the lesser step of applying targeted tariff measures against the UK on sensitive products such as cars, whisky or fish.If the two sides cannot agree on reforms to make the protocol function, there could be a serious rupture of economic and political ties.The souring of relations could also extend to foreign affairs and co-operation on a range of fronts, from data flows to pan-EU scientific research projects.A trade war would also cause job losses in the EU, especially in France, Belgium and the Netherlands, which still have big economic links with the UK. The EU has already set aside €5bn to compensate governments and companies which took an economic hit from Brexit.As was seen in the four years after the 2016 Brexit vote, trading on WTO terms could also deter investment and damage business confidence in the UK.
261  Central bankers have outlined starkly different responses to the global surge in inflation, with senior US and UK officials signalling that interest rates are likely to rise soon in their countries despite such a policy shift remaining a distant prospect in the eurozone.Philip Lane, the European Central Bank’s chief economist, on Monday said the eurozone was in a “completely different” situation to other countries, adding there were “powerful reasons” for inflation to fall in the region next year. It would be “counter-productive to tighten monetary policy at the current juncture,” he added.In contrast, US Federal Reserve vice-chair Richard Clarida said the “necessary conditions” for US interest rates to rise from their current near-zero level will be met by the end of next year should the economy progress as expected.The Bank of England has been criticised for leading markets to believe there would be a rate rise at its meeting last week, when it left rates unchanged. Even so, governor Andrew Bailey has insisted the vote was a “close call” and the BoE “won’t bottle it” if the economy develops in line with its forecast.Their comments highlight the diverging views among central banks over how quickly they should tighten monetary policy in response to rising global inflation. Resurgent consumer demand, supply chain bottlenecks and rising energy costs are pushing prices higher around the world.Analysts said the ECB was bound to be the slowest to raise rates after it spent much of the past decade struggling to avoid Japan-style deflation. Eurozone economic activity and employment levels also remain weaker than in the US and UK.“On all fronts, the risk of a self-sustained wage-price spiral looks much lower in the euro area than in the US or in the UK,” said Frederik Ducrozet, strategist at Pictet Wealth Management.The US economy has rebounded above pre-pandemic levels, boosted by its stronger fiscal policy response. In contrast, the eurozone is only expected to achieve pre-pandemic levels of output later this year. Although the bloc’s unemployment levels have returned to pre-crisis levels, millions of people remain on furlough schemes and have left the workforce.Erik Nielsen, chief economist at UniCredit, said: “The key differences with the eurozone inflation outlook compared to the US are the difference in fiscal stimulus and the much more flexible US labour and housing markets, while UK inflation outlook is being affected by the long-term hit to supply stemming from Brexit and the likely effects of sterling depreciation.”Clarida on Monday said that if the US unemployment rate drops to 3.8 per cent from its current 4.6 per cent, as projections suggest, that would be consistent with his assessment of maximum employment — and warrant tighter monetary policy.The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditure index, surged to 3.6 per cent in September from a year earlier and is on track to end the year at 3.7 per cent, according to its latest forecasts.In the UK, consumer inflation has averaged the BoE’s 2 per cent target over the past decade. It also has tighter labour markets than the eurozone, and the BoE will pay particular attention to the labour market effects of the end of the UK’s furlough scheme in October.“There will actually, as a matter of fact, be two official labour market data releases between now and our next meeting” in December, Bailey said last week.By contrast, Lane said eurozone inflation had averaged 0.9 per cent from 2014 to 2019, adding: “Despite the high current inflation rate, the analysis indicating that the euro area is still confronted with weak medium-term inflation dynamics remains compelling.”Eurozone inflation reached a new 13-year high of 4.1 per cent in October — well above the ECB’s 2 per cent target. But Lane said several factors pushing up prices today were expected to fade next year, including supply chain bottlenecks and the impact of a temporary German tax increase.He added that the eurozone’s large current account surplus, generated by more exports than imports, highlighted the bloc’s “weak medium-term aggregate demand conditions”.Furthermore, despite vast government aid packages in response to the pandemic, Lane said fiscal policy in Europe was “constrained by high aggregate national debt levels and the lack of a permanent central fiscal capacity”.“These factors reinforce our strategic assessment that extensive monetary accommodation is required to ensure that inflation pressure builds up on a permanent basis in order to stabilise inflation at 2 per cent over the medium term,” he said.
262  In the tortuous negotiations over Brexit, Boris Johnson’s government believes it has learned one big truth: hardball tactics with the EU work. It is convinced it extracted concessions by threatening a no-deal exit in late 2019, and again last year by preparing to override parts of the withdrawal agreement it signed months earlier. With talks on reforming the post-Brexit protocol on trade with Northern Ireland seemingly stuck, Downing Street is indicating it is ready to trigger a clause that would suspend key parts of that accord. Forceful negotiating tactics are one thing. Carrying out the threat would be a grave mistake.Like any “safeguards clause”, Article 16 of the protocol exists to be used, by both sides, if applying the agreement leads to “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties” or reduces trade. Corrective steps can be taken unilaterally, but must be restricted purely to what is needed to remedy the situation. With two buses set alight by masked men in the past week, a Northern Irish first minister forced to resign in the summer, and trade being crimped, Downing Street argues the threshold to pull the alarm cord has been met.But the article is supposed to apply to unforeseen issues. There may be truth in Britain’s argument that the EU has applied the protocol in overly legalistic fashion and, until last month, was slow to offer compromises. Much of what the UK objects to about how the protocol is working, however, was entirely foreseeable. It flowed directly from the hardline Brexit Johnson’s government insisted upon. Unless all of the UK stayed in a customs union with the EU, Northern Ireland had to remain in the EU’s single market for goods, to prevent a destabilising “hard” trade border being created with the Republic.Downing Street set out in a July paper five desired changes to the protocol — including removing the right of the European Court of Justice to settle disputes — that amounted to a rewrite of key elements. If the UK used Article 16 not in a narrow, limited way but to try to force these changes, that would fall well outside the clause’s purpose. It would be tantamount to one party using the safeguards clause to unravel the deal and compel a renegotiation.Britain would almost certainly lose ensuing EU legal action, on those grounds. But that would take time. The UK government hopes it could, meanwhile, establish facts on the ground and allow it to demonstrate that its preferred approach — involving, in essence, no border in the Irish Sea but in-market surveillance — is workable. That would entail two unacceptable risks.First, since maintaining the integrity of its single market is an EU article of faith, it is not inconceivable — as Ireland’s foreign minister Simon Coveney has warned — that the EU might respond by setting aside the post-Brexit Trade and Cooperation Agreement with the UK. That would need 12 months to take effect. But it would create a new potential “no deal” cliff-edge — just as supply bottlenecks, labour shortages and rising energy costs are creating a cost of living crisis. Damage to the economy, and the government’s political fortunes, could be severe.Secondly, it would torpedo the UK’s credibility as a reliable partner as it seeks trade deals across the world. Negotiated solutions exist to the Northern Ireland frictions, similar to the EU’s veterinary and dispute resolution agreements with Switzerland. Downing Street has played chicken twice on Brexit and thinks Brussels swerved. It should not assume it will happen a third time. And in a head-on collision with a much heavier vehicle, there is little doubt who would come off worse.
263  European gas prices jumped on Monday as traders said there was little evidence that Russia was preparing to increase exports to the region, despite Gazprom starting to fill some of its storage facilities on the continent.Russian president Vladimir Putin last month ordered state gas giant Gazprom to begin filling the storage facilities it controls in Germany and Austria by November 8 at the latest, boosting hopes that exports to Europe would rise.But while data show that Gazprom started adding some gas to its largest storage sites in those countries over the weekend, traders and analysts said there was disappointment as no additional pipeline capacity had been booked by Russia, suggesting that any storage fill would come from existing flows.This is unlikely to provide significant relief to a market that has been roiled by tight supplies ahead of winter as well as fears of shortages if the weather is even slightly colder than normal and Russia does not boost exports to western Europe.“Russia has done what it said it was going to do, but in a very narrow way,” said Laurent Ruseckas at consultancy IHS Markit.“There has been no big increase in the overall exports to Europe, which is why some traders are disappointed, even as Gazprom’s own storage facilities are starting to see some gas go in,” Ruseckas added. “What would get a bigger reaction from the market would be if Gazprom went back to auctioning short-term gas supplies, as they have done in previous years.”The European benchmark price jumped as much as 10 per cent to above €80 per megawatt hour before easing to €76.50, while the UK benchmark for December delivery rose 6 per cent to about £2 per therm.Gas prices in Europe have eased slightly from record highs in October after Putin indicated that Russian supplies to western Europe could increase.Traders and analysts were focused on November 8 after the Russian president’s order to fill the Gazprom controlled sites, which the company has allowed to fall to unusually low levels, drawing criticism from analysts who believe Moscow has contributed to tight supplies this year.Russia has limited its exports to western Europe to those secured by long-term contracts this year and has tied increased supplies to the start-up of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which runs through the Baltic Sea to Germany.Some European lawmakers have accused Russia of stoking the gas crisis to increase pressure on regulators in Europe to accelerate the pipeline’s authorisation. Russia has denied limiting gas supplies.Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesperson, told reporters on Monday that there had been no progress in certifying Nord Stream 2. “Obviously, this will take some time and the most important thing here is to be patient,” Peskov said, according to Interfax.Additional reporting by Max Seddon in Moscow
264  You’ve heard of the Great Resignation right? Of shortages of truck drivers and restaurant workers in the US and Europe putting dampers on the Great Reopening and raising hawkish howls that we’re about to see wages spiral? Thought so.But have you heard of Lying Flat? If not (and we hadn’t till a few days ago), then you ought to.A big question for economists and markets right now is whether the current bout of high inflation is a temporary phenomenon or a harbinger of something more permanent. And to really know if price pressures will prove more durable, the single most important thing we need to understand is whether there’s been a fundamental change in the dynamic between labour and capital.Hawks warn that shortages augur a return to the dreaded wage-price spiral witnessed in the US and parts of Europe in the 1970s, where workers’ demands for higher wages triggered price rises, which in turn fed into further wage demands. Fed Chair Paul Volcker successfully (but painfully) killed this dynamic by hiking interest rates 10 percentage points, to north of 20 per cent, in the early 1980s.In the decades since, it has been plain sailing on the inflation front. Now, however, with post-pandemic inflation lingering, central bankers (and the financiers that follow them) are watching labour market dynamics much more closely than they have been at any time since the Volcker era. The Bank of England, for instance, featured this chart in its latest Monetary Policy Report:What’s garnering far less attention in Threadneedle Street and at the Fed than the Great Resignation, but may turn out to be far more important, is a phenomenon that’s emerged in China.It began back in April with a Baidu post by 26-year-old Luo Huazhong, going by the username of Kind-Hearted Traveller, on why he had chosen to reject the rat race that has come to characterise the lives of many young Chinese. Translation below courtesy of Quartz:The post struck a chord and was shared tens of thousands of times across Chinese social media, creating a movement that has come to be known as Tang Ping, or Lying Flat. Lying Flat has now become popular enough that last month China’s president Xi Jinping condemned the movement in one of the CCP’s official journals.If a rebuke from Xi is not enough to stem the movement, then hiking wages might be. As Qin Liwen, a freelance writer, pointed out in an episode of her ‘Poking with Chopsticks’ podcast, the reason the movement has gained momentum is that millennials no longer believe they can earn enough money to provide security for themselves and their parents, who — as only children — they are largely responsible for:Qin also notes that, while the number of participants shouldn’t be exaggerated — there are many young people willing to remain on the “hamster wheel” — the movement does reflect a broader “dimming of hope”.Maybe Lying Flat will eventually fall flat in the face of clampdowns. We’re no experts in the social dynamics of Chinese society (and if you are, we’d welcome your thoughts in the comments section). But we think policymakers in the US and Europe ought to pay as much attention to China’s millennials as they are the worker shortages in their own labour markets.Since the mid-1980s, the country’s opening up and economic development has, together with globalisation, been one of the most important drivers of inflation dynamics the world over. It’s been a prime contributor to the Great Moderation that has enabled the central bankers that followed Volcker to keep a lid on price pressures with relative ease. And while cheap Chinese labour has been far from the only factor keeping a lid on Western workers’ wages, with more than 800m people of working age there, it is a factor in explaining why decades of low unemployment has failed to deliver pay growth.Wages in China have already risen fast over the past decade. Yet Lying Flat signals the pace we’ve seen is nowhere near fast enough to meet the wants and needs of younger people. Twenty to 40 year olds make up just shy of 30 per cent of China’s population of 1.4bn people, with their importance for the labour market set to grow substantially as the one-child policy triggers vast demographic change and shrinks the working age population in the coming decades.If those millennials succeed in getting the better terms and conditions they desire, Lying Flat, not the Great Resignation, may be the big thing that finally gets global wages — and prices — to rise in a more enduring fashion.
265  The UN Security Council last week extended for one year the mandate of an EU-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In that unhappy, divided country tensions have risen so rapidly that the council’s unanimous vote might seem a welcome example of co-operation among western countries, Russia and China.It is nothing of the sort. It is a defeat for western diplomacy and another nail in the coffin of the Dayton peace settlement that ended the 1992-95 Bosnian war, Europe’s most violent conflict since the second world war. It demonstrates that western governments lack the political will to stand up for their values and assert their authority even in a troubled part of Europe where the US, the EU and Nato have generally held the upper hand since the mid-1990s.Bosnia and Herzegovina is not the only example. In Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, three countries spread across the unstable borderlands between the west and Russia, the US and Europeans find it difficult to shape events. In effect, the trio are dismembered states, their notional territorial unity rendered meaningless by Russian-backed breakaway regions.Is Bosnia and Herzegovina, whose politics and institutions have been frozen along ethnic lines since the 1990s, doomed to go down the same road? Outright war is unlikely. More insidious are threats of secession from the Bosnian Serbs — who, along with Bosniaks and Bosnian Croats, are one of the state’s three communities.The Security Council vote is a bad omen because, in return for Russian and Chinese acquiescence, the western powers agreed to exclude from the UN resolution any reference to the Sarajevo-based Office of the High Representative. This superficially small detail was, in fact, a significant departure from the west’s long-held diplomatic position. It is a concession for which they may pay a heavy price.The high representative’s office matters because it is charged with upholding the Dayton accord and protecting Bosnia’s unity against extreme nationalists and secessionists. The holder of the office, who has invariably been a European, enforces civilian aspects of the peace settlement. The first high representatives performed their duties with vigour, dismissing some 140 Bosnian officials, including ministers, judges, civil servants and elected politicians deemed a threat to Dayton.It cannot but damage the high representative’s political authority that western governments no longer feel the need to insist on a reference to the office in a vital UN resolution. It signals to Bosnian Serb secessionists that the west is losing interest in rigorous enforcement of the 1995 settlement. Bosnian Serb leaders, ever on the lookout to destroy Dayton, want the high representative’s office abolished. So does Russia.Christian Schmidt, a former German government minister, took up the role of high representative in August. But neither the Bosnian Serbs nor Russia recognise his appointment. In his first report, Schmidt warned that Bosnia and Herzegovina was facing “the greatest existential threat of the postwar period” and that recent Bosnian Serb actions were “tantamount to secession without proclaiming it”.But the west’s once robust defence of Dayton is giving way to exhaustion with the quarrelsome nationalisms of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Western diplomats are even toying with electoral reforms that would consolidate the power of ethnically based political parties.Dayton was an ambiguous settlement. It ended three years of horrendous violence and held out the promise of reconciliation. But it also helped entrench local political elites who share the spoils of power along ethnic lines. Far from calming tensions, the west’s complicity in the dismal politics of ethnic partition will simply store up trouble for the future.
266  The big event of the week, overshadowing all else in the global trading system, is the 2021 Trade Secrets summit on Thursday, this year again in virtual form. There’s a great programme of conversation and debate about the transatlantic relationship, business and supply chains, trade and climate and all sorts. I mean, we would say that, but really, there is. See the link above for sign-up. It features an interview between today’s Trade Secrets author and the European Commission’s trade chief, Valdis Dombrovskis, focusing on EU-US relations — which as it happens is the subject of today’s main newsletter piece.One other thing caught our eye in recent days: Joe Biden chiding journalists for not having explained supply chain issues sufficiently. Perhaps the president meant only the White House press corps, which may or may not be true. But elsewhere in the media? Try here, here, here, here and here and, you know what, browse the back catalogue here. We know Trade Secrets is behind a paywall, but surely the White House can spring for an FT subscription. Call it a stimulus or an infrastructure project or something. Treat yourself.Today’s Charted waters looks at another victim of the snags in global supply chains: the paint industry.Trade folk have had a week now to digest the news of the deal to end the EU-US row over the US’s Section 232 steel and aluminium (aluminum, whatever) national security tariffs. One conclusion on which everyone should agree: the tariff-rate quota solution they came up with is not a thing of beauty. A hugely complicated system of sub-quotas for dozens of separate products seems likely to create rather more security of employment for expensive trade lawyers and lobbyists — the next generation of Bob Lighthizers can start lining up visits to Porsche salesrooms — than for actual workers in the steel and aluminium industries on either side of the Atlantic.Two questions present themselves. One, is it nonetheless a good idea? And two, does it presage a new and constructive era in transatlantic trade relations? If we had to judge, we’d very reluctantly, mumbling in an embarrassed fashion and with a deep sense of shame and self-loathing, answer yes to the first. But we, or at least today’s author, remain sceptical about the latter.If you want the sermon on why the deal is economically silly and legally suspect, then the good people at the Cato Institute, keepers of the free-trade flame in the Washington think-tank world, have been thundering majestically from the pulpit as usual. We’d add that it’s not a good look for the credibility of the EU, which has always set its face against tariff-rate quotas and similar managed trade in this context, meekly to give in.But in practice there is unlikely to be litigation in Geneva against the deal, any more than there has been against similarly jury-rigged arrangements with Canada and Mexico. By suspending the EU’s case against the US at the World Trade Organization, the agreement also avoids the potentially explosive outcome of a dispute settlement panel ruling in the EU’s favour, thus second-guessing the US’s judgment of its own national security needs. (Similar cases from other complainants are still outstanding, of course.)And while Brussels might have had to swallow some pride on this occasion, one of this year’s other transatlantic patch-up deals, the agreement to suspend the long-running Airbus-Boeing litigation, was actually somewhat more advantageous to the EU. (The WTO dispute settlement system had authorised more firepower for Washington to retaliate with tariffs against Brussels than vice versa.)We really hate to admit this, but given the shakiness of the world trading system, even these messy makeshift deals are probably better than continuing with tariff wars and politically hazardous litigation. To fudge-fudge is better than to judge-judge, as former UK prime minister Harold Macmillan might have put it.It’s now become a common criticism that Biden’s trade policy is Donald Trump’s but without the hyperventilating rhetoric. In terms of his wrong-headed analysis of what trade does to the American economy and American workers, that’s a reasonable charge. But we’d contend that the difference in his political tactics is quite meaningful. Trump’s instincts (or rather one of his multiple competing instincts) was to start trade wars in all directions as an end in itself. The Biden administration will defuse trade conflicts with allies such as the EU by doing whatever one-off deals are possible (steel/aluminium, Airbus-Boeing, digital services taxes) within its assessment of what is domestically politically feasible.The problem is that said assessment doesn’t currently allow for much. It certainly doesn’t seem to cover reviving the WTO in any meaningful way. US trade representative Katherine Tai’s pronouncements on the issue have been a masterclass in avoiding substance, and while the incoming US ambassador to the WTO did say during her Senate confirmation hearing that she wanted to revive the organisation’s Appellate Body, that commitment was as usual made conditional on some major but ill-defined reform.Now, of course the steel and aluminium deal has a forward-looking and potentially constructive element: to create a carbon club of low-emissions steel producers. However, that rings loud alarm bells about WTO compatibility and whether in fact it will make any difference to emissions at all. (We’ll come back to this issue in due course.) And if the US thinks a steel carbon club is a substitute for the EU’s carbon border adjustment mechanism, which it fears will catch American exports to Europe, well, Rupert Schlegelmilch, one of the top officials working on relations with Washington at the European Commission’s trade directorate, has a fairly definitive answer.Similarly, the transatlantic Trade and Technology Council is a nice constructive-sounding thing to be doing. But as we’ve written before, the officials involved play down any chance of rapid convergence in anything but minor issues.So that’s how we read the transatlantic state of play right now. Biden is keen to sound co-operative with Europe, but his domestic political calculation gives him very limited space to do anything substantial beyond improvised fixes to problems as they loom up ahead. Watch out for a lot of performative but ultimately unproductive callisthenics ahead.Harry Dempsey has a great piece on the woes of another industry suffering owing to global supply chain snags: paint.Before reading it, we had no idea just how complex the chains involved in producing a single tin of paint actually were.

267  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.The whistleblower behind the Facebook Papers, Frances Haugen, is speaking in the European parliament in Brussels today as part of her extensive tour of European capitals (London, Berlin and Lisbon so far). We’ll look at what ammunition MEPs hope to gather from this hearing in their efforts to rein in Big Tech.Also today (and tomorrow), finance ministers are gathering in Brussels first in eurogroup, then in full Ecofin format, to discuss inflation, energy prices and the commission’s recent proposals on how to approach a review of the bloc’s fiscal rules. I’ll unpack their agenda and what prospects are for progress, pending the formation of a new government in Berlin.And on the Covid-19 vaccination front, we look at political tensions brewing in the Baltics, most strikingly between the president and the prime minister of Lithuania.The controversial practice of targeted advertising is back in the spotlight today when Frances Haugen, a Facebook whistleblower, addresses lawmakers at the European parliament, writes Javier Espinoza in Brussels.With an update of the bloc’s tech rules still under discussion, Brussels is feeling increased pressure from politicians, academics, activists and privacy watchdogs to introduce a ban or at least limit the extent to which companies including Google and Facebook (now known as Meta) are able to track users’ online behaviour and sell the resulting profiles for targeted advertising.An outright ban would be a massive blow to Big Tech, as their core business model relies on the multibillion dollar adtech industry.So far, the European Commission has been reluctant to include an outright ban. EU officials argue that the move is likely to disproportionately hurt small businesses, which rely on targeted advertising to let users on social media know about their products and services. Tech executives argue a ban is not needed if privacy rules are enforced properly.That has not stopped the controversy around the practice. Earlier this year, MEPs from the centre-left Socialists and Democrats launched a campaign entitled #AdsZuck (a reference to Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg) which sought to gather signatures for a public petition calling for a total ban on targeted advertising. Some 2,000 people have signed the petition so far.Today’s hearing (which you can watch live here from 16:45 CET) with Haugen is an attempt to gather more ammunition for the parliament’s stance that the planned update to the bloc’s tech regulation doesn’t go far enough.Axel Voss, a centre-right German MEP involved in the negotiations on tech regulation, is likely to ask Haugen how to “prevent targeted ads from being tools for harmful content, for instance, for children, while not banning [it] altogether”, according to a person with knowledge of his question.Haugen will know a thing or two about social media causing harm to children (Read her full profile). During her time at Facebook, she gathered a trove of documents exposing the company’s alleged culture of putting profits over the wellbeing of its users. Facebook has said she was a mid-level employee with no decision power who mischaracterised the way the company works.Some are hoping her arrival in Brussels at a time of deep political divisions inside the parliament over the draft rules for the modern internet will help unblock the impasse on the day lawmakers were supposed to have a common position ready to be debated with member states and the commission.According to the US-based activist group Avaaz, Haugen’s revelations are a “golden opportunity” to influence the last stages of the Digital Services Act. Avaaz says MEPs need to focus on three key battles: regulation of platform’s “harmful” algorithms, opening up of the platforms’ black box of data and stronger enforcement of EU rules.Andreas Schwab, another German centre-right MEP involved in tech regulation, said the testimony “will probably further reveal the problematic role platforms such as Facebook play in modern society”. Schwab said that the tech rules currently under discussion will not be enough to “tackle political advertising, fake news and foreign interference in domestic politics online”, urging the commission to “hurry” with its complementary proposals on these topics.“We must never have another Cambridge Analytica 2.0 where personal data is abused for political gain,” Schwab said in reference to the UK data company that was hired by Donald Trump’s campaign to influence US voters in the 2016 presidential election. “Haugen’s revelations have shown that we cannot wait any longer,” Schwab said.The UK government’s own independent climate adviser, the Climate Change Committee, estimates that eliminating net greenhouse gas emissions from the UK will come with a bill of £1.4tn by 2050. That is the equivalent of £1,700 a year on average for every household, coming on top of £3,000 of tax increases unrelated to climate change that Boris Johnson’s government has also imposed over the next few years. (More here)EU finance ministers are gathering in Brussels today to have an exchange of views on how the bloc’s economic governance (and a return to the bloc’s fiscal rules in 2023) should be structured in the post-pandemic era, but without a new finance minister in Berlin the discussion isn’t likely to get very far.As the FT wrote last week, the likelihood of fiscal hawk Christian Lindner being appointed at the helm of the Bundesfinanzministerium is raising alarm bells among economists.And with COP26 in Glasgow making abundantly clear that a lot more, not less, public spending will be needed to meet Europe’s greenhouse gas emission targets and transition away from fossil fuels over the next decades, analysts are starting to worry about where the EU’s finance ministers are headed.“On present policy,” writes UniCredit chief economist Erik Nielsen in a note to investors, “such a boost to investment is made impossible by the combination of the EU’s fiscal rules and the political reality of not wanting to raise taxes or cut other expenditure in sufficient amounts.”In an interview last week with the FT, Lindner said that “pressing on with an ultra-expansionary fiscal policy for Europe would be a big danger” — a position other fiscal hawks in the bloc are only too happy to endorse.Other topics for discussion at today’s eurogroup and tomorrow’s Ecofin are:Covid-19 cases are sky-high in the Baltic countries and so are political tensions, writes Richard Milne, Nordic and Baltic correspondent.Most striking is the squabbling between Lithuania’s president and the government in Vilnius over pandemic measures.Last week president Gitanas Nauseda vetoed a bill proposing that unvaccinated workers should pay for their own Covid-19 tests, causing prime minister Ingrida Simonyte to sharply criticise the head of state for interfering in Lithuania’s efforts to jab more people.In a way, the tension is not strange. Nauseda beat Simonyte in the 2019 presidential election and state broadcaster LRT reports the two have not had their weekly official meeting in two months.Nauseda and the government have found room to agree on foreign policy, taking the same tough line against Belarus and China and strongly proclaiming Vilnius’s defence of democracy and freedom.But the timing of the latest squabble is poor. It came two weeks after Nauseda suggested the government had deliberately slowed vaccination efforts so as to humiliate him after he set a mid-July jab target of 70 per cent.Covid numbers have been surging in the Baltics, recently putting all three states in the top 10 per capita worldwide, although there are signs they are starting to fall.Covid-related political tensions are not confined to Lithuania.Estonia’s new president, Alar Karis, also criticised the government in Tallinn, saying it had not done well enough, especially on communication. His comments followed the resignation of Estonia’s culture minister, reportedly the only member of government not to be fully vaccinated, after weeks of pressure over some of her sceptical views.All three Baltic countries, and much of eastern Europe, are struggling with a fourth wave of Covid-19 due to lower-than-EU-average vaccinations. The political sniping is likely to continueand later this week
268  Unlike competing ETFs, which offer exposure to futures prices of carbon credits, the SparkChange Physical Carbon EUA ETC (CO2), which launched on the London Stock Exchange on Thursday, is the first ETF to invest directly and exclusively in EU allowances (or EUAs), otherwise known as pollution permits.The idea is that by buying the ETF investors are withdrawing carbon allowances from the market and therefore preventing polluters from using them, driving up the cost of the remaining EUAs and helping stop emissions from occurring in the first place. EUAs have almost doubled in price since the beginning of the year rising from about €35 per tonne at the beginning of January to a high of almost €65 at the end of September. The launch day was a success. Assets under management swelled from $1m at the opening bell to more than $11m by the close of trade, according to Hector McNeil, co-founder of HanETF, the white-label ETF provider that partnered with SparkChange to bring the ETF to market.“Buying a physically-backed carbon allowance and effectively taking the permit to pollute away from a polluter does exactly that — it forces polluters to reduce emissions now,” said Jan Ahrens, head of research at SparkChange. He noted that EUAs, with their controlled supply, differed from uncapped carbon offsets, although both were sometimes referred to as carbon credits. Kenneth Lamont, senior fund analyst for passive funds research at Morningstar Europe, said the concept of investing directly in EUAs via the ETF was an interesting development that offered distinct advantages over futures-based carbon credit ETFs.“By tracking physical contracts the new ETC neatly sidesteps the additional pricing noise created by tracking futures,” Lamont said. “This is particularly important when the futures market is in contango — [a phenomenon that] occurs when the price of carbon allowances are expected to rise. In this environment investors can lose money even when the spot price of carbon credits is rising.”US investors have access to four ETFs investing in carbon futures prices: the KraneShares Global Carbon ETF (KRBN); KraneShares California Carbon Allowance ETF (KCCA); KraneShares European Carbon Allowance ETF (KEUA); and iPathA Series B Carbon ETN (GRN). WisdomTree relaunched its futures-based Carbon ETF (CARB) on the LSE in August this year. However, some industry observers sounded a note of caution.Patrick Wood Uribe, chief executive of Util, a sustainable investment data provider, said one-dimensional actions could have “unintended consequences”. “What happens if you do allow investors to restrict the supply of allowances?” he said.Wood Uribe argued that one of the outcomes could be rising energy prices, which could in turn have negative social consequences if prices increased too quickly. Polluters could also simply decide it is worth paying for the trade, he said.Wood Uribe said he welcomed the idea of trying to solve a non-financial problem in a financial way, but added: “It does highlight how important it is to think holistically about these things.”Lana Khabarova, founder of SustainFi, a sustainable and impact investing site, agreed that investors who genuinely wanted to buy the ETF ought to give it careful thought.Where climate change meets business, markets and politics. Explore the FT’s coverage here. Are you curious about the FT’s environmental sustainability commitments? Find out more about our science-based targets hereShe said that, while there were no intentions to increase the amount of EUAs in supply, Article 29a of the EU emissions trading directive allowed authorities to increase the supply of allowances if there had been significant and sustained price rises, which could affect the value of the ETF’s holdings.Khabarova also said that EUAs were already used by hedge funds to hedge their exposure to investments in oil and gas stocks raising the prospect that this ETF could be used in the same way.But, despite potential problems she said she welcomed the new fund. “I think it’s great that investors can invest in carbon credits, whether via futures or physical credits.”She said carbon prices were “way too low to meet Paris Agreement goals” and that they needed to exceed $100 a tonne.Lamont agreed the product’s positive attributes could not be ignored. “This is a great example of an ETC/ETF providing access to markets that had once been the preserve of institutional investors,” he said.Click here to visit the ETF Hub As part of our coverage of COP26 we want to hear from you.

269  As the EU’s biggest economies bounce back from the coronavirus crisis, one lags far behind: Spain.The country, the worst hit in Europe by the economic impact of the crisis last year, is making much less progress than other eurozone members in regaining pre-pandemic levels of output.“Right now there’s cause for concern,” said Alicia Coronil, chief economist at Singular Bank, a Madrid-based private bank. “Compared with the eurozone average, the economy shrunk more last year, inflation is higher [at a three decade peak of 5.5 per cent] and growth is slower.”As of the end of the third quarter, Italy’s gross domestic product was 1.4 per cent below its end-2019 level. Germany narrowed the gap to 1.1 per cent and France to a mere 0.1 per cent. But in Spain the gap is more of a gulf. Its GDP remains 6.6 per cent below pre-pandemic levels. The economy has only just returned to its size in 2016.Pablo Casado, the leader of the country’s centre-right People’s party, accuses the leftwing government of having overseen “the worst recovery in the developed world”.After 18 months in which countries’ economic performance closely tracked their struggles with the pandemic, the Spanish experience represents a decoupling of sorts. Spain has some of Europe’s lowest infection rates, but that does not appear to be providing an economic boost relative to its neighbours.“The recovery has beendelayed compared with other countries and compared with what was expected,” said Raymond Torres, chief economist at Spain’s savings bank foundation.He cites three factors — faltering household consumption; rising energy prices that have contributed heavily to inflation; and a delay in the use of the EU’s €800bn recovery fund. Spain is one of the fund’s main beneficiaries, with €140bn of grants and loans over the next six years.The bigger question is how the delays may damage the country’s longer term prospects.Torres said Spanish households had proved reluctant to spend the €55bn in savings he estimated they built up in the pandemic. He links that nervousness to a sense of precariousness in the workforce — about a quarter of jobs are temporary — and the impact of energy prices. Even before recent record highs, Spaniards spent proportionally much more than elsewhere in Europe on electricity — an average of more than 8 per cent of net disposable income in 2019.Antoni Cañete, the head of Pimec, Catalonia’s small and medium business association, also highlights the impact on growth of the supply chain crisis on sectors such as Spain’s crucial auto industry, and problems with the tourist season, which started poorly, although it rallied in late summer.Torres adds that delays to the EU funds may have held back not just government but also private sector investment, which has remained weak, while domestic consumption edged down in the third quarter.Many corporate leaders want to move ahead with showpiece projects, but privately complain about the slow release of funds — which is partly because of talks between Madrid and Brussels over state aid and partly reflects the complexities of putting many projects out to tender.According to a recent report by AIReF, Spain’s fiscal watchdog, the government had access to almost €5bn of the recovery funds by the end of August — covering the latest data available — but had only spent €104m. While economists agree that the funds are better spent well than quickly, the watchdog said the delay would slow their impact on growth.Such factors have hit expectations for recovery. Just over a year ago, the government forecast that the economy would expand in 2021 by 9.8 per cent — including a 2.6 per cent rise brought about by the recovery funds.But Madrid’s forecast for 2021 has come down to 6.5 per cent — and the consensus today is that growth will be even lower. Third-quarter growth was below expectations and second-quarter figures were revised downward from an estimate of 2.8 per cent to just 1.1 per cent. AIReF now expects growth this year of 5.5 per cent — making up less than half the damage of 2020.The government insists the recovery is strong and not necessarily captured by GDP figures that have not yet been finalised. The number of people paying social security — the most commonly used gauge of the labour market — reached an all-time high of almost 20m last month. For the first time in 46 years, unemployment did not increase in October, traditionally a difficult month for the country’s highly seasonal economy.“These figures are very encouraging,” Isabel Rodríguez, the government’s spokeswoman, said this month. “All the indicators signal that the economy is growing.”Some observers say that for decades Spain’s economy has lagged behind the rest of Europe in the economic cycle and that its swings are more violent, with bigger rises and steeper falls.Indeed that in part is the concern of economists such as Coronil and Torres. Next year the main drivers of the economy — private consumption, investment, EU funds and tourism — could all speed up. With energy costs unlikely to subside, and inflation already high, that may add to the price pressure.It is a preoccupation shared by business. “There are lots of little things that are holding back growth,” said Cañete of the Catalan small business association. “But what is worse is that inflation is getting higher and we could lose competitiveness.That is the big worry we have.”This article has been amended since publication to clarify a reference to government and private sector investment
270  So-called linker ETFs registered global net investor inflows of $31.7bn in the first nine months of 2021 — more than double the $15.7bn they attracted over the whole of last year, according to ETFGI, a London-based consultancy. Total assets held in inflation linked ETFs had risen to $114bn by the end of September, up 39.5 per cent from $81.7bn at the end of last year, according to ETFGI. Deborah Fuhr, founder of ETFGI, attributes the sudden shift to recent big rises in the cost of living, globally. “Investors’ concerns about inflation are driving inflows into inflation-linked bond ETFs,” she says. These concerns are now at such a level as to push inflows into inflation-linked bond ETFs — previously seen as a niche product in most investors’ portfolios — ahead of flows into traditionally more popular categories, such as corporate bonds, high yield and emerging market ETFs, Fuhr notes.And the flows only underscore how difficult it is for bond investors at the moment, according to Michael John Lytle, chief executive of Tabula Investment Management, a fixed-income ETF provider. He points out that they are facing a period of high uncertainty when so-called experts have little to go on.“Economies are not overly good at expanding rapidly with unknown dynamics,” Lytle observes — referring to the rebound after the global contraction caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. He adds that the world has entered a phase in which “prognosticators” are effectively “speculating when prices will come back down again”.“Anything’s possible,” Lytle says. “The thing that’s happened in the last few months is that prognosticators are all over the map.” Usually, he points out, there would be far more consensus.“So investors need inflation hedging tools that they previously never needed,” he adds.However, ETF investors also need to have some understanding of how the underlying linker securities work, so that they can understand what kind of protection they are buying. Inflation-protected ETFs usually offer a choice of protection based on either realised or expected inflation. Realised inflation protection is provided by products that track indices of straightforward US Treasury inflation-protected securities (Tips) or other inflation-linked bonds that track consumer price index data. Tips and similar linkers are therefore backward looking, in that they are based on bonds that are linked to reported inflation metrics. Alternatively, investors can choose to invest in ETFs that track an index of inflation expectations, otherwise known as the break-even rate.Tabula believes its US Enhanced Inflation Ucits ETF (TINF) is unique in offering exposure to both.When choosing inflation protected ETFs, investors must think about the duration of the underlying securities, as well. “The longer the duration of the instrument, the more exposure you have to interest rate changes,” explains Lytle. A lot depends on how long an investor plans to stay invested and whether they believe that the current sharp rise in inflation will be transitory or become entrenched. Market views on exactly that point have been changing rapidly. For example, short term government bond yields rocketed in October, as the market began to price in anticipated central bank rate rises.Medium-term bond funds have been investors’ preferred choice in recent months. The $35.7bn iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP) — which invests in bonds with a range of maturities — attracted the lion’s share of flows into inflation-protected bond ETFs, taking in $8.4bn in the year to October 21, according to data from CFRA. At the end of October, holdings in the iShares fund — the largest inflation protected ETF in terms of assets under management — had a weighted average maturity of around 8 years. Bonds with a 3-5 year maturity constituted the largest proportion of the portfolio, at approximately 23 per cent, but nearly 16 per cent of the portfolio was in bonds with a maturity of more than 20 years. The fund had no holdings of bonds with a 10-15 year maturity.Schwab’s $21.4bn US Tips ETF (SCHP) — another linker ETF that CFRA would consider an intermediate maturity product with a weighted average maturity of about 8 years — was ranked third for inflows. It accrued $6.7bn in the same 12-month period. Investors need inflation hedging tools that they previously never neededTwo short-term bond ETFs were ranked second and fourth. The $18bn Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities ETF (VTIP) attracted $7.4bn, while the $7.4bn iShares 0-5 Year Tips Bond ETF (STIP) attracted inflows of $4.2bn.By contrast, Pimco’s $880m 15+ Year US Tips Index Exchange Trade Fund (LTPZ), which has an effective maturity of more than 23 years, had attracted just $120m.While inflation has been dominating headlines there is no suggestion from analysts that investors should be shifting a significant portion of their portfolios to ETFs providing protection against rising prices.“It’s not about reorienting your portfolio to 50 per cent inflation products, that would be insane,” says Lytle. He suggests that investors should still try to build portfolios that they believe will generate the best returns.Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at New York-based CFRA Research agrees that linker ETFs should be only one part of an allocation strategy. “Inflation-protected ETFs are well suited for a slice of your fixed income exposure,” he says. His advice is that investors consider using these products for a portion of their exposure to US Treasuries — or as a replacement of that existing exposure.
271  “We were told that. for a few minutes on one provider it wasn’t possible to call Slovakia because 10,000 people had decided to call the Czech Republic to ask what was happening,” says Martin Drnek, a manager at Scio.The episode was one of the many forms of disruption caused by the rapid shift from the physical to the online world ushered in by the pandemic. Education worldwide has been thrown into chaos by Covid-19, with lockdowns and other disruption affecting more than 220m tertiary-level students, according to Unesco, the UN’s cultural organisation. At universities, not only have classes moved online, but entrance exams have undergone a digital shift to adapt to a Covid-affected world.One of the biggest challenges of such exams is that there are — or should be — no second chances. All candidates must take an exam under the same conditions and at the same time, for the sake of fairness and to avoid questions leaking. So, now that exams are being conducted online, artificial intelligence and machine-learning technology are being harnessed to identify and prevent cheating.After negotiating the first year of the pandemic using software provided by other companies, Scio developed its own to test and monitor university applicants. It paired with Born Digital, a Czech start-up founded by Tomas Malovec in 2019, which specialises in AI and machine learning techniques. The resulting online exam system is due to go live this year.If we have online teaching, it’s good to accept students who have experience with online education and who know how to work onlineBeyond the most basic problem of ensuring that the system is stable, one of the biggest challenges of switching to online exams, says Drnek, is familiarising students with a system they may never have used before — both so that they can perform to the best of their abilities and so they do not accidentally do anything that could be construed as cheating.The software, called ScioLink, addresses this in various ways, says Malovec. To spare students any problems in downloading the software to monitor them during exams, it is embedded in the exam webpage.Then, to ensure the right person is performing the test, ScioLink photographs the candidate’s face and identity document using their webcam. It requires them to perform a 360-degree scan of their surroundings by webcam, and monitors their behaviour during the test via the webcam, along with the computer’s other systems, including the microphone. If a candidate engages in actions deemed to be suspicious, the software warns them in real time.“In most cases, people are not trying to cheat. They just don’t know they are doing something forbidden. For example, someone calls and they pick up their phone — it could be just their mother asking them something,” says Malovec. “[If they are warned] they can correct it immediately.”If someone is trying to cheat, however, Born Digital’s AI model has various ways of catching them. It can detect whether other people are present in the room, and has been trained to recognise if someone is wearing earphones to be fed information. It can also recognise forbidden aids such as books or devices, such as smartphones and calculators — something Malovec says was not straightforward. “A phone is frequently just a black rectangle, so it is not simple. There was a lot of playing with things like this [during development],” he says.Born Digital’s software does not itself rule whether someone has cheated. Instead, it alerts examiners to the point during the exam at which a potential breach occurred. This allows them to review footage of the incident without trawling through hours of otherwise unimpeachable exam conduct.Malovec says students will be “inventive” when it comes to evading the monitoring technology, but points out that the software is always learning. He also predicts universities will increasingly embrace online tests, saying this is only the beginning of a period of change.Juraj Mokry, vice-dean of the medical faculty at Comenius University in Bratislava, says online entrance exams can also indicate whether candidates will be able to cope with online teaching, which he expects to continue once the pandemic subsides. “If we have online teaching, it’s good to accept students who have experience with online education and who know how to work online,” he says. “It’s not only about excellence in chemistry and biology. It’s also testing how they can handle problems with computers and everything.”However, he stops short of arguing that online tests should completely replace in-person exams. “We should offer some variability,” he says. “Like with education, one person prefers to learn from a screen, another from a textbook, another prefers to listen. It should be the same here.”
272  The EU could abandon the entire Brexit agreement with the UK if London goes through with its threat to suspend parts of the withdrawal deal, Ireland’s foreign minister has warned.In some of the strongest public comments to date, which suggested a full blown trade war was looming, Simon Coveney told broadcaster RTE that the UK was deliberately pushing for a deal it knew it could not get.Retaliatory action from Brussels would follow any action from London, he said. “One is contingent on the other. So that if one is being set aside, there is a danger that the other will also be set aside by the EU.”That raises the spectre of a breakdown in relations between London and Brussels.The UK government has said for weeks that the conditions exist for it to suspend parts of the Brexit deal because of deep differences over how to make post-Brexit trade rules work for Northern Ireland.The region was left inside the EU’s customs union and single market, despite Britain’s exit, under the so-called Northern Ireland protocol. That was in order to avoid a land border on the island of Ireland and the need to protect the 1998 peace deal that ended three decades of sectarian strife.London has dismissed concessions from Brussels made last month that would simplify Irish Sea customs checks and is refusing to accept oversight of the deal from the EU’s top court.UK Brexit negotiator Lord David Frost and Maros Sefcovic, EU vice-president and Brexit point man, were due to meet again on November 12 in London. Brussels says it has been more than flexible; the UK says it has not gone far enough.London is now widely expected to trigger Article 16 of the withdrawal agreement — putting the deal or parts of it on hold — within days.Coveney said that would be seen by the EU as “deliberately forcing a breakdown in relations and negotiations between the two sides”. Leaders of Northern Ireland’s pro-UK unionist parties criticised an unnamed EU diplomat who was quoted in the Daily Telegraph as saying EU leaders were increasingly frustrated and “prepared for peace [but] ready for war” over Article 16. They said the phrase, paraphrasing a loyalist paramilitary slogan, was fanning tensions.In recent days in the region, two buses have been set ablaze in parts of Northern Ireland and there have been skirmishes after other protests against the protocol.The EU increasingly believes London is seeking to collapse negotiations in a bid to get the EU to rewrite the protocol. “I think they are deliberately asking for what they know they can’t get,” Coveney added.Last week, Irish Taoiseach Micheál Martin slammed London’s stance as irresponsible, unwise and.reckless”.Invoking Article 16 “would have far-reaching implications for the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union,” he said.
273  The Vatican will incur a loss of £100m in donations intended for the needy when it completes the pending sale of a luxurious London office building now at the centre of an international criminal investigation.The Vatican is in the final stages of selling 60 Sloane Avenue, a building in the Knightsbridge district of London, for about £200m to private equity group Bain Capital, according to several people familiar with the process. Bain Capital and Savills, which is managing the sale, both declined to comment.Senior Holy See officials invested a total of €350m of donations in the London building between 2014 and 2018, the Vatican has said, meaning that the sale is expected to confirm a loss of about £100m for the Catholic Church.The Vatican prosecutors say the money invested in the building and other investments was derived from Peter’s Pence, an annual donation given by Catholics around the world which, according to the Vatican, is intended “for the many different needs of the universal church and for the relief of those most in need”.The London building, at one point intended to be converted into luxury flats, is at the heart of a scandal that has forced the Vatican to overhaul completely the way it manages its finances.Late last year Pope Francis stripped the Vatican’s powerful central administration office of an investment portfolio worth hundreds of millions of euros made up of donations from Catholics.The soured bet on a booming London property market has left some commercial agents and investors nonplussed.“I couldn’t quite understand how they [the Vatican] had lost money on it,” said one agent with decades of experience in the London office market.Vatican prosecutors earlier this year charged Raffaele Mincione, a former Italian banker, with various crimes including fraud and embezzlement.Mincione’s companies acquired the London building in 2012 for £129m. Two years later a unit of the Vatican managing charitable donations bought a stake in the property via an investment fund founded by Mincione at a far higher valuation. The Vatican acquired the rest of the building in 2018.Vatican prosecutors say Mincione’s companies made a large profit from investing in the Knightsbridge building.He has denied any wrongdoing, saying that the increase in the property’s value was justified by audited and independent third-party consultants. He has also said the Vatican was always advised by its own investment banks.Vatican criminal proceedings against Mincione and others, including a cardinal, were paused last month and charges against the accused lifted after the Vatican judge requested that the prosecutors provide additional evidence to the defence lawyers.Lawyers acting for Mincione have said the lifting of the charges means the case against him in the Vatican court is legally and, in effect, “null”.The Vatican has said it disagrees on the status of the proceedings. Another hearing is expected to take place at the end of this month.Mincione has had €48m of his assets frozen in Switzerland at the request of the Vatican’s prosecutors as part of the criminal investigation. He is pursuing a separate civil claim against the Holy See in the English High Court seeking “declaratory relief”, a ruling which would judge that he acted properly.Mincione has said that he was never aware that the money that was being invested on behalf of the Vatican was derived from charitable funds, and that Vatican officials were responsible for the loss because in 2018 they prematurely pulled out of the investment, and allowed planning permission for the construction of luxury flats to lapse. Vatican prosecutors allege that the loss was a result of a complex fraud.The English court is expected to rule on whether the case against the Vatican can be brought by Mincione’s companies before the end of this month.
274  At the COP26 climate conference last week, activists awarded Norway their “Fossil of the Day” prize. It’s an accolade Oslo’s brand-new government could have done without at its first global outing. But it highlights the dilemma faced by Norway, as a big fossil fuel producer, and even more so by the EU, whose economy is deeply reliant on natural gas.In a punchy first interview, Jonas Gahr Store, Norway’s new prime minister, told the Financial Times that Europe’s green transition required his country to keep drilling. A rapid end to Norwegian hydrocarbon supplies, he said, “would put a stop to an industrial transition that is needed” to decarbonise.It is, of course, a self-serving argument. It flies in the face of the International Energy Agency’s road map to net zero, which calls for no more investment in new oil and gas developments. It also goes against the EU’s quixotic demand for an end to hydrocarbon extraction in the Arctic.That said, the argument may be right. It is correct technologically, in that substituting natural gas for coal and oil is the necessary next step to reduce emissions. It captures important truths about the political economy of oil and gas-exporting countries. Even a population as climate-conscious as Norway’s has nowhere near a majority for phasing out fossil extraction. It reflects geopolitical reality: less Norwegian gas would make Europe even more dependent on Russian president Vladimir Putin’s caprice.Above all, it exposes the political challenge of the EU’s green ambitions. The intention to decarbonise is genuine. But the continent remains highly dependent on natural gas, and would become more so by weaning itself off coal.And yet, the short-term logic comes with a long-term contradiction. If the EU encourages gas investments to meet short-term needs, it could lock itself into its dependence on gas for a long time. The argument for gas as a transitional energy runs up against the fact that nobody develops a gasfield planning to switch it off in five to ten years’ time. So the EU and Norway are caught in a hypocritical embrace, with North Sea gas set to power European homes and businesses for the long haul.There is a way out, as all sides recognise. Natural gas needn’t be burnt for its energy content. It can serve as a feedstock for hydrogen. If carbon is captured and stored (CCS) in the process, the resulting “blue” hydrogen is a source of carbon-free energy.The technologies exist for using it to power heavy vehicles unsuited for batteries, ships and high-temperature industrial processes such as steel. In fact, some activities are hard to decarbonise in any other way, and CCS is a sine qua non if net negative emissions are to become possible.What is missing is infrastructure and a market. To switch gas from a combustible energy source to hydrogen feedstock requires transport and storage for hydrogen and CO2, and facilities to sequester carbon. Such investments are hard to justify unless sufficient demand is expected.This is a chicken-and-egg problem. For there to be enough demand, mass adoption of hydrogen-powered technologies in the relevant sectors is necessary. That in turn is economically viable only if users are confident hydrogen supply will be forthcoming.It is in the EU’s power to create a market. It is in the gift of gas-producing countries to ensure large-scale hydrogen supplies. But for either to happen, both must jump together.The EU bears the greatest responsibility to make this happen. It has a hydrogen strategy. But speak to public and private decision-makers in Norway, and scepticism that the EU means business is close to the surface. They question if Europe has the stomach for the tough choices net zero requires, such as a carbon price that bites. And does Europe fully endorse blue hydrogen and CCS, or is it wedded to the less efficient “green” hydrogen made from electrolysing water? That choice would be as self-defeating as Germany’s turn from nuclear energy, which made it use more coal.If the EU were to commit to blue hydrogen, and put its money where its mouth is, it could demand the corresponding commitment to supply from Norway. Rather than a ban on Arctic exploration, it could demand a policy to allow further gas extraction only with infrastructure that could be swiftly converted to blue hydrogen production with carbon storage.Politically, or even legally binding, instruments could be found to assure each side that both demand and supply would be forthcoming. For Oslo, such a policy offers a compromise with those demanding an outright phaseout of fossil fuels. It might even be allowed to return its Glasgow award.
275  Airlines are preparing to lay on hundreds of thousands more seats between the UK and Greece next summer than they did in 2019 in the hope of a boom in foreign holidays as travel restrictions ease.Jet2 and easyJet are among carriers that have added capacity to their pre-pandemic flight schedule for 2022. Jet2 said it had 1m more seats on sale between Greece and the UK than it had offered in 2019, while easyJet has plans to add about 500,000 more flight tickets to its schedule subject to space being made available at airports.“Having met most of the tour operators and airline companies here in the UK.we are very, very optimistic about 2022,” said Vassilis Kikilias, the Greek tourism minister, speaking to the Financial Times at the World Travel Market conference in London.Kikilias said that Greece was expecting 35 per cent more tourists from the UK next year than it had in 2021, equalling the record level of about 3.6m in 2019. He forecast that the “sun, sea and sand” season would start earlier than usual, in March.The agreements between the airlines and the Greek government, with the tourism ministry helping to secure airport slots for planes in return for guarantees of inbound flights, are an indication of the travel industry’s faith in a strong bounceback in foreign travel next year.Michael O’Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, has said he expects the recovery to hit full swing by next summer, when his airline will be operating more than 500 new routes across Europe.“We are looking at very substantial growth next year,” he said.Several tour operators including Tui, Europe’s largest, have said that reservations for holidays in summer 2022 have already surpassed the level of bookings at the equivalent point in 2019 with consumers choosing to spend savings from lockdown on higher grade accommodation and resorts.Greece was one of the first European countries to reopen to international tourists following the first lockdowns in 2020. Tourism-related income makes up about 25 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product.The UK is Greece’s second-largest inbound market after Germany but tight UK restrictions on travel this year forced many to holiday at home.Kikilias, who was appointed to the tourism ministry in September having previously been health minister, said the country had taken a “calculated risk” in opening up early but that it had paid off with greater confidence from consumers that Greece was safe to travel to.The government installed extra doctors in hotels, added health service workers to Greece’s popular island destinations and used €320m of EU funding to upgrade its tourism sector, the minister said.Greece had targeted 50 per cent of 2019’s passenger numbers and income in 2021, equivalent to between €5bn and €6bn in tourism-related spending, but the government said it had already reached 65 per cent of 2019’s income levels so far this year.Wizz Air, Lufthansa and Ryanair are among airlines to have reported their first profitable quarter since the start of the pandemic in the three months to the end of September. IAG, the owner of British Airways, has forecast a return to profit in the second or third quarter of next year.
276  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
277  Thousands of Poles took part in vigils and marches on Saturday following the death of a pregnant woman whose case has reignited a debate about the country’s highly restrictive abortion laws.In the capital Warsaw, thousands marched through the city centre, bearing placards with slogans such as “My body, my choice”, and “It could have been any of us”, and chanting “Not one woman more”, and “Shame!”Smaller protests and marches also took place in other towns and cities, including Gdansk, Wroclaw, Szczecin and Pszczyna, the town in southern Poland where the woman died.The 30-year-old, identified only as Izabela, died after going to hospital in her 22nd week of pregnancy when her waters broke. Her family said in a statement that she had told them that doctors waited for her unborn baby, which had congenital defects, to die rather than perform an abortion. The foetus died, and after less than 24 hours in hospital Izabela died from septic shock.Izabela’s death follows a controversial ruling last year by Poland’s constitutional tribunal that a 1993 law allowing abortions in the case of severe foetal abnormalities was unconstitutional.The ruling, which sparked huge protests across the country, tightened what were already some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the EU and left only two grounds for a termination: a threat to the mother’s health or if the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest.Politicians from the ruling conservative-nationalist Law and Justice party, which has close links to Poland’s influential Catholic church, said that those rules would not have prevented an abortion from being carried out in Izabela’s case.“If the life or health of the mother is threatened then an abortion is still possible, and here nothing has changed,” Mateusz Morawiecki, Poland’s prime minister, said this week.However, women’s rights activists say that the tightening of the laws has made doctors afraid of carrying out abortions, even if there is a risk to the mother’s life.“The situation is getting worse and worse. By slowly taking away women’s rights step by step, they are being taken away completely,” said Ola Wlodarczyk, a 32-year old who joined the march in central Warsaw.“We want our rights, our rights to our own bodies, back. The right to abortion is a fundamental human right.[This case shows] that these aren’t just slogans on placards and empty chants on the streets. It has a direct impact on women’s life and health.”The hospital in Pszczyna said on Friday that two doctors who had been on duty while Izabela was in the hospital had been suspended.In an earlier statement, it said that “all medical decisions were made taking into account the legal provisions and standards of conduct in force in Poland”.
278  Austria is to make full vaccination mandatory for entry into restaurants, bars and entertainment spaces as Vienna battles to contain soaring cases of Covid-19.Full vaccination status will also expire nine months after a second dose, rather than 12, the government said, unless extended by a booster shot.The rules — which will also recognise those who have recovered from proven coronavirus infections — will come into effect on Monday.Until now, entry into hospitality venues had been possible using the EU’s green pass certificate — which can include evidence of a recent negative PCR test.“If we want to prevent another lockdown, we must act now,” said chancellor Alexander Schallenberg at a press conference on Friday night, as he announced a tightening of the rules.Consumer services that involve close personal contact, such as hairdressing and beauty treatments, as well as any organised gathering of more than 25 people, will require evidence of full vaccination or recovery.Friday’s announcement triggered a surge in vaccinations in Austria over the weekend. On Saturday alone, 32,000 jabs were administered nationwide, of which a third were first doses, public health authorities said.Across Austria, vaccination centres reported record turnouts and the highest number of registrations since the summer, with snaking queues seen outside the country’s mobile “vaccination buses” and many people waiting up to an hour for a jab.Austrian media have dubbed it the “Schnitzelpanik” — a sarcastic reference to the risk of no longer being able to enjoy the country’s national dish in a restaurant having persuaded vaccine holdouts, where months of public health warnings and appeals to social responsibility had failed.In Upper Austria, where vaccination rates have been the lowest, 8,000 people booked appointments for a first injection on Saturday, compared with a daily average of just 1,000 the week before.Speaking to state-owned broadcaster ORF on Sunday, vice-chancellor Werner Kogler, of Austria’s Green party, warned that there was still the possibility of further restrictions if the situation did not improve. The new vaccination requirement would stay in place until at least Christmas, he said.The government is also looking to tighten up rules for workplaces, he added: the aim is to require those who are not fully vaccinated or recovered to have a recent PCR test to attend workplaces, Kogler said.The number of daily new infections in Austria has doubled in just five days: on Monday there were 4,523 new cases reported, and on Friday, 9388 cases.Rapidly rising case numbers are expected to imminently eclipse the previous highest recorded daily number of infections in Austria — 9,586 — seen in mid-November last year, to which the government responded with one of the strictest and longest lockdowns in Europe.The number of deaths has also been rising in recent weeks. Although it has done so at a less alarming rate than in previous waves, Austria’s relatively low vaccination rate means it is a cause for concern among public health authorities.In Germany, political leaders and health officials are demanding tighter regulations and the reimplementation of free coronavirus testing as cases rise.The government stopped offering free rapid testing to the public last month, hoping it would push the unvaccinated to get the jab. Germany requires vaccination, a negative test, or a certificate of recovery from the virus in order to access shops, restaurants, and other businesses and activities.But cases have skyrocketed in recent weeks, reaching 191 cases per 100,000 people on Sunday. Germany, like Austria, has also been struggling to get the unvaccinated to take the jab.The leaders of two German states have called for the reinstatement of free testing, as did the head of the German Medical Association, Klaus Reinhardt.On Thursday health authorities in Lower Austria said they were cancelling all non-urgent surgical procedures owing to a bed shortage.One in three Austrians has not yet had a first dose of the vaccine.Scepticism is relatively high in the country. Earlier this year, a new political party of vaccine sceptics, MFG, won 6.4 per cent of the vote, winning seats in one of the country’s most important regional elections. Subsequent polls have indicated MFG’s result would be replicated nationwide.Responding to the new vaccine requirements on Friday, the leader of Austria’s populist rightwing Freedom party, Herbert Kickl, dubbed the measures “corona reprisals” and castigated the conservative-led Austrian government’s record during the pandemic.“It is inexplicable why a fresh corona test should be worse than a vaccination given several months ago,” he said. “It clearly shows that the government has only one goal.to drive people towards the needle, with no ifs or buts.”
279  Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman has warned that moving too fast from gas to renewable energy would be “dangerous and irresponsible”, arguing that the recent energy crisis can be partly blamed on the industry being undervalued.Fridman said he would invest more in alternative energy to reduce the carbon impact of his oil and gas empire.But he cautioned against switching off gas supplies too quickly, saying the recent price surge reflected a lack of investment by companies given the “huge public pressure for decarbonisation”, and the signal this gave to investors and banks “to cut the relationship with oil and gas business”. He expected gas would be important for the energy mix for“dozens of years”.“Transition is a very complicated and very challenging process,” he told the Financial Times in an interview at his Mayfair headquarters. “For the time being, we don’t have any viable alternative to living without gas.”Fridman is one of Russia’s richest businessmen but spends half his time in the UK. LetterOne, his holding group, has more than $10bn to invest, and will announce its latest deal with a UK-based recycling business next week.The company’s pre-tax profit for 2021 is expected to exceed $5bn.Fridman has extensive holdings in Russia through Alfa Group, which he co-founded in 1991, but set up LetterOne with his partners in London in 2013 using $14bn raised from the sale of a stake in oil firm TNK-BP to Rosneft.LetterOne’s largest business is its energy division, which was chaired by former BP boss John Browne, who the FT can reveal left Fridman’s group last month after serving almost seven years. Outside energy, the investor has a sprawling portfolio spanning telecoms, financial services and retail businesses.Fridman’s long-term strategy is putting his company at odds with other investors in the sector.He signalled a forthcoming wrangle over the future of Wintershall Dea, Europe’s largest independent gas and oil company, in which LetterOne owns a third, alongside the majority shareholder BASF. Lord Browne has also stepped down as head of the company’s supervisory board.Fridman pointed to the pressure the German company had faced from investors and activists over its stake in the gas producer, and said there was “a distinction in approach” between LetterOne and BASF. BASF wants to sell its stake in the 127-year-old German business through an IPO, but LetterOne wants “to build a long-term strategy”.“For us, it’s a [long-term] mission to hold the business in the right direction. For BASF it’s a bit different,” he added.LetterOne is unlikely to sell out in any IPO at this point, and will not block the process, but could support a sale of part of the company to a private equity buyer.Fridman wants to support the company’s hugely profitable gas business alongside investing in renewables businesses and technology that “diminishes the negative environmental damage”.He said: “Let’s try to combine these two approaches.”In the UK, LetterOne is investing up to £1bn in fibre broadband in a regional infrastructure company called Upp, and in the healthcare sector it owns retailer Holland & Barrett, which Fridman said would have a new business model orientated towards services alongside products.He said the general environment in the UK for oligarchs had “deteriorated because of the stand-off between Russia and the west”, but added that “on a personal level, it’s become a bit more friendly, because people made a distinction between the general Russian oligarchs label and us personally”. Even so, he said there was a “kind of competitive disadvantage as a Russian” that required “additional efforts to convince people that we are doing things right”. The UK government, he added, had “a lot of information to make a distinction between good people and bad people.It will be important to find a way to make a distinction between politics, and those who like me want to become a normal business citizen.We try to be as transparent as possible.”The billionaire said he did not intend to give his five children any of his wealth, describing it as “dangerous” to inherit so much money and important that they made their own way.Unlike other Russian oligarchs, he is not a “glamorous person” with the “talent” to spend money. “I don’t have yachts. I don’t have planes. I have a house in London. I have a house in Moscow.”
280  A former aide of Emmanuel Macron has been sentenced to home detention and given a suspended prison term after beating up protesters three years ago, an incident that triggered allegations of a cover-up by the French president’s Elysée team.Alexandre Benalla, who was in charge of ensuring Macron’s security during the 2017 presidential election and then worked for him at the Elysée Palace, was caught on video punching a male protester and tackling a young woman in the fifth arrondissement of Paris during May Day union protests in 2018.On Friday, Benalla was ordered to spend a year under house arrest with an electronic bracelet and also received a two-year suspended prison sentence.The then 26-year-old was filmed at the protests in a helmet similar to those worn by riot police. But he dressed in casual clothes, hitting protesters, before leaving after his face was captured on video.“You betrayed the trust placed in you by your appointment,” said Isabelle Prévost-Desprez, president of the court, at the hearing on Friday, according to AFP.The magistrate underlined the apparent “impunity” and “omnipotence” of the defendant, who was also found guilty of fraudulently using his diplomatic passports after his dismissal, of having fabricated a false document to obtain a service passport and of illegally carrying a weapon in 2017.After video of the May Day violence was made public by Le Monde newspaper, Macron initially defended Benalla, saying: “If they want someone to blame, they should come and get me.” It then emerged that Macron and his team were aware of the incident but had failed to inform judicial authorities. Benalla had been suspended for two weeks but kept on the payroll before the revelations by Le Monde.In 2019, the French Senate also condemned “failings at the heart of the state” that led to other scandals involving Benalla, which included his arrangement of private security contracts worth over €1m for oligarchs seen as close to Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president. Senate investigators at the time described the Elysée Palace’s response to Benalla’s misdeeds as “incomprehensibly indulgent”.Benalla was also fined €500 and prohibited from holding public office for five years. Vincent Crase, a former employee of Macron’s La République en Marche party and an associate of Benalla, was also found to have committed “illegitimate violence” on protesters and received a two-year suspended prison sentence and a €500 fine.Two police officers were also for sentenced for having handed over video surveillance to Benalla. Maxence Creusat was fined €5,000, and Laurent Simonin was handed a three-month suspended prison term.Benalla’s lawyer Jacqueline Laffont told BFM TV channel on Friday night that her client would “obviously appeal the judgment”, adding that the verdict was “incredibly severe and totally disproportionate with the facts and requests from the prosecutors.”
281  There are no low-cost options when it comes to tackling climate change. Renewable energy is not cheaper than fossil-based power once the price of investment and storage are considered. Low-carbon energy will cost more.The only way to incentivise the world to shift to this more expensive low-carbon future is to make fossil fuels costlier, which means more carbon pricing.Such schemes typically take the form of taxes on polluters’ emissions or “cap and trade” systems that limit how much companies can emit before having to pay more.Convincing the electorate that carbon pricing is the right thing to do will not be easy. Society as a whole will need to bear these extra costs.The Emissions Gap Report 2021 published by the UN in October was a timely reminder of what we have achieved and what remains to be done to contain the increase in global temperatures to 1.5C.The good news is that more ambitious climate-change targets launched since the Paris Agreement in 2015 have brought us closer to the 1.5C target. The gap will be smaller still following India’s pledge at the COP26 summit to set more ambitious climate goals for 2030 and reach net zero by 2070.Major emitters are also starting to back up ambition with action. China has committed to stop coal investment abroad, while Joe Biden, the US president, is planning to spend more than $500bn on climate measures. In Europe, the EU’s Fit for 55 package proposes legislation to meet the continent’s climate ambitions.The bad news is that current commitments and actions are clearly not sufficient. More decisive action is urgently required. The world is still on a path close to 2.7C of global warming by the end of this century.So, what can get us on the 1.5C road to net zero?Government policies will play a key role, whether it be carbon pricing or subsidies for renewable power and other transition technologies. CRU’s Carbon Abatement Curve suggests that European businesses should prepare for CO2 prices of nearly $200 a tonne by 2030 if the EU is serious about its climate-change targets.Switching to renewable power is one of the relatively cheaper means of emission reduction, even with storage. But do not be fooled: renewable energy is not cheaper than fossil-based power once the cost of the initial investment and storage are considered.If we think about other sources of emissions in commodities — coal in steel, natural gas in ammonia — these sectors cannot simply electrify. They need new raw materials and production processes. Hydrogen is often viewed as the wonder solution, but we forecast that carbon prices would need to reach well over $200 a tonne to incentivise widespread adoption in steel, and even higher for fertilisers.The commodities industry is capital intensive. Switching to renewable power and electrifying operations is vastly expensive and takes years if not decades to achieve. That is why businesses benefit from a predictable policy environment. They need clarity around regulation, taxes and intermediate targets to net zero. In reality, such stability is likely to remain elusive. The current energy crisis is a case in point.Financial and private markets will also drive the energy transition. COP26 was the first COP summit where finance played a prominent role. Anecdotal evidence suggests that it is becoming harder to insure a coal mine in South Africa and trickier to raise funds for a new oil pipeline in the US.Yet there is still plenty of funding available for fossil-fuel projects. This suggests that climate considerations are still not centre stage in finance — but, on current trajectories, it could become mainstream quickly.Lack of finance for fossil fuels will raise the cost of funding and ultimately prices. In essence, this does the job of a carbon price. By pushing up the price of fossil fuels, it makes renewable energy and other low-carbon options more viable.Jumana Saleheen is chief economist and head of sustainability at consultancy CRU and Paul Butterworth is its research managerThe Commodities Note is an online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times
282  As the hot, dry, Mediterranean summer slides into autumn, we turn our backs on the sea, mountain-bound. From Thessaloniki, capital of central Macedonia, we skirt Mount Olympus, above which lightning rents holes through the baggy, sackcloth skies — not a good omen for our long-weekend walking trip. The heavens open, and the windscreen wipers swish for the duration of a three-hour drive along the deserted super-highway, the Egnatia Odos, westwards into the heartland of Epirus.The EU-funded motorway is a feat of engineering with seventy six tunnels and more than a thousand bridges. Completed in 2014, it runs parallel, some of the way, to the older Via Egnatia, built by the Romans two centuries before the birth of Christ. In Greece, you never quite get used to these extraordinary juxtapositions of the ancient and contemporary.Soon, we are transported across the great plains of Thessaly, the rolling wheat fields bumping up against the foothills of the Pindus Mountains. We pass billboards celebrating the fact that these hills are still home to brown bears, then beyond the gateway town of Metsovo, off the highway now, we finally push up into the Zagori, the name derived from Slavic words meaning the “place behind the mountains”. The sense of isolation grows as we wind up past waterfalls and ruined homesteads, around hairpin turns that look down on arched Ottoman bridges.Aristi, one of the 46 villages that make up the Zagori, is wreathed in woodsmoke as we approach. The sound of sheep bells reverberates around the hillsides. In the main square are the obligatory giant plane trees beneath which all Greek mountain village life unfurls, and set around it are the school, the church and crucially, the taverna, En Aristi. There, the owner and his family wait the tables at weekends, proffering shots of tsipouro and the herby pitte, or pies, that are a taster of the region’s memorable comfort food.A few steps away, Aristi Mountain Resort offers the cosiest hotel option in the Zagori: rooms with wood-burning stoves or open hearths spread across a series of traditional stone houses, with a spa and indoor pool. It will be a base for my three friends and me as we explore the surrounding peaks and canyons on foot. There’s a storybook quality to the place; when you step out of your own rosemary-fringed front door into an autumn morning it is like stepping out through the back of a wardrobe into a dreamscape.Rather than take a guide, we are relying on maps to plot our own routes, and on the first afternoon we follow a road of white limestone that forges down through the village and out on to the wild hillside. It leads to a single track bridge that crosses the crystalline waters of the Voidomatis. You can follow this path for several hours; past the frescoed 17th-century Spiliotissa monastery, stone age caves, and a ruined chapel. We skirt white riverine beaches all the way to the graceful, Ottoman-era arched bridge at Kleidonia. In winter, views over the bright water open up as the trees shed their leaves, revealing the snow settled on the serrated summit of Astraka.It is still too early for snow during our visit, but on the morning following our arrival the peaks reveal themselves slowly and seductively, through the veils of mist; a sensational backdrop to our breakfast table. By the second espresso, sunbeams pour like honey into the blackest folds of the valley. On the first full day of our long weekend, we decide to throw ourselves in at the deep end and walk the Vikos Gorge, often billed as the world’s deepest, relative to its width.The ancient cobbled kalderimi, or mule path, zigzags down from the village of Monodendri to the valley floor, past the imposing mansions of former merchants. Down in the bottom of the gorge we sidestep banks of scree and shale, following the riverbed, bone-dry despite recent rains. Beneath ranks of towering planes, limestone boulders, polished smooth by the seasonal torrents, are strewn around as though tossed by the giants of classical mythology. We lose track of the cairns we are following and instead are lured by the sound of water, echoing through the steep-walled canyon.Eventually we come upon the springs of Voidomatis, where the water is always icy, even in high summer. The mineral blue-green pools are pure enough to drink and certainly to swim in, which we do, warming ourselves afterwards in the sun that pours through the branches of the deciduous forests that fringe the lowest part of the gorge. Within this cool, green, silent world, lichen hang like bracelets from the branches of the hornbeam and the moss underfoot creates a bouncy, sometimes slippery tread.High above us is the 18th-century church of Theotokos Koimesis, abandoned though its frescoes are intact, and entered (we will discover later) via a low door that forces you to bend and humble yourself before God. In October, the surrounding plateau abounds with wild flowers. The wild cyclamen, which seem to bloom miraculously from bare rock, were prized for their purgative powers by the 18th-century shaman doctors of Vikos, the Vikogiatroi. Much of their knowledge of the plants of this unique ecosystem is sadly long lost, but the enthusiastic drinking of ironwort tea as a cure-all is still very much part of the culture.The shaman-doctors, like the bridge builders and secretive stonemasons of the region, formed self-protective guilds, and communicated in a private language, to prevent the secrets of their trades from being stolen. Zagori’s isolation worked in its favour during the time of the Ottoman sultans who allowed the region a degree of autonomy. It prospered on trade out of Metsovo along the Silk Road to Thessaly, Constantinople, the Black Sea and beyond. Napoleon’s fleet at Trafalgar even wore cloaks woven from the wool of Zagori sheep, according to local guide, Joshua Barley, of travel company The Slow Cyclist, who is a mine of such information.From the springs, we follow the signposted path that leads us out of the Vikos Gorge, pushing on to arrive at the small village of Mikro Papingo. On the terrace of the Pinocchio café we sit and enjoy cold beers, bread and sheep cheese, looking back in exhausted and happy contemplation as the sun sinks over the gorge. We have covered about 14km from Monodendri, and close to 1,000 metres of ascent.From our terrace vantage point, we plan hikes for the coming days that will join the dots between some of the other beautiful villages of the region: up to Lake Drakolimni, on a high ridge more than 2,000 metres above sea level, or down the valley to the old merchant’s bridge at Missios, or perhaps to tackle the more than 1,000 cobbled stairs that climb the mountainside to the village of Vradeto, the highest in the region. This is an alternative Greece, eye-opening and haunting in autumn and winter, a world apart from the Mediterranean seaboard, the sun-baked, sociable beaches.Details: Aristi Mountain Resort has double rooms from about €140 per night. The Slow Cyclist offers tailor-made journeys on e-bikes and on foot in the Zagori; classicist Rupert Smith (theeviaschool.com) guides trips through the area on foot and by car.

283  The EU has warned there would be “serious consequences” for the UK if it suspended parts of the Northern Ireland protocol, a key element of the Brexit deal.Speaking in Brussels after hours of inconclusive talks on Friday with UK Brexit minister Lord David Frost, the EU’s Brexit negotiator Maros Sefcovic told reporters: “Let there be no doubt that triggering Article 16 — to seek the renegotiation of the protocol — would have serious consequences.“Serious for Northern Ireland, as it would lead to instability and unpredictability. And serious also for EU-UK relations in general, as it would mean a rejection of EU efforts to find a consensual solution to the implementation of the protocol.”The UK and EU have been in a stand-off for months over post-Brexit trade rules for Northern Ireland. Under the terms of the protocol, the region remained in the EU single market for goods after the UK left the bloc to avoid imposing a trade border on the island of Ireland.But the UK government wants to rewrite the agreement, which it insists is not working. Sefcovic proposed plans in October to reduce checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea after the UK complained that the agreement was hitting trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and stirring unrest in the unionist community.The EU said its reforms would cut customs checks by half and health checks by 80 per cent on British products clearly destined for Northern Ireland. But UK officials have said this does not go far enough.After the inconclusive talks on Friday, Sefcovic said: “We have seen no move at all from the UK side. I find this disappointing and once again, I urge the UK government to engage with us sincerely.”According to a UK spokesperson, Frost told Sefcovic that “that the EU’s proposals did not currently deal effectively with the fundamental difficulties in the way the protocol was operating”.“He added that, in the UK view, these gaps could still be bridged through further intensive discussions.”Frost earlier told reporters that “Article 16 is very much on the table”. EU diplomats said that in recent weeks member states have been talking to the commission about what countermeasures the bloc could take if the UK makes good on its threats to invoke Article 16.While some advocated targeted action, such as slowing cross-Channel trade with more intensive customs and health checks, others favour the more dramatic move of ending the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which permits tariff and quota-free goods trade between the EU and UK.The UK would then have a year to decide whether to stick with the protocol and the TCA, or trade on World Trade Organization terms.“If the TCA [termination] is triggered it would be 12 months before it takes effect. You start a new clock with a new deadline,” said one EU diplomat. “The member states don’t think this negotiation is going anywhere. We are dealing with ideologues. You cannot reason with them.”Frost and Sefcovic will meet again for talks in London on November 12, with both hinting that it will be a make or break session.Separately, Downing Street announced that it had appointed Lord Jonathan Caine, an expert on Northern Ireland who served as a special adviser to six British secretaries of state for the region, to be a junior minister at the Northern Ireland Office.
284  Good evening from London, at the end of a busy week of central bank announcements and employment data giving us a clearer insight into the state of the global recovery.The latest clue comes in today’s US jobs report, which showed employers added 531,000 jobs in October, up from the previous month’s revised figure of 312,000 and closer to the monthly average of around 580,000 since the start of the year. Unemployment fell to 4.6 per cent from 4.8 per cent.There were “widespread” gains, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, led by leisure and hospitality with 164,000 jobs, professional and business services adding 100,000 jobs and manufacturing generating an additional 60,000. The better than expected figures sent US stocks up, putting them on track to hit a new record. The data are a marked improvement after the spread of the Delta variant of coronavirus had undermined progress in recent months and exacerbated an already serious problem with labour shortages. They come just days after the US Federal Reserve announced it would start “tapering” its pandemic stimulus programme after achieving “substantial further progress” towards Fed chief Jay Powell’s twin goals of maximum employment and inflation averaging 2 per cent.Wages continue to rise, but Powell insisted current inflationary pressures were not due to a “tight labour market” and instead reflected supply-chain bottlenecks and other shortages.Today’s news from the US follows data for the eurozone on Wednesday showing unemployment was back at pre-pandemic levels. The bloc’s jobless rate fell from 8.6 per cent to 7.4 per cent in September. About 2m fewer Europeans were looking for work compared with the same month last year, prompting unemployment to fall to December 2019 levels.Labour shortages continue to crop up as constant themes in company results and economic statistics, such as this week’s PMI surveys for services in the UK and US.UK chancellor Rishi Sunak told a parliamentary committee this week he was “cautiously optimistic” about the country’s labour market after the pandemic furlough scheme ended, but several sectors have voiced concern about how Brexit has exacerbated difficulties in recruiting staff.A lack of butchers, for example, means meat producers are now sending pig carcasses to Europe for processing before they are shipped back to Britain. However, the poultry industry said it would need only about half of the emergency visas for foreign workers announced by the government, after turkey farms cut production and managed to recruit some workers locally. Both industries have struggled to hire overseas staff under the UK’s new points-based immigration system.A report published today highlights another structural change in the UK workforce that has been accelerated by the pandemic: the number of people employed in the gig economy has trebled in the last five years.For up-to-the-minute coronavirus updates, visit our live blogBank of England chief Andrew Bailey has insisted that interests rates were still likely to rise in the coming months after the bank surprised markets yesterday by keeping them on hold. The pound dropped again today, reflecting concerns over the central bank’s messaging, putting sterling on track for its worst week since June.Even as the COP26 climate conference strives to chart a path away from fossil fuels, oil prices are still soaring thanks to surging demand and insufficient supply, as our Big Read explains. The US has blamed the Opec+ producers group for putting the global economic recovery at risk.More than 40 countries signed a pact to phase out coal use at the Glasgow summit, but the US has refused to play ball. Signatures from major coal consumers China, India and Australia are also noticeably absent.The rapid deterioration in UK-EU relations, exemplified by the current spat over fishing rights, is worrying many people in the far more economically important financial services sector who fear there will be a negative impact on pending decisions in Brussels to grant British institutions “equivalence”, allowing them to operate on the continent.Industrial output in Germany, the eurozone’s biggest economy, unexpectedly shrank in September by 1.1 per cent, following August’s contraction of 3.5 per cent, according to new data this morning. Retail sales in the eurozone also fell unexpectedly, raising concerns over the health of the consumer sector.Shoppers around the world are feeling the effects of a huge surge in food prices because of factors such as bad weather and supply chain problems. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization’s measure rose 31 per cent in October, as global food commodity prices passed their 2008 and 2011 peaks — just before the Arab spring protests that were partly caused by soaring food costs.This year’s stock rally in developed economies has not been replicated in emerging markets. Investors fear that the Fed’s announcement on Wednesday that it would begin winding down its pandemic stimulus programme could trigger a further flight away from EM stocks.IAG, the owner of British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus, has warned it would lose another €3bn this year after being shut out of the lucrative north Atlantic market during the pandemic. Unlike low-cost rivals Ryanair and Wizz Air, which both returned to profit over the summer, IAG will not be able to recover until its long-haul operations are back in the air. Meanwhile, Qantas is benefiting from a surge in bookings as Australia opens up.Lettings company Airbnb has been boosted by the rebound in travel, nearly quadrupling its profits compared with the same period last year. Net income of $834m was up 280 per cent on the 2020 period and was 212 per cent higher than the same (pre-pandemic) quarter in 2019.Simon Roberts, head of the UK’s second-largest supermarket J Sainsbury, said there would be less choice of some products this Christmas, as he detailed inflationary pressures and supply chain problems, particularly at its Argos stores.

The results indicate it could be even more effective than Merck’s molnupiravir, which received its first approval in the UK on Thursday. US travel stocks, including cruise companies and airlines, rose on the news today.Pandemic control: In the week when the official global death toll from the pandemic passed 5m, the World Health Organization has warned that Europe was moving back to the “epicentre” of the crisis as a surge in new infections sparked fears of a new wave of the pandemic this winter. Germany on Thursday reported 33,949 new cases, its biggest daily increase since December, with the number of patients in intensive care the highest since May. The spike could put Europe’s health systems under fresh strain after months when the virus appeared to be in decline.

285  The president of the Czech Republic has said he is prepared to appoint Petr Fiala as prime minister a month after the opposition leader’s rightwing Together coalition won the country’s parliamentary election.Milos Zeman, who according to the Czech constitution has the right to appoint the premier, was rushed to hospital on October 10, the day after the vote, leaving the process of forming a new government in limbo.However, after being moved out of intensive care, Zeman on Friday gave an interview from hospital to Czech radio station Frekvence 1 in which he said he was feeling “completely normal” and that he expected to appoint the 57-year-old Fiala as prime minister.Fiala welcomed the announcement, writing on Twitter: “The Czech Republic is in a difficult economic and epidemiological situation and needs a new government with a clear mandate”.Before he was hospitalised with an undisclosed ailment, the 77-year-old Zeman had said that he would give the first chance to form a government to the leader of the biggest single party, rather than the biggest coalition.That would have meant that billionaire incumbent Andrej Babis, who has led the Czech Republic for the last four years and become a close ally of Zeman, would have had the first shot.However, the president acknowledged on Friday that Babis had no chance of cobbling together a majority as Fiala’s Together and a second coalition of the Pirate party and Mayors and Independents had already agreed to an alliance which would command 108 of parliament’s 200 seats.“There are still a few steps that have to be taken towards [appointing Fiala as prime minister],” Zeman said. “But I think that there will be no problem there. Because Andrej Babis, with whom I spoke by telephone a little while ago, is not interested in becoming prime minister. The reason is quite simple: no one wants to deal with him.”Babis confirmed on Friday that he was prepared to step down. The new parliament is due to meet for the first time on Monday.Asked about his health, Zeman, who suffers from diabetes and has trouble walking, said he was feeling better than usual as he had “not smoked for a month” and expected to see out his term. However, the head of a group of doctors treating him said the president was not yet “fully” able to carry out his duties and that his prognosis was uncertain.Fiala’s three-party Together coalition and the centrist Mayors/Pirates said on Tuesday night that they had struck an agreement on their priorities for government as well as on the allocation of key posts.Among the most immediate challenges facing the new administration is the latest wave of the pandemic, which has accelerated in recent weeks. Both infections and hospitalisations due to Covid-19 are rising rapidly, although they still remain well below the peaks recorded earlier this year.The government will also have to contend with a variety of economic problems ranging from surging inflation, which hit 4.9 per cent in September, to gathering pressure on the energy sector, which is struggling with the fallout from rocketing gas prices.Fiala and his allies have already said they plan to cut the government deficit, which has been blown out by the pandemic and a combination of benefit increases and tax cuts pushed through by Babis, to a maximum of 3 per cent of national output. It stood at 5.6 per cent last year and the outgoing government is forecasting that it will be 7.7 per cent this year.
286  Ever since Lufthansa was privatised in the 1990s, the German airline has carried excess baggage.The collective bargaining power of no fewer than five German unions — and several more across Europe — kept staff numbers exorbitantly high. The carrier had almost as many employees as British Airways-owner IAG and Air France-KLM combined at the end of 2019, and a cost base that cruised at dizzying altitudes. Management were forced to choose between painful strikes or paying up, in what came to be called the “German disease”.Now, Lufthansa is the beneficiary of a more widespread malady — coronavirus. The sclerotic group has managed to shed more than 30,000 of its 138,000 staff since the pandemic began and redundancy schemes have proved so popular another round is being launched.“In these turbulent times people see the industry is changing,” a person close to the company explained. The size of the compensation packages, reaching six digits in some instances, has no doubt helped change minds too. But an unburdened Lufthansa eked out its first post-pandemic quarterly profit this week and with transatlantic borders about to reopen, is on track to pay back its €9bn bailout in full within months.The Frankfurt-based company is by no means the only German group to have had a good pandemic. Premium carmakers Daimler and BMW, their hands forced by semiconductor shortages, found they could boost profits by selling fewer, higher-end cars and slashing costs. Both have pledged to keep sticker prices high even once bottlenecks ease.Nicolas Peter, BMW chief financial officer, assured reporters this week that the crisis was “definitely not a blessing” for the Munich manufacturer, citing the backlog in orders and claiming that the company was already on track to boost its margins before Covid-19 hit.Yet as industry analyst Arndt Ellinghorst points out, investors now have solid proof that “this can be a much more valuable industry”. The market, he says, “will immediately notice if [carmakers] go back to old ways” — shipping as many cars as possible to offset the burden of a highly inflexible workforce.In truth, however, the market has hardly noticed German industry’s coronavirus-induced conversion to cost discipline at all. With Tesla passing a $1tn valuation and Ford shares trading at near 20-year highs amid excitement about its electrified pick-up truck, BMW — which is on track to sell far more electric vehicles than celebrated start-ups such as China’s Nio — is valued as if it will stop generating any cash in five years.The few funds paying attention will have encountered unwelcome evidence of Deutschland AG’s seemingly incurable malaise. Volkswagen boss Herbert Diess’s plans to cut jobs and keep VW visible in Tesla’s rear-view mirror is being blocked by unions, while down the road Elon Musk’s company is likely to circumvent German requirements for workers to be represented on boards, and is reportedly recruiting for its new factory from nearby Poland.Look underneath the hood, and there are worrying signs even within Lufthansa’s impressive restructuring. Only 4,000 of the roles axed were in Germany, and negotiations with pilots in the country are yet to be resolved. The national carrier is even less attractive to outsiders than it was before the pandemic — just over 10 per cent of the company is in foreign hands. More obstacles will have to be removed for Germany to truly take off.
287  A group of visiting European Parliament members has told Taiwan that it is not alone in its bid to survive as a democracy in the face of a more assertive China, just as Brussels tries to mend ties with Beijing.Raphael Glucksmann, a French member of the European Parliament who is the subject of Chinese sanctions, said that Europe shared Taiwan’s democratic principles.“We came here with a very simple message: Taiwan is not alone,” Glucksmann told a press conference at the end of a high-profile visit to the country. “Taiwan’s democracy is crucial. to European long-term interests.”The delegation, from the Special Committee on Foreign Interference in all Democratic Processes in the European Union, including Disinformation, marked the first official visit by members of the European Parliament to Taiwan.Since arriving in Taipei on Wednesday, the delegation has met Taiwanese officials, experts and civil society groups about how best to fight disinformation, a problem that has long plagued the East Asian democracy, without compromising civil and political rights.The EU has previously cited China as a source of disinformation on Covid-19, while Taiwan has also traced fake news and social media rumours about the virus to Chinese media.While the parliamentary delegation is wholly independent of the EU’s official foreign policy apparatus, it nonetheless underscores Brussels’ challenge in handling relations with China, coming amid efforts by the bloc to ease tensions with Beijing as it attempts to balance its mass of economic and geopolitical interests.The EU’s formal policy towards China is a convoluted and seemingly contradictory designation of “co-operation partner, negotiation partner, economic competitor and systemic rival”, underscoring the lack of consensus among the 27 member states.Regarding Taiwan, EU officials stress that the bloc has been consistent in applying a “One China policy”, but that individual member states have a legitimate interest in developing co-operation with Taipei without recognition of statehood.Relations between Beijing and Brussels plunged in March after the EU imposed sanctions on China over its treatment of Uyghur Muslims and the country responded by imposing sanctions on some MEPs, including Glucksmann.That torpedoed efforts towards the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) a landmark trade deal between the bloc and Beijing that had been the cornerstone of Brussels’ China policy before the sanctions spat.But in recent weeks EU officials have sought to draw a line under the fallout and find a more constructive tone. A call between Charles Michel, European Council president and Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, last month touched on “areas of mutual interest” for the first time since the sanctions dispute, a person briefed on the discussion said.China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and threatens to invade if Taipei refuses to submit indefinitely. Over the past year, Beijing has increased air and naval operations close to Taiwan.On Friday, Andrius Kubilius, a former Lithuanian prime minister and delegation member, said that Taiwan’s situation echoed challenges posed by Russia, which has interfered in countries such as Belarus and Ukraine.
288  Because it’s not as if there’s a dearth of them here, in this place that for so many is an idea and a feeling – a very good feeling – as much as a location on the map. Its 30-some miles of cliffs, coves and colourful villages sequester at least half a dozen properties that regularly feature at the very top of annual “Gold” and “Best” lists. Many have been in the hands of the same families since they received their first guests back in the 1970s or the 1950s – or even the 1830s. They have deeply loyal clienteles, cultivated over years of satisfying the most discerning of travellers. The finest ones at once reflect a sense of place and are little worlds unto themselves.A tall order, then, creating another one from scratch. Ambition is a prerequisite. You’d also bring – if you’re smart – extensive hospitality experience, a degree of design nous, familiarity with the area, reserves of patience and the inclination to lay down large quantities of cash.All of it is brought to bear at Borgo Santandrea, which opened quietly in July in the tiny town of Conca dei Marini, a few miles west of Amalfi. It’s the result of four years of collaboration between two families from the island of Ischia – each established hotel owners – and local artisans, from ceramicists to landscape designers to ironmongers. From the entrance almost 100m above the sea, its seven floors spill prettily down a steep terraced incline. The gardens are lush: mature olive, lemon and pomegranate trees are skirted with stands of wildflowers and blue myrtle; winter jasmine curls around the white columns along the wide terrace of Alici, one of the hotel’s three restaurants. At every other turn, tall arched windows or floor-to-ceiling glass doors frame the inimitable horizon – a soaring milky blue-white sky above the deeper, truer blue sea. That elemental palette informs the backdrop throughout the interiors: whitewashed walls, white marble paving, and a full 31 unique majolica tile designs, almost entirely in the blue-to-white spectrum, which took artisans in nearby Salerno two years to produce. There are chevrons and herringbones, lozenges and basket weaves, undulating ribbons and geometric labyrinths – but not a floral elaboration or baroque flourish in sight.The commitment to a 20th-century vision is down to one of Borgo Santandrea’s ischitano co-owners (who prefers to remain anonymous), who regularly considered a life as an architect while at university before ascending the corporate ladder to a senior position at a global bank in London. He began collecting midcentury furniture, with a focus on Italy and the Nordic countries, in his 20s.Part of what appealed to him about Conca dei Marini’s ageing Gran Hotel Saraceno, when it came on the market several years ago, was that hiding underneath its ornate, heavy interior design (dark-wood furniture, black marble and Corinthian columns featured throughout) was a clean-lined and quite beautiful 1960s structure. “When we bought the [Saraceno] in 2017, it was clear we had to bring it back to its ’60s roots, when the vast majority of the property – with its distinct modernist features – was built,” he says.“Passion project” is a descriptor that has probably passed its sell-by date, particularly when considering small hotels like this one. But here the passion manifests in very concrete terms; almost all of this co-owner’s extensive personal furniture collection was shipped south from his home and integrated into the design of the hotel. “We wanted to recreate the atmosphere of a sophisticated Italian coastal villa,” he says. “In that context, [sending] my midcentury pieces to Borgo Santandrea was a natural move.” The idea was to strip all the way back to the building’s good bones, then layer up to create a credible sense of lived-in-ness so that when guests encountered his gallery-worthy assemblage, purchased in Milan, London, Copenhagen and elsewhere, “it [would feel] like they have been there in Amalfi for the past few decades.” Their beauty competes with the tile designs, and show-stopping views, for your attention. That glass-topped concierge desk is actually a rare late-1940s issue of Carlo Mollino’s Reale dining table. All those armchairs, gathered in clusters by tall windows and around a marble mantelpiece, were designed by Englander & Bonta (Argentina, the 1950s), Hans Wegner (Denmark, vintage mid-1960s), Fredrik A Kayser (the Model 711, also mid-1960s) and Erik Worst (Denmark, 1970s – there are a dozen scattered throughout the hotel). The leggy, sexy teak and glass tasting table in the wine cellar is another rare Englander & Bonta edition, purchased at auction in Buenos Aires. All have been refurbished with textiles that hew 100 per cent Made In Italy, in true-to-period combinations of blue and white, including original designs signed Gio Ponti for Rubelli. Dozens of Ponti’s own 811 chair series, faithfully reproduced by Molteni, are scattered throughout the 45 rooms and suites, some of which have grassy terraces and plunge pools, curated libraries, or bathtubs nestled next to picture windows (all have balconies and sea views, double-king beds and slick marble-majolica bathrooms). “Ponti in particular had to play a central role,” says the co-owner, “and that’s not only because of the beauty and versatility of what he made but also the connection to the area, where he did one of our favourite projects [the Hotel Parco dei Principi in nearby Sorrento].” But for many the ace in Borgo Santandrea’s pocket will be its beach, one of the very few naturally occurring private ones on this coast. The elevator descends through solid rock to a stone passageway that opens onto the beach club – a former fishermen’s boathouse, dressed perfectly in low-slung white sofas and ’70s rattan lounge chairs (some of the few pieces held over from the Saraceno, refurbished and dressed in a jaunty navy-and-white striped cotton). There’s a long bar with indoor-outdoor seating and on a terrace just above, Al Borgo, the hotel’s alfresco beach restaurant serving simple classics which, for my money, is the most enjoyable food in the place. (Executive chef Crescenzo Scotti does impressive things at Alici and at La Libreria, the fine-dining restaurant; but informal canvassing would indicate that most people just want a faultless spaghetti vongole or grilled pezzogna when they hit this part of the world.)And then the beach itself: a long melange of white and grey pebbles descending into aquamarine water, clear and eminently swimmable and serviced by a squadron of locals in smart navy shorts and polo shirts. It all fits in particularly well in Conca dei Marini – a tiny, pretty hamlet, more of an elaborated highway stop than an actual town along the lines of Praiano or Positano, and quieter than either. Small boats buzz in and out, ferrying guests to La Tonnarella, to the right of the hotel (go at least once, put your feet literally in the sand and feast on their sublime spaghetti alla Jacqueline – named after La Onassis, who loved Conca), or the excellent Zeffiro Sereno, at the other end of the beach.As the hotel’s general manager, Maurizio Orlacchio, was quick (and laudably modest enough) to note, it may take years for Borgo Santandrea to become what he and his fellow stakeholders aspire for it to be, which is an integral part of the dream of this coast. It’s early days to judge on service – particularly for a place that opened in the can-we/can’t-we travel days of summer 2021 – or on that ineffable, intuitive thing called ambience, which often requires years to bring about, and which is still very nascent here. But they’re off to a pretty promising start upstairs. And from down at the beach, the view is better still. Maria Shollenbarger travelled as a guest of borgosantandrea.it; doubles from €770
289  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.Back in June when the European Commission announced their president’s jet-setting tour, we did flag the cognitive dissonance of leaving a large carbon footprint just to spread the news of extra money for climate-related projects. After a story first reported by The Telegraph earlier this week, the commission is now trying to save face and justify why Ursula von der Leyen needed to be booked on flights as short as the 50km between Vienna to Bratislava. I’ll give you the rundown of the arguments and how the backlash in Germany is shaping up.Another story that won’t go away is the so-called mink-gate in Denmark, a year-old scandal that is coming back to haunt Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. We’ll bring you the latest in this saga and why she is accused of a cover-up.And in Czech news, with President Milos Zeman out of intensive care, we’ll have a look at what comes next in the country’s government formation.Just days ago, Ursula von der Leyen addressed the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, calling “on all of us to do whatever it takes now to limit global warming”, because nature could no longer pay the price of carbon.That statement stands in stark contrast with the European Commission president’s own air travel policy — booking a private jet to criss-cross Europe for photo-ops in each capital where a national spending plan for the country’s own slice of the EU’s €800bn post-pandemic fund was approved (Details of each trip are available here).The commission argued these trips were necessary to remind citizens of the EU money and joint EU goals (including a greener economy) underpinning those plans. “It is very important for citizens to understand the European dimension of these programmes,” said commission spokesperson Eric Mamer.Why von der Leyen couldn’t take a train instead of a flight from Vienna to Bratislava? Because she had to make several stops that week, Mamer said, so the plane was booked for the entire trip. Also, the airline has a carbon offsetting programme, he added.“We only use those kind of flights when the calendar and the logistics don’t allow us to take a different means of transport,” he said. One time in June, von der Leyen took a train from Brussels to Strasbourg instead of flying. Also, she’s a vegetarian. And the commission’s headquarters recycle rain water.Still, the backlash was strong, especially in Germany, where the Bild tabloid picked up the story. Jana Schimke, an MP from von der Leyen’s own party, the Christian Democratic Union, said that “if you want change, you have to lead by example. Otherwise you lose credibility.” Michael Jäger, head of the Taxpayers Association of Europe, said the 50km flight was an “environmental sin”.And Liberal MEP Moritz Körner, who is part of the current German coalition talks, wrote that he regrets having voted for her as commission president and that she should go “at the latest in 2024”.As with other scandals, the commission is counting on this to blow over. But the reactions do show that walking the walk when talking green policies does matter, increasingly so.Should EU officials be banned from short-distance air travel? Click here to take the poll.Exactly one year after Denmark’s government shocked the world by ordering the deaths of millions of mink, the fate of the deceased mustelids continues to haunt centre-left Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, writes Richard Milne, Nordic and Baltic Correspondent.Frederiksen, leader of the Social Democrats, is widely seen as the most powerful modern prime minister in Copenhagen so was always likely to be in a tough spot over what has become known as “mink-gate”.The controversy in recent days has focused on why Frederiksen and several top officials in her office have deleted all their text messages from that period.At a late-night press conference on Wednesday, Frederiksen conceded that the language used by some officials — one said “close the shit” about the mink industry — was harsh, but added: “Live with it”.She stressed that she had been told by advisers to automatically delete her SMS after 30 days for security reasons in the months before the scandal, even though other ministries and previous prime ministers did not have the same practice.“I understand it can look strange.I’m not covering anything up,” Frederiksen said.The slaughter of up to 17m mink last November swiftly descended into farce as it transpired the government did not have a legal basis for the killing; trucks shed thousands of mink on roads; and the rotting corpses had to be dug up after only a few weeks after they threatened drinking water supplies.A commission is investigating mink-gate and is trying to recover the deleted text messages to determine just who in government knew there was a problem with the legality of the order. Opposition parties said yesterday that Frederiksen’s explanations left more questions than answers.Frederiksen is standing strong, backed by disparate leftwing parties. But as with other scandals, she may find that the most dangerous part is not the actions she took or didn’t take but the aftermath and anything that looks like it could be a cover-up.Yesterday’s meeting between French and British ministers in Paris failed to bring an end to the bilateral fishing rights dispute. The two sides can’t even agree on how many licences for French boats are in dispute. But they did at least concur on talking again next week. (More here)Czech president Milos Zeman was taken out of intensive care yesterday following a three-week stay that has complicated the process of forming a new government after parliamentary elections last month, writes central Europe correspondent James Shotter.Under Czech law, the president has the power to decide whom to give the first chance to form a new government, but the 77-year-old’s health problems — which required him to be hospitalised on October 10, the day after the election — have prevented him from doing so.The Prague Central Military Hospital, where Zeman is being treated, said yesterday that his condition — details of which have not been made public — had improved enough for him to be moved to an ordinary hospital room, but did not make clear whether he was now well enough to work.The uncertainty over Zeman’s condition has left Czech politics in limbo, and sparked calls for the launching of a constitutional procedure that would allow the president’s powers to be transferred to other officials if Zeman is deemed incapable of fulfilling his responsibilities. A group of medical experts is due to assess his condition today.Last month’s election was won by Together, a three-party rightwing coalition led by Petr Fiala. Along with a second coalition of two smaller parties, Fiala’s bloc will control 108 of the 200 seats in the new parliament, which will meet for the first time on November 8, giving them the ability to oust Prime Minister Andrej Babis and his Ano party from power.The two blocs on Tuesday said they had reached an agreement on what their governing agenda would be, as well as on how key government posts would be allocated.However, how quickly they can turn their plans into action depends on Zeman, who before his hospitalisation said that he would give the head of the biggest single party, rather than the biggest coalition, the first chance at forming a government. That would mean giving the first shot to Babis. But, with no chance of building a majority, Babis has indicated that he is preparing for opposition.“If you look at Zeman’s past as president, then there is no reason to believe that he would not try to do something unorthodox.but on the other hand he is ill so he may not be up to engaging in complicated constitutional play,” said Jiri Pehe, director of the New York University in Prague.With a surge in Covid-19 cases and various economic problems needing to be addressed, Pehe said a period of prolonged political uncertainty would do the country no good.
290  Europe is experiencing a surge in coronavirus infections to levels not seen in months, alarming health officials and sparking fears that the continent could be engulfed by a new wave of the pandemic this winter.Hans Kluge, regional head of the World Health Organization, said the pace of transmission across Europe, as well as Central Asia, was a “grave concern”, adding that the region was moving back to the “epicentre” of the health crisis.“Today, every single country in Europe and Central Asia is facing a real threat of Covid-19 resurgence, or is already fighting it,” he said.Germany on Friday reported 37,120 new infections, its largest daily increase since the start of the pandemic. The incidence of infection now stands at 169.9 per 100,000 people over seven days — a level not seen since the peak of the third coronavirus wave in the spring — while the number of Covid patients being treated in German intensive care wards is the highest since May.The fear is that the surge in cases will place Europe’s health systems under fresh strain after months when the virus, if not fully defeated, appeared to be in abeyance.Explaining the sharp rise, experts said the onset of colder weather had prompted people to spend increasing amounts of time indoors, where the virus can spread more easily. They also cited stubbornly high vaccine hesitancy and waning immunity among those who had been inoculated.Studies show the risk of breakthrough infection roughly doubles five months after a second jab. The new Delta coronavirus sub-variant, which appears to be about 10 per cent more transmissible, may also be playing a role, along with fatigue with mask wearing in public places. Studies have shown mask wearing reduces viral transmission.Antoine Flahault of University of Geneva’s global health institute noted the “devastating” surge in new cases in central and eastern Europe over recent weeks and the “alarming” death rates there. From the east, “this pandemic wave is now spreading towards western Europe”, he said.He also pointed out that although new infections were rising in countries such as the Netherlands, Austria and Belgium, all had relatively low mortality and hospital admission rates, for now.Fergus Sweeney, head of the clinical studies division at the European Medicines Agency, said it was “very concerning” that the continent’s key metrics — cases, hospital admissions and deaths — were all rising as winter approached.He urged all Europeans to get vaccinated or complete their vaccination course. “We’re not all protected until everyone is protected in that respect,” he said.Governments have responded to the rising caseload by considering tighter restrictions for the unvaccinated, amid growing frustration at flatlining immunisation rates and the refusal of a sizeable minority to get the jab.Jens Spahn, Germany’s health minister, said the flagging inoculation rate was the key reason behind the surge in cases. “We’re experiencing above all a pandemic of the unvaccinated,” he said this week.Germany’s vaccination rate lags well behind countries such as Italy, France and Spain.While Spahn also spoke of an urgent need to speed up the distribution of booster jabs, the committee advising the government on the issue has recommended these should be administered only to the over-70s as well as staff and residents of care homes.The Covid surge is particularly pronounced in central and eastern Europe, where vaccination levels are lower than in the west of the continent. Slovakia, where just 46 per cent of the population is fully immunised, recorded 6,713 new cases on Thursday — its highest number of daily infections since the pandemic began.In Poland, where 53 per cent of people are fully vaccinated, the number of new cases jumped almost 50 per cent on Thursday, having already quadrupled in the preceding three weeks. Hospital admissions have also been rising sharply, having trebled in the past three weeks in Poland and more than doubled in Slovakia.In the Baltic states, Latvia has reintroduced lockdown measures for at least a month while both Latvia and Estonia have had the world’s highest number of cases per capita in recent weeks.Romania, where only a third of the population is vaccinated, has had the world’s most deaths per capita in the past seven days. Bulgaria, the least-vaccinated EU nation, reached a new record of daily Covid deaths this week.Greece, where intensive care wards are at 84 per cent capacity, up from 67 per cent a month ago, is among the EU countries to tighten restrictions in response to a surge in new cases. All unvaccinated people will from Saturday be required to show a negative test to enter indoor public spaces, including banks, most shops and government buildings.The Netherlands said this week it would reintroduce restrictions to curb the fastest rate of new infections since July, after new measures were also introduced in neighbouring Belgium.In France, infections have been climbing slowly from a low base since their trough in early October. Even with high vaccination rates, the number of people newly hospitalised for Covid began to tick up in the last week of October after eight weeks of declines. Schools in about half the country’s departments have brought back mask-wearing requirements for children.Absenteeism and difficulty filling jobs are also pressuring hospitals’ ability to treat patients, with one recent study showing that about 20 per cent of beds were closed because of labour shortages. France’s booster campaign has also been slow to get off the ground.Spain’s 14-day incidence rate of 51.6 per 100,000 people is only slightly higher over the past seven days. In the UK, new cases have dropped from a mid-October peak of more than 47,000 per day, on a rolling weekly average, to below 40,000 daily cases.UK hospital admissions have remained steady at about 1,000 a day, while about 150 people per day are dying from Covid.“Hopefully we’re over the last great peak of Covid in 2021,” said Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London.
291  The UK government will face “significant challenges” in preparing the country’s borders for the introduction of full customs controls on EU imports next year, the government spending watchdog has warned.In a report on the state of UK borders after the Brexit transition period, the National Audit Office said the government would need to work hard to make ready port infrastructure and educate EU traders on the new controls.While the EU introduced full border controls on UK exports to the bloc from January 1, the British government has three times delayed instituting its own checks in order to avoid delays at British ports.“The government has [been] prioritising [trade] flow over compliance. However, this cannot go on indefinitely. The current overall operating model for the EU-GB border is not sustainable,” the watchdog warned.The UK government has said it will start to introduce checks from January, when importers will be required to fill out import declaration forms on products coming from Europe. EU exporters will be required to supply other paperwork, such as export health certificates, from July.While congratulating the government for a “significant achievement” in avoiding the worst-case scenario of long border queues last January, the NAO warned that the delays in instituting border checks were increasing the risk of trade disputes, smuggling and health issues.“Repeated delays to putting in place an effective border regime also leaves the UK open to potential challenge that it is not complying with international trading rules, and more likely that gaps in border controls could be exploited,” it said.The NAO said pre-Brexit forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, the UK’s fiscal watchdog, showed that a porous border could cost the exchequer up to £600m in unpaid VAT, £100m in lost alcohol and tobacco duties, and £200m in lost customs duty.However, the new controls will increase paperwork and the strain on UK computer systems. Between January and August this year some 48m customs declarations were made by traders to HM Revenue & Customs, but these were expected to increase “significantly”. HM Revenue & Customs said it had increased the capacity of its main Customs Declaration Service (CDS) system from 60m to 200m declarations a year.In evidence given to the NAO, the British International Freight Association said “lots of goods, including foodstuffs” were being brought into the UK without the required declarations.The lack of data from full border checks was storing up multiple risks, the NAO said. “The longer that import controls are delayed the longer it will be until [government] departments can use this new information to effectively target risks, such as those relating to smuggling and food safety.”The report also warned that the government faced “a more significant challenge” in getting EU companies ready for the new controls. The NAO said a lack of preparedness among EU hauliers and traders remained a “significant risk” and warned that if they “consider that exporting to the UK is too onerous to be worthwhile, this could reduce the flow and availability of food and other products to the UK”.Meg Hillier, chair of the House of Commons’ powerful public accounts committee, said leaving the EU had put additional costs and paperwork on UK businesses that EU exporters sending goods to the UK had not had to suffer.“The delayed rollout of full import controls means it’s still not a level playing field for some UK businesses,” she said. “Government must help businesses adapt to the new rules and put in place border controls that work for all.”
6  WHAT TO MAKE of the military analysts who calmly list the reasons why the most serious war in Europe since 1945 might begin in January? The flat, muddy terrain of south-eastern Ukraine will be frozen solid by then, allowing Russian tanks to roll in. It is in the middle of the deployment cycle for the conscripts who make up much of Russia’s ground forces. And Russia may find itself with a pretext for invasion, since the new year has in the past brought front-line flare-ups in Ukraine’s war against Russian-backed separatists. Besides, the 100,000 Russian troops massed near the border are more than mere theatre; Russia is setting up field hospitals and calling up its reserves.Listen to this story.Dima is unimpressed. A colonel in the Ukrainian army, he has watched the rapid transformation of his country’s armed forces from a bad joke to something approaching a modern army. And he thinks Russia has been watching, too. “They are afraid of us, because since 2014 we have shown what we can do,” says Dima, who prefers not to use his real name. “It would be a third world war, at a minimum,” he says, perhaps with a touch of hyperbole. In the corner of a café in Kyiv, fidgeting with cigarettes and coffee, he remembers how far Ukraine has travelled.In 2014 Dima was commanding a battalion near Luhansk, a city in the south-east near the Russian border. Of his 700 soldiers, only 40 were ready for active duty. His men did not bother to wear their clumsy Soviet-army vests or helmets, which offered little protection against bullets. Soldiers instead, when possible, dressed in German gear scrounged abroad from second-hand stores by volunteers. His tanks had the wrong engines installed. Few men had the training they needed to fight well. But had Ukraine enjoyed today’s armed forces back in 2014 “Donetsk and Luhansk would be free today,” claims Dima, with a snap of his fingers.But they are not. Ukraine failed to stop Russia’s annexation of Crimea, and the self-declared “republics” of Donetsk and Luhansk remain outside Ukraine’s control (see map). That Ukraine had just 6,000 combat-ready troops at the time was a result of decades of neglect. Well-intentioned Ukrainian politicians were complacent after the signing in 1994 of the Budapest memorandum, under which Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees from America, Britain and Russia. Ill-intentioned officials sold off equipment and took their cut.Now Ukraine is getting its act together. Military spending as a share of GDP has more than doubled, to 4%, funded in part by a “military levy” on incomes. America has given $2.5bn-worth of equipment to Ukraine. That includes Harris radios to ensure troops can communicate, and counter-battery radars to detect the source of enemy fire. Ukraine now has 250,000 troops and a further 900,000 reserves; some 300,000 of them have experience on the front line. Ukraine has bought Bayraktar TB-2 combat-capable drones from Turkey, a NATO member. America has sent Javelin missiles, though on the condition that they are stored far from the front line.Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, wants more than new weapons. He covets accession to NATO. That would commit America and 29 other countries to leap to Ukraine’s defence if it were attacked by Russia. But such an invitation looks highly unlikely; NATO does not want an unambiguous commitment to defend a country Russia has already attacked. However, Ukraine is preparing its forces to work with NATO’s anyway. Joint exercises are increasingly common, and getting bigger. A new policy requires all Ukrainian troops to have a command of English by 2025.Much of Ukraine’s improvement has been based on the premise that Russia wants to challenge Ukraine, but does not want the cost of waging a war in its own name. This has produced the kind of disorganised ground war that Ukraine has been getting better at fighting since 2014.But the Kremlin’s thinking may now be changing in response to a version of the future it claims to find intolerable. It fears that a West-veering Ukraine will abandon its historical role as a buffer between Russia and the West, and instead play host to American firepower only a short distance from Moscow. On December 1st Mr Putin used a speech to demand that NATO commit not to station troops or missiles in Ukraine, pledges that NATO will not be prepared to give.Russian impatience with what it claims is threatening behaviour does not mean it wishes to gobble up swathes of Ukrainian territory for good. Fyodor Lukyanov, a foreign-policy analyst close to the Kremlin, suggests that a quick, hard incursion akin to Russia’s war with Georgia in 2008 could occur, followed by merciless talks. A pretext would be easy to manufacture.If Russian force were unleashed fully upon Ukraine’s troops, it would pulverise them. Nothing in Ukraine’s arsenal would be able to stop Russia’s air force of modern jets, which recently proved their power in a bombing campaign over Syria. Most of Ukraine’s navy vanished along with Crimea in 2014, and it has not been rebuilt since then. Russian troops are better armed, greater in number and backed by a smoother logistics set-up. No Western power looks willing to wage war against Russia for Ukraine’s sake. Mr Putin is probably bluffing. If he is not, Dima’s confidence will face a fearsome test. 
7  THREE-AND-A-HALF years ago German politics looked exhausted. Angela Merkel had just assembled her third “grand coalition”, a tired centrist alliance that left no one satisfied. Today, two months after an election that saw Mrs Merkel’s Christian Democrats booted from office, the mood is markedly brighter. On November 24th the leaders of Germany’s Social Democrats (SPD), Greens and Free Democrats (FDP), a pro-business party, exuded optimism as they gathered in a converted Berlin warehouse to hail their new “traffic-light” coalition (named after the parties’ red, green and yellow colours). In 177 pages and 52,000 words—a shade more than “The Great Gatsby”—their three-party deal lays out a policy agenda for the next four years.Listen to this story.Seeking to conjure coherence from an unwieldy project, the parties are pushing a narrative of “modernising” Germany after 16 years of Mrs Merkel’s conservative rule. The notion that three disparate parties might so quickly sand away their differences looked dubious. But their leaders insisted that the two-month coalition negotiations—which proceeded relatively smoothly, on time and mostly without leaks—built a bedrock of trust. Olaf Scholz, the SPD’s taciturn chancellor-to-be, says he hopes the parties will campaign jointly at the next election. People were sceptical of traffic lights when they were introduced in Berlin in the 1920s, he noted, but they are are indispensable today.The parties’ modernising promise finds expression in a raft of legislative proposals. These include a liberalisation of Germany’s archaic citizenship laws, streamlining of bureaucracy, electoral reform to shrink the bloated Bundestag, improvements to gay and trans rights, and the legalisation of pot. Negotiators say they struck agreement on these issues quickly. The deal’s language on other themes bears the hallmarks of trickier talks.A commitment to keep Germany on the “path to 1.5 degrees” (ie, to limit global warming) is threaded throughout. A pledge to bring the coal phase-out forward to 2030 from 2038 is welcome though symbolic, as carbon-pricing is already killing the stuff. More significant is a planned increase in the share of renewables in Germany’s electricity mix to 80% by 2030, up from the current 65% target (and 45% today). The agreement is thinner on transportation, says Alexander Reitzenstein, a climate expert at Das Progressive Zentrum, a think-tank, and, to his surprise, offers nothing on raising the domestic carbon price.The parties bickered over fiscal policy and public investment. A constitutional “debt brake”, strongly backed by the FDP, limits deficit spending. A raft of complex tools will be used to get around it, including beefing up the state development bank, extending debt repayments and tweaking the calculation of Germany’s structural budget deficit. Details on all this are thin, but the coalition will probably struggle to meet the Greens’ target of €50bn ($56bn) a year in fresh money. Next year this national discussion will bleed into a European one on fiscal rules, a touchy subject in Germany. Here, the deal’s vague commitment to use the rules to secure growth and foster investment in the EU offers more than some had dared hope.“The foreign-policy chapter is stronger than I’d expected,” says Jana Puglierin of the European Council on Foreign Relations. A vow to attend the first meeting next year of signatories to a new anti-nuclear weapons treaty will worry NATO allies. But it is balanced by a strong commitment to NATO’s nuclear-sharing arrangements, under which Germany consents to host American nukes and maintain aircraft that can deliver them. The Russia talks were especially contentious, and the coalition agreement ducks explicit mention of Nord Stream 2, a Russian gas pipeline detested in America and much of Europe. But Germany’s China hawks are delighted with the deal’s robust language, including support for Taiwan’s involvement in international organisations. Mrs Merkel’s engagement-first approach to China looks set to expire with her chancellorship.The agreement is weaker on reforms to Germany’s pension system, which faces chronic pressure from an ageing population. Easing restrictions on labour immigration from outside the EU is welcome but cannot plug the demographic gap. On asylum the new government offers carrot (easier family-reunification rules) and stick (quicker deportations). Yet for a country squat in Europe’s middle, national policies can only do so much in the absence of a deal to bolster the EU’s common asylum rules. A fresh migrant crisis on Europe’s borders could strain the traffic-light government as it did Mrs Merkel’s.Many of the 17 ministerial posts still need to be divvied up, but the most important are already known. One crucial relationship will be between Christian Lindner, the FDP leader and Mr Scholz’s presumed finance minister, and Robert Habeck, the Green co-chair, who will run a beefed-up climate and economy ministry (Annalena Baerbock, the Greens’ other leader, will be Germany’s first female foreign minister). The tax-cutting liberal and the statist Green claim to be united in the mission of managing Germany’s energy transition. Reality will test that promise.Yet unforeseen events will prove the biggest challenge. In that sense, the pandemic once again raging inside Germany offers the traffic-light coalition a grimly fitting welcome. Mr Scholz’s government will be sworn in during the week of December 6th. By then, with thousands of Germans dying from covid-19 every week, many hospitals will be under severe strain. The new chancellor is already contending with demands for another national lockdown and an Austria-style vaccination mandate. The wedding went as well as can be expected. But the honeymoon will be brief. 
8  THE SIGHT of 40,000 unvaccinated Austrians marching through their capital, Vienna, in recent days was troubling twice over. The tightly packed opponents of lockdown measures were at risk of spreading the coronavirus. They also threatened to stir up an already tense political situation. Karl Nehammer, Austria’s interior minister, warned that anti-vaxxers in the Alpine republic are growing more radicalised. He called the demonstration’s mood “incensed” and “aggressive”. Some protesters were extremely provocative, carrying placards likening Alexander Schallenberg, Austria’s new chancellor, to Josef Mengele, the sadistic physician at the Nazi concentration camp in Auschwitz.Listen to this story.The protesters were marching against Austria’s increasingly tough measures against anti-vaxxers. On November 22nd the government imposed a full lockdown once again, to last for at least ten days. That compels Austria’s 9m people to hunker down at home, leaving only for work, essential shopping and exercise. Austria is also the first Western democracy to make covid-19 vaccinations mandatory for all, starting on February 1st 2022. “For a long time—maybe too long—I and others assumed that it must be possible to convince people in Austria to get vaccinated voluntarily,” said Mr Schallenberg when he announced his “very difficult” decision.Europe, once again, is at the centre of the pandemic. Cases are surging as the highly contagious Delta variant makes its way, belatedly, through Europe’s population. The World Health Organisation said on November 23rd that deaths from covid-19 across the continent could exceed 2m people by March. (The Economist’s own tracker suggests this number was long ago surpassed.) Last week reported deaths increased to close to 4,200 a day from 2,100 at the end of September. The disease has become the leading cause of death in Europe.Will more countries respond with the sort of strict measures seen in Austria? As hospitals in central Europe fill up, anxiety grows. Around 66% of the total population in the European Union is fully vaccinated, but vaccination rates vary greatly between countries. Farther west, they are remarkably high. Among the over-12s in Portugal, more than 88% of the population is fully vaccinated. By contrast, in Bulgaria the share is below 25%. Within Germany there are also large east-west variations.Other governments have imposed compulsory covid vaccinations for specific groups. Italy made them obligatory for all workers in public or private companies, unless they can prove they are immune or have tested negative in the past 48 hours. Similarly, France made vaccination compulsory for health staff as well as police and firefighters. This week Germany made vaccinations compulsory for its army.Support for a nationwide vaccine mandate, previously a taboo, is now rising in Germany. Prominent politicians had repeatedly promised that such a mandate would not be considered. But several state premiers, including Daniel Günther of Schleswig-Holstein, Markus Söder of Bavaria and Volker Bouffier of Hesse, now back such a measure for the entire country. Many Germans agree. A survey of 7,500 respondents, conducted in the past few days by Civey, a pollster, suggests that 72% would favour an Austrian-style vaccine mandate, and only 20% would oppose it.As such mandates become likelier in many places, the polarisation between rival camps is growing. Anti-vaxxers consist mainly of supporters of populist and far-right parties, but also acolytes of alternative medicine, hippies and libertarians. Over the weekend thousands of opponents of anti-covid measures marched in the Benelux countries, Italy, Switzerland and Northern Ireland. In Belgium and the Netherlands rioters clashed with the police over three days. The mayor of Rotterdam lamented “an orgy of violence”.Andrea Ammon, the head of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, has warned that vaccine mandates could provoke more resistance from anti-vaxxers, which seems plausible. But officials made their full-throated promises to keep vaccinations voluntary when taming the pandemic looked easier. Now, however, as winter forces more people together indoors and the Delta variant runs rampant, the pressure to return to lockdowns and impose tougher vaccine mandates may grow harder to resist.

9  EVEN TRAGEDY, it seems, cannot bring Britain and France together. For a brief moment on November 24th, after 27 refugees died in the icy English Channel trying to cross in an inflatable boat from the northern French coast to Britain, it looked as if tensions between the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, might ease. But this was not to be. For behind the row about migrants lies a fundamental problem: the two neighbours are separated by a narrow channel of water and a gulf of mutual distrust.Neither side is blameless in this latest spat. The day after the drownings, and without warning the French, Mr Johnson tweeted a letter he had sent to Mr Macron. In it he proposed ideas about better cross-border cooperation, such as the dispatch of British soldiers and policemen to patrol French beaches, which had already been rejected by France as an infringement of sovereignty. The letter also proposed a “returns agreement” to take back migrants who arrive in Britain, which the French have repeatedly made clear is a matter for EU, not bilateral, discussion.Mr Macron, who was in Rome signing a Franco-Italian friendship treaty, retorted angrily that the letter was “not serious” and that he did not conduct diplomacy by Twitter. Yet days earlier the French diplomatic service had tweeted a clip of Jean-Yves Le Drian, the foreign minister, calling Mr Johnson a “populist who uses all elements at his disposal to blame others for problems he faces internally”. Serious was hardly the word that best characterised the decision by Gérald Darmanin, the French interior minister, to cancel an invitation to Priti Patel, the British home secretary, to a meeting on the migrant crisis. This is due to take place on November 28th in the port of Calais, with his Dutch, Belgian and German counterparts, as well as the European Commission.Behind this trading of cross-Channel insults, the view in Paris of the underlying problem is twofold. The first is that the French have concluded that Mr Johnson’s government cannot be fully trusted. Although Mr Macron has never liked Brexit, as it weakens the EU, this is not now his real gripe. Two years after the British voted to leave the EU, he went enthusiastically to a Franco-British summit at Sandhurst in 2018, in the hope of building a stronger defence and security relationship with Britain. Yet the French have been dismayed by British efforts not to implement parts of the deal to leave the EU that they had signed. Ahead of the G7 meeting in Cornwall this summer, Mr Macron declared that “this means nothing can be respected.” As if to make his point, details of the two leaders’ private conversation at the G7, concerning sausages and borders, were then leaked, making Mr Macron look foolish.In September the French were further bruised by AUKUS, a strategic pact between Britain, America and Australia, which was negotiated behind their backs and tore up their own deal to sell submarines and make Australia the centrepiece of France’s Indo-Pacific strategy. Since then, say the French, the Americans have gone out of their way to repair the lost trust; but not the British. The only language that Britain understands right now, conclude the French, is one that involves a show of strength.The second problem is that the old British reflex of blaming the French, especially when it helps to distract attention from domestic troubles, is becoming politically problematic. Mr Macron faces a presidential election next April, and needs both to be seen to be defending French interests and not letting an affront go unchallenged. As it is, under the Le Touquet agreement signed in 2003, France allows British immigration officers to control entry to Britain at channel ports on French soil (and vice versa). Several aspirant presidential candidates to his right, including Michel Barnier, the EU’s former Brexit negotiator, vow simply to let migrants go on to Britain if they wish. By over-reacting, Mr Macron’s government undermines its own claim to be ready for serious dialogue. But, as one French official says, “as long as the first instinct of the British is to blame us, it’s difficult to have a meaningful conversation.”In particular the French resent the charge that they are not doing their bit to patrol the coastline or to welcome refugees. In recent years, with the help of British finance, they have built up high fencing and tighter checks on freight leaving France through the Channel tunnel, in order to keep migrants from crossing to Britain via that route. This has encouraged people to try their chances in small boats from the beaches instead. So far this year, the French coastguards say that they have rescued 7,800 migrants from the Channel. French authorities have also arrested 1,552 people-smugglers, and dismantled 44 trafficking networks.Moreover, last year France received 93,475 applications for asylum, the highest number in the EU after Germany, compared with 36,041 in Britain, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Many refugees have family in Britain, however, and do not want to stay in France; some spend only hours on French soil. The French want closer co-operation with EU neighbours, such as Belgium and Germany, in order to try to break up the people-smuggling rings that bring refugees to the French coast in the first place.“The problem today is that both France and the UK see what the other is doing through their own prism,” wrote Michel Duclos and Georgina Wright in a note for the Institut Montaigne, a think-tank: “ Neither thinks the other side is serious about strengthening co-operation.” In the long run, the two neighbours and allies will need to rebuild confidence and work more closely together. In the short run, the prospect of restoring cross-Channel trust looks lamentably slim.
10  RUSSIA’S LARGEST component republic is Yakutia. It extends well into the Arctic Circle and is as big as Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Finland and Romania combined, but with a population of just 1m people. Over the past decade retreating sea ice has opened up a new shipping lane along its coast, the Northern Sea Route (NSR). This is the shortest passage between the ports of east Asia and western Europe, but its icy waters also offer something even more precious: geological bounty, in the form of cobalt, tin and rare-earth metals, deep below the surface.Listen to this story.Hostile weather and other obstacles to extraction make prospecting along the NSR a daunting venture. Nonetheless, numerous arms of the Russian state as well as private investors have already set their sights on these underwater minerals, in addition to the area’s oil and gas. Discoveries of deposits on land give hope of further bounty offshore. Nodules—tiny balls of oxides scattered across the ocean floor, and first identified off the coast of Siberia—hold special promise. They contain minerals that can be used in everything from electronics to rechargeable batteries.But there is a problem. The nodules are formed when seawater penetrates magma chambers deep below the sea floor. This water is heated to extreme temperatures before it ascends back towards the surface through chimney-like vents—in effect, submarine volcanoes. The process leaches metals out of the earth’s crust and deposits them on the sea floor. But the vents also warm the water in their vicinity, which sustains remarkable ecosystems on the seabed. These habitats are little understood and would take decades to study fully. In the absence of proper environmental controls, biologists and oceanographers fear that mineral extraction around the vents could destroy irreplaceable habitats.“Impact assessment is easier to do on land,” says Javier Escartin of the Laboratoire de Géologie, an academic institution in Paris. “We don’t have data on the ocean, where ecosystems are often so fragile they don’t recover in human timescales.” An evaluation along the NSR would require sophisticated robots to collect samples and map the sea floor—endeavours that some argue would be so expensive that they would make exploitation of undersea resources unviable.For now, Russian mining companies are guarded. Alrosa, Russia’s largest diamond producer, describes Yakutia as “a northern frontier for short-term exploration”, though the company provided no specifics. Nornickel, a big producer of nickel off the Taimyr peninsula, stresses the need for green construction standards but “does not conduct deep-sea mining and currently has no plans to do so”. Yet in 2001 Russia submitted a claim to expand its exclusive economic zone from 200 nautical miles from the coast to as far, in some places, as the North Pole.Completely icebound just 20 years ago, Yakutia’s waters are now navigable by ordinary ships for four months a year, and global warming will probably widen that window. As the passage becomes busier, many see alarming risks: in addition to environmental impact studies, there are calls for greater protections for indigenous people, restrictions on dredging and pollution, and transparency regarding mining operations. “Regulation is insufficient, especially now that the Arctic is open for business,” says Malte Humpert, founder of The Arctic Institute, an American think-tank. The NSR, it seems, is an emerging economic and environmental flashpoint, both above water and below. 
11  YOU WAIT, rifle in hand. An enemy appears. You kill him, and whoop for joy. Welcome to VALORANT, a popular video game that some people play professionally. This year the VALORANT Champions Tour, a series of contests that ends next month, will offer $1m in total prize money. Eighty players are competing; all are men.Listen to this story.Some 42% of gamers who watch e-sports (at least occasionally) are female, and women often commentate on tournaments. But of the 300 highest-earning e-sports players, not one is a woman. Why so few women make it to the top is poorly understood. E-sports do not require physical strength. But they do require dedication, and the pool of avid female gamers is smaller than the pool of males.It may be that girls are on average less keen than boys on video games, or have better things to do. Certainly, young males tend to play such games for longer hours than their sisters, which irks their parents but is essential if one wishes to turn pro. Some women may find the culture uncongenial: amateur shoot-em-up gamers linked via headsets often shout obscenities at each other and the screen. Some female gamers face hazing.All-female e-sports tournaments do exist, but are less competitive, less popular and less well rewarded. An all-female VALORANT tournament in September offered €20,000 ($23,000) in prize money.This is not much, but more than the players could have earned elsewhere.Some in the industry are trying to promote more female participation. G2 Esports, based in Berlin, recently announced its first-ever all-female team. David Beckham’s Guild franchise now includes Guild X, a team of five women. They will enjoy the same tournament preparation as male players, to help them compete at a higher level. Klaudia “Cinnamon” Beczkiewicz, the captain, says: “It’s like we have a family...that believes in us.” Whether that is enough to transform e-sports remains to be seen.
12  THE LIST of things France and Italy have argued about in the past decade ranges from the serious to the silly. Nicolas Sarkozy and Silvio Berlusconi scrapped over migrants crossing from Italy into France. When the gilets jaunes popped up in France, Luigi Di Maio, then deputy prime minister, offered his support to the protesting petrolheads. “The wind of change has crossed the Alps,” said Mr Di Maio. France responded by pulling its ambassador across the Alps back to Paris in protest. In Libya, Italy and France found themselves backing opposite sides in a civil war on Europe’s doorstep. An Italian minister even complained that the French were trying to claim Leonardo da Vinci was French and spelling his name wrong to add insult.Listen to this story.Such rows have disappeared in the past year. Cosy dinners have replaced diplomatic slanging. In September President Emmanuel Macron and Mario Draghi, the Italian prime minister, chatted past midnight in a four-hour meeting at Le Petit Nice, a three-Michelin-star restaurant in Marseille that offers a €590 ($665) set menu, wine included. Populist stirring of French politics by Italian politicians is a thing of the past, replaced by Mr Macron and Mr Draghi violently agreeing. To cement the improved relations, Mr Macron and Mr Draghi signed a long-mooted Franco-Italian treaty on November 26th. The treaty covers everything from defence integration to migration to inducements for young people to experience la belle France and la dolce vita.The model is the Elysée Treaty, which the French and German governments signed in 1963, and which has provided the backbone of relations across the Rhine ever since. Such comparisons may look overdone. Burying the hatchet after a continental war is a bigger deal than making up after some undiplomatic diplomacy. But this ignores the speed and cynicism that drove the Elysée Treaty’s signing. Charles de Gaulle saw the document as a way of driving a wedge between Germany and America. It was not mentioned in a meeting between the German and French leaders the month before. Indeed, it was thrown together in such haste that a German diplomat had to race to Hermès in Paris to find a suitably grand leather folder for its signing.For such treaties are often about something else. If the Franco-German treaty was really about America, then the Franco-Italian treaty is about Germany. Or so say officials from other countries, watching closely. Each party in the new German government provides something for France to worry about, whether it be the feeble defence policy of the Social Democrats, the frugality of the Free Democrats or the virulent opposition to all things nuclear of the Greens. France needs options, and Italy is a good one.A glimpse of the potential of a Franco-Italian tie-up came in 2020, when a joint push on common debt—a French and Italian dream, but a German nightmare—shoved the German government into dropping its long-held opposition to the idea. The departure of Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats from government throws the EU’s power relations into flux. But no matter how much things improve between France and Italy, Germany will remain the main ally of France. A deal acceptable to both France and Germany is probably acceptable to most EU countries; a deal acceptable to Italy and France may struggle for support beyond the Mediterranean. Any major shift in policy requires Franco-Italian persistence. But it still needs German permission.Instead, a more even relationship between the EU’s biggest three countries is the most likely upshot of the treaty. Germany is the EU’s biggest member and France is its most politically dynamic, at least under Mr Macron. But Italy is the most consequential. Whether Italy, the club’s third-largest economy, can return to real growth after decades will determine the club’s economic health. How Italy copes in a post-Draghi era when polls suggest nearly half of Italian voters will support Lega (hard right), the Brothers of Italy (further right) and Forza Italia (the vehicle of the ever-present Mr Berlusconi) will shape the club’s politics. An Italy that is able to shape EU debates—such as on looser spending rules or on migration—is better placed to deal with both problems.Treat me wellFor Italy, the treaty says more about itself than its ties with France. While at Italy’s finance ministry, Mr Draghi worked on preparations to join the euro. The rationale was one of il vincolo esterno, the external constraint: roped into monetary union, Italy would no longer suffer from self-inflicted problems such as high inflation. Now a technocratic politician rather than a political technocrat, Mr Draghi has followed a similar strategy in government. Under Mr Draghi, Italy has maxed out its €190bn share of a €750bn recovery fund, pledging wide reforms that will take years to carry out. If Italy wants the money, it must continue to follow the policies Mr Draghi set out, regardless of who is running the show.A deal with France is another constraint. With a treaty in place, a serene bureaucratic relationship should carry on even amid the stormiest politicking. Both Mr Draghi and Mr Macron know they will not be around for ever. Their successors may make Mr Sarkozy look Zen and Mr Berlusconi resemble a statesman. Mr Macron faces elections in the spring. Meanwhile, Mr Draghi is still coy about whether he will stay as prime minister or try to become Italy’s president, floating above Italian politics—less a politician than St Mario, the patron saint of bond-market credibility.Treaties are not foolproof. A determined enough future government could let the arrangements wither, or rip them up altogether. After signing the Franco-German treaty in 1963 de Gaulle watched as his hopes of driving a wedge between Germany and America were dashed by the German parliament inserting a flowery dedication to NATO. The general shrugged it off: “Treaties, you see, are like girls and roses: they last while they last.” Sometimes, though, that is a long time indeed. Editor’s update (November 26th): The text has been altered since publication to include the signing of the Franco-Italian treaty
13  GERMANY’S COALITION talks have done little to dispel its reputation for political dullness. After winning a majority in September’s election, the Social Democrats (SPD), Free Democrats and Greens aim to wrap up negotiations next week on their “traffic-light” coalition (named after the parties’ colours) before taking office in early December. Bar the odd wobble the talks seem to have been largely straightforward. But Germany’s closest allies have been watching one issue with mounting alarm.Listen to this story.The “P3”—America, Britain and France, the three nuclear-armed NATO allies that hold permanent seats on the UN Security Council—have two related concerns. First, that Germany may go soft on its involvement in NATO’s “nuclear sharing” arrangements, under which America stations up to 20 atomic bombs at Büchel Air Base in western Germany, while Germany maintains a fleet of dual-capable aircraft (DCAs), from which they can be launched. Second, that the incoming government may flirt with the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), an international disarmament effort.The first issue is familiar. Nuclear sharing, also practised by Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Turkey, gives countries without their own nuclear weapons an important stake in NATO’s nuclear planning. But Germans have long been uneasy about the presence of American nukes on their soil; in the early 1980s over 1m marched against the deployment of Pershing II missiles. Successive governments have vowed to seek the removal of nuclear bombs, only to yield to pressure from allies.Yet several new elements are at play, including the fissures in the international arms-control regime, Russia’s growing unpredictability and the ascent to government of the Greens, who retain a strong pacifist streak. The most urgent issue is a pending decision on replacing Germany’s decrepit Tornado DCAs. These planes’ lifespan can be spun out to 2030 at the latest. To ensure operational continuity beyond that date, decisions for a replacement must be made by 2023, says Christian Mölling at the German Council on Foreign Relations.The TPNW is a newer concern. Driven by non-nuclear countries and pressure groups, and in force since January, the treaty obliges ratifying countries (56 so far) to renounce the development, production and ownership of nuclear weapons. Supporters say this turns the screws on nuclear powers who have done little to meet their disarmament obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1970. Opponents say it weakens the NPT, undermines NATO’s deterrent and helps adversaries like Russia and China who face no pressure from civil society to sign up.The P3, individually and together, have lobbied Germany’s government and the incoming coalition on both issues. Joe Biden’s and Emmanuel Macron’s joint call last month for allies to “continue close consultations on nuclear and arms-control matters” appeared to be aimed squarely at Germany. Olaf Scholz, the SPD’s taciturn chancellor-presumptive, has also been pressed but has given little away. “We have no idea what he thinks,” says one anxious P3 diplomat. His party’s left is strongly, and vocally, opposed to nuclear sharing.Few expect the traffic-light coalition either to end nuclear sharing unilaterally or to join the TPNW outright. More likely is a pledge to stay in nuclear sharing without a clear proposal on how to implement it, despite the Tornado issue. A nervous government, says Claudia Major at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, may simply drop out of the arrangement by kicking the can for as long as possible until the road runs out.The TPNW is the allies’ bigger worry. Despite diplomats’ entreaties, Mr Scholz’s government is expected to say it will attend the treaty’s first meeting in Vienna in March, albeit not as a signatory. (Norway, another NATO member, will do the same.) Even that, reckon the P3, will damage NATO’s cohesion. Yet it may be the best that can be expected from a country destined to veer endlessly between America’s nuclear protection and the deep atomic queasiness of its voters. 
14  THE MIGRANTS had nowhere to go. Behind them stood Belarus’s brutal security officers, before them rows of Polish soldiers. Mostly Iraqi Kurds, they had been lured to Minsk, Belarus’s capital, with promises of passage to Germany, then dumped in the forests, told to breach the border fence and beaten if they did not. On November 16th the Belarusians moved hundreds of them to a border crossing. Alexander Lukashenko, Belarus’s dictator, hoped that by provoking violence he could embarrass Poland and divide the EU, which imposed sanctions after he stole an election. When migrants threw stones, the Poles sprayed them with water cannon.Listen to this story.Mr Lukashenko’s use of helpless migrants as propaganda tools is a problem for the EU, but mostly not in the way he hopes. Rather, his border crisis complicates the European Commission’s conflict with Poland over the rule of law. Since coming to office in 2015, Poland’s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has passed laws that give the government power over the courts. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled that these laws violate EU rules about judicial independence and must be rolled back. After years of dithering, the commission has begun to enforce those judgments. Now it must balance supporting Poland on border security with keeping up the pressure on judicial matters.Poland’s takeover of its judiciary is modelled on that of Hungary, Europe’s pioneer of illiberal democracy. PiS changed the rules governing its National Judicial Council, which picks judges, so that its members are named by parliament and the minister of justice, with no input from judges themselves. The ECJ has ruled that since the council is no longer independent, judges appointed under the new rules are not judges under EU law.Many of them are poorly qualified PiS loyalists. PiS has packed the constitutional court and set up a disciplinary chamber of the supreme court that can punish judges for rulings it dislikes. The ECJ ordered Poland to disband the disciplinary chamber. The government says it will, but has yet to present a plan to that end.This rule-of-law conflict threatens the very structure of the EU. In October, trying to wriggle out of the ECJ’S judgments, Poland’s constitutional court ruled that the articles of the union’s founding treaty dealing with judicial independence violate the Polish constitution. That challenged the principle that European law supersedes national law, without which the union would have little power. “We would be like the UN,” says an EU official.The commission has some new tools of persuasion. Until it scraps the disciplinary chamber, Poland is accruing fines of €1m ($1.1m) a day. PiS is counting on €36bn from the EU’s new covid-19 recovery fund to bankroll its ambitious infrastructure and social-welfare plans. But that fund has a clause that blocks the money until the commission certifies that recipient countries comply with the rule of law. The commission could attach a list of specific conditions to Poland’s grants.On November 15th Iustitia, an organisation of independent Polish judges, put out a proposal to restore the rule of law, including implementing all the ECJ rulings and giving judges back their voice on the National Council of the Judiciary. Some EU countries will press for such conditions, notably the Netherlands, which insisted on the rule-of-law clause. But Germany is more reluctant. Meanwhile Zbigniew Ziobro, Poland’s unrepentant justice minister, is trying to use the disbanding of the disciplinary chamber as an excuse for more changes, including a review of the credentials of every judge in the country. State-run television portrays the conflict as “an offensive of the ECJ against Poland”.The migrant crisis is just as thorny. The EU and America have persuaded nearly all the airlines and transit countries that Mr Lukashenko used to bring in migrants to stop co-operating. The EU approved new sanctions this week on Belarusian individuals and firms, and could block trade entirely to deter Mr Lukashenko. That could limit the problem to the estimated 12,000-15,000 migrants already in Belarus—a fraction of the number who enter Italy across the Mediterranean each year.EU and international law obliges countries to let people in to request asylum, so Poland’s pushbacks are illegal; some migrants have already died of exposure. The Poles have refused help from Frontex, the EU’s border agency, which can evaluate asylum claims fast. Marcin Przydacz, a deputy foreign minister, notes that few migrants apply for asylum in Poland; they want to get to Germany. Western officials hope to press Belarus to let UN agencies and NGOs offer humanitarian aid to the migrants there. Letting them cross might encourage more to come and reward the propaganda strategy of Mr Lukashenko and his sponsor, Vladimir Putin.The commission may now postpone action on the rule of law in Poland until the border calms down. Failing to show solidarity could turn Poles against the EU and weaken their prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, a relative moderate and rival of Mr Ziobro. But a complete rollback of the government’s control over the judiciary is likely only if PiS loses the next election in 2023, says Stanislaw Biernat, a former judge on the constitutional court.As for the migrants, they are losing hope that anyone will help them. As one put it, “The Poles will never have mercy on us, nor will the Belarusians have mercy on us. We are stuck between them.” 
15  EIGHTEEN YEARS ago this month, the 35-year-old Mikheil Saakashvili, an American-educated Georgian politician, led the first “colour revolution” in the countries of the former Soviet Union. When he subsequently became president he turned around the corrupt and failing republic, although he was also much criticised for hogging and abusing power. Now he is in prison fighting for his life after seven weeks on hunger-strike.Listen to this story.Mr Saakashvili stepped down in 2013 after his party lost an election, surrendering power to Bidzina Ivanishvili, a reclusive billionaire who founded and still controls the ruling Georgian Dream party. Mr Ivanishvili chased him out of the country and stripped him of his citizenship. Hated by the Kremlin, which fought a short war with Georgia in 2008, Mr Saakashvili spent the next eight years in Ukraine, where he became prominent.Last month he returned to Georgia, only to be promptly arrested. In a video released by the government, he was shown being dragged, half naked, into a prison hospital. Mr Saakashvili has been denied the right to attend his own trial. A member of the European Parliament hoping to see him was turned away at the border.Mass protests over Mr Saakashvili’s treatment are growing by the day. Ten members of parliament are also on hunger strike and his doctor says the former president could suffer a heart attack at any moment. His supporters say he has been denied access to proper medical care, increasing the risk to his life. If he dies, Mr Saakashvili will become a martyr. If he lives, it will be a rare example of successful resistance to Mr Ivanishvili.This is the latest of many signs that Georgia is moving backwards. This year alone the government has arrested the head of the opposition, hacked the phones of human-rights activists and foreign ambassadors, and turned down an EU loan after backtracking on an agreement promising judicial and electoral reform. It has handled the covid-19 crisis badly. But its treatment of an admired, if flawed, former president could be its worst blunder yet.
16  APOSTOLIS, A RETIRED Greek-Cypriot dentist aged 78, tours his former clinic in Varosha, now a derelict shell of a building, for the first time in nearly half a century. His friend Despo wipes away tears in front of her grandfather’s old shop, where she would park her bike after school. Varosha was once home to some 39,000 Greek-Cypriots and swarms of tourists. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton strolled on its beaches. Four young Swedes, later known as ABBA, gave one of their first concerts here. Now it is a ghost town, overgrown by bushes and trees. Opposite Apostolis’s clinic, painted over the façade of what was once a Greek high school, are a pair of flags, one Turkish, the other belonging to the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus (TRNC), set up after the island was split by a Turkish invasion in 1974 into Greek and Turkish portions.Listen to this story.Fenced off since the invasion, when its Greek-Cypriot residents fled the advancing Turkish troops, Varosha was partially reopened earlier this year. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, ordered the army to hand the town over to the TRNC. This has allowed visits by Greek-Cypriots living in the southern part of the island, in the Republic of Cyprus, which the outside world considers the legitimate government of the whole place. But it also bolsters the TRNC, which no country but Turkey recognises, and paves the way for the development of property still claimed by displaced Greeks. That, in turn, further complicates the Herculean task of reuniting the island. That was the point: Mr Erdogan and Ersin Tatar, the Turkish-Cypriot leader, have insisted for the past year that a united Cyprus is no longer possible. In New York in September Mr Tatar and Nicos Anastasiades, president of the Republic of Cyprus, seemed to agree that they had nothing to discuss.Northern Cyprus, home to 450,000 people, has never stood on its own feet. Turkey stations tens of thousands of soldiers in the enclave, props up its economy, and is the main conduit for its foreign trade. Though Turkey has always meddled in the north’s affairs, it has never done so as much as now. “Ankara treats us like one of its districts,” says Ozdil Nami, a former TRNC foreign minister. A new low came last year, when officials and goons dispatched by Turkey endorsed Mr Tatar, an Erdogan loyalist, ahead of presidential elections and threatened his opponents, including Mustafa Akinci, the incumbent. Mr Tatar won the vote by a sliver. “Those people”, he says at his residence, referring to the politicians and journalists who accused Turkey of interfering in the elections, “are traitors.”Echoing Mr Erdogan, Mr Tatar says he has no faith in a proposed federal model, which would bring north and south under one roof, and that the only way forward is to keep the island divided. Yet analysts and diplomats say a two-state solution is a pipedream. Not even Turkey’s closest allies would want to jeopardise relations with the EU, of which Cyprus is a member, by recognising the north.The risk is that a botched campaign for sovereignty would put Northern Cyprus on a slippery slope to full annexation by Turkey. That is not an outcome Turkish-Cypriots want. The vast majority of them welcomed the Turkish invasion in 1974, which foiled an attempt by a Greek junta to unite the island with Greece. They feel close to Turkey. But they also have a separate identity. Many are alarmed by Turkey’s authoritarian turn. Settlers from Turkey, who began arriving after the invasion and are now about a third of the north’s population, are a lot keener on Mr Erdogan.Greek-Cypriots are also alarmed. “If we don’t find a solution, we'll end up having a border with Turkey, which for us is a worst-case scenario," says a senior Cypriot official. But they also have themselves to blame for the stalemate. It was Mr Anastasiades and his team who reportedly got cold feet during the most recent reunification talks, in 2017. And it was Greek-Cypriot voters who rejected a settlement in a referendum back in 2004, on the eve of the country’s accession to the EU.There is room for hope. A big offshore energy find could breathe new life into the talks, though it could also trigger a standoff between Turkey, Cyprus, Greece and the EU. Turkey’s push for a two-state solution could be a ploy intended to rattle the Greek-Cypriots. But facts on the ground will be hard to undo. “We might have reached a point where it’s no longer possible to put the island back together again,” says Fiona Mullen of Sapienta Economics, a consultancy in Nicosia, the capital. “Varosha may be the final nail in the coffin.” 
17  A PERK OF being locked up by a fascist dictator is that it leaves you with a lot of time on your hands. Altiero Spinelli, an Italian communist, spent the bulk of his youth imprisoned by Benito Mussolini. During one stint of internment in 1941, Spinelli used his spare time to come up with the Ventotene Manifesto, named after the island off Naples to which he was banished. Pieced together on cigarette papers, it provided a socialist blueprint for a federal Europe, earning the communist thinker a legacy as one of the more obscure founding fathers of the EU.Listen to this story.Aside from the European Parliament building in Brussels, which bears Spinelli’s name, communists left little mark on the club. Across western Europe, moderate Christian and Social Democrats ran the show. The Eurocommunists, who looked to Brussels rather than Moscow, were briefly in vogue in the 1970s and 1980s. Wily socialists, such as François Mitterrand, soon put them out of business. In Italy, where communists once won 34% of the vote, the party fell apart after communism collapsed in eastern Europe. And countries that had lived under communism were desperate to join the EU, in part so the ideology could not return.The spectre of communism no longer haunts Europe. But it does occasionally jump from behind the curtain and shout “boo”. Sometimes the surprise comes from the least likely spots. Austria is probably the most bourgeois country in Europe: rich, cosy and more than a little smug about it. Yet its second city, Graz, is now run by the Austrian Communist Party, which came first in local elections with 29% of the vote. Wags soon renamed it Leningraz.It was a revolution decades in the making. A low threshold for winning seats on the city’s council meant that communists could scrape a few even in dry years, and busy themselves with running the city’s housing policy. Popular measures helped, such as communist councillors donating two-thirds of their salaries to the needy. “What we are doing now would have been ordinary social democrat policy in the 1970s,” says Max Zirngast, a councillor who spent three months in a Turkish jail for criticising Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s autocratic regime before entering the world of Austrian municipal politics. A world without capitalism is still the aim. But a city with more social housing will do for now.Tradition rather than grassroots fervour keeps the red flag flying in Cyprus. The island’s communist party, AKEL, is one of the country’s two main parties. It prospers thanks to an almost Anglican attitude to communism: just as one does not have to believe in God to go to church every Sunday, so Cypriots can vote for communists without wishing to seize the means of production. Card-carrying communists in shiny Mercedeses are a common sight. Force of habit rather than belief explains the party’s persistence, argues James Ker-Lindsay of the London School of Economics. As one of the biggest parties, AKEL is helped by being able to dish out the patronage that still dominates Cypriot politics.In Europe, parties can be tiny but still influential. Christian Democrats found themselves supporting decidedly unChristian ideals due to panic about those to their right. Crackdowns on asylum-seekers and cuts to welfare budgets were triggered by parties that mustered barely a tenth of the vote. The same logic works for the far left. In an age of fragmentation, any party that can win even 5% of the vote becomes relevant. Take Portugal. Antonio Costa, the Socialist but still centre-left prime minister, relied on both the Portuguese Communist Party and the Left Bloc to remain in office.Parties do not always use this power well. The communists voted against Mr Costa’s budget, leaving elections likely early next year. It was an odd decision. The budget was stuffed with lefty spending pledges, such as increased pensions and free child care. Now the leftist parties face losses in an election, the polls suggest. Such cock-ups are common. In the Czech Republic, the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia opted to support Andrej Babis, a billionaire, as prime minister. Three years later, the party was kicked out of parliament for the first time since 1948.It is little surprise that the most successful far-left parties of recent years have eschewed outright communism. Some of Syriza’s leaders spent time in the Greek communist youth movement, but the party which ran Greece from 2015-19 bristled at mention of the c-word. (Hardcore lefties repay the favour by seeing Syriza and its eventual compromise with the EU as an example of what not to do in power.) Podemos, a far-left Spanish party, is part of the governing coalition, but its brand of anti-austerity populism comes from a different tradition to Europe’s remaining reds.That country of single blessednessYet some traditional Marxist parties are savvy. The Workers’ Party of Belgium (PTB), which began life as a home for Marxists who found Belgium’s Communist Party a bit soft, is now a mainstream party. Pressure from the PTB led to Belgium gumming up a free-trade deal between the EU and Canada, which sent diplomats on a crash course on the rules of Belgian federalism. Popular campaigns to slash taxes on energy put left-wing rivals in government in an awkward spot. In the Flemish parliament, it mischievously complained that a pay cut for MPs had not actually gone through, two years after its approval. If polls are borne out, the far-left party is set to become the third-largest in the national parliament.Wallonia, the French-speaking region of Belgium, provides the base of the PTB’s support. The region was the centre of continental Europe’s Industrial Revolution; now it is the apogee of deindustrialisation. Disaffected voters in depressed regions have been fodder for the radical right across Europe. Canny politics from the far left in Belgium has flipped that trend, dragging voters to the other side. In 1869 Karl Marx called Belgium the “the snug, well-hedged, little paradise of the landlord, the capitalist, and the priest”. In 2021 Belgium offers the EU’s best hope for the ideology that bears his name.
18  TUNE IN TO any French prime-time talk show this autumn and discussion rages over the country’s wretched decline. France is losing its factories and jobs, squeezing incomes and small businesses, destroying its landscapes and language, neglecting its borders and squandering its global stature. Its people are fractious and divided, if not on the verge of a civil war, as a public letter from retired army officers suggested earlier this year. At the second presidential primary debate for the centre-right Republicans party, on November 14th, the five candidates competed with each other to chronicle French disaster. Listen to the hard right and it is “the death of France as we know it”.Listen to this story.The anxiety is widespread. In a recent poll 75% agreed that France is “in decline”. When asked to sum up their mood in another survey, the French favoured three words: uncertainty, worry and fatigue.Like others, the French have some good reasons for apprehension. Lockdowns have been wearing. Rising gas and petrol prices, supply-chain delays, a new wave of covid-19 cases and restrictions: all are genuine causes of uncertainty. Moreover, the French hold a presidential election in April and the campaign is already divisive. The line-up is likely to feature not just one but two strong candidates from the hard right: Marine Le Pen of the National Rally (formerly the National Front), and Eric Zemmour, a reactionary former TV pundit. A sobering 47% of the French told a poll they will vote in the first round for a candidate from one or other political extreme. Some 60% say they have no confidence in President Emmanuel Macron.Yet there is a paradox at the heart of France’s current malaise: the country is doing fairly well, and in some respects better than its neighbours. Covid cases are rising again in France, but nothing like as fast as in Germany. In July Mr Macron introduced covid passes; France now has a greater share of fully vaccinated people than Germany or Britain. Like most of Europe, the French economy is enjoying a bounce after a deep drop in GDP last year and is expected to expand by 6% this year. Third-quarter growth, of 3% on the previous one, was particularly strong, and higher than in Germany, Italy and Spain. French GDP is now back at its pre-pandemic level (see chart).France’s unemployment rate, at 7.6%, has fallen below its pre-pandemic level. This is not primarily thanks to government wage-support schemes, generous though they were at the height of the pandemic. In September the number of workers on such schemes dropped to 520,000, down from 8.4m in April 2020. “We are seeing net employment creation in France in sectors like manufacturing that we haven’t seen for a while,” says Ludovic Subran, chief economist at Allianz, an insurer. Firms report difficulties recruiting; salaries are expected to rise. Under the government’s “Made in France” strategy, new factories—making batteries in northern France and insulation panels in the south-west—are in the works. The CAC 40 stockmarket index is at a record high.So why are the French so convinced that things are falling apart? There is no single explanation. In a country that boasts four anti-capitalist presidential candidates, one reason could be a lingering French suspicion of the financial gains that economic recovery brings. The government has spent heavily to keep jobs and businesses going during the pandemic, in order to avoid lay-offs and bankruptcies, and to protect incomes. Living standards rose in 2020 and will do so again in 2021. But this policy is now also helping those with investments in such firms. The saved jobs are taken for granted whereas the rewarded shareholders are regarded in some quarters as undeserving beneficiaries. Mr Macron still struggles to shrug off his label of président des riches.It could also be that the structure of government builds in disappointment. A strong central state, which the French dignify with a capital letter (État), headed by a powerful presidency, encourages excessive expectations of both. The conflict and compromise that characterises the reality of government is a source of particular dissatisfaction, as is the complexity of the globalised world. The difficulties that France has experienced securing microchips for its car-components industry, say, or halting migrant flows, are sometimes seen as not merely the result of global supply-chain jams or international-migration pressures, but a form of emasculation and wounded national pride.A further answer may be that, as Claudia Senik, an economist at the Paris School of Economics, puts it: “The French have an ambivalent relationship to happiness.” A poll this week suggested that 78% feel happy about their own lives, but 60% are convinced that their country is going downhill.Being idealists, the French find that the real world always disappoints. Taught from a young age to adopt un esprit critique, they delight in disapproval. Last year, as covid first spread, a poll suggested that only 39% of the French thought that their government was managing the crisis well, compared with 74% in Germany and 69% in Britain. Bleak is chic.Perhaps most important, ahead of any French presidential election the stirring of indignation and the promise of salvation is a practised political art. François Mitterrand campaigned as “the tranquil force” in his successful bid for the presidency in 1981, hinting at the chaos he would calm. Jacques Chirac promised in 1995 to mend the “social fracture” that he claimed threatened French unity. Mr Macron was unusual by campaigning in 2017 in tones of optimism. As covid cases rise, supply chains clog up and punitive winter heating bills arrive in the letterbox, there is still plenty that could go wrong. But even if it doesn’t, it will suit his opponents of all stripes to lay the doom on thick. An early version of this article was published online on November 16th 2021
19  “IT IS TERRIFYING, all the arguments and measures to persuade the unvaccinated to get the jab are simply ignored,” said Manfred Güllner, head of Forsa, a German pollster. The cause of his consternation? In a recent Forsa survey, 65% of the 3,048 unvaccinated Germans polled said they would “definitely” not get a covid-19 jab in the next two months. A further 23% were inclined not to.Germany, Austria and Switzerland have the highest shares of unvaccinated people in western Europe, bar tiny Liechtenstein and Luxembourg. Most of their hold-outs vote for populist, far-right parties. In Germany, for example, around 50% of those polled by Forsa voted for the AfD, a far-right party particularly popular in the east; 15% cast their vote either for Die Basis, the political arm of the Querdenker, the movement opposing all measures to contain the covid-19 pandemic (the picture shows a Querdenker rally). Saxony, the eastern state where the AfD is strongest, has Germany’s lowest vaccination rate, just 57.5%, and its highest infection rate.Because more than two-thirds of the population are fully vaccinated, the latest wave is far less deadly than it might have been. Deaths are rising far more slowly than infections. Yet intensive-care wards are again close to capacity in particular in Austria and Germany (see chart). At the same time the political gulf between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated is widening. New measures in Austria and Germany to halt the spread of infection are aimed at cajoling the unvaccinated into getting jabbed without inflicting another winter of lockdowns on the vaccinated majority. “A federation of imbeciles has ensured that Germany is being hit extremely hard by the fourth wave—much worse than many other European countries,” says Der Spiegel, a weekly, in its current edition. On November 11th Germany reported 50,196 new cases, the second-highest number in the world after America. On November 15th the number of new cases per 100,000 people in the previous seven days hit 303, the highest rate yet recorded. In Saxony it is 754 and in some eastern and southern districts it exceeds 1,000. The government is reportedly preparing to bring in the army to assist stretched health-care services.The city of Berlin on November 15th banned the unvaccinated from restaurants, bars, cinemas, theatres, concert halls and other entertainment sites, in an expansion of the capital’s “2G” (geimpft or genesen—vaccinated or recovered) rule. In some places even the vaccinated or immune must be tested before entry. Outdoor events with more than 2,000 people are also off-limits for the unjabbed.As caseloads have risen, it has not helped that Germany has been virtually leaderless since elections at the end of September. Angela Merkel, the departing chancellor, Olaf Scholz, her likely successor, and all 16 state premiers will at last meet on November 18th to discuss new measures to contain the pandemic. Most expect something like the imposition of Berlin’s 2G rule to the entire country, but no new lockdown. Germany’s “state of epidemic emergency”, which permits the government to impose a national lockdown or close schools, expires on November 25th—and the likely incoming government coalition of Social Democrats, Greens and Free Democrats under Mr Scholz does not want to renew it. (Mrs Merkel’s Christian Democrats are campaigning for renewal.)In neighbouring Austria the situation is even grimmer. The seven-day infection rate is more than 800 per 100,000 people, and hospitals are cancelling non-emergency surgery. Though the government intended to wait until 600 beds in intensive-care wards were occupied by covid-19 patients, it has acted before reaching that alarming milestone. From November 15th it has imposed a ten-day lockdown on unvaccinated people aged 12 or over. Those who cannot prove that they are either fully vaccinated or immune through recovery from a past infection may leave their home only for essential reasons, such as going to work or to buy groceries—or to get a jab. People breaking the rules face fines starting at about €500 ($572); businesses will have to pay €3,000. Groups conspiring to evade regulations could be clobbered for €30,000.“We must raise the vaccination rate. It is shamefully low,” said Alexander Schallenberg, the chancellor, on November 14th. Roughly 65% of Austria’s population are fully vaccinated. The right-wing Freedom Party, which gets around a fifth of votes at national elections, is the mouthpiece of anti-vaxxers. Herbert Kickl, the party’s boss, rails against Austria’s “covid-apartheid”. He is calling for a demonstration in Vienna against the new measures on November 20th and is threatening to sue the government at the Constitutional Court.Across the border in Switzerland citizens will vote in a referendum on November 28th on codifying the federal government’s emergency pandemic powers. Opponents are especially vocal in German-speaking cantons; Freiheitstrychler, who describe themselves as the original Swiss, are particularly prominent. (Freiheit means “freedom”; they carry trycheln, the giant cowbells that are a folkloric Swiss symbol.)The referendum particularly concerns the Swiss covid certificate, which has been compulsory since September 13th for admission to restaurants, gyms, cinemas, and big cultural and sports events. The populist Swiss People’s Party (SVP), the country’s strongest, is campaigning against the emergency powers. According to a recent poll 51% of its supporters are unvaccinated.The Swiss government (a seven-strong council on which the SVP occupies two seats) last week launched an unprecedented vaccination drive with mobile inoculation centres, a vaccination “village” at the main railway station in Zurich and in-person or telephone counselling. Only 65% of the population are fully vaccinated. The government is unlikely to win the Trychler over. But it hopes to persuade some reluctant Swiss that getting jabbed is a price worth paying to visit their local restaurant for rösti.Dig deeperAll our stories relating to the pandemic can be found on our coronavirus hub.

20  ALL IS DISQUIET on the Eastern front. On the border between Poland and Belarus, refugees from the Middle East are massing. They have been lured there by Alexander Lukashenko, the Kremlin-backed dictator of Belarus, with false promises of a new life in the West. On the Russian side of the Ukrainian border, it is soldiers that are gathering, in sufficient numbers to raise concern in America. And inside Russia, repression is growing. The latest victim is Memorial, Russia’s most venerated human-rights organisation, set up in 1987 to document the crimes of the Soviet regime. It is now being threatened with closure.Ominous Russian troop manoeuvres have taken place before. But this time America is warning its European allies that it considers an invasion a genuine possibility. Although much is still unclear about Russia’s troop movements, many units on their way home from Belarus, which played host to Russia’s quadrennial Zapad exercise in September, have set up camp near the Russian town of Yelnya, around 200km (125 miles) from Ukraine’s border.Russia alarmed Ukraine with a similar build-up in April, before pulling many of the troops back. Then, the open movement of troops, during the day and in large groups, at least offered analysts some reason for calm. This time operations have been more covert. America is so worried that earlier this month the head of the CIA, William Burns, flew to Moscow to dissuade Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, from invading. It is unlikely that America would dispatch its top spy without good reason. But it is equally unlikely that Mr Putin is simply going to back off, without testing the resolve of Joe Biden, his American counterpart. So a protracted period of heightened tension may be on the cards.Nobody knows whether the troops are intended for action in Ukraine or Belarus, or simply for the intimidation of both—probably the most likely explanation. According to a European intelligence source, the Russian force is smaller than it was earlier in the year and therefore would struggle to take and hold much Ukrainian territory, although Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, estimates that it numbers 100,000 troops.Michael Kofman, who watches Russia at CNA, an American think-tank, wrote recently on Twitter, “It does appear that the Russian military has been ordered to position itself for a possible operation in the coming months.” But this does not mean that any offensive is imminent, or that the final go-ahead has been given, he noted. Russia’s priority for months has been securing German regulators’ approval for Nord Stream 2, a gas pipeline that bypasses Ukraine, says Dmitri Trenin of Carnegie Moscow, a think-tank. An invasion would surely scupper that.For now, at least, Russia’s goal of undermining Ukraine and plunging it into crisis may be better achieved by other means, such as disrupting its energy supplies. This month Russia halted coal exports there, exacerbating local fuel shortages. Some worry that Russia might curb gas shipments as well. “It’s a very disturbing trend,” says Yuriy Vitrenko, the head of Naftogaz, the state gas company.Blackouts and heating outages could spark strikes and protests, Russia doubtless hopes, undermining Mr Zelensky. Dmitry Medvedev, a former prime minister and a member of Russia’s security council, recently published an article calling Ukraine’s leadership “imbecilic”. There is no point in talking to Mr Zelensky, he argued, since he is merely a Western puppet. “Contacts with such weak leaders are counterproductive; any moment they can trade you 15 kopecks.”Similar moves are afoot further north. Russia has been pushing Mr Lukashenko to surrender what is left of Belarusian sovereignty, and is already using him to destabilise the EU. Mr Lukashenko’s cynical use of innocent and desperate people as a weapon against the bloc is being given the backing of the Kremlin’s propaganda machine. Behind the migrants stand Belarusian soldiers, pushing them towards the border fence and giving them the tools they need to breach it. With 15,000 Polish troops (and a small group of British soldiers on the way) on the other side the risk of an accident is rising. On November 11th Russia sent two TU-160 bombers flying over Belarus, just 60km from the Polish border.Temperatures fall below zero at night and people are sleeping in uninsulated tents. Russia and Belarus hope to generate a humanitarian crisis that will test the EU’s resolve and unity. So far, the EU has stood firm, backing Poland in its determination to keep the migrants out, and placing responsibility for their plight where it belongs, with Belarus. European leaders have threatened further sanctions against Belarus and even against Aeroflot, Russia’s national airline, which could be banned from flying through the EU’s airspace. But if significant numbers of people start to die at the border, this unity may yet fracture. Whatever happens, Mr Putin’s strategy of sowing mischief will surely continue. And the confrontation with the West, on which his increasingly unpopular regime tries to base its legitimacy, will deepen.
21  THE CENTREPIECE of this year’s European Year of Rail was the “Connecting Europe Express”. Between September and October its cars whisked EU officials across the continent on a whistle-stop tour promoting the future of railways. But the train itself was a nostalgia trip: most of its wagons were built in the 1980s, since more recent models were less likely to be certified by the rail-safety boards of all 26 countries it visited. Without arm-twisting by the European Commission, said Alberto Mazzola of the CER, a rail-industry group, the trip would have been impossible.Listen to this story.It was a classic European story. The EU has grand ambitions for trains as a way of cutting carbon emissions, and its national railway networks are strong. But rail is the form of transport that requires the most co-ordination, and on a continent split into dozens of countries that is a problem. Governments pour money into domestic high-speed lines, but often leave just a winding bit of track linking to the neighbours. For the national carriers that dominate the sector, such as Germany’s Deutsche Bahn and France’s SNCF, cross-border trips are a side business and competitors a nuisance. “The single European railway area exists in terms of a market opening,” says Kristian Schmidt, the European Commission’s director of land transport. ”But we have a long way to go.”The EU’s mobility strategy calls for making all scheduled travel of 500km (310 miles) or less carbon-neutral by 2030. The most obvious way to do that is with electric passenger trains. Even accounting for use of fossil fuels in power generation, trains average about one-fifth the greenhouse-gas emissions per passenger-kilometre of aeroplanes and less than half that of buses, says the European Environment Agency.Gimme a ticket for an aeroplaneYet only 8% of the distance travelled by land in the EU is by rail. Even in the most train-happy countries, Austria and the Netherlands, the figures are 13% and 11%. In those countries, more than 75% of land travel is done by car. Statistics on cross-border rail are patchy, but EU figures show that people made only 6.5m international trips by train from Germany in 2019. They made 110m by air, just to other countries in the EU. Shifting a significant share to rail will require huge investments.More fast trains would help. The EU wants to double high-speed rail traffic by 2030. Because they deliver passengers to city centres rather than airports, trains can out-compete flights on routes of up to 800km, provided they run at 200kph or more. Flights between Milan and Rome fell by more than half after a high-speed rail line opened in 2007. The Eurostar carried nearly 80% of traffic from London to Brussels and Paris in 2019, and a big share of those travelling between Paris and Frankfurt go on French TGV or German ICE trains.But such international high-speed routes are few. Spain and France each have extensive high-speed networks, but to get from one to the other trains must creep along old-fashioned tracks. France and Italy have scarcely begun tunnelling under the Alps to link their networks. High-speed routes between Berlin and central-European cities such as Prague and Vienna are still in the planning stage.These tracks are part of a web of high-priority transport corridors known as TEN-T first sketched by the EU in the 1990s. But national governments, which bear most of the costs, have been slow to pony up the money. The EU’s own Connecting Europe Facility and other programmes budget €86bn ($100bn) for rail from 2021-27. But high-speed track can cost more than €40m per kilometre. On most routes countries would be better off improving their conventional networks, according to the European Court of Auditors.A less costly approach is to bring back the original long-distance rail technology: the night train. Sleeper cars were disappearing in Europe by the mid-2010s, but were revived between Brussels and Vienna in 2016 by öBB, Austria’s national carrier. They have become a romantic fad, popping up again in France, Germany and Sweden. But their carrying capacity is small.Berth of a nationNational divisions have always been a problem for rail. Sleeper trains were brought to Europe by Georges Nagelmackers, a Belgian banking heir who fell for the Pullman car while travelling in America in the 1860s. It took him years of negotiations with various governments to set up the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lit, which ran sleeper coaches that switched between national operators’ locomotives when they crossed borders.In some respects European cross-border rail has gone backwards. The trip from Brussels to Luxembourg can take an hour longer than it did in 1980. Along the German-Czech border some timetables are not much better than those in Hendschel’s Telegraph of 1914. When Germany’s transport minister last year announced “Trans Europ Express 2.0”, it raised the question of why the original Trans Europ Express trains immortalised by Kraftwerk in 1977 were abandoned by the early 1990s.One difficulty in reviving them is compatibility. Europe’s electric railways use four different voltage levels. Signalling and safety systems are even worse: almost every country initially had its own. The European Rail Agency is gradually enforcing common specifications, but that effort has been under way since 1996. At Europe’s edges, even the width of the track varies: the Baltic countries use the Russian Empire’s wider gauge, and Spain and Portugal have one of their own.Private rail entrepreneurs say that traffic would rise if countries actually lived up to their obligations to allow competition. Under EU law all member states have unbundled their rail infrastructure from their train operators, and must let outside players run on their tracks. But some countries are in practice more open than others. Germany’s track owner is an arm of Deutsche Bahn and charges high service fees, which tends to deter competitors. Sweden charges only for the added maintenance that new users require, fostering competition from newcomers such as FlixTrain and MTR that has cut prices.Then there is ticketing. Because systems are incompatible, only a few agencies sell rail tickets across the entire continent. As for refunds, operators are responsible only for the portion of the trip on their own trains. High-speed rail tickets typically cost far more than a budget airfare on the same route. That is unlikely to change while jet fuel and most airline emissions are tax-free.If Europe wants passengers to shift to rail, it will need to tax airlines’ carbon emissions properly. Until then, many passengers will think of trains nostalgically. At a Connecting Europe Express event in Berlin, Christopher Irwin of the European rail passengers’ union reflected that he first travelled to the city by rail from Britain in the 1960s. “It was easier back then.” 
22  ON NOVEMBER 6TH teams of medics dressed in full protective gear packed equipment into a Romanian military transport plane before pushing beds with two severely ill covid-19 patients up the ramp and inside. As the propellers began to whirr, the back door slowly closed and the plane lumbered up the runway heading for Denmark. “There is no secret,” says Raed Arafat, who is co-ordinating Romania’s fight against covid: the country’s hospitals are “overflowing”. About 90 patients have been evacuated to Denmark, Germany, Hungary and elsewhere. Teams of doctors are also flying in from all over Europe to help their beleaguered colleagues.Listen to this story.Across Europe the numbers of people infected with the highly contagious Delta variant are rising, and many governments are contemplating or imposing new restrictions. But this wave is affecting some countries far more than others. From the Balkans to the Baltics an arc of susceptibility has emerged, encompassing a swathe of countries with low vaccination rates.In the past few weeks the death rate from covid-19 has hit record highs in Bulgaria, Latvia and Romania. In the week to November 8th there were 22.8 confirmed deaths in Bulgaria for every million people. In Romania the figure was 21.8 and in Latvia 18.8. Yet for the EU as a whole it was only 3.0. The number of cases is at last dropping in those three badly-hit countries, but it is now soaring in Croatia, Estonia, Lithuania, Slovenia and Ukraine.All of the countries being clobbered are at the low end of the scale when it comes to vaccination. Only 23% of Bulgarians and 34% of Romanians have been double-jabbed. In Latvia the proportion is 57%, but it was much lower a month ago, when the current wave took hold. In the EU as a whole, 66% are double-vaccinated.Low vaccination rates are not the result of a lack of vaccines. The countries of the arc have ample supply, but also loud anti-vaxxers. Distrust of government and medical staff is high. A Eurobarometer survey conducted earlier this year found that only 22% of Bulgarians and Croats, 26% of Latvians and 31% of Romanians tend to trust their governments. When asked if they trusted medical staff, 34% of Bulgarians said they did not, along with 32% of Croats, 31% of Latvians and 40% of Romanians.It is ironic that relatively low levels of infection in the summer seem to have contributed to the scale of current outbreaks. Those with doubts about the vaccine saw little urgency in getting it, which left them vulnerable when the Delta variant hit. Of those now in hospital, says Dr Arafat, 92% are unvaccinated. The true share could be higher, as unknown numbers have bought fake vaccination certificates. He angrily denounces anti-vax disinformation, which is often propagated by rogue doctors, Orthodox priests and far-right nationalists, with the help of “Dr Facebook”.Inga Springe, a journalist with Re:Baltica, a news website, says that in Latvia prominent doctors have given ambiguous signals about vaccinations and some politicians are promoting themselves via anti-vax sites. Bulgaria goes to the polls on November 14th for the third time this year, and politicians there may fear alienating anti-vax voters.According to Oana Popescu, director of GlobalFocus, a Romanian think-tank, Romanians’ lack of enthusiasm for getting vaccinated is a direct result of what they perceive to be decades of neglect by the authorities. “When the government suddenly seems to care for you for the first time in 30 years, of course you become suspicious!” she explains. Alas, it is not just Romanians who feel that way. Dig deeperAll our stories relating to the pandemic can be found on our coronavirus hub.

23  ALEXANDER LUKASHENKO, master tactician? The president of Belarus has brought thousands of migrants from the Middle East to the EU’s doorstep on the eve of winter, daring the bloc to abandon its humanitarian instincts as the world looks on. Mr Lukashenko seems to have intended to reignite the internal division and political upheaval that followed the influx of migrants to Europe in 2015. He has instead forged a consensus in favour of the swift punishment of his regime.Listen to this story.The scenes that have unfolded at the Polish-Belarusian border since November 8th were his concoction. Belarusian travel agents in Iraq offer flights, a visa and the sham promise of an easy path to a new life in Europe in exchange for thousands of dollars. Arrivals in Minsk are whisked through the woods to a spot on the border where, far from swiftly crossing into Poland and embarking on the supposed opportunity to move around the Schengen free-travel zone, migrants end up squeezed between the EU’s razor-wire fences and Belarusian men with guns, unable to go forward or back. As The Economist went to press on November 11th, some 2,000 were trapped near the current main point of concern, the Kuznica crossing (see map). There have been a number of attempts to breach the border there. An estimated 20,000 migrants are thought to be elsewhere in Belarus, with more still continuing to fly in via Istanbul and other Middle Eastern cities on Belavia, the Belarusian state carrier.Mr Lukashenko’s foreign policy has increasingly resembled that of a mafia boss since his theft of elections last year. He has sent goons after dissidents who fled abroad. He is angry at the countries sheltering them, chiefly Poland and Lithuania, and at the entire EU for the sanctions it has imposed on his regime. The ambition of those sanctions was scaled back thanks to lobbying by affected industries, from Austrian banks to Lithuanian railways. Now the political will to deter Mr Lukashenko has hardened. The EU is hinting at fresh sanctions, including on Belavia, possibly as soon as next week. The hitherto hesitant Irish government, whose firms lease planes to the airline, has come on board.That does not mean that keeping migrants off the route to Belarus will be easy. The EU wants to install officials at airports across the Middle East to prod Iraqi passengers with awkward questions before they embark. But that will take time. Angela Merkel, Germany’s outgoing chancellor, has asked Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, to talk Mr Lukashenko out of his plotting. Her chances of success seem slim.Poland sees deterrence as the best way to stem the influx, and so is determined not to admit any of the migrants gathering at its gates. Its populist government has waved away offers of help from Frontex, the EU’s border agency. A camp has sprung up on the Belarusian side, and a lengthy battle of wills is likely. Meanwhile, the migrants are in danger. A freezing winter approaches. And Mr Lukashenko is willing to make people suffer, if the television footage causes problems in Europe. 
24  EVERYONE WANTS to be a little bit Danish. Hygge, a sense of Nordic contentment attained via baking, candles and good company, became the philosophy du jour during lockdown. Danish dramas win garlands, while its comedies contain jokes so enjoyably dark that viewers may worry about finding themselves on a Europol watch list. Even Danish semen has become a booming export, thanks to the country’s combination of liberal rules for donors and reputation as a small nation of tall hunks.Listen to this story.But it is the Danish labour system that attracts the most plaudits. Leftists drool over a model that sees burger flippers in McDonald’s paid the equivalent of $22 per hour. Those on the right marvel that the country has no statutory minimum wage. Instead, employers and stakeholders sit down together and hammer out collective agreements that cover most workers. It is the same in neighbouring Sweden. Employees benefit from wages and benefits that are among the most generous on the continent; employers can hire or fire with ease during boom or bust. Denmark and its Scandi neighbours manage to be both a worker’s paradise and a capitalist’s dream.Telling Scandinavians how to run a labour market is akin to teaching the French how to bake baguettes. Yet this is the position in which the Nordic countries have found themselves. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, wants all workers to be covered by a minimum wage, whether through national law (as in most of the club) or through collective agreements (as in Scandinavia). Proposals that will see the topic of minimum wages dragged into EU law are being negotiated among MEPs and national governments.At first glance, Denmark and Sweden have little to worry about. A common minimum wage is not on the table. Indeed, that would be impossible for a club that includes Luxembourg, whose minimum wage is €2,202 per month ($2,550) and Bulgaria, where it is €332. According to the EU’s own treaties, only national governments can set a minimum wage. Indeed, the commission came to praise the Scandinavian system, not to bury it. It would rather everyone looked a bit more like Sweden or Denmark, with collective agreements galore.Instead, the commission wants to shape how national governments guarantee decent wages, rather than to set their level. Under its proposals, countries would still be in charge of the details. Those with statutory minimum wages would be forced to ensure these are adequate when measured against average incomes. For those without a minimum wage, a group which includes Italy, Austria, Cyprus and Finland as well as the Scandinavian duo, the commission wants at least 70% of workers to be covered by collective agreements—a hurdle that the Scandinavians already meet.Yet the Scandinavian duo are still fretting, and with some cause. All legislation comes with unintended consequences, particularly at the European level, where the European Court of Justice is a player as much as a referee. In Sweden about 60% of collective agreements do not include a minimum wage, points out German Bender, an analyst from Arena Idé, a Swedish think-tank. With EU law now encompassing minimum-wage rules, legal challenges would become possible. And peculiar things can happen. A case in the 1960s involving an unpaid electricity bill worth a few lira ended up establishing the primacy of EU law, which means EU rules trump national ones if the two clash. The so-called “no bailout” clause in the EU’s treaties did little to stop a series of bail-outs. A single judgment might upend the Nordic labour model.When proposals start rolling, they are tricky to stop. Employment legislation gets agreed by a qualified majority of governments, so vetoes do not apply. Usually, though, the EU avoids topics that are sacred to national governments. Pleas that legislating—rather than issuing suggestions—on minimum wages violates the Scandinavian principle of no government interference in wage-setting fell on deaf ears. Denmark and Sweden “yellow-carded” the proposal for a directive on minimum wages, a formal protest, but to no avail. In the EU’s ministerial council, where national governments haggle over a position, the lawyers say it is perfectly legal. The French government, which will shepherd negotiations on the topic from January, is keen to get it done sharpish.Beyond the bare minimumNew rules on minimum wages are only the beginning of a wider push on workers’ rights at the EU level. Laws to make pay transparent have been put forward by the commission. Proposals on how countries must treat “platform workers”—such as Deliveroo riders and Uber drivers—are in the works. For some it is a welcome shift in EU policy. During the austerity years governments were to be lean and mean. Angela Merkel was fond of noting that the EU was 7% of the world’s population, a quarter of its economy, but about half of all its welfare spending. Today, the tune has changed. Generous welfare states and high worker protections were once held to be the cause of the EU’s woes; now they are the solution.For the Scandinavians, this shift is cause for concern. Their system is not broken, yet the EU insists on fixing it. There is little scope for dodging the legislation. Denmark has an opt-out on the euro, as well as on European laws on justice and home affairs. Sweden is in theory obliged to join the euro eventually, but uses a loophole to cling on to its krona. Such derogations are a thing of the past, however, and of no help in the present case. Europe is no longer à la carte. Systems that work well, such as those of Denmark and Sweden, may have to change in order to help systems that work less well, such as those of Cyprus or Italy. “United in diversity” is the EU’s slogan. But unity increasingly trumps diversity as the EU delves ever further into the lives of its citizens. Everyone wants to be a bit like Denmark. But Denmark may soon start to resemble everywhere else.
25  TURKEY HAS deported Syrian refugees before. Some were sent back to their war-scorched homeland for failing to register with the authorities or for minor crimes. Some say they were tricked or forced into signing voluntary return forms. But none thought they would be thrown out for eating bananas. Until now.Listen to this story.In October the government said it would deport seven Syrians for sharing “provocative” videos on social media, which showed the young refugees staring into their phones and munching yellow fruit. This was in response to an interview with a Turkish man who had blamed Syrians for driving up rents and complained that they could afford bananas, which he could not.The banana-eaters seemed to be mocking prejudice against refugees. But officials accused them of mocking the needy. And that was not the end of it. Turkish police arrested a Syrian journalist who had made light of the uproar in a video that showed him nervously buying bananas from a grocer, then hiding them under his sweater. (He was released on November 8th.)Some 3.7m Syrians have made Turkey their home over the past decade. The Turkish welcome, once generous, has become grudging. As the lira plummets and inflation tests 20%, the refugees are becoming a target of frustration. With its poll numbers shrinking President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government appears keen to prove that it can act tough. Even over soft fruit.
26  IT WAS NOT poverty or ambition that drew Irfan Demirbilek to Germany from Turkey in 1968, but the lure of its splendid cars. Spotting a queue outside an employment office in Istanbul one day, Mr Demirbilek, an electrician who had long dreamed of having his own wheels, decided to join them in applying to work in West Germany. The countries had signed a “guest-worker” deal in 1961, and a brief spell earning Deutschmarks would suffice for an Opel or VW Beetle. A few months later Mr Demirbilek was on a three-day train to Cologne, his head full of excitement and apprehension.Listen to this story.As with so many Turkish guest workers, his brief German sojourn turned out to last a lifetime (and several cars, he chuckles). Now 84, he is sitting with his wife at a theatre in Düsseldorf, where the pair have just been garlanded with flowers in a ceremony to mark the 60th anniversary of the guest-worker treaty. The moment has offered Germany a chance to reflect on the complex history of what is now a 2.75m-strong Turkish minority, its largest by a distance.Three-quarters of a million poor and largely unskilled Turks came to West Germany during the 12 years the agreement was in force. (Family reunification, and later waves of political exiles, boosted the numbers further.) Talk to guest workers and their descendants and you hear complex family histories: of immigrants vacillating between return and staying; women struggling to make sense of a place to which they had no economic or cultural link; and “suitcase children” tossed back and forth between the two countries.Germany, too, went through agonies, as its Gastarbeiter became a permanent minority in a country with little understanding of itself as a land of immigration. Integration policy came late, and was halting. First-generation Turks often lived in dormitories in enclaves where encounters with Germans were rare. Learning German was seldom needed for the manual work most performed. Children could be placed in migrant-only classes on the assumption they would one day go “home”; the gifted were often held back from the best schools.Public distrust found expression in government policy. In 1983 Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who wanted to halve Germany’s Turkish population, offered guest workers repatriation payments. It was not until 2014 that Turkish-Germans born in the country could retain dual citizenship into adulthood. Today some 1.5m residents, including nearly two-thirds of adults, do not have a German passport. (The incoming coalition is discussing reform of Germany’s citizenship laws.) Xenophobic violence, common in the 1990s, is still a threat: four Turkish- and Kurdish-Germans were among the ten victims of a mass shooting in Hanau last year.The reality for most is more prosaic. Germany’s Turks own some 90,000 businesses, employing half a million people. They have spread beyond well-known neighbourhoods such as Marxloh in Duisburg or Mülheim in Cologne to suburbs and rural areas. Turkish-Germans are familiar faces from football to film. Eighteen won seats in the Bundestag in September’s election. But difficulties persist. Children with a Turkish background are likelier to drop out of school and earn less at work than other Germans, even when family background is accounted for. Zerrin Salikutluk, an expert on integration at Humboldt University in Berlin, describes studies suggesting that teachers’ low expectations for Turkish pupils tend to reduce their grades. Germans with Turkish-sounding names still face discrimination in housing and hiring.Such problems should dwindle over time, though others have emerged. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s autocratic president, has directly appealed to Turkish-Germans who struggle to find a place in Germany—and has exported his own country’s turbulent politics. At times of strain between the two governments, surveys find that a growing number of young Turks say they feel drawn to Turkey. Hakan Demir, a newly elected Turkish-German MP for Neukölln, a diverse district in Berlin, says local children enjoy provoking him by calling themselves Ausländer (foreigners), something he does not hear from older constituents. Well-integrated Turks bristle at having their loyalties questioned.Even Germany’s belated recognition of the achievements of its migrants often comes wrapped in well-meaning condescension. “The labels have changed,” says Meral Sahin, a wedding-shop proprietor in Cologne, reeling off half a dozen of them, from “guest worker” to “foreign resident”. But, she adds, they always said more about the Germans using them than the people to whom they were applied. Ugur Sahin and Özlem Türeci, the Turkish-German scientists behind the BioNTech covid-19 vaccine, have expressed unease at the politics of being held up as immigrant role models.Germany has learned from some of its mistakes. It quickly channelled Syrian and other migrants from the 2015-16 wave into language and integration courses. Yet, notes Nesrin Tanç, a Duisburg-based author, for all the commemorations Germany still lacks an overarching story capacious enough to include Germans, Turks and other groups. Such notions can seem eccentric, even dangerous, in a country where patriotism is regarded with queasiness for obvious historical reasons. But since people with a “migrant background”, in the German argot, are more than a quarter of the population, the need for a unifying narrative has only grown.At a recent ceremony to honour guest workers, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Germany’s president, urged his compatriots, Germans and Turks alike, to “develop a history together” in which the contribution of all German residents could be acknowledged and celebrated. Germany, now rapidly ageing, is once again crying out for foreign labour. When the next wave of recruitment from abroad takes place, previous episodes will provide valuable lessons. 
27  FARMERS IN SOUTHERN Italy are cultivating avocados and mangos. Tropical creatures such as the rabbitfish are turning up in Mediterranean nets. And Bordeaux winemakers fret that their Merlot grapes may become extinct. Fifty years ago all this would have been unthinkable. But since the early 1980s rising temperatures have forced some farmers to swap grapes for passion fruit.Listen to this story.Italy and France have long been proud of their cuisines. Both countries jealously guard the rules that say only ham made in Parma can be called “Prosciutto di Parma”, and only fizzy wine made in Champagne can be called champagne. Roquefort, that most celebrated of blue cheeses, was given special protection by the parliament of Toulouse in 1550.The fact of having been grown somewhere famous has traditionally been seen as a guarantee of quality. But climate change could upset that. Take polenta, a popular Italian dish consisting almost entirely of ground maize. High temperatures and drier weather have already reduced maize yields in southern Italy. If this pattern continues and spreads northwards, will Italian polenta-makers have to order their maize from elsewhere? And what about durum wheat, which grows abundantly in Mediterranean lands and is used to make pasta, flatbreads and couscous? Modelling suggests that durum yields will sharply fall there if the temperature keeps on rising.So should gourmands worry about the future of spaghetti? Gabriele Cola, a researcher at Milan University, is optimistic about the short term. “I don’t see crops at serious risk, because farming is more informed and technologically capable, so it can always respond to changes,” he says. Increased irrigation can counter the effects of drought. Scientists may also breed more resistant varieties of crops.But in the long run deeper change seems likely. If temperatures rise unabated, farmers in northern Europe may find they can grow southern staples; polenta may invade Germany. And southern locavores may have to adapt. If tropical fruit continue to thrive in Sicily, could ham and pineapple pizza one day be considered authentically Italian?For more coverage of climate change, register for The Climate Issue, our fortnightly newsletter, or visit our climate-change hub
28  THE BRITISH government is easily distracted. At the G7, it was sausages that knocked its concentration. Leaders gathered in Carbis Bay in June to discuss the pandemic and climate change. Instead they found Boris Johnson, their British host, embroiled in an argument with the EU about the export of chilled meats to Northern Ireland. At COP26, the environmental jamboree in Glasgow in Scotland, it was fish. Mr Johnson argued with France over the fate of a few dozen fishing licences in the Channel Islands.Listen to this story.Britain’s relationship with the EU has a habit of interfering with set-piece events. France threatened to ban British boats from its ports, as well as jam up freight heading to and from Britain with extra checks. In turn Britain threatened to sue France for breaching the terms of a trade deal between the EU and Britain, agreed on with a mixture of stress and haste at the end of 2020. Two NATO allies, nuclear powers and partners on the UN Security Council with a combined GDP larger than Japan’s, issued threats over a fishing industry worth only about 0.1% of it—though they managed to park the issue for a few days while the bigwigs were in town.Fishing illustrates the Richard Scarry rule: politicians are terrified to mess with workers whose jobs are often depicted in children’s books, since voters have a romantic view of farmers, firefighters, cops, etc. So fights between national fishing fleets can swiftly escalate, until prime ministers and presidents are slapping each other with figurative flounders. The EU keeps such squabbles in check between its members, but Britain has left the club. Dull meetings of a fisheries council have been replaced by a British minister dashing across the Channel for talks to avert a trade war.Franco-British ties have often frayed. When all went well, it led to good things such as jointly developing Concorde, the world’s first supersonic passenger jet. When things went poorly, it led to bad stuff, like the operational performance of Concorde, which lost lots of money and then fizzled out. When both countries were in the EU, it took larger disputes, such as Iraq, to strain the relationship. Now, even scallops can blow things off course.Take away bodies like the EU, which tie governments together in ceaseless dialogue, and friction is inevitable. Neighbours row, no matter how well-tempered they usually are. Across the Atlantic, local hegemon America frequently squares up against Canada, the most placid neighbour imaginable, over everything from timber to milk. Japan and South Korea are both rich democracies fearful of authoritarian neighbours and allied to America, but they do not let that get in the way of a reliably spiky relationship.Although the EU is skilled at soothing things between its members, that can make things more complex for its neighbours. Ottawa can speak to Washington directly, without having to worry much about bilateral relations between Canada and Montana. When Britain tries to deal with its EU neighbours, it now faces an overlapping matrix of legal and political authority, between the EU and national governments. At times, the British government still clings to the false hope that convincing a few big countries is enough to sway the EU. The opposite is the case: those that are most affected by an issue hold the pen on controversial files, whether they are large or small. Other governments back them, building up favours that can be repaid. The EU is complicated. Dealing with it is complicated, too.Britain is hardly alone in enduring a rocky relationship with the EU. So do most of the club’s neighbours and allies. Turkey, ostensibly an ally but more usually an annoyance, is a constant thorn. The club often clashes with America, another economic power used to having its way. Switzerland’s relationship (the most similar to Britain’s) is often barbed. For an example of somewhere that usually has a calm relationship with the EU, the best options are Norway or Liechtenstein, which is less a country than the answer to a pub-quiz question. Britain is too large to accept being pushed around but too small to force its way.Perpetual arguments beckon, says Samuel Lowe of the Centre for European Reform, a think-tank. When the row over fish passes, attention will turn to Northern Ireland, a more serious problem. The British government wants to overhaul the Northern Ireland protocol, which oversees trade involving the province. Depending on how it does it, this could trigger an all-out trade war between Britain and the EU, or, at best, months of negotiations. When that issue passes, others will flare up, whether on data protection, financial regulation or British exporters facing a carbon border-tax.The threat is not the rows themselves, but the opportunity costs of dealing with them. Britain and France will remain strong military allies. In the midst of the row, a French sub popped up in Faslane, which is home to Britain’s nuclear subs. The Lancaster House treaties, in which the two countries tied their armed forces together, still stand. Such agreements do not collapse overnight. But they can wither if there is little political desire to keep them watered. Amid the noise, the longer-term damage being done can be silent. Don’t worry about the bang; fear the whimper.We need to talkAfter Brexit, officials in Britain and the EU come together almost only in crisis or confrontation. Rather than regular meetings aimed at solving problems before they appear, diplomats talk when things have already gone wrong. Politicians will always scrap, whether inside or outside the EU. But there are now fewer forums for diplomats to heal the wounds. Even America and the Soviet Union had a red phone. European history is one of grumpy relations between neighbours. The EU did not exist, so they had to invent it. Over 60 years, an apparatus emerged to stop small technical arguments becoming big political headaches. Brexit means having to reinvent a space for arcane policy discussion between Britain and its European neighbours. Until it does, public fights over scallops or sausages will be too tempting to resist. 
29  A GERINGONÇA IS pleasing to say, but difficult to operate. The Portuguese term, sometimes translated as “contraption”, refers to a device patched together from oddly fitting parts. Although the governing arrangement that António Costa, Portugal’s prime minister, assembled in 2015 was dubbed the geringonça, it proved surprisingly durable. But on October 27th it finally fell apart, as two left-wing partners voted down his budget, triggering elections two years early—a rare occurrence in Portugal.Listen to this story.Though the budget was expansive, splashing out on free kindergarten and other goodies and increasing the minimum wage, it was not lavish enough for Mr Costa’s radical allies, the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP) and the Left Bloc (BE). Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, the president, had announced in advance that if it failed, he would call elections. If he was hoping to put pressure on the parties to seal the deal, the gamble failed.The parties are scrambling to influence the electoral timetable. Most want elections on January 16th, to avoid prolonged instability. But the calendar is complicated by the plans of the biggest opposition party, the Social Democrats (PSD), a centre-right outfit despite its name, to hold leadership elections on December 4th. That would leave the winner scant time to pick candidates for the general elections. One PSD candidate, Paulo Rangel, is lobbying Mr Rebelo de Sousa (who hails from the PSD himself) to hold the elections later, to allow the party time to regroup. The current leader, Rui Rio, wants to postpone the primary instead. The president was due to announce the date on November 4th.After an inauspicious start Mr Costa has won respect, not least in neighbouring Spain (where the centre-left Socialists also depend on a far-left party, Podemos). His Socialists came second in 2015’s election, then toppled the short-lived minority PSD government, cobbling together a majority with the BE and PCP, previously considered untouchable by the moderate Socialists.The then-president required a written agreement between the parties: the BE and PCP never joined the government but made clear commitments of support. But Mr Costa increased his party’s seat count in 2019’s elections. Mr Rebelo de Sousa decided not to insist on a formal agreement before blessing the second geringonça. The Bloc and the Communists, weakened and unbound by any deal, were sure to flounce out at some point.Some think Mr Costa might have been happy for them to do so now. Portugal’s covid-19 vaccination rate, 87%, is one of the world’s highest. He can point to decent GDP growth and falling unemployment until the pandemic (which in 2020 caused GDP to plunge further than in any year since the 1930s). He has kept the deficit, which made Portugal a ward of the European Union and the IMF after the financial crisis, low enough to win international respect.But this has come at the cost of public investment: Portugal’s is thought to be the lowest in the EU in 2020 and 2021. Salaries are low by Western European standards: the minimum wage, at €775 ($900) a month, is around €300 less than Spain’s. Many Portuguese head abroad to work.If Mr Costa nonetheless does well, he might be able to govern with smaller, more tractable allies than the ones that have just let him down. Miguel Maduro, an ally of Mr Rangel in the PSD leadership contest, wants to return to an informal arrangement where whichever of the two biggest parties ends up with the second-largest tally of seats agrees not to try immediately to topple a minority government led by the other one.But all the moderate parties are warily watching Chega, a far-right party with just one deputy now, but worryingly strong support in the polls. Mr Rangel refuses to govern with Chega. (Mr Rio has been more equivocal.) If Chega squeezes the other parties, any new government will be tricky. Portugal may be joining a new European normal: shrinking established parties, growing extremes and complex coalitions, a kind of permanent geringonça. 
30  QUEEN YULIA spends her nights lip-synching in a cheap wig and a disco-ball bra. Sometimes she does so on a plastic horse. She is one of a handful of professional drag queens in Georgia. She is also a co-owner of Success Bar, the country’s only avowedly gay pub. (Some other clubs in Georgia run occasional gay nights.) Before she made a living on stage, she was in charge of “face control” for the bar. For bouncers at most other venues, that means maintaining an air of exclusivity by letting in only stylish folk. For Queen Yulia and security guards at other LGBT events in Georgia, it means screening out bigots who might turn violent.Listen to this story.This is hard. Hatred, unlike a cool outfit, is not instantly visible. Partygoers hoping to attend a gay night at Bassiani, a nearby club, must submit their names, dates of birth, links to their Facebook profiles and even passport numbers days in advance. The party’s security team then screen for signs of prejudice before allowing anyone to hit the dance floor. Nomadic Boys, a travel blog catering to gay tourists, advises clubgoers in Tbilisi to “avoid entering in big groups” and “keep silent as the bouncer scans you”, lest innocent punters be taken for violent homophobes. Such scrutiny is needed in Georgia, where violence against gay people is alarmingly common.On July 5th anti-gay rioters ransacked the headquarters of gay-rights groups that had planned a pride march that day. The thugs injured dozens of journalists covering the attack. One cameraman who was beaten later died, though the cause of his death remains unclear. Irakli Garibashvili, Georgia’s prime minister, called the pride march a “propagandistic parade”. He said it ought to have been cancelled, since 95% of Georgians oppose its message. The march planned for Tbilisi wasn’t like pride celebrations in other European capitals where revellers throw condoms around, says Nia Gvatua, another co-owner of Success Bar. We were just trying to walk down “one fucking street”, she says.Gay Georgians are used to having their events disrupted. In 2019 bigots threw smoke bombs at a screening of a gay romance film. In 2013, as activists marked May 17th, a day on which activists worldwide decry homophobia and transphobia, rioters threw stones at pro-gay demonstrators and tried to lynch a man they thought was gay, says Amnesty International, an NGO. The next year, the head of Georgia’s Orthodox church chose to designate the same day as an annual celebration of family values.Most Georgians think gay sex is immoral. In a survey in 2018 by the International Social Survey Programme, 84% said it was always wrong. That was a higher share than in the Philippines, Russia or Turkey.Success Bar thus offers an island of tolerance. Gay people can mingle, dance and have sex in the Dark Room, a dimly lit section of the bar. That is handy. More than 40% of Georgians live in multigenerational households. Grandma’s watchful eye makes sex at home awkward for anyone, but especially for gay couples.Tight security keeps clubgoers safe, for the most part. According to Queen Yulia, gay-bashers sometimes create fake Facebook profiles, posing as gay, to get into her bar. Once inside, they figure out who is gay or trans so that they can attack them later, outside. They tend to avoid fights inside the bar, where they are outnumbered.Covid-19 restrictions and the fear of violence left Georgia’s gay nightlife shuttered for months. Success Bar reopened in October. On its first day back, two gay activists were arrested outside the bar, supposedly for breaking a covid curfew.Queen Yulia no longer feels safe in Georgia. Since the attack on July 5th, life for LGBT people has become worse, she says. She takes taxis everywhere now because she “can’t take two steps” on the street without getting yelled at or beaten. She is saving money to leave the country. Others are leaving, too. For those who remain, the party goes on, but so does the struggle for acceptance. 
31  FOR THE past six months Italians have been floating from triumph to triumph. It began in May when an Italian band, Maneskin, won the Eurovision song contest. In July their men’s football team became Europe’s champions and in August, at the Olympics, their male sprinters astonished the sporting world, claiming gold in the 100 metres and 4 x 100 metres relay. In October an Italian scientist, Giorgio Parisi, shared the Nobel prize for physics.Listen to this story.Italy has meanwhile had what is, for it, the novel experience of being governed by an internationally respected prime minister, Mario Draghi, with a huge parliamentary majority that allows him to turn his projects swiftly into law. Supported by an effective vaccination campaign, the economy is recovering strongly. On October 28th Mr Draghi, a former president of the European Central Bank, forecast economic growth this year of “probably well over 6%”, though few expect Italy’s GDP to regain its pre-pandemic level until 2022, well behind America and Britain, among others. But Standard & Poor’s, a rating agency, has revised its outlook for Italian debt from stable to positive, and Italians can look forward to a period in which their government will be in a position—under an obligation, indeed—to spend liberally for the first time since the days of the post-war, American-funded Marshall Plan.Italy stands to be the biggest beneficiary in absolute terms of the EU’s post-pandemic recovery project. From the core Recovery and Resilience Facility alone, it is due to receive €191.5bn in grants and loans. Such an influx of cash cannot help but have an impact on an economy that, even before covid-19, had barely grown this century: in real terms, Italy’s GDP in 2019 was only 4% above its level in 2000, thanks to a combination of slow growth in even the best years and big declines in the bad ones. Real GDP per person was 1% lower over the period, compared with increases of 16% in France and 24% in Germany. Oxford Economics estimates that over the next three to four years the EU’s recovery project will add on average a helpful annual 0.5 percentage points to Italian GDP growth.Enzo Moavero, a professor at LUISS university in Rome who has served as a non-party minister in three recent governments, warns that the real challenge for Mr Draghi will be to deliver sustainable growth at or preferably above the European average. This, he reckons, will require “effective reforms that lead to thoroughgoing structural change.”The EU’s recovery project is designed to address that issue. It makes the allocation of funds contingent on specific reforms and investments aimed at improving the growth prospects of member states. Italy has so far been given an initial €25bn with no strings attached. But it will have to satisfy a daunting 51 requirements by the end of the year to qualify for the next tranche. And it could struggle to meet the target. A report to the cabinet on September 23rd revealed that at that point only 13 of the 51 objectives had been reached.Italy’s reform programme is not the problem; that is ahead of schedule. In May a package was approved that simplified a wide range of bureaucratic procedures. And a shake-up of the criminal-justice system is about to be implemented. A further reform, focusing on civil justice, is in the pipeline. Officials say that legislation to promote competition is also coming soon.The problem is with investment. The outstanding foot-draggers appear to be the ministry of tourism, which at the time of the report had yet to implement any of the six investments for which it is responsible; and the department for ecological transition, which had implemented only one.Looking beyond the end of this year, two doubts arise. The first concerns the fate of legislation after it is handed out for implementation at the sub-national level. “In Italy, the intention of policies is all too often lost in translation,” says Paolo Graziano, who teaches political science at the University of Padua. There is a shortage of the necessary project-management skills among officials charged with implementing complex programmes—a shortcoming the Draghi government says it has begun to address. But another reason, says Fabrizio Tassinari of the European University Institute in Florence, is that “secondary legislation becomes hostage to vested interests, from local authorities to trade unions.”A further doubt centres on Mr Draghi himself. He is known to want the presidency, which becomes vacant in February, and if he were chosen he would have to resign as prime minister. Even if he does not become head of state, he is unlikely to remain in government after a general election that has to be held by the spring of 2023, and may well come sooner.On October 18th mayoral candidates from the Democratic Party (PD) were elected in Rome and Turin, completing a clean sweep of Italy’s biggest cities by the centre-left. But the PD and its allies are weaker in the provinces. Polls continue to suggest that Italy’s next government will be a coalition dominated by two parties that have long been critical of the European Commission: the Brothers of Italy (FdI) party, which has links to neo-fascism, and the hard-right Northern League.Those close to Mr Draghi argue that his departure need not lead to a radical break. His government has established bureaucratic mechanisms for steering and controlling the flow of the recovery money that will, with luck, outlive it. And future governments will be just as constrained by the deadlines the commission imposes and loth to forfeit the flow of cash from Brussels by failing to meet them.Perhaps. But the League, which is a part of the coalition underpinning Mr Draghi, and the FdI, which is not, are both wedded to policies and interests that are at odds with the reforming thrust of the recovery plan. The League has already succeeded in parrying it in one important area. A significant weakness of the Italian economy is that, while taxes on labour are too high, those on property are too low. Mr Draghi’s government moved to adjust the balance by changing the criteria used in the land registry in a way that would have boosted the revenue from property. But he ran into determined opposition from the League’s leader, Matteo Salvini. As a result, the changes will not now come into effect until 2026; and even then they will not be used to calculate tax liability.“I am more positive now than I was a year ago,” says Nicola Nobile of Oxford Economics. “But I still consider a permanent improvement in Italy’s economic prospects to be an upside scenario rather than a base case.”
