0  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is likely to mean that central banks will take longer to tighten the ultra-loose monetary policy they deployed during the coronavirus pandemic, according to the chief executive of Man Group, one of the world’s biggest hedge fund managers.Luke Ellis, whose firm has $148.6bn in assets and reported record client inflows and a 230 per cent rise in profits for last year, said on Tuesday he was “sceptical” of whether markets had really seen the end of “easy money”, despite strong central bank rhetoric in recent months that interest rates would have to rise to combat inflation.“The Ukraine situation pushes that out,” Ellis told the Financial Times. “It’s likely that central banks will be less aggressive than they would have been, even though their problem is worse.“This [war in Ukraine] is clearly inflationary,” he added.His comments come after central banks have targeted tighter monetary policy to try and control a surge in inflation, which hit a higher than forecast rate of 7.5 per cent in the US in January — a 40-year high.A recent poll of 45 economists by the FT and the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business found that a majority expected the federal funds rate to increase from its current near-zero level to a minimum of 1.5 per cent by the end of this year.Ellis also said that Man Group’s funds had sold out of virtually all of their positions in Russia and Ukraine before Christmas, on fears that rising tensions would lead to capital controls. He said the firm still had what he described as a “de minimis” position in Russian equities, which it had not managed to sell but which “makes no difference”.Man on Tuesday reported record net inflows during the year of $13.7bn, with $7.2bn of these coming in the fourth quarter alone.Last year’s flows equal almost the entirety of the $13.9bn net inflows recorded by the whole of the $3.6tn hedge fund industry for 2021, as measured by data group eVestment.Statutory pre-tax profit jumped from $179mn in 2020 to $590mn last year, helped by a near-quadrupling of performance fee earnings and a rise in management fees.While hedge funds made gains during the pandemic on average, helped by rising markets, it has often been the biggest firms who have prospered most. Man’s rivals Citadel and Millennium, for instance, have posted large gains, helped by their diversification across assets, an ability to raise or cut risk quickly and their ability to hire traders.Man posted strong gains in a number of its funds last year, aided by rising markets and a move by investors into cheaper, so-called value stocks.Its $4.7bn AHL Evolution fund, which bets on trends in almost 800 niche markets, rose 17 per cent, while its GLG Japan CoreAlpha fund gained 28.2 per cent. Its AHL TargetRisk strategy, which aims to balance risk across equities, government bonds, credit and inflation-linked bonds, gained 14.4 per cent and grew from $11.2bn to $18.7bn in assets during the year.Ellis said that after two consecutive quarters of record net inflows at the end of last year, the firm was “back to normal now” but added that clients had not “hit the panic button” in response to a choppy start to 2022 in markets.Man Group’s share price was up 1 per cent to 195.05p at around midday on Tuesday.
1  On Ukraine’s border with Poland this week, trying to find some shelter from the biting wind, Lena was coming to terms with the fact that — for the second time in her life — she has been displaced by war.After Russian-backed separatists and Moscow stoked conflict in eastern Ukraine in 2014, Lena fled her home in Luhansk and moved to Kyiv, hoping for a safer life in the capital. But as Russian missiles began to rain down on her country last week, she found herself fleeing once more.“We had bought an apartment in Kyiv, but now we had to leave again,” she said, cradling her pet dog beneath her jacket. “I don’t believe what is happening. I just don’t believe it.”Since Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine last week, hundreds of thousands have made a similar journey. The country’s western neighbours have all offered help. Poland, which has close linguistic and cultural ties with Ukraine and is already home to more than 1mn of its citizens, looks likely to be one of the main destinations.Poland’s conservative-nationalist government vehemently opposed EU efforts to enforce quotas for asylum seekers during the 2015 migration crisis. But this time, officials have said they are preparing to take as many as 1mn Ukrainians. Poland’s border force said on Tuesday that 410,000 people had entered the country since the start of the war.On Tuesday the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said the conflict looks set to create “Europe’s largest refugee crisis this century” and that more than 660,000 have fled the fighting over the past six days.The exodus has blocked Ukraine’s roads and caused chaos at crossings such as Medyka, where the queue of cars stretches tens of kilometres from the border, stranding thousands for days in freezing conditions with dwindling supplies of food and water.The tailbacks have also sparked emotional scenes on the Polish side of the fence. Many Ukrainians already living in the west have come to the border to wait as their loved ones inch closer to the checkpoint. On Monday, one family hugged with joy as they were reunited. A few metres away, another woman cried with desperation at the delays facing hers.Bogdan, who had come from Berlin, said his wife Olga and their five-year-old daughter had driven from Kyiv to within 30km of the border on Friday evening. But nearly three days on, they were still 11km — or two days — away.While she waited in the car, he said, Olga had wrapped herself and their daughter in all the clothes they had so she could turn off the engine to conserve fuel without freezing. On the other side of the border, Bogdan had been calling her every 20 minutes or so to stop her falling asleep and losing her place in the queue.“She is worried, she is panicked, she has a little kid, and if she runs out of petrol, they will have to go more than 10km on foot, and it’s impossible with a small child and after five days when she hasn’t slept,” he said.Among those crossing the border, there were also groups from countries such as Nigeria, Yemen and Tunisia, many of whom moved to Ukraine to study and then found themselves caught up in the conflict.Marcel, a Nigerian who had been studying medicine in Vinnytsia, said he had made the crossing without problems. But Ahmed, who had been studying in Odesa, said he and his friends from Yemen had been insulted by Ukrainian border guards, and that one had been hit three times. “It was the worst journey of our lives,” he said.As the new arrivals waited for transport further west, or tried to obtain much-needed sim cards for phones, smaller groups of Ukrainian men in Poland were heading in the opposite direction.Anatolii Kachorak, from Ivano-Frankivsk in Ukraine, said he was waiting for his mother, wife and two children, who had been stuck at the border for four days, to cross to safety — but that as soon as they arrived he would go to defend his country. “I will fight to the end,” he said. “I will go to the front line, to wherever things are hottest.”Despite Poland’s resistance to asylum quotas in 2015-16, opinion polls suggest most are in favour of taking in Ukrainians. Polish social media is awash with offers of free transport and accommodation, as well as links to fundraising sites for refugees.In Medyka, aid groups have set up makeshift tents to provide shelter and on Monday volunteers were processing and handing out a steady stream of donations of blankets, food and water.“We can take Ukrainians in, there is no cultural difference between us,” said Slawomir, who had taken the day off work to ferry 2,000 meals from Krakow to Medyka. “There will be no problem. They are us — just on the other side of the border.”But alongside the welcome, there have also been traces of unease at how the conflict might develop. At one petrol station on the outskirts of Przemysl, some 30km from the border, all the pumps had run dry, despite signs warning customers to limit their purchases to 100l each.“I think people panicked a bit,” said the cashier. “They started turning up with a couple of canisters each. It went quickly. I hope that was the peak. But Putin is completely unpredictable. He has lost it.”And relief at reaching Poland is tempered with fear of the unknown for many of the refugees from Ukraine. “I really don’t know what I will do now,” said Lena, as she waited for her sister, who already lives in Poland, to pick her up. “In our situation, the plans you make — they never come true.”
2  The curious case of The Sims 4: My Wedding Stories was never going to be the biggest news coming out of Russia this month. Yet developer EA still managed to froth the gamer community into a mighty uproar on social media and the fansite Sims Community, when it announced that it would not be releasing its latest expansion pack in Russia due to the country’s so-called “gay propaganda” law, which makes it illegal to show LGBT content to minors.The Sims has long been a standard-bearer for queer representation in gaming, and the marketing campaign for My Wedding Stories focused on a lesbian couple planning their marriage. While a few voices applauded EA for taking a stand, many fans were furious, particularly queer Russian players on Twitter who shared their opinions alongside the hashtag #weddingsforrussia. Many pointed out that EA had misunderstood the law, which is ambiguously worded and inconsistently applied. A week later, EA sheepishly backtracked and said it would release the game in Russia uncensored.It was a PR mess. Yet controversy around censorship in gaming is becoming increasingly common. As the global market grows, developers endeavour to make their content appropriate for audiences in wildly different cultural contexts. If they release a game with uncensored content internationally, they can face criticism for cultural insensitivity and even upset governments, get banned and lose profits. But censor a game and audiences could argue they’re compromising artistic integrity or pandering to repressive regimes. Should developers refuse to censor outright? Or do gamers need to accept that games may take different forms depending on geography?Since the 1980s, games have been censored in some form. The original game development hubs often censored for one another: American games reduced their violence for Japan and Japanese games toned down sexual content for the US. For the most part, these alterations simply filtered out extremes of sex and gore. But there is another, thornier reason for censorship — when a game developer alters content to appease a government rather than its people.The epicentre of this debate is China, the biggest gaming market in the world. The Chinese government has always had a volatile relationship with games — consoles were mainly banned between 2000 and 2014, while a ban was introduced last year on under-18s playing online for more than three hours per week. The country’s National Press and Publication Administration also censors and bans games with critical views of the country. And in the hugely popular action role-playing game Genshin Impact, the words “Taiwan”, “Tibet”, “Stalin”, “Putin”, “Hong” and “Kong” are blocked from the in-game chat.Two recent incidents particularly ignited the fury of the international gaming community, with complaints building on Reddit, Steam, ResetEra, Twitter and in the gaming press. One was the case of Devotion, an acclaimed horror game from Taiwanese studio Red Candle Games, which was pulled from sale because of a background detail comparing Xi Jinping to Winnie the Pooh. More troublingly, in 2019 Californian game publisher Blizzard expelled a professional gamer from a tournament and withdrew his winnings after he publicly expressed support for Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement. The resulting outcry went all the way to US senators, prompting Blizzard to return the prize money and reduce the player’s ban. The idea that an American company could act as a political censor for China was a frightening thought.Governments rarely explicitly tell developers to censor their games. More often, developers self-censor for commercial reasons, entering murky ethical territory. But perhaps more important than whether companies are censoring is the question of why. Developers owe their players transparency. They should state clearly what is being changed and why, so gamers can decide what they want to buy and play. In certain cases, the decision is understandable — such as a mission in Fallout 3 which was removed for Japanese audiences, in which you can choose to detonate an atomic bomb. In others, such as the Blizzard controversy, gamers end up feeling as if a company has sacrificed its integrity for the sake of its bottom line.Meanwhile, on an isolated server of Minecraft is a digital building called The Uncensored Library. This is a project by NGO Reporters Without Borders which noticed that, while many news websites and political blogs are censored in authoritarian countries, Minecraft is accessible everywhere. So it stocked this virtual library with censored reporting to prove that games don’t merely have to navigate censorship — they can also fight it.
3  French president Emmanuel Macron, reporting back from his latest talks with Putin, kept faith in the diplomatic track. The EU imposed sanctions on a few more people for the Russian-led war in the Donbas. And Germany continued to resist sending weapons to Ukraine. It was the kind of hesitant response that critics of the EU have come to expect — despite its aspirations to become a geopolitical power. Fast-forward seven days, though, and Europe’s strategic outlook has been transformed. It was led by a momentous policy turn in Berlin, which pledged to ramp up defence spending, dropped its resistance to arming Kyiv, endorsed damaging financial sanctions on Moscow and embarked on a costly drive to reduce its energy dependence on Russia. The EU’s illusions about the nature of the Russian threat to Europe have crumbled. Where European capitals once favoured dialogue, they have turned to deterrence. Engagement with Russia has turned to isolation as business, cultural and sporting ties are cut. The shift has occurred with breathtaking speed — even if it took Russia’s decision to launch the biggest military offensive in Europe since the battle of Berlin in 1945 to bring it about.It was not long ago that European capitals argued over the need for a European Peace Facility to provide weapons to third countries. Now Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, has earmarked €450mn to arm Ukraine, including with fighter jets.“The paradigm has changed. Everything has changed. Nobody is questioning where we stand any more,” said Nathalie Tocci, director of Italy’s Institute for International Affairs. “It is not only war in Europe, it is war against Europe.”Michel Duclos, a former French diplomat and adviser to the Institut Montaigne think-tank, said Germany, France, Italy and even to a degree the UK — until the 2018 poisoning of Sergei Skripal on UK soil by Russian agents — failed to recognise that Moscow was becoming more aggressive. Their assessment was shaped by a dominant narrative that Russia felt threatened by the enlargement of Nato, he said.“Our leaders discovered with horror that the problem for Putin was not the security of Russia but his need to take back the Ukrainian lands,” Duclos said. “When he talked about ‘denazification’ and the cleansing of Ukraine, it was not the old Putin. It was a Putin prepared to risk it all to satisfy his ethnographic-nationalist imperative.”The illusions about Russia were so big in Germany, said Jana Puglierin, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, that Putin’s aggression brought a tectonic shift in German thinking.“The German public has finally woken up,” said Puglierin. For decades, German policy had been driven by two nostrums: that Russia could be made a responsible security partner in Europe, and that dialogue and engagement, particularly through trade, were more effective than deterrence. They have been turned on their head practically overnight. “With the attack on Ukraine, Putin is not just seeking to wipe an independent country off the map,” German chancellor Olaf Scholz told the Bundestag on Sunday as he tore up Germany’s postwar antimilitarist foreign policy doctrine. “He is demolishing the European security order that had prevailed for almost half a century.”While Germany was last week still dragging its feet on excluding Russia from the Swift global payment system, by the weekend it had signed up to western sanctions against Russia’s central bank aimed at destabilising the financial system, in an escalation of economic warfare.For years the EU had tried to avoid sanctions that hurt ordinary Russians. Now the west is looking to wipe out their savings and cut them off from the rest of the world. Russians have become unwelcome. European airspace is all but closed to Russian planes. Russian football teams have been suspended from international fixtures and club competitions. The objective seems to be to make ordinary Russians understand the consequences of Putin’s war, rather than the “special military operation” in Donbas he still pretends it to be.The crisis has also brought the EU closer in ways that seemed unimaginable only a few months ago. EU capitals have co-ordinated their policy on harbouring Ukrainian refugees — a joint approach sorely missing during the 2015-16 migrant crisis. And even Hungary’s Viktor Orban, who has nurtured close ties with the Kremlin, has backed tough sanctions, saying it was time for the EU to show “strategic composure”. Meanwhile, post-Brexit Britain has resumed co-operation with the European Commission.Pierre Vimont, a senior fellow at Carnegie Europe, a think-tank, and a former EU diplomat who acted as Macron’s special envoy to the Kremlin, said that in the long term a new relationship with Russia “would have to be built on top of today’s crumbling security order”. “We can’t just hope that we can push Russia behind its borders and that the Russia issue will vanish.” But now was the time for Europe “to show its strength and to show it stands with Ukraine”, he said. “These are giant steps [for Europe]. I don’t think there is a way back.”
4  TotalEnergies has said it is reviewing how to manage its business in Russia but stopped short of announcing an exit despite pressure to follow rivals in cutting ties with the country.BP, Shell and Norway’s Equinor have said they will dump stakes in projects and sell out of Russian state-backed oil groups following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, in moves that have rippled across the industry.Total on Tuesday condemned “Russia’s military aggression” but unlike its peers did not pledge to divest. The French oil and gas major said it would not provide capital for new projects in Russia and was examining the impact of EU sanctions on its current Russian business.“TotalEnergies supports the scope and strength of the sanctions put in place by Europe and will implement them regardless of the consequences (currently being assessed) on its activities in Russia,” the company said.The group, which has a large exposure to Russia and operates liquefied natural gas plants that are largely turned towards Asian markets, is under mounting pressure from within France to take action.“I think that from now on there is a problem of principle to work with any political or economic figure close to Russian power,” French finance minister Bruno Le Maire told France Info radio when asked whether Total should leave the country.Total has invested heavily in two projects in the Yamal Peninsula in Russia’s frozen north alongside local partner Novatek. Total owns 19.4 per cent of the Russian company, which has been under US sanctions limiting its access to finance since 2014 when Russian president Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea.Novatek’s other main shareholders include the Volga group, the investment vehicle of Gennady Timchenko, who featured among businessmen on a list of individuals sanctioned by the EU over the invasion of Ukraine.Unlike BP, ExxonMobil and Shell, whose large Russian investments predated the annexation of Crimea and associated sanctions, Total has continued to expand its footprint in Russia since 2014.Novatek’s Yamal LNG project, in which Total owns a 20 per cent direct stake, began shipments in 2017. The French energy major in 2019 acquired a 10 per cent direct stake in a second Novatek project, the Arctic LNG 2 development in the Gydan Peninsula, which is expected to begin production in 2023 and ship 19.8mn tonnes of LNG a year.Russia last year delivered 16 per cent of Total’s global oil and gas production, according to investment bank Jefferies, and cash of $1.5bn.Le Maire said he would discuss the situation with Total’s chief executive Patrick Pouyanné.“He is acutely aware of the gravity of the situation and the problem it raises,” Le Maire said. “We will be able to take decisions together in the coming days.”Le Maire also said he would talk to the head of energy group Engie, which was one of the financial backers of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that has been frozen.Total said it was looking to provide fuel to help Ukrainian authorities and aid for Ukrainian refugees.
5  Foreign investors held $20bn of Russia’s dollar debt and rouble-denominated sovereign bonds worth $41bn at the end of 2021, according to data from the Russian central bank. Holdings of Russian equities amounted to $86bn, Moscow Exchange data show. But the exclusion of many Russian banks from the Swift payments network means foreign investors are now stuck, unclear how they can exit without falling foul of the new sanctions, and unable to find counterparties who are willing and able to buy. “Markets have priced an extremely conservative level across the board because, frankly, markets have just pulled back and said ‘we are going to wait and see what happens’,” said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, one of the biggest western holders of Russian sovereign debt according to data from Bloomberg. “There’s not a lot of actual trading going on. Nobody wants to be on the other side.” Over the weekend, western countries said they would bar some Russian banks from Swift, the messaging network that underpins global payments, while also blocking the central bank’s ability to access $630bn in foreign reserves. From Tuesday, the US will prohibit its financial institutions from buying new Russian government bonds. Most trading has stopped. The Russian central bank on Monday banned overseas institutions from selling local securities on the Moscow Exchange, and suspended trading in shares and derivatives on the bourse all day. Overseas stock exchanges meanwhile suspended trading in listings of Russia’s best-known companies. Deutsche Börse, Germany’s largest stock exchange operator, suspended trading in shares of 16 Russian companies, including Aeroflot, Rosneft, Sberbank, VTB and VEB Finance. Shares of Russian bank VTB were on Tuesday suspended on the London Stock Exchange, hitting traders’ ability to sell out of clients’ positions.The value of London-listed securities such as Sberbank, TCS and Gazprom plummeted on Monday, but many traders also voluntarily withdrew from making prices for fear of the repercussions — instead choosing to wait for more guidance from their compliance departments. Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange have temporarily halted trading in some groups with strong ties to Russia* as they search for more information on the impact of sanctions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.US regulations give the exchanges the power to suspend trading in shares and ensure that investors have full disclosure of any material information that may affect share prices. Among the companies Nasdaq halted include Nexters, Yandex and Ozon Holdings.One question for brokers and investors was whether their trading counterparts would be ejected from Swift. “I’m having to not trade Russia till I get a list,” said one trader at an investment bank.Some brokers were concerned that even if they managed to strike a deal, there was little guarantee it would be settled and the asset exchanged for cash. Most cross-border trades are settled in US dollars, and banks are responsible for managing the currency risk for such transactions. “It’s just so messy. If you trade something and you can’t settle it, you’re left with the exposure,” said a trader at a US broker.Those concerns were exacerbated by worries that payments for trades and coupons on bonds would be frozen in accounts at custodian banks or international securities depositories, where deals are settled and balances between central banks and commercial banks are updated. The two largest depositories, Belgium’s Euroclear and Clearstream, together hold about €50tn of assets in custody for global investors, making them a pillar of the financial system. Deals are usually finalised by transferring balances between customer accounts held at the depository, or between the two market utilities.Late on Monday, Clearstream said the rouble would no longer be an eligible settlement currency, with immediate effect.Euroclear said it would disable VTB, the main conduit between both customers of Euroclear and Clearstream, on Tuesday and cease rouble-denominated trades that take place outside Russia from March 3. It also said it could not accept incoming funds to its other correspondent bank, Dutch group ING. Correspondent banking entails one bank providing services to another, often in a separate country. Some brokers pinned their hopes on Euroclear finding a new regulatory-compliant bank in Russia. However, such a process can take time.“Setting up a new correspondent bank relationship can take months. It’s a very onerous process. Generally, you’re encouraged to do on-site visits for due diligence or explain why you haven’t,” said Virginie O’Shea, founder of Firebrand Research, a capital markets consultancy. Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, said Russia could counter the freezing of bank assets by introducing a moratorium on corporate debt repayments. On Monday, President Vladimir Putin barred Russians from moving foreign currency abroad, hindering banks’ foreign liability repayments.BlackRock believes it is possible that Russia could default on its bonds because of an inability to make payments to investors’ accounts. “It’s the difference between ability to pay and desire to pay,” said Rieder. *This story has been amended to clarify that the groups halted by US exchanges had ties to Russia.
6  A missile struck the centre of Kharkiv on Tuesday morning as a massive convoy of Russian military vehicles headed towards the capital Kyiv, suggesting Moscow was shifting to a more destructive phase of its invasion of Ukraine.Over the first five days of the assault, Ukrainian troops have managed to repulse successive waves of Russian ground attacks on urban areas. Footage on social media of blown-up bridges, drone strikes and charred tanks have fed hopes in Kyiv that Moscow’s military timetable was slipping behind schedule.Yet although western governments have applauded Ukrainian resistance, officials cautioned that the bloodiest phase of Russia’s offensive was still to come. Once its military has solved the logistical problems that have bogged down its advance, western officials fear Russia will unleash brutal firepower on Ukraine, with massive civilian casualties.Early signs of that came on Tuesday with a large explosion in the heart of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, which destroyed its local government headquarters and filled the adjacent Independence Square with rubble. Ukrainian officials blamed it on a Russian missile strike.That followed a heavy bombardment on Monday of residential areas of Kharkiv, where videos shared on social media showed the characteristic fin-tailed sections of cluster bombs protruding from the city’s streets.In a video statement, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky described the rocket attack on Kharkiv’s central square as “outright, undisguised terror”. “After this, Russia is a terrorist state,” he said. “No one will forgive. No one will forget.”Western officials also pointed to social media posts of TOS-1 heavy flame throwers positioned outside the besieged Black Sea city of Mariupol, which was under constant Russian rocket and air attacks, according to its mayor.“Russian forces have increased their use of artillery north of Kyiv and in vicinities of Kharkiv and Chernihiv,” the UK defence ministry said on Tuesday. “The use of heavy artillery in densely populated urban areas greatly increases the risk of civilian casualties.”On Tuesday, satellite imagery showed a 64km convoy of Russian trucks and military vehicles heading south towards Kyiv, within 45km of the capital. The convoy appeared to have more than doubled in length since it was first captured by satellite images on Monday.The movement of large numbers of Russian forces to Kyiv comes as western officials have warned that the city is close to being encircled. Russia has said it has kept open an access corridor.A pause in attacks on Kyiv on Monday “means that Russian forces are regrouping, reinforcing and increasing readiness,” said Rochan Consulting, a conflict analysis consultancy. “This of course is very concerning.”According to western military intelligence, Russia has moved between 50 and 75 per cent of the combat forces it had positioned along the Ukraine border — about 150,000 troops — but much of them have yet to see action. Russia has also not yet used its heavy artillery in the way the army has traditionally been trained to fight.“It’s challenging to predict what will happen next,” one official said. “But I have a high degree of confidence that [Russia] will fix those issues and when they do they’ll bring more of their firepower and resources into combat.It will [be]come clearer over the next 24-48 hours.”While Russia has struggled to make inroads into Kyiv and Kharkiv, Russia’s defence ministry said on Tuesday that it had succeeded in cutting off Ukraine’s access to the Sea of Azov.In statement to Russian state news agencies, the ministry said its troops, which had initially entered Ukraine from Russian-annexed Crimea to the west of the Sea of Azov, had managed to link up with Russian separatist areas to the east.“There have been some Russian successes,” said Henry Boyd, a military analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.But in other parts of the country it has been a different story.Special forces were pushed forward to capture airfields, such as Hostomel in Kyiv, but left unsupported so they had either to retire or face capture. Armoured convoys have chugged along, unprotected by air cover, vulnerable to attack.“Their convoys are travelling so closely spaced,” said Ben Hodges, former commander of US armed forces in Europe. “They have not been in tactical formation ready to fight and have been getting smoked by drones and artillery.”Observers cite three main reasons for Russia’s atypical attack, and why its tactics are likely to change.First, Moscow underestimated Ukrainians’ will to fight. “It is a common mistake to be arrogant about your enemy’s abilities,” Hodges said.Second, Moscow gambled on a quick victory, which would also allow it to keep “the war secret from the Russian public”, Michael Kofman, a senior research scientist at the CNA think-tank, said in a recent podcast. “It was based on terrible assumptions.”And third, Russian commanders probably overestimated the effective force of their own troops.Officials and analysts fear that addressing those failures will now lead to a grisly escalation of military tactics involving more force and more power.“Russia’s military did not play to its strengths at the start, so the obvious recourse is to fall back to a strategy that does work,” Boyd said. “It’s a scorched earth approach.”
7  Russian forces have launched a heavy bombardment of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, an assault that overshadowed the first direct talks between Ukrainian and Russian officials since President Vladimir Putin began his invasion six days ago.Residents of the city said they had come under intense artillery and rocket fire from Russian positions on Monday. Video footage shared on social media showed high-rise apartment blocks in Kharkiv being hit by heavy shelling that shrouded the sky with plumes of dark smoke.“Dozens of civilians are dying,” said regional governor Oleh Sinegubov. “It’s happening during the day when people go to pharmacies, for food, for drinking water. This is a crime.”Russia’s military operation has failed to unseat Ukraine’s government or capture any major cities, but has uprooted hundreds of thousands of civilians who have fled to neighbouring countries in search of safety.Satellite imagery released by Maxar Technologies on Monday showed that a Russian convoy heading towards Kyiv from the north had grown in length to several dozen kilometres.The war has cranked east-west tensions to new heights, with Putin putting the country’s nuclear deterrent on high alert and the west imposing swingeing sanctions on Moscow that sent the rouble into a tailspin and prompted Russia’s central bank to impose capital controls. A defiant Putin denounced the west as an “empire of lies”.On Tuesday, Australia became the latest US ally to commit military aid, promising $50mn for weapons and $25mn of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine as it dubbed Russia a “pariah state” over its invasion of the country. Scott Morrison, prime minister, said most of the military aid would be for equipment including missiles and ammunition. Morrison also reiterated his criticism of China for not participating in the sanctions programmes. “No one should have anything to do with them,” he said of Russia.The sanctions continued to impact companies around the world, with Mastercard blocking multiple financial institutions from its payment network. Walt Disney said it would pause the release of its films in Russian cinemas while WarnerMedia’s The Batman will not open in the country this week as planned.Western officials have warned that the number of civilian deaths from Russia’s invasion is likely to increase as a result of Moscow’s decision to deploy heavy artillery attacks on the cities of Kharkiv and Kyiv.“I am very concerned at what we are seeing today in the increased use of artillery, both rocket and tube artillery in Kyiv, in Kharkiv.that increase in artillery risks being far more indiscriminate,” said a western official on Monday. “As a consequence we are going to see an increase in civilian casualties.”Ukraine’s US ambassador told reporters on Monday that Russia had used a thermobaric bomb, which draws in oxygen to create an especially intense explosion — although this could not be independently verified. The chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court said he hoped to open an investigation “as rapidly as possible” into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Ukraine.As Russia faced increasing international isolation over its invasion, Emmanuel Macron, president of France, phoned Putin to demand he end the offensive, Macron’s office said.He urged the Russian leader to stop all strikes against civilians, preserve civilian infrastructure and provide safe access to key roads, especially south of Kyiv, Macron’s office added. The Elysée said Putin “confirmed his willingness to pursue these three points”.According to the Kremlin, Putin told Macron that a settlement was possible “only if Russia’s legitimate security interests are unconditionally taken into account”. That included recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea, the peninsula it annexed from Ukraine in 2014, and “demilitarising” and “de-Nazifying” the Ukrainian state.Ukrainian and Russian negotiators held talks on Monday near the Belarus border, but they failed to yield a breakthrough.Mykhailo Podolyak, an aide to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, who took part in the negotiations, said the delegations would return to their respective capitals for consultations. “The talks are difficult.The Russians unfortunately still have an extremely biased view of the destructive processes they have unleashed,” he said.Vladimir Medinsky, the head of Russia’s delegation, said: “The most important thing is that we agreed to continue negotiating.”While Russia has made some military gains in southern Ukraine, the pace of its advance has slowed and it is yet to take any big Ukrainian population centres, with the capital, Kyiv, still under government control.A senior US defence official said 75 per cent of the Russian combat forces that had amassed on the border had moved into Ukraine. Russian soldiers had advanced roughly 5km towards Kyiv since Sunday and were now within 25km of the centre of the capital, the official added.“We expect that they’re going to want to continue to move forward and try and circle the city in coming days,” the official said.John Kirby, Pentagon spokesperson, said on Monday that the Pentagon was aware of the convoy of forces and equipment moving towards Kyiv but did not have a sense of its timeline.“Clearly, we continue to see Russian forces. try to move closer so they can move on Kyiv from the ground,” Kirby said.Kirby also said that while Russia had suffered setbacks that it had not envisioned, it was “too soon for us to have some sort of sweeping conclusions” about the strength of Russian forces.In southern Ukraine, Russian attempts to cut Ukraine off from the Black Sea appeared to be having more success. Its forces have captured the towns of Berdyansk, on the Sea of Azov, and Enerhodar, according to a Russian defence ministry statement.Reports suggested that the port of Mariupol, the last big stronghold of Ukrainian resistance that has stopped Russia from connecting the eastern border region of Donbas to Crimea, was surrounded.Russian and Ukrainian military claims cannot be independently verified.But the bombardment of Kharkiv appeared to be particularly intense. Sinegubov, the regional governor, said Russia had used “weapons prohibited by all international conventions — in particular, cluster bombs” and targeted residential areas. “There was no military infrastructure here,” he said. “There is no excuse for this crime.”One doctor working at a Kharkiv hospital said it had admitted at least 17 people injured by shelling, and that a 17-year-old girl had been killed after being hit in the chest.“This is a Russian-speaking region of Ukraine,” the doctor said. “All this situation feels like an illusion. It feels like we are dreaming.”Russia’s armed forces denied claims that they had encircled the capital and said civilians could safely leave on the highway to the town of Vasylkiv, the scene of heavy weekend fighting.
8  The most alarming portent is the rouble’s freefall after western leaders proposed much tougher sanctions. They plan to freeze assets of the Russian central bank, prohibit dealings with it and expel some Russian banks from the Swift international payments network.The shock via Russia’s estimated $630bn of foreign exchange reserves is reduced by its shift into assets the west cannot touch and relatively low government debt levels. Even so, the sanctions package is a declaration of financial war.The central bank doubled interest rates to 20 per cent to protect the rouble. But the currency was down nearly a fifth to 104 against the US dollar. Russians were lining up at ATMs from Sunday. Liquidity evaporated in a blink. The stock market did not open. Rouble-denominated bonds did not trade. Dollar eurobonds halved. The cost of swaps to insure against a Russian default spiralled to 37 per cent of bonds’ face value.The world financial system is fragile. The pandemic is not over yet and government balance sheets are laden with debt. There is scope for the Russian financial crisis to amplify other shocks — surging emerging market food prices, for example. Financial crises overlapped in Russia and Asia in the late 1990s. Victims included US hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management.War and sanctions will dent domestic economic growth and inflate prices, exported to the wider world via hard currency-denominated oil and gas. For sure, exposures this time around are mostly less pronounced. Russia has faded in importance as an investible market, accounting for less than 4 per cent of MSCI’s emerging markets equity index. But there will be plenty of pockets of financial pain, from businesses leasing aircraft to Aeroflot to swanky British boarding schools with Russian pupils. Bond coupon payments will be disrupted. There is a heightened danger of cyber attacks of the kind suffered by Toyota.The subtlest threat is of dislocations we cannot foresee: Lehman moments when panic spreads and markets seize up. Small or middling setbacks for businesses then become existential threats. The war means this threat is greater now than it has been since the early days of the pandemic.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

9  Days after approving $350mn in military aid for Ukraine, US president Joe Biden sent a message of support to another vulnerable country by dispatching a high-level delegation of former American officials to Taiwan.Michael Mullen, former chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, flew to Taipei on Tuesday to reassure Taiwan — and remind China — that the US’s commitment to the island was strong despite its focus on Ukraine.The delegation included Michèle Flournoy, a former top Pentagon official, Evan Medeiros, a former White House Asia adviser to Barack Obama, and Mike Green, who held the same position for George W Bush. One US official said the high-level bipartisan delegation showed the US commitment to Taiwan was “rock solid”.The visit comes as some experts worry that the US attention on Ukraine will dilute its focus on China — a bigger long-term challenge — and Beijing could increase pressure on Taiwan while Washington is preoccupied.One person familiar with the debate inside the Biden administration said the president was crafting Ukraine policy independently of the ramifications for China and Taiwan, but stressed that he was paying attention to Beijing.“The driving force and motivation is about Russia and Ukraine. That’s the lens through which the president is thinking about it,” said the person. “But we’re watching very closely how China is.reacting.”A Pentagon spokesperson said the US had not changed its posture in the Pacific to send a warning to China.Elbridge Colby, a former Pentagon official, said the move to send such a high-profile delegation underscored that the US military faced a “two-front” problem with Russia and China but stressed it should prioritise Beijing.“The military threat to Taiwan is very real,” he said. “There are things we can and should do to help Ukraine.but Europe must take a back seat to ensuring our military position in Asia.”Some experts worry that China might conclude from the US decision not to send troops to Ukraine — which is neither a Nato member nor an American ally — that it would not defend Taiwan.But the person familiar with discussions inside the administration said it was an “intellectually lazy” comparison. For instance, the Taiwan Relations Act requires the US to provide Taiwan with assistance to help defend itself.Biden has continued the policy of “strategic ambiguity”, under which the US does not say if it would defend Taiwan and is partly designed to give China pause about military action.Kurt Campbell, the White House top Asia official, suggested at an event for the German Marshall Fund think-tank that there was no change to the policy, despite calls to the contrary from some in the region, such as former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe recently.Experts say China is analysing the Ukraine conflict to see what lessons can be applied to Taiwan. Bonnie Glaser, a China expert at the German Marshall Fund, said Mullen and the delegation would probably impress upon Taiwan’s leaders that they needed to become more serious about boosting defences and implementing reforms.US officials have long argued that Taiwan should counter Chinese aggression with an asymmetric strategy that exploits Beijing’s weaknesses rather than trying to match its strengths. Instead of acquiring expensive weapons such as fighter jets, which the Chinese military would probably seek to destroy at the outset of an assault on Taiwan, the country should equip itself with large numbers of small, comparatively cheap and mobile pieces of equipment, such as shoulder-launched missiles and sea mines, according to US military experts.While some may interpret the Ukraine situation as meaning that the US would not defend Taiwan, the war has also produced uncomfortable truths for Beijing. “They have been concerned by some of the solidarity that everyone has witnessed in the aftermath of the invasion,” said Campbell.Whatever lessons China takes, the attention the US is giving the Ukraine war has prompted concerns that the situation will unwind the renewed “pivot” to Asia that Biden had been implementing.Sheena Greitens, a China expert at the University of Texas at Austin, said a longstanding worry was that the rhetoric was not matched by resources. “The running joke is that the Indo-Pacific is named the priority theatre and then Central Command [which oversees US military operations in the Middle East] gets all the resources,” she said, adding that Ukraine raised new questions about how many resources European Command would now receive.But Eric Sayers, an Asia expert at the American Enterprise Institute think-tank, said the war would “sharpen” the US focus on Taiwan and accelerate policies to ensure China did not conclude it could win a quick, costless war.“In many ways, the multilateral sanctions and export control package coming together to respond to Moscow is also a playbook to be deployed during a future crisis over Taiwan,” Sayers added. “Beijing should take note of the co-ordination and sophistication of this global response to naked aggression against a sovereign people.”At the same time, Oriana Skylar Mastro, a China expert at Stanford University, said the US needed more “strategic discipline”.“China will see this as another strategic window of opportunity,” she said. “The colonial empire was a drain on the British and this is a drain on the US. We have to choose our battles and Ukraine is not one of them.”
10  Good morning. A lot of people were wrong about the risk of a full-scale Russian invasion. We at Unhedged were — implicitly if not explicitly — guilty of this too. Some reflections on why this mistake was so common follow. Also, how war raises the stakes in the crypto debate.In late January I wrote a piece called “Bargain Hunting in Russia”, a phrase that, a month later, I do not enjoy typing. The article pointed out that a combination of high energy prices and tensions on the border with Ukraine made Russian stocks look very cheap. The piece concluded as follows:This statement is hedged twice, first by saying that on the most relevant risk I had no idea what I was talking about, and second by deploying the journalist’s loyal friend, a conditional. But all the same, the piece looks awful in retrospect. Conditionals aside, the piece did not take the risk side of the ledger remotely seriously enough.How much of an idiot I am is not, in itself, an interesting topic. What is interesting is whether there are lessons to be learned from the widespread credulity about a certain account of what was happening on the border of Ukraine, and whether those lessons might have broader application. After all, a lot of global investors owned Russian equities and bonds last week. The country’s fiscal and current account surpluses made the bonds attractive, and exposure to inflation-hedging commodities did the same for the equities.My piece characterised the case for Russian equities as follows:Argument one overestimated Vladimir Putin’s concern with domestic support and geostrategic interests as conventionally defined. The failure of argument two followed directly. Once Putin chose outright war, scepticism about the power of sanctions was falsified. Russia’s foreign currency reserves were effectively destroyed by sanctions on the central bank, and its broader banking system is on its knees already.The first point to make here — by way of clarification, not mitigation — is that very surprising things do happen. If someone says, “I’m 95 per cent sure that X” and then not-X occurs, the probability estimate may still have been correct. The only way to assess this, as the psychologist Philip Tetlock points out, is to see if a given person’s probability estimates come in about right over time — that is, for example, the things that they say have a 75 per cent chance of happening, come to pass roughly 75 per cent of the time.But that doesn’t let me or anyone else off the hook for doubting that an outright invasion was going to take place. I think part of my problem, and a lot of other people’s, was which experts we talked to. All the people I spoke to were strategists and portfolio managers who have been following Russia and Russian stocks for a long time. But when thinking about risk, it is dangerous to depend only on these sorts of insiders. Here is what one investor, who lives in Russia, said to me:Tetlock likes to recall how seasoned CIA experts on Germany had no clue that the Berlin Wall was about to fall. It was only the newbie analysts who noticed something was amiss. Lesson: when doing a hard risk assessment, include both seasoned pros and people who bring fresh perspectives and don’t make the standard assumptions.In recent days a lot of foreign policy types have been talking about how Putin has changed and become more irrational — that he is “not the Putin we knew”. It may be that Putin is more risk-seeking now. But attributing this to mental illness, Covid isolation or age is also a way for people who have been surprised to reduce their own cognitive dissonance. As Tetlock put it to me in an email, this line allows surprised experts to say “well, he would have done what I expected if he weren’t suffering from xx”.There is another problem here, too, I think. Once we assign an outcome a low probability, we often stop thinking hard about the consequences of that outcome. In this case one of the strategists I talked to said that “it’s hard for something worse to happen than what is already priced in” — a familiar refrain when beat-up assets are pitched. Well, it’s starting to look like, from the point of view of foreign investors, many Russian assets may be worth little or nothing, if bonds default and dividends are blocked. Even if you “punted” on high-risk, high-return Russian assets with a tiny percentage of your portfolio, a wipeout hurts. Did I think enough about that?A final thought. What has happened this week has made me wonder anew about uninvestable risk. Are there risks that are simply too complex to be analysed with the degree of precision investment requires? Should we have known in advance that military conflict in eastern Europe was one of them? Are there other, analogous uninvestable risks in the world at present? Warren Buffett has a “too hard” tray on his desk, alongside the usual “in” and “out” baskets, where these risks go. I would be curious to hear what readers currently put in that category.Bitcoin’s price went gangbusters on Monday, putting on $3,000 in a matter of hours. But ignore that. The more interesting news was a rise in rouble-denominated bitcoin buyers, as the currency continued to crater. Longtime bitcoiners were triumphant. Here’s one:Western sanctions are prompting a devastating slide in the rouble and new capital controls, so a greater-than-usual number of people are using bitcoin as an escape hatch. Like in Turkey earlier this year, crypto’s volatility is less scary when the official currency has lost half its value. This seems like bitcoin working as intended.As we noted last week, a “freedom money” vision of bitcoin is gaining force, promising to sidestep state control. Ukraine is raising millions in crowdfunded bitcoin (among other tokens). The Canadian trucker protesters rallied to it after Ottawa imposed sanctions on crypto wallets under its emergency law. US and UK conservatives are flogging it.But even for the freedom fighters in Ukraine, freedom money is a double-edged sword. Here’s the country’s digital minister on Sunday:You can see the bind here: trying to invite money into Ukraine without letting it flee Russia. Such discrimination is something the traditional financial system is better equipped to do, as sanctions are demonstrating.But crypto is meant to let money flow freely. The absence of state control is not always bad, but presents hard trade-offs. Is throwing dissidents a financial buoy worth a leakier sanctions regime against Russia? There is a nasty political fight brewing over crypto. (Ethan Wu)An excellent Politico interview with Fiona Hill, on the topic of Putin’s ambitions.
11  In just one week, Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine has brought about so many policy shifts in Europe that it’s hard to keep track. Kyiv’s application to join the EU was met with encouraging signals from multiple capitals. Still, President Volodymyr Zelensky’s call for a fast-track membership may be the one Rubicon the bloc is unlikely to cross any time soon — and we’ll run you through the reasons why.Other milestones were passed yesterday when Switzerland joined the EU in adopting far-reaching sanctions against the Kremlin and Turkey’s president made his strongest show of support for Ukraine yet.The situation in Ukraine remains dire, with an onslaught on the eastern city of Kharkiv causing many civilian casualties. Over 500,000 Ukrainians have fled to safety in neighbouring countries. A first round of talks yesterday between Ukrainian and Russian envoys, as well as another Paris-Moscow call have not led to any breakthroughs.In slightly more uplifting news, energy ministers gathered in Brussels yesterday pledged to link up Ukraine’s electricity grid to the EU’s within weeks. And with elections looming in Hungary, we look at how statements from Budapest on the delivery of weapons to Ukraine have inflamed the opposition. This article is an on-site version of our Europe Express newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every weekday morningVolodymyr Zelensky has proved to have exceptional powers of persuasion when dealing with EU leaders in recent days, write Sam Fleming and Valentina Pop in Brussels.The looming decision by the EU and G7 partners to eject a number of Russian banks from the Swift messaging network owes much to his public demands for tougher action against Vladimir Putin’s regime, for example. (Last night the EU and US were still tussling over the exact banks that will be affected.) Another example is Zelensky’s increasingly prominent campaign for Ukraine to become an EU member. Yesterday, flanked by the prime minister and speaker of the parliament, the president submitted an application to the EU. The proposal has been widely welcomed in the EU, where governments are anxious to offer Ukraine all the support and encouragement they can muster as its weathers Russia’s brutal invasion. Now that the application has been submitted, it will need to be assessed “very rapidly” by the council, with a decision on whether to request an urgent opinion from the European Commission, said one EU official. It will then fall to the commission to assess Ukraine as a possible candidate — a process that can take upwards of 18 months but which can be accelerated. The governments of the Baltic states, as well as a number of other countries including Greece, signalled support for the move and so did Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, who told Euronews that “we want them in the European Union”. The European Parliament, in a resolution expected to be adopted today, also supports Ukraine’s bid for “candidate status”, while seeking further integration for the country into the single market along the lines of the EU’s existing association agreement with Ukraine. The Latvian defence minister, Artis Pabriks, in an op-ed published in the Financial Times, is also urging action on fellow EU members. “Ukraine needs more than weapons and hope. It needs membership of the EU and Nato. It would be a disgrace if we did not meet the request for EU accession made by President Volodymyr Zelensky,” he said. The reality is, however, that joining the EU remains a far-off prospect. Officials in Brussels warn that such a process — if ever started — would take years. And if Ukraine’s application were to be fast-tracked, the risk is that countries in the western Balkans that have been waiting for decades would feel sidelined. While the messages of support are warranted, “some people are getting carried away” and signalling things that the EU will be unable to deliver in a rapid manner, said one EU official familiar with enlargement discussions. Being granted EU candidate status is something that Ukraine has sought before, culminating with the 2013 Euromaidan protests (which were about the government reneging on an association agreement with the bloc). The pro-Russian president was ousted, after which Russia launched its attacks in 2014. Back then, several member states, notably the Netherlands and Germany, were adamant that membership was off the table. Any membership decision has to be taken unanimously by the 27 member states after a years-long process of adopting the so-called EU acquis communautaire, the body of common law, and changing state structures, including the judiciary, to match EU standards. For its part, the commission dismissed any idea that von der Leyen’s “one of us” remark meant that Ukraine can avoid going through the hoops that countries wanting to join the EU face. “There is a process when it comes to accession negotiations,” said chief spokesperson Eric Mamer. Russia’s central bank more than doubled interest rates yesterday in an attempt to steady the country’s financial markets, after unprecedented western sanctions sent the rouble tumbling as much as 29 per cent. Some investors said they saw a possibility that Russia could default on its debt, which has become extremely hard to trade. (More here)The EU intends to connect Ukraine’s electricity grid to its own within weeks to ensure security of supply in the embattled country, despite the risk of causing blackouts elsewhere in Europe, write Andy Bounds in Brussels and Eleni Varvitsioti in Athens.Once the networks are synchronised, a shortage of power in Ukraine, through the loss of a power station for example, would have knock-on effects in neighbouring states. But officials yesterday seemed willing to take on that risk.“We have to help Ukraine. We have to take the risk,” said Barbara Pompili, the French minister for ecological transition who chaired an emergency council of EU energy ministers yesterday. “We have to weigh up the risks but also the need to connect Ukraine because they are at risk of blackout.” The technical work could take several weeks, said Kadri Simson, the EU energy commissioner. Moldova would also be connected, she added. Ukraine decoupled its grid from Russia’s on February 24 and, as an isolated system, it is vulnerable to outages.A €53.4mn agreement to plug it into the EU grid was signed in 2017 and the move was originally expected next year. Simson said that gas — which typically flows from Russia via Ukraine to the EU — is also now going the other way. EU countries have also provided diesel, jet fuel, petrol and crude oil as requested by Kyiv.Ministers discussed ways to reduce reliance on Russia, which supplies around 40 per cent of EU gas demand. So far it is fulfilling its contracts despite sanctions after the Ukraine invasion.The bloc “can get through this winter safely”, said Simson, thanks to record imports of liquefied natural gas.Even if Russia cuts off the gas the EU could probably cope next winter too, Bruegel, the Brussels-based think-tank, found. It would require a 10-15 per cent cut in gas use, as long as imports from north Africa, Norway and Azerbaijan remain at current high levels and there were record LNG imports. The weather is the biggest variable, with demand changing by up to 30 per cent depending on how cold it is.Ministers also demanded the commission come up with more radical proposals to cut high prices for domestic consumers, after a 170 per cent rise in gas costs in 2021. Its suggestions last October were insufficient, they said.However, their own ideas have not gained traction. Spain continues to lobby for the suspension of a pricing system that links the cost of electricity to that of gas, however it is generated, but remains in a minority.Greece, backed by Romania and Bulgaria, tabled a plan to use low interest, long-term loans to fund subsidies for consumers, to little enthusiasm.Hungary has said it will not allow the transfer of weapons to Ukraine from its territory, a decision which does not affect actual deliveries but is significant in the view of forthcoming elections next month, writes Marton Dunai in Budapest.The Hungarian foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, together with all his EU counterparts on Sunday agreed to use EU funds for the first time ever to deliver weapons to Ukraine. But yesterday, he took to Facebook to make the following statement:“Today, we have made another decision not to allow the transfer of lethal weapons in Hungary as these shipments could easily be targeted by military attacks,” Szijjártó wrote. “Hungarians do not want this war. We want peace in the neighbourhood and in the region.” The shipments can still go ahead via Poland, which on Sunday offered to be a logistics hub for the operation. Hungary has consistently taken a contradictory line on Russia, given prime minister Viktor Orban’s cordial ties with Putin and rather frosty links with Ukraine. On the one hand, he has denounced the war and backed the EU’s sanctions regime against Russia. On the other, he has so far refused to deliver weapons to Ukraine and said he did not need extra Nato troops to be deployed on Hungarian territory.With elections coming up next month and polls suggesting a tight race, Orban in a televised interview on Sunday sought to shake off criticism from the opposition, calling him out on cozying up to Putin. The opposition has said it would send weapons to Ukraine, to which Orban replied that such a step would be hasty, risky and unnecessary.He added that he would fight against sanctions in the field of energy:“The issue of Paks 2 [Hungary’s finance-and-build agreement with Russia for a nuclear power plant] and energy must be left out of sanctions, or else we will pay the price for them.”G7 finance ministers discuss implementation of sanctions against Russia, including the suspension of some Russian banks from SwiftEuropean Parliament holds an emergency session to show support for UkraineThe unthinkable might start to become thinkableNato enlargement: A majority of Finns are in favour of joining Nato for the first time in the Nordic country’s history — another sign that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is pushing the once neutral state and its neighbour Sweden towards the military alliance.Oligarch ban: The EU has frozen the assets and imposed a travel ban on some of Russia’s most prominent oligarchs, as well as senior figures in the government, in the latest widening of its sanctions regime.

In practice, the policy means cutting ever more massive cheques to its founder Stephen Schwarzman.Schwarzman made over $1bn last year, DD’s Antoine Gara reports, a record haul for the buyout billionaire as Blackstone’s soaring profits enabled the group to boost its dividend 80 per cent.The Blackstone chief executive received over $940mn in dividends and about $150mn in “carried interest” compensation — the entitlement to a share of the profits on successful investments.Two other Blackstone executives earned nine-figure paydays: the firm’s billionaire president Jonathan Gray and recently-retired vice-chair Hamilton James. Both received hauls of at least $160mn.This income dwarfs the money that investment banking chieftains like JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs’ David Solomon took home last year. Schwarzman raked in about 20 times that of Dimon’s earnings, underscoring how private equity dealmakers stand to make far more than bankers and traders.Schwarzman, who likes to call Blackstone the “reference entity” in the buyout industry on shareholder calls, delivers on his bravado when it’s time to tabulate what he makes at year-end.KKR’s Henry Kravis and George Roberts took home more than $100mn in 2021 — less than a tenth of what Schwarzman received. This is partly because KKR pays out a far lower percentage of its profits in dividends, preferring instead to reinvest its profits.Kravis and Roberts both received about $67mn in carried interest and more than $40mn in dividends. It’s good money, but nowhere near the cash bestowed upon Blackstone dealmakers.If getting rich is the primary objective of Wall Street, Schwarzman’s methods are working best.The volatility plaguing markets recently hasn’t deterred Canada’s TD Bank Group from sealing a deal. The bank made its largest acquisition on Monday, agreeing to buy Tennessee-based First Horizon for $13.4bn and securing its position as the sixth-largest lender in the US.TD has been on a shopping spree for nearly two decades, buoyed by strict rules on large US rivals that have made it easier for lenders north of the border to act as consolidators of the fragmented American banking industry. It bought Maine-based Banknorth in 2004, Hudson United for $1.9bn in 2005 and Commerce Bancorp for $8.9bn just ahead of the financial crisis.The acquisition of First Horizon will boost TD’s presence in the US south, enabling it to better compete with others that have trodden a similar path.

13  A British energy group that had been poised to sell gas from one of the newest fields in the UK North Sea to a subsidiary of Russia’s Gazprom has said it will end the arrangement “with immediate effect”.The Financial Times reported on Tuesday morning that UK gas producer IOG was preparing to sell its share of production from the Elgood gasfield in the southern North Sea to the UK-based trading and marketing arm of the Russian state-owned group.Elgood, in which IOG has a 50 per cent holding, is due to commence production in the next fortnight.However, London-listed IOG said late on Tuesday that it had served notice to Gazprom Marketing & Trading (GM&T) and its “thoughts are with everyone affected by the shocking, unprovoked invasion of Ukraine”.Centrica, Britain’s biggest energy supplier, on Tuesday also said it would seek to withdraw from an existing supply contract with GM&T, which has offices in London and Manchester as well as internationally.IOG’s chief executive Andrew Hockey added that his company had experienced “strong interest” in the rights to buy its gas during a competitive process last year “and would expect to sell the gas to a highly credible alternative buyer”.The UK company already has a separate sales agreement with BP’s gas marketing arm for its share of production of another new field, Blythe, which is shortly due to commence production.IOG said a day earlier that if GM&T became “subject to [UK] sanctions [against Russia], IOG would not sell the gas designated under its existing standard gas sales contract with GM&T”.The sales agreement was announced in July last year but UK companies are under intensifying pressure to sever their ties with Russian state-backed entities. UK business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said this week there was a “strong moral imperative on British companies to isolate Russia”. BP, Shell and Norway’s Equinor have also this week said they would cut ties with their respective Russian partners.Centrica chief executive Chris O’Shea said on Tuesday his company intended to exit its gas supply agreements with Russian counterparts, principally Gazprom, “as a matter of urgency” and was “working through the details of how best to do this”.GM&T has been active in the UK gas market for more than 20 years. It is principally a trader of energy products including natural gas and power but also has its own retail arm, which is one of the largest suppliers to UK industrial sites and businesses.The Elgood field is part of a new North Sea development known as Saturn Banks. IOG estimates gas reserves in its share of the project at about 14bn cubic feet. While each individual field in the scheme is relatively modest in size, analysts said they collectively represented a sizeable resource for the 50-year-old UK oil and gas producing region, which is in long-term decline.IOG’s agreement with Gazprom, reached after a competitive bidding process involving more than 10 traders, also covered the company’s share of production from several other fields in the Saturn Banks scheme, which are at a later stage of development.GM&T did not respond to requests for comment by the Financial Times on Monday.According to its latest strategic report, the company paid a £179mn dividend to its immediate parent company, Gazprom Germania, in 2020 after generating a profit that year of £236mn. Its ultimate parent is PAO Gazprom in Russia.This article has been amended since first publication to make clear that IOG estimates that its share of the Elgood field gas reserves is about 14bn cubic feet
14  Global growth in dividends is forecast to slow sharply this year with the prospects for big increases dimming even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine further clouded the outlook.After a bumper set of payouts delivered a full recovery from the worst of the Covid-19 crisis in 2021, this year was set for only modest growth even before the war broke out. Now, analysts warn of a knock to confidence and potential consequences from inflationary input prices and economic sanctions.While total corporate payouts rose almost 17 per cent in 2021, dividend increases in 2022 were expected to be limited to 3 per cent before Russia’s attack on Ukraine, according to the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index, a widely-followed report on payouts. Now this forecast may have to be trimmed further.“The impact of the crisis will vary according to the sector and company with some being more impacted than others by sanctions and rising input prices,” said Jane Shoemake, client portfolio manager, global equity income at Janus Henderson.She added that it would take time to gauge the economic fallout from the conflict, but that “the contribution from Russian banks and oil companies is likely to be severely impacted”. Global dividends hit a record $1.47tn last year, staging a full recovery from the sharp cuts to payouts during the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the Janus Henderson report.Total corporate payouts to shareholders rebounded in 2021 from the depressed levels recorded the year before, when many companies held on to their cash to weather the initial economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the report.The rebound brought relief to income-dependent investors — including retirees, pension plans and charities — who had suffered from the cuts. However, the recovery was heavily dependent on a handful of sectors, notably mining firms, who benefited from exceptional boosts in commodities prices.“A large part of the 2021 dividend recovery came from a narrow range of companies and sectors in a few parts of the world,” said Shoemake.Andrew Bell, chief executive of the Witan Investment Trust, said the pace of the recovery in 2022 would depend on “the degree to which the current Russian invasion of Ukraine weighs — via energy prices and general confidence issues — on economic growth in 2022, and for how long”.One-off special dividends, particularly from mining firms, played an unusually large role in 2021’s rebound. Companies such as Rio Tinto, which were big winners from the rebound in economic growth from the pandemic, delivered handsome rewards to shareholders. Rio investors are set to receive a total of $16.8bn (£12.3bn) in the 2021 financial year, the second-biggest payout in the history of the FTSE 100.Mining companies paid double their previous record level of dividends, set in 2019. Miners, along with banks, delivered three-fifths of the increase to payouts last year.“For the banks, this was about restoring payouts to more normal levels given that regulators had curbed distributions in many parts of the world in 2020,” Janus Henderson said.Those payments contributed to a particularly strong annual rebound for the UK last year, with total dividends up by 44 per cent from the year before. However, the UK recovery came from a base of particularly severe cuts during 2020, leaving payouts still lagging behind pre-pandemic levels.“Having underperformed other equity markets in recent years, the UK equity market looks very attractively valued on both an earnings and dividend yield basis,” said Shoemake.British funds group Link, which compiles data on UK dividends, expects payouts to decline again in 2022, meaning a return to pre-pandemic levels is a long way off. “The recovery in UK dividends is not complete, but the easiest part of the catch up is now behind us,” said Ian Stokes, managing director, corporate markets UK and Europe at Link.North American markets saw slower growth, in part because US companies were more resilient to cut in 2020. Healthcare firms were among the largest payers in US markets, alongside banks and tech groups.
15  An increasingly isolated Vladimir Putin left Russia for only the second time during the pandemic last December. His destination was New Delhi and his focus was on preparing for future conflicts.Moscow works with New Delhi in the “military and technical sphere like with no other country”, the Russian president told Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, calling India “a time-tested friend” as the leaders signed a new 10-year defence co-operation agreement.The friendship would be challenged just eight weeks later when Russian troops stormed Ukraine, sending India rushing to rescue more than 15,000 nationals, mostly students studying in the country.While western nations condemned Russia’s aggression, New Delhi’s loyalty to its longstanding partner held firm. India, as a temporary UN Security Council member, abstained from voting on a resolution to condemn Russia’s invasion last week, along with China and the United Arab Emirates.Analysts say India believes there is little benefit in alienating Russia, on which it depends for crucial commodities such as energy and fertiliser, with neighbouring China as a much greater strategic threat. Russia’s support is seen as vital to managing India’s unresolved confrontation with China on its northern Himalayan border after deadly fighting in 2020.“Here in Delhi, Russia has always been [seen as] a dangerous tactical distraction for the west,” said Constantino Xavier, a fellow at the Centre for Social and Economic Progress think-tank in New Delhi. “From India’s perspective, the only actor that will come out stronger [from the war in Ukraine] is China.”Although Modi appealed to Putin “for an immediate cessation of violence” in a phone call on the first day of the war, Indian officials have steered clear of blaming the Russian president. Instead, New Delhi has stayed in touch with both Moscow and Kyiv as it prioritised evacuation operations for its citizens on Ukraine’s western borders.India’s partnership with Russia goes back to the early days of independence after 1947, when Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru drew inspiration for parts of his socialist economy from the Soviet Union.Though India was “non-aligned” during the cold war, the country grew close to the Soviets as the US drifted towards its nemesis Pakistan. Crucially, the Soviet Union is credited as having helped India win its 1971 war with Pakistan over Bangladesh.India’s ties with the US and Europe have strengthened since the cold war ended. New Delhi — a member of the Quad security partnership with the US, Japan and Australia — is seen as an indispensable western ally and counterweight to China in Asia.Yet hemmed in by foes on its northern borders, India’s geographical position means it is loath to rely on distant western support.“China on one side and Pakistan on the other, both nuclear enabled,” Uday Kotak, managing director of Kotak Mahindra Bank and one of India’s richest men, said in a tweet. He added that given “our dependence on Russian military equipment, and [that the] US is far away, we have challenges”.“India watches the Russia-China relationship very closely,” said Tanvi Madan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think-tank. “What they’ve seen for years is the relationship getting closer and closer. They haven’t wanted to push Putin further into Chinese arms.”She argued that Modi’s unwillingness to criticise Putin is well understood domestically. “Any other Indian government would likely have done the same thing,” she said.Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has also refrained from condemning Russia.Moscow has remained India’s most important military supplier. Russian tanks, aircraft and other heavy weaponry are deployed at India’s Himalayan border, and the countries are collaborating to produce arms in India, too.About 65 per cent of arms transferred to India between 1950 and 2020 were from the Soviet Union or Russia, an estimated $83.4bn of a total $126.7bn, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.As Putin arrived in India in December, so did deliveries of S-400 Russian-built missile defence systems, part of a $5.4bn deal signed two years earlier in defiance of Washington.Observers say Moscow needs its allies, such as India and China, to help alleviate the crushing pressure of western financial sanctions.Although bilateral trade was worth only about $8bn last financial year, Indian businesses with Russian links have been lobbying the government to let them keep trading with their counterparts, a person familiar with the matter said. The finance ministry declined to comment.While India trades with Russia in dollars, “there’s a talk of going back to rupee-rouble trade which used to be the norm”, said Biswajit Dhar, a Jawaharlal Nehru University professor specialising in trade, referring to the period from the 1970s to the 1990s.Two Indian government-linked finance companies in Russia — Commercial Indo Bank, 60 per cent owned by the State Bank of India, and reinsurer GIC Perestrakhovanie LLC, fully owned by India’s General Insurance Corporation — are working to strengthen bilateral banking.India’s government has not told Indian lenders what to do about Russian banks that have been targeted by western sanctions. But India has previously been willing to ignore western sanctions, creating a payment mechanism for Iranian imports.Dhar said India would prioritise its trading relationship with Russia. “All these avenues will be explored, anything that can help continuation of trade ties. Everything is going to be used,” he said.
16  Russia’s central bank more than doubled interest rates on Monday in an attempt to steady the country’s financial markets, after unprecedented western sanctions sent the rouble tumbling as much as 29 per cent.The central bank boosted its main interest rate to 20 per cent from 9.5 per cent in an emergency decision, saying that “external conditions for the Russian economy have drastically changed”.The rouble dropped to almost 118 against the US dollar in offshore trading on Monday, according to Bloomberg data, after Russian president Vladimir Putin put his nuclear forces on high alert and the US, Europe and UK unleashed sanctions aimed at cutting the country off from the global financial system.The exchange rate later recovered to around 105 in what market participants described as deeply strained trading conditions that made it difficult for foreigners to sell.Russia’s biggest foreign bond, $7bn in debt maturing in 2047, lost more than half of its value on Monday to reach around 30 cents on the dollar, according to Tradeweb data. Some investors said they saw a possibility that Russia could default on its debt, which has become extremely hard to trade. “If you see a quote on the screen it might be live or it might not,” said one. “There’s nothing certain in this environment. It’s not about fundamentals any more, it’s about compliance issues.”Trading in shares and derivatives on the Moscow Exchange was suspended, Russia’s central bank confirmed on Monday. However Russia-focused shares traded on other markets around the world dropped heavily.Global depositary receipts of Russian companies traded in London, such as Sberbank, Lukoil and VTB, remained open. Sberbank, whose European subsidiaries the European Central Bank warned were “failing”, plummeted more than 70 per cent, as did TCS Group, which owns Tinkoff.Moscow is being pushed further to the fringes of world markets. Norway said on Sunday that its $1.3tn oil fund, the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund, would freeze its investments in Russian assets and begin divesting from the country. BP, the UK energy group, also said it would divest the 20 per cent stake in Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft it had held since 2013, and other big western companies ended Russian partnerships.The rouble had already been hit hard in the previous week, sliding to record lows following the invasion and the imposition of sanctions by the US and Europe. On Monday, governor Elvira Nabiullina said Russia’s central bank had spent $1bn defending the rouble last Thursday, and a “small amount” on Friday.But the US and its allies ratcheted up punitive measures on Saturday, taking aim at Russia’s central bank to prevent it from using international reserves. Nabiullina said on Monday that this had stopped the central bank from intervening further. Western allies also agreed to cut some of the country’s lenders out of the Swift messaging system, a crucial piece of infrastructure for global payments.Russians have been forming long queues to withdraw money out of cash machines, with the central bank lacking an obvious mechanism to stabilise its economy and currency.Putin introduced capital controls on Monday, banning Russians from transferring foreign currency abroad or from servicing loans in foreign currency outside the country from Tuesday. He also ordered Russian exporters to sell 80 per cent of their foreign currency revenue dating back to January 1 in an effort to help offset the rouble’s sharp decline.But analysts agree the western sanctions can inflict long-lasting damage. “Put simply, Russia’s ability to transact with any financial institution at a global level will be severely impaired, because most international banks across any jurisdiction use Swift,” George Saravelos, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a note to clients.“Money markets may experience some deterioration in funding conditions this week on the back of the uncertain impact of an asset freeze on global liquidity. It would be expected that the European Central Bank, Fed and other central banks step in to provide a powerful backstop if needed,” he said.On Friday, rating agency S&P Global cut Russia’s debt rating to “junk” status, underlining the risk that the military assault on Ukraine could prove even more deeply damaging to the country’s financial markets.“The Russia bond market is not functioning at all, other than EU and US banks working on unwinding any outstanding trades with Russian banks,” said Kaan Nazli, a portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman.Additional reporting by Max Seddon, Philip Stafford, Harriet Clarfelt and Kate Duguid
17  The EU has frozen the assets and imposed a travel ban on more than half a dozen of Russia’s most prominent oligarchs, many of them with close ties to President Vladimir Putin, as it penalises some of the country’s most powerful people following the invasion of Ukraine.The individuals hit by the measures include Mikhail Fridman, the founder of Alfa Group, and fellow shareholder Petr Aven; Igor Sechin and Nikolai Tokarev, the respective chief executives of oil companies Rosneft and Transneft; and financier Alisher Usmanov.The blacklistings, which take immediate effect, are the latest in a round of increasingly punitive sanctions that the EU began implementing last week as it seeks ways of damaging the Russian economy and hampering Putin’s war effort. Measures imposed by the US and western allies against the Russian central bank led to a steep decline in the rouble as well as frantic cash withdrawals by Russian citizens.Among those hit by the restrictive measures, agreed by member states on Monday, is Fridman, who is described in the EU statement announcing the sanctions list as “a top Russian financier and enabler of Putin’s inner circle”. It added that Fridman “actively supported materially or financially and benefited from Russian decision makers responsible for the annexation of Crimea and the destabilisation of Ukraine”.His bank, Alfa-Bank, is already subject to EU sanctions on issuing bonds, shares and loans in the EU for refinancing, while the US has imposed debt and equity restrictions. Aven, meanwhile, is described as one of the president’s “closest oligarchs”.Putin’s longtime friend Gennady Timchenko, the founder and shareholder of Volga Group, is also on the EU list. He is a shareholder of Bank Rossiya, which is already under sanctions imposed by the EU and UK.Rosneft chief Sechin is described as one of Putin’s “most trusted and closest advisers, as well as his personal friend”, who had been in contact with the president on a daily basis and has been receiving financial gains and “important assignments in return for subordination and loyalty”.Sechin is already subject to a travel ban and asset freeze by the US, as is his son.Tokarev, the chief executive of Russian oil and gas pipeline company Transneft, served with Putin in the KGB and is said by the EU to be “one of the state oligarchs who assumed control over large state assets in the 2000s as Putin consolidated power, and who operates in close partnership with the Russian state”.Other names on the list include Usmanov, one of Putin’s “favourite oligarchs”, and Sergei Roldugin, dubbed “Putin’s wallet”, who keeps his assets at Bank Rossiya.The EU cites an investigation by an international media consortium which alleged that Roldugin is responsible for “shuffling” at least $2bn through banks and offshore companies as a part of Putin’s hidden financial network.Another Rossiya shareholder and businessman on the EU’s list is Alexei Mordashov, chair of steelmaker Severstal and Severgroup, which the EU said controls television stations that actively support Moscow’s policies of destabilising Ukraine. He also owns 34 per cent of Germany-listed travel group Tui.Severstal on Monday published a statement on behalf of Mordashov in response to the sanctions: “I have never been close to politics and have always focused on building economic value at the companies I have worked for both in Russia and abroad.”It added: “I fail to understand how these sanctions against me will contribute to the settlement of the dreadful conflict in Ukraine.”Fridman and Aven “are profoundly shocked by the demonstrably false allegations.purporting to justify the basis on which they have been sanctioned”, stated LetterOne, their London-based private equity firm.“They will fight this injustice with every sinew — for themselves and the tens of thousands of employees in the UK and Europe who rely on them,” LetterOne said. They “have always been totally transparent about their dealings and source of wealth. Sanctioning them based on disproven and malicious gossip will have no impact on Russia’s actions in Ukraine.”Usmanov declined to comment.The chair of Moscow’s international airport, Alexander Ponomarenko, is another oligarch on the list with close links to Putin’s inner circle and with the leadership in Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. Like several other oligarchs, Ponomarenko had financed a palace complex considered to be personally used by Putin, the EU said.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was also on the list.The blacklist has been extended to include more government and military officials. Gas insurance company Sogaz, which insured the construction of the railway bridge connecting the Crimean peninsula to Russia, has been added to the list of financial services companies included in the measures.Igor Sechin is the chief executive of Rosneft, Russia’s top oil producer. A former member of the siloviki, the term used to describe figures with a military and security background, Sechin worked with Vladimir Putin in the St Petersburg mayor’s office in the 1990s. Putin brought him to Moscow when joining the national government. Sechin served as deputy of the Kremlin’s administration and Russia’s deputy prime minister before being appointed head of Rosneft in 2012.Alisher Usmanov is a Russian billionaire who was once the country’s richest man. A metals and technology tycoon, Uzbekistan-born Usmanov controls Russia’s second-largest phone network, MegaFon, and metals giant Metalloinvest, along with other businesses through his USM Holdings. Usmanov was among Facebook’s biggest investors at one point and held a stake in Russia’s largest internet company, Mail.ru, before selling in 2021.Mikhail Fridman is the co-founder of Alfa Group, which owns Russia’s largest privately owned bank Alfa-Bank, biggest supermarket chain X5 and mobile operator Veon. He runs London-based private equity firm LetterOne, which he set up with partners in London in 2013, using $14bn raised from the sale of a stake in oil group TNK-BP to Rosneft, to invest in energy, telecommunications and technology. Fridman divides his time between Moscow, where the Russian edition of Forbes estimates his fortune at $15.5bn, and London, where he was named the UK’s 11th richest man by the Sunday Times. He grew up in Lviv in western Ukraine.Petr Aven, Fridman’s partner, joined Alfa after serving as Russia’s trade minister in the early 1990s and is chair of the group’s bank. He also divides his time between London and Moscow. Aven has published several books based on interviews with fellow big players in Russia’s turbulent 1990s, including one on the late oligarch Boris Berezovsky.Nikolai Tokarev heads Russia’s state-controlled oil pipeline operator Transneft. He is a former KGB officer who served with Putin in Dresden, then East Germany, in the 1980s. Tokarev previously headed Zarubezhneft, one of Russia’s largest oil producers. Transneft has built key export oil pipelines during his tenure.Alexei Mordashov, Russia’s richest man, owns Severstal, one of Russia’s leading steelmakers. He worked his way up from serving as an economist at Severstal’s producing enterprise at Cherepovets in western Russia to a main shareholder at the company. His other business interests include a 32 per cent share in German tour operator Tui and he owns half of Tele2, one of the largest telecommunications companies in Russia.
18  The UK government is working through a “hit list” of Russian oligarchs with links to President Vladimir Putin as it seeks to impose sanctions on them, foreign secretary Liz Truss said on Monday.Ministers want to target oligarchs’ assets and investments in the UK, as they also consider potential action against advisers who work for the tycoons.Truss disclosed the process as the government unveiled a much-delayed economic crime bill in draft form that is designed to crack down on “dirty money” in the UK.The legislation was criticised for lacking an overhaul of Companies House, the UK registry for businesses that has been under attack by transparency campaigners.Ministers are targeting oligarchs following Putin’s decision last week to order his armed forces to invade Ukraine.Eight oligarchs have been hit with UK sanctions but Truss told the House of Commons: “We have a very large team of people working through our hit list of oligarchs — and we are also looking at their properties, their ownerships of yachts. We have already grounded their private jets.”She also said the government wanted to ensure oligarchs could not gain access to their funds and that “their trade can’t flow”.Sir Iain Duncan Smith, a former Conservative leader, asked Truss to use the economic crime bill to introduce a criminal offence applicable to people who work for oligarchs under sanctions — such as lawyers and estate agents — if they fail to give up information on their clients’ deals.Truss said Duncan Smith made a “very good point”, adding: “We are absolutely looking at what we can do to target the families of oligarchs, the people that work for them, the people that support them, and the people that enable them because, ultimately, all of these people are supporting the Putin regime.”Ben Bradshaw, a Labour MP who was present at a briefing with Truss on Friday, said she had stated that “oligarchs’ lawyers in London are very litigious” and “she had already had several warning letters from them”.Downing Street suggested on Monday that law firms representing oligarchs could face penalties. “We will certainly keep all options under review,” it said.Meanwhile, the government outlined its economic crime bill, which includes provisions for a register of overseas entities that control property and land in the UK.Ministers want to see to it that anonymous foreign owners of UK property reveal their identities to ensure that criminals cannot hide behind secretive chains of shell companies.“Oligarchs and kleptocrats from Russia and elsewhere have used the veneer of legitimacy provided by UK-registered companies and partnerships, and they have also used the high-end property to help launder proceeds of corruption,” said Kwasi Kwarteng, business secretary.Ministers also published a white paper setting out medium-term plans for the reform of Companies House, to make sure that applicants would provide more details of their identity when setting up companies.There was criticism that these plans were not yet law, given a government consultation into reform was carried out more than a year ago.“We don’t need a white paper, we need legislation,” said Dame Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP. “I am dismayed.”Andrew Mitchell, a former Conservative minister, said MPs had for years been calling for the measures outlined in the economic crime bill.The bill includes measures to strengthen the UK system of “unexplained wealth orders”, through which authorities can order people to reveal the source of their wealth, which is liable to be forfeited if they cannot prove it was gained legitimately.Susan Hawley, executive director at Spotlight on Corruption, the campaign group, said the government must commit itself to a second economic crime bill later this year, including Companies House reform.
19  Wall Street and European stocks slipped, oil prices rose, the rouble plunged and US government bonds rallied after new sanctions imposed on Russia reverberated through financial markets.The S&P 500 US stock index fell 0.2 per cent in New York, with more than 70 per cent of the companies within the benchmark declining in value. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite eked out a 0.4 per cent advance, rebounding from an earlier loss of as much as 1.1 per cent.In Europe, the regional Stoxx 600 share gauge closed 0.1 per cent lower. The Stoxx banks sub-index fell 5.7 per cent as traders responded to uncertainty about western allies locking some Russian lenders out of the Swift payments system. Germany’s Xetra Dax lost 0.7 per cent.The moves came after Russian president Vladimir Putin put his country’s nuclear forces on high alert and western powers imposed sanctions on Russia’s central bank in response to the invasion of Ukraine.Global equities had rallied on Friday as traders reacted to punitive measures against Russia that did not target the nation’s energy exports. But after financial sanctions against Russia were ratcheted up over the weekend, fund managers de-risked their portfolios, closing out strong bets on the global economy and future central bank policy while loading up on low-risk and easily tradeable assets.“Investors are reducing their active bets,” said Michael Metcalfe, head of macro strategy at State Street. “Right now is a time to take stock, reduce positions and try to assess all the possible outcomes that could arise” from the geopolitical situation, he added.Traders were closely watching for any signals of stress in dollar funding markets, as banks and traders looked for the sanctions to spill out into global funding markets. Despite shifts in currency swap and other markets, investors and strategists said there were not yet indications of severe funding strains.Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, rose 3.1 per cent to settle at $100.99 a barrel. Futures linked to TTF, Europe’s wholesale natural gas price, rose 11 per cent to €103 per megawatt hour.The yield on the two-year US Treasury note dropped 0.12 percentage points to 1.45 per cent, reflecting a significant rise in the price of the highly liquid debt instrument. The benchmark 10-year Treasury also rallied, with the yield falling 0.14 percentage points to 1.83 per cent.“It's a flight to safety,” said Tatjana Greil Castro, co-head of public markets at credit investor Muzinich & Co.“It’s a dash for liquid assets and a little bit of pricing out higher interest rates,” she added, “although the Fed will keep some resolve.”The moves came as traders rapidly dialled back how much they expect the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates as the US central bank attempts to curb surging inflation. Money markets had earlier this month tipped the Fed to raise rates to roughly 1.7 per cent by the end of the year. By the end of Monday, those bets had dropped back to just under 1.4 per cent.The rouble dropped as much as 29 per cent to almost 118 against the US dollar on Monday morning, later trimming some of its declines. Russia’s central bank more than doubled interest rates to 20 per cent on Monday and banned foreign selling of local securities in a bid to stem the fallout from sanctions.The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq also halted trading in Russian securities listed on the two bourses, with the NYSE citing “regulatory concern”. The list of stocks that stopped trading in New York included Russian internet company Yandex and gaming company Nexters.Elsewhere, shares in BP dropped 4 per cent after the British group said at the weekend it would divest its near-20 per cent stake in Russian state oil provider Rosneft.In Asia, Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng index fell as much as 1.6 per cent to its lowest level in almost a year before paring losses to close down 0.2 per cent.
20  Western governments are pushing for social media companies to remove Russian state-backed media from their platforms, as Big Tech is dragged into the information war that has raged following President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine.Meta-owned Facebook and Chinese short-form video platform TikTok on Monday announced they would block access to Russia Today and Sputnik in the EU following a request from the bloc designed to throttle pro-Russia propaganda. YouTube put a similar ban in place on Tuesday morning.Nick Clegg, Meta’s head of global affairs, said Facebook had received requests from a number of other governments and would “work closely” with them on the issue.Attempts by the social media companies to remove misinformation and employ fact checks have been met with accusations of censorship from Russia, which has begun restricting access to Facebook in the country and threatened to do the same at YouTube.The claims and counterclaims over the war in Ukraine have placed Silicon Valley companies in the middle of a geopolitical battle for influence, given their position as gatekeepers to information seen by billions of consumers.Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, on Sunday said she planned to “ban in the EU the Kremlin’s media machine”, though it was unclear how the policy would be enforced. “We are developing tools to ban their toxic and harmful disinformation in Europe.”The prime ministers of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland have signed a joint letter directed to the heads of Meta, Google, YouTube and Twitter demanding a clampdown on Russian state media on their platforms.On a call on Sunday, European internal markets commissioner Thierry Breton urged Google chief executive Sundar Pichai and YouTube’s Susan Wojcicki to consider bans, and to update their terms of service to ensure “war propaganda” never appears as “recommended” content to users, according to a person briefed on the call.YouTube has since blocked all channels connected to RT and Sputnik across Europe, including in the UK.Twitter, which last week paused advertising in Russia and Ukraine, on Monday said it would label content from Russian state-affiliated media websites — something that Facebook and YouTube have been doing for several years — and reduce visibility of that content.It declined to comment on whether it will block RT and Sputnik completely, in line with the EU’s request. Last week, Twitter said it was aware that it was “being restricted for some people in Russia”.Both YouTube and Facebook blocked access in Ukraine to RT and several other state-backed outlets over the weekend, following a request from the Ukrainian government.The platforms also paused the ability for Russian state media channels to run advertisements on their platforms or to make money from ads that run alongside the content that they create.The moves extended beyond the social media sector. Google on Sunday decided to block downloads of the RT app in Ukrainian territory. Microsoft went further on Monday, blocking downloads of the RT app on its Windows app store worldwide, as well as RT and Sputnik content from its MSN website, citing the EU decision.Silicon Valley’s social media platforms, which have cast themselves as politically neutral but committed to democratic free speech, have long struggled to prevent their platforms from being manipulated for information warfare. This includes clandestine activity by troll farms and bots directed by the Russian government, one of the most active actors in the space.Facebook announced the takedown of a small disinformation campaign late on Sunday that used fictitious personas to spread anti-Ukrainian messaging and was tied to a previous Russian disinformation operation.The potential removal of state media would mark a new frontier for the social media platforms, which have tended to focus on removing covert operations rather than any domestic propaganda apparatus.It also carries the risk Russia will expel European media from Ukraine after it shut down broadcaster Deutsche Welle’s Moscow bureau this month in response to Germany’s refusal to let RT broadcast.RT is available to more than 120mn European viewers, according to its website, and has 6.3mn and 4.6mn followers on Facebook and YouTube pages respectively. Its Spanish-language YouTube channel, which has nearly 6mn subscribers, is one of the most watched Spanish YouTube channels, according to researchers at data analysis company Omelas.Margarita Simonyan, RT’s editor-in-chief, said in a post on social media app Telegram that the move to ban RT “has NOTHING to do with the goal of stopping the military operation in Ukraine”.“Or do they think that Putin will change his mind about saving the Russian-speaking population in Ukraine or stopping Nato’s spread without RT’s broadcasts in English, French, or Spanish?” she added.Vera Jourova, a vice-president of the European Commission, said that the actions being taken by the social media platforms were “not enough”, and should include bans as well as ensuring their algorithms boost more trustworthy content.In the US, Mark Warner, chair of the Senate Intelligence committee, on Friday wrote letters to Facebook and Google, as well as Twitter, TikTok and Telegram, calling on them to “assume a heightened posture towards the exploitation” of their platform for information operations.Alex Stamos, director of the Stanford Internet Observatory and Facebook’s former chief security officer, said on Twitter: “It’s appropriate for American companies to pick sides in geopolitical conflicts, and this should be an easy call.”Disinformation experts warn that if the platforms crack down too hard, this too can play into narratives designed to further sow discord.“Tech firms taking steps to stop promoting RT or Sputnik are laudable as part of their larger strategy to stop promoting conspiratorial content,” said Ben Dubow, founder of Omelas. “But government intervention gives Russia a talking point of the west being no more open to opposing views than they are, while giving the green light to go after the BBC” and other outlets, including domestic opposition outlets.Alongside other authoritarian governments, Russia has increasingly wielded the threat of penalties such as fines and slowing or shutting access to the platforms to get them to restore or restrict content.Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of global security, said that Russia had issued requests to geo-block or hide certain posts, but the company had refused the request. He declined to comment on the impact of Russia throttling its service in the country, and whether the company would consider a global blanket ban of Russian state media outlets.
21  Big Tech is being dragged into the information war between Russia and the west as pressure over monitoring and censoring content on the events in Ukraine intensifies.Meta-owned Facebook and Google’s YouTube are among those facing calls from the EU to remove content from Russia Today, Sputnik and other Kremlin-backed outlets in an effort to throttle pro-Russia propaganda. Attempts by the same companies to remove misinformation and employ fact checks have been met with accusations of censorship from Russia, which has begun restricting access to Facebook in the country and levelling threats to do the same to YouTube.Efforts by the Russian censors to stop mentions of a “war” in the traditional media have been outgunned by a huge wave of posts by Ukrainians on social networks, according to our reporters in Moscow and Kyiv.Meanwhile, as part of sanctions, Washington has announced export controls on semiconductor technology that are intended to isolate Russia from the world’s tech economy and stymie its military capabilities, while allowing ordinary citizens in the country to still buy mobile phones, dishwashers and laptops.In the online conflict, where hacking attacks are expected on businesses and networks around the globe, companies are clamouring for help from cyber security providers. Reuven Aronashvili, who helped create the Israeli army’s “Red Team” unit, and now runs a cyber security company called CYE, said corporations were flooding his company with requests. “We are seeing a very significant increase — just in the last 48 hours, we’ve seen almost a 10-fold increase in demand.”The world’s largest carmaker Toyota appears to be an early victim. On Monday, it said it would shut down all of its plants across Japan and the factories of two subsidiaries Hino and Daihatsu after a suspected cyber attack on one of its largest parts suppliers.Senior Japanese officials told the Financial Times they feared leading companies were now targets for reprisals after the government joined other G7 industrial nations in applying tougher sanctions against Russia.1. World’s largest SWF opposes Apple pay Norway’s oil fund is voting against Apple’s pay policies, including $99mn in salary and bonuses for chief executive Tim Cook, part of a growing shareholder backlash against remuneration at the tech giant.2. Work surveillance on the rise Staff surveillance is at risk of “spinning out of control”, Britain’s largest federation of trade unions has warned. About 60 per cent of employees reported being subject to some form of tech surveillance and monitoring, in a survey by the TUC published on Monday — up from 53 per cent the previous year.3. Buy now, profits later Losses at Swedish “buy now, pay later” group Klarna soared last year, as its rapid growth into new markets drove up credit defaults. The fintech on Monday reported net losses of SKr4.5bn ($470mn) for the fourth quarter, compared with SKr755mn a year earlier. Elsewhere, Zip, Australia’s largest BNPL company, has acquired one its biggest rivals, Sezzle, for A$491mn ($355mn),4. Britain’s post-Brexit post-GDPR Four years ago, UK businesses were scrambling to overhaul the way they collected workers’ personal information before the General Data Protection Regulation came into force, in May 2018. Now, business leaders wonder if they will have to rip up the rule books again — as a result of the British government’s plans for an independent, post-Brexit, data regime, writes Kate Beioley.5. Chinese rivals capture Korean game makers’ flag Pressure from Chinese rivals has wiped $20bn off the market value of South Korea’s top game companies, with the developer of global hit PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds leading the slump. The poor performance of new releases has prompted Korean game makers to shift their focus to “play-to-earn” games with digital coins and non-fungible tokens to generate revenue. Meanwhile, two UK video game industry veterans have called for Britain to invest more in homegrown talent and prevent the loss of further UK-based companies to foreign buyers.Look out for a raft of 5G and smartphone announcements this week from Mobile World Congress, taking place Monday to Thursday in Barcelona.

22  Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has forced the biggest reappraisal of corporate relations with Russia for a generation, leaving oil executives and commodity traders with a choice between clinging on to their lucrative commercial ventures or heeding calls for divestment.Russia is the world’s third-largest oil producer, the biggest exporter of gas and, for most of the past decade, was viewed as the world’s most promising exploration and development destination.Western sanctions have sought to avoid restricting oil and gas exports, and some of the companies say they can continue to operate in the country.However, decisions by BP, Shell and Norway’s Equinor to cut ties with their Russian partners have increased the pressure on the likes of TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil, Trafigura and Glencore to do the same.“What BP has done should put the rest of industry’s feet on the fire,” said Christyan Malek, head of global energy strategy at JPMorgan.While commodity groups have always operated in difficult parts of the world, even during periods of war, the pressure on companies today to adhere to higher environmental, social and governance standards meant this was “uncharted territory”, he added. “How do you advance a credible ESG agenda when you’re in a country that’s in a major conflict?”Of the oil majors still operating in Russia, Total has the most commercial exposure now BP has decided to dump its 19.75 per cent stake in Rosneft and Shell is moving to end its partnerships with Gazprom, analysts said.The French group has invested heavily in two projects in the Yamal peninsula in Russia’s frozen north, as it seeks to build out its liquefied natural gas business alongside local “strategic partner” Novatek.Total owns 19.4 per cent of the Russian company, which has been under US sanctions limiting its access to finance since 2014 when Putin annexed Crimea. Total also has a 20 per cent and 10 per cent stake in two Novatek LNG projects.Total on Tuesday condemned “Russia’s military aggression” but stopped short of announcing an exit, saying it would not provide capital for new projects in Russia and was reviewing how to deal with its existing business.Russia last year delivered 16 per cent of Total’s global oil and gas production, according to investment bank Jefferies, and cash of $1.5bn.Shell’s Russian production represented 5 per cent of its global total last year, Jefferies said. Expanding in the country had been a priority for Shell’s management, said a person familiar with the company’s strategy.Shell owns 27.5 per cent of state-owned Gazprom’s huge Sakhalin-2 offshore LNG project in Russia’s far east. Inaugurated in 2009, it produced roughly 11.6mn tonnes of LNG in 2020, of which 3.2mn tonnes will have flowed to the group, representing about 10 per cent of the company’s global production. Its withdrawal from the project could leave Shell short of LNG in East Asia at a time when prices for cargoes of the fuel are high and expected to keep rising.The UK-listed oil major, one of five international energy groups that each committed to fund 10 per cent of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany, is also pulling out of that project. Last week Berlin said it was halting certification of the pipeline indefinitely and the US placed sanctions on the Gazprom subsidiary building it.Shell’s Russia business has long been contentious among some staff, not least because four Shell employees were among those killed when Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine in 2014.US supermajor Exxon has been operating in Russia for 25 years and employs more than 1,000 people in the country. In 2018, it withdrew from joint ventures with Rosneft after the US government expanded sanctions originally placed on the Russian company in 2014.Despite that decision, Exxon has continued to operate the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project in partnership with two Rosneft units and companies from India and Japan. The US company owns 30 per cent of the project, which has exported more than 985mn barrels of oil and 29bn cubic metres of natural gas since production began in 2005.Exxon did not respond to requests for comment.George Voloshin, a Russia expert with corporate intelligence firm Aperio, said he expected more divestments. “There will be a domino effect spreading well beyond the energy sector and extending to a wide variety of joint ventures and affiliates,” he said.At least one global oilfield services company was already reviewing its Russian projects, he added.Commodity traders are also exposed. Swiss trading house Trafigura has built a strong relationship with Rosneft since helping it raise funds through short-term prepayment deals that were still permitted after the 2014 sanctions were introduced.It strengthened that relationship in December 2020 when it agreed to buy 10 per cent of the €7.3bn Rosneft-led Vostok Oil project in the Arctic, in a deal that will also give Trafigura long-term access to cheap Russian crude. If all goes to plan, Vostok will develop a new oil-producing region on Siberia’s Taymyr Peninsula to rival the US Permian Basin and Saudi Arabia’s Ghawar oilfield. A consortium led by Vitol, the world’s biggest independent oil trader, is also set to take a 5 per cent stake in the project.Trafigura declined to comment. Vitol also declined to comment.People with knowledge of its thinking said Trafigura had no plans to sell its stake in Vostok. They described the investment as a “small, minority interest” in a project that will not start producing oil until 2024.Trafigura and other traders had continued to lift Russian crude and were expected to continue to do so unless it is explicitly banned by western governments, bankers said.While UK politicians have criticised the likes of BP and Shell for their Russian relations, sanctions have intentionally avoided blocking energy exports, in a sign that western leaders remain willing to buy Russian oil and gas, even if some say they do not want western companies involved in its production.London-listed Glencore owns a 0.5 per cent stake in Rosneft, worth $195mn as at Friday’s close, plus 25 per cent in Russneft, a smaller Russian oil producer, which it is poised to sell. It also has a 10.5 per cent stake in En+, the metals group that has a controlling stake in aluminium producer Rusal.“The combined $920mn market value of these stakes is equivalent to 1.2 per cent of Glencore’s $77bn market capitalisation,” said Dominic O’Kane, analyst at JPMorgan. “In addition, Glencore’s marketing relationship and offtake contracts with various Russian commodity producers will be under scrutiny, including Rusal and Rosneft.”Glencore declined to comment.If more companies run for the exit, finding buyers for unwanted minority stakes in Russian assets will be difficult. Some analysts have speculated that potential bidders could include state-owned Chinese or Middle Eastern groups such as the Qatar Investment Authority, which already owns 18 per cent of Rosneft. But any deal would be difficult to get over the line and come at a huge discount.BP’s decision to reclassify the investment and take a paper loss without triggering a fire sale or immediately writing down the stake to zero made a lot of sense, said Aperio’s Voloshin. “It’s absolutely the worst time to sell.”Additional reporting by Jim Pickard in London
23  Norwegian oil group Equinor and Germany’s Daimler Truck are ending their partnerships with Russian businesses while Volvo and Jaguar Land Rover said they were halting deliveries of cars to the country as the corporate fallout from the invasion of Ukraine spreads.The announcements came as multinational groups with operations in Russia grappled with the reputational impact of their association with the country as well as potential exposure to western sanctions designed to inflict severe economic pain.They follow BP’s announcement on Sunday that it was divesting its near-20 per cent stake in Russian state oil group Rosneft, with chair Helge Lund describing Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine as an “act of aggression which is having tragic consequences across the region”.Companies with staff in Russia are also considering whether to repatriate their families, people close to two French groups with operations in the country said.Equinor on Monday said it was “exiting” joint ventures in Russia that include a strategic partnership with Rosneft encompassing projects throughout Siberia.“In the current situation, we regard our position as untenable,” said Anders Opedal, chief executive. “We will now stop new investments into our Russian business and we will start the process of exiting our joint ventures in a manner that is consistent with our values.”He said Equinor, which is two-thirds owned by the Norwegian government, was “deeply troubled” by Russia’s invasion.Daimler Truck, the world’s largest truckmaker, said it had taken the decision to “immediately suspend all our business activities in Russia” even though its contract with local vehicle maker Kamaz limits co-operation to manufacturing civilian vehicles. Kamaz, which was established under the Soviet Union, separately makes utility vehicles for Russia’s armed forces.Volvo Cars specifically cited the impact of the west’s financial penalties as it said it would “not deliver any cars to the Russian market until further notice” because of “potential risks associated with trading material with Russia, including the sanctions imposed by the EU and US”.Truckmaker Volvo, which is independent of the car company, said on Monday it had halted production at its factory in Russia and stopped sales to the country until further notice, citing the risk of sanctions.Jaguar Land Rover on Monday evening said it was pausing the delivery of vehicles into the Russian market because of “trading challenges”, while carmaker BMW said its “business activities in Russia are under review”, with a decision expected on Tuesday.ZF, a major German parts supplier, also said it has frozen all deliveries to Russia, including those to the ZF Kama joint venture, while it investigates the impact of the international sanctions.Following warnings from other carmakers that they could struggle to transport components into and out of Russia, Renault said it had temporarily closed its Moscow plant, which produces models such as the Renault Captur and its Arkana SUVs, because of supply chain problems.Another of the French group’s factories operated by its Russian Avtovaz business also halted production on Monday, but that was because of semiconductor shortages, the company said, with manufacturing there due to resume on Tuesday.Russia is the Renault group’s second-biggest market by sales volumes, while Avtovaz last year made up about 7 per cent of its overall revenues.Many of the western companies employ largely local staff through their Russian subsidiaries.Major employers also include retailers such as Germany’s Metro AG or France’s Auchan. The French supermarket chain, with 30,000 workers in Russia, said it was “anticipating everything we can” as it also tries to grapple with any fallout for its staff. Western sanctions sent the rouble tumbling on Monday.Equinor said it expected to take impairments related to the ventures. The company has been in Russia for more than 30 years and expanded its partnership with Rosneft in 2020, paying $550mn to gain a 49 per cent stake in a dozen exploration and production licences in eastern Siberia.Equinor’s current production in Russia is modest at just 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day versus its group total of about 2mn barrels a day. It has 70 employees in Russia.Norway’s government on Sunday ordered its $1.3tn oil fund, the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, to ditch its $3bn in Russian investments.Daimler Truck’s move is unlikely to have a large impact on its profits as the truckmaker sells just a few thousand units in Russia each year.Mercedes-Benz AG, which in its previous guise as Daimler AG was the parent company of Daimler Truck, said it was also seeking to divest a 15 per cent stake in Kamaz.Additional reporting by Antoni Slodkowski in Tokyo, Leila Abboud in Paris, Olaf Storbeck in Frankfurt and Steff Chavez in Chicago
24  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
25  Five days into Russia’s conflict with Ukraine, events are moving so fast that Illarion, a 37-year-old Muscovite programmer, has decided he needs to be prepared for the worst: having to flee the country.“A few days ago we were all saying of course there won’t be any war. Then the war happened. Then we were saying there won’t be a nuclear war, we won’t have to flee the country,” said Illarion, standing at one of the long lines at cash machines throughout Moscow.Large queues have formed as residents search for US dollars, which are increasingly scarce after the west imposed financial sanctions on Russia that limit its access to foreign currency.Some people queued for hours waiting for dollars to arrive at a branch or ATM, only for the machine to be emptied within minutes. Others even tried to track cash trucks around the city, they told the Financial Times. Anxiety was only heightened by Russian president Vladimir Putin’s move on Sunday to put his nuclear forces on high alert.“We are now wondering whether the state is going to forcefully convert dollar savings into roubles to take the citizens’ dollars because they are being cut off from the outside. That is a reality we see on the horizon,” said Illarion. “I don’t think it is a joke any more that we may have bombs flying at us and we’ll need to flee the country, which requires having dollars in cash or cryptocurrency.”The Russian rouble fell more than 30 per cent at the start of trade on Monday against the dollar after the US and the EU imposed sanctions on its central bank and cut access to the Swift payments system for some of the country’s banks.Moscow then announced a ban from Tuesday on foreign currency transfers to banks outside the country.More Russians even appear to be considering leaving the country. The search for the word “emigration” has increased fivefold last week, according to Google trends, which analyses the frequency of online searches. Most of the searches come from Murmansk and St Petersburg, a traditionally liberal city, followed by Moscow.Lev Gudkov, the head of independent polling centre Levada, told Kommersant FM radio that the number of people willing to leave the country had increased significantly in February, reaching 22 per cent of Russians and to nearly half among the young.Reasons include limited business opportunities, the “increasingly repressive regime” and anxiety among parents of children approaching conscription age, he said. “Whoever had been in two minds will now be persuaded to leave as the iron curtain rolls down,” he said.Some have compared the situation to the communist era, when the Soviet Union was in effect shut off from the rest of the world. Others expect a repeat of the 1990s, when a collapse in the value of the currency pushed up the cost of living.“I recall in the 1990s prices were set in dollars, even if it was illegal. The rouble was worthless. And I worry this is what we will see again,” said Alexei, an IT specialist, who had been waiting for several hours at a mall where he exchanged roubles into dollars at the record rate of more than Rbs100 per dollar. Before the war, a dollar bought Rbs70. He too said he was looking for ways to emigrate.Elena, a 29-year-old human resources specialist from Moscow, said she was thinking of following friends who left for the United Arab Emirates before the current crisis because they could not see a positive future in Russia.“The feelings are mixed. We are completely unprepared. This is a total mess, and it is very scary in all senses. That the economy collapses and we will live off [food] allowance cards as our parents and grandparents [did],” she said, referring to a system of rationing prevalent in the 1990s.“We really hope the situation can be resolved with minimal losses, but knowing the policy of our country and where it is headed, I am not positive about the prospects.I’m starting to think I’ll be of more use even to my own family, my parents, by being out of here,” she added.Others have lined up to buy iPhones and televisions, spending roubles now in the expectation that their value will continue to fall.“For the past few days, it’s been like Christmas for us,” said a shop assistant in an electronics shop. “People are ready to buy things even [though] we have been raising prices every few hours based on the forex situation.”In the face of profound uncertainty, Illarion is one of those ready for all eventualities. “I have rouble savings in case everything will be OK, and dollar savings in case things are not OK,” he said. “Anything that previously seemed impossible we have to have a plan for.”
26  The UK home secretary Priti Patel has resisted pressure to ease significantly requirements for Ukrainians seeking to enter Britain as they flee Russia’s invasion. Patel told the House of Commons on Monday that she was creating a “bespoke humanitarian route” for British nationals and Ukrainians resident in the UK to bring over their family members. However, in a statement during Home Office questions, Patel went little further than a concession offered by the prime minister on Sunday that Ukrainians resident in the UK would be able to bring over “immediate” family members fleeing Russia’s invasion. “Immediate” family currently covers spouses, longstanding partners, children under the age of 18, parents where there is a grandchild under 18, and, in some cases, adult carers. Patel did not broaden the definition and said it was vital to continue requiring visas of people coming to the UK due to growing security concerns.She insisted that maintaining security checks was vital because of the threat from extremism and in light of Russian soldiers’ infiltration among Ukrainian forces. “The approach we are taking is on the best and strongest security advice,” Patel said.“Security and biometric checks are a fundamental part of our visa application system worldwide and will continue,” Patel told the Commons.EU members on Sunday dropped the demand for visas altogether, allowing Ukrainians to come to the EU for up to three years visa-free. Patel insisted that recent concessions — which also include some easing of the rules for UK citizens to bring Ukrainian spouses to Britain — would allow an extra 100,000 Ukrainians to come to the country.Patel’s position faces opposition from a number of MPs, including from within her own Conservative party. Members of the One Nation group of MPs, a centrist caucus including former cabinet ministers Greg Clark, Damian Green and Jeremy Hunt, urged the prime minister to do more to help Ukrainian refugees. “The United Kingdom must not flag or fail,” they said in a letter on Monday. “Our message must be clear: Ukrainian victims of war seeking refuge are welcome.”Yvette Cooper, shadow home secretary, criticised Patel’s statement for its confusion. “Why on earth is the home secretary so poorly prepared for something she has been warned about for so many weeks?” she asked. Stuart McDonald, a Scottish National party MP, who sits on the Commons home affairs select committee, said Patel’s statement amounted to a “paltry offer”.“We continue to call for the UK to follow the EU approach and waive visa requirements for Ukrainian nationals,” he said. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees has estimated that 500,000 people have fled Ukraine for neighbouring countries since Russia’s assault began on Thursday. The UK has only one operating consulate in Ukraine, in the western city of Lviv, which is only issuing visas to the families of British nationals with residency in Ukraine. Ukrainians seeking visas to join family members settled in the UK must apply in neighbouring countries such as Poland, Hungary, Romania or Moldova under existing rules. The Home Office said it had increased staffing at consulates in those countries.
27  Citigroup said it has almost $10bn worth of exposure to Russia through loans, government debt and other assets, partly held through its retail bank in the country which it has said it wants to sell.The disclosure, made in Citi’s annual report on Monday, underscores how the New York-based bank’s business is more directly tied to events in Russia than any of its Wall Street rivals, as western powers ratchet up financial sanctions on the country following President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.The exposure, based on end-2021 figures, was made up of $8.2bn at its investment banking and retail banking operations in Russia through corporate and consumer loans, local government debt, reverse repurchase agreements and deposits with Russia’s central bank, which was hit with sanctions on Sunday.Citi has a further $1.6bn of exposure to other financial counterparties in the country.“Citi continues to monitor the current Russia-Ukraine geopolitical situation and economic conditions and will mitigate its exposures and risks as appropriate,” the bank said in the regulatory filing.The exposure is a small fraction of Citi’s overall business, with the bank holding $2.29tn worth of assets at the end of last year. It is nevertheless an unwelcome distraction ahead of an investor day on Wednesday where Jane Fraser, chief executive since early last year, will outline her road map for the bank.Part of Fraser’s strategy has been to exit about a dozen markets from its far-flung international retail network, including Russia. The bank said in the filing that it was still seeking to exit the Russian retail market.Goldman Sachs estimated that its exposure to credit losses in Russia was $650mn, of which $134mn was from over-the-counter derivatives, $177mn from loans and lending commitments, and $339mn to secured receivables, according to its annual report filed last week. The bank said its total market exposure to Russia was $414mn as of December.In their most recent annual reports, neither JPMorgan Chase nor Bank of America listed Russia among their top 20 markets for financial exposure.In a research note on Monday, analysts at Oppenheimer wrote that US bank exposure to Russia was “limited”.“The harder to figure issue is the indirect exposure, given that many European banks (particularly French, Italian and Austrian) have much bigger exposures and could clearly be impacted much more severely,” they wrote.
28  Shell is pulling back from Russia and ending its involvement with the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline project as the corporate backlash against Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine gains momentum.The decision comes a day after rival BP said it would sell its near 20 per cent stake in Russian oil company Rosneft, a move that could cost the company up to $25bn.Shell said it would end all three of its joint ventures with Kremlin-backed Gazprom, including its 27.5 per cent stake in the huge Sakhalin-2 liquefied natural gas project, whose other shareholders include Japan’s Mitsui and Mitsubishi.Shell, which did not say whether it would seek to sell its stakes or write them off, said it also planned to end its involvement in the Baltic Sea Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany.“We are shocked by the loss of life in Ukraine, which we deplore, resulting from a senseless act of military aggression which threatens European security,” said Ben van Beurden, chief executive.Kwasi Kwarteng, the UK business secretary who met van Beurden on Monday to discuss the company’s involvement in Russia, welcomed the decision.“Shell has made the right call to divest from Russia — including Sakhalin II,” Kwarteng said in a tweet. “There is now a strong moral imperative on British companies to isolate Russia. This invasion must be a strategic failure for Putin.”Gazprom declined to comment.The decision to quit the joint ventures in Russia would trigger impairment charges, Shell said, adding that it had around $3 billion in non-current assets in the ventures at the end of 2021.The company’s Russian joint venture assets were valued at $3bn at the end of last year.“Our decision to exit is one we take with conviction,” said van Beurden. “We cannot — and we will not — stand by.”Shell’s Russian production accounted for 5 per cent of its global total last year, according to investment bank Jefferies, and expanding its footprint in the country had been a priority for the company.Inaugurated in 2009, Sakhalin-2 in Russia’s far east produced roughly 11.6mn tonnes of LNG in 2020, 3.2mn tonnes of which will have flowed to Shell, representing about 10 per cent the company’s global production of the fuel.Its decision to withdraw from the project could leave Shell scrambling to find more LNG for customers in Asia at a time when prices for cargoes of the fuel are high and expected to keep rising.The UK-listed oil major was one of five international energy groups that each committed to fund 10 per cent of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.Germany last week said it was halting certification of the pipeline indefinitely, while the US placed sanctions on the Gazprom subsidiary building it.Van Beurden has met Russian President Vladimir Putin several times. The company’s Russia business was already contentious for some staff, not least because four Shell employees were among those killed when Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine in 2014.Norway’s Equinor also followed BP on Monday in pledging an exit from its joint ventures in Russia. The three announcements have increased the pressure on the likes of TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil, Trafigura, Vitol and Glencore to do the same.Russia is one of the world’s biggest oil producers, supplies 40 per cent of Europe’s gas and has long been considered one of the world’s most promising exploration and development destinations.
29  Boris Johnson told cabinet colleagues on Monday that the British public would have to endure even higher energy prices as the cost for inflicting “pain” on Russia through sanctions.The UK prime minister said any suffering for consumers would be minimal compared to what the people of Ukraine were going through under the onslaught by the Russian military, according to officials.His comments came against a backdrop of steep rises in energy prices in recent months, in part because of Russia limiting gas exports to western Europe.On top of a sharp jump in gas and electricity bills, motorists were facing record prices at the pump with the price of petrol hitting £1.51 on Sunday, according to the RAC.Earlier, Kwasi Kwarteng, the UK business secretary, said on Twitter that it would be “madness” to halt production of North Sea oil and gas on environmental grounds as he warned of a long-lasting energy price shock.Kwarteng warned the UK was “vulnerable” to rising international energy prices — stoked by the conflict in Ukraine — despite its limited imports of Russian gas.British households face a sharp jump in domestic energy bills after Ofgem, the regulator, earlier this month raised the “price cap” from April by 54 per cent to nearly £2,000 a year on average.Analysts at Investec have warned the cap, which limits how much energy companies can charge the 22mn households not on fixed-term deals, may rise to more than £3,000 annually when it is next adjusted in October following rises in wholesale markets since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.UK gas prices are currently trading at about 250p per therm. Although they are lower than record levels of above 450p per therm set in December, prices are still more than four times what they were a year ago.Kwarteng pointed out Britain still relied on the North Sea as its biggest single source of gas, with the bulk of imports coming from Norway, a Nato ally. “The situation we are facing is a price issue, not a security of supply issue,” he wrote.Russia accounts for 5 to 6 per cent of gas imports but Britain is tied to international markets so it has to pay more when there is strong demand or concerns over tightening supply.“The situation we are facing is a price issue, not a security of supply bill. Put simply, we have lots of gas from highly diverse and secure sources, but it is very expensive,” Kwarteng said.Environmentalists oppose further development of North Sea oil and gasfields. But under the government’s plans to hit its net zero carbon target by 2050, Britain will still require vast amounts of gas for years to come.Kwarteng said North Sea development would be “good for jobs, energy security [and] tax revenues to fund public services,” adding: “It would be complete madness to turn off our domestic source of gas.”But he warned that approving additional North Sea production would not have a material impact on wholesale gas prices. In the long-term it would be cheaper to get more power from renewable energy, he added, backed up with new nuclear power when there is not enough wind or sun.Kwarteng said UK renewable capacity had increased fivefold since 2010 but said it should be accelerated further. “The more cheap, clean power we generate at home, the less exposed we’ll be to global gas markets.”
30  Ukraine is planning to issue a “war bond” to fund its armed forces in their battle against Russian invasion as the country sought to reassure international investors that it will not default on its debt.The Ukraine finance ministry unveiled its plans to raise money to fund its war effort, in the announcement of a new bond auction scheduled for Tuesday. “In the time of military aggression of the Russian Federation, the ministry of finance offers citizens, businesses and foreign investors [the chance] to support the budget of Ukraine by investing in military government bonds.”On an investor call with bond fund managers on Monday, Ukraine’s government commissioner for public debt management Yuriy Butsa described the fundraising exercise as a “military bond” aimed at “everyone who wants to support the budget in these troubling times”.“Unfortunately, it’s not a regular exercise for us this time,” he said. “I was not trained as a military expert, but now everyone has to be one.”Butsa told investors that the “initial plan of Russia actually failed dramatically”, while underscoring that Ukraine’s “government is fully functioning” and its “treasury operations is fully functioning” despite the military assault from the neighbouring nation.Ukraine’s central bank has imposed capital controls as an emergency measure, which will make it difficult for overseas investors to participate in the auction, according to one fund manager on the call. But the bond should attract “decent local demand”, the fund manager added.The sale comes after a sharp plunge in the prices of Ukraine’s existing bonds, as investors worry the Russian invasion will push Kyiv to default on its debt. Ukraine’s dollar bond maturing in 2032 dropped to a price of 31 cents on the dollar on Monday.“We are not planning any restructuring and we will honour our debt accordingly,” Butsa said, adding that the “money is on the way already” for Ukraine to make a scheduled coupon payment of around $290mn to international bondholders due on Tuesday.On top of seeking money to finance the war effort, the Ukrainian official made a direct plea to bond investors to take further steps in order “to make the pain for Russia as hard as possible”.“You can lobby for exclusion of any Russian instruments from the indices,” Butsa said. “The second thing I think that is also possible to do is to lobby rating agencies for the downgrade of the rating of Russian companies.”Under sustained questioning from investors, Butsa pushed back on the notion that the country might alter its policy of servicing its debt on time if the war drags on, noting that Ukraine’s $18bn debt restructuring in 2015 had curtailed its access to debt markets for a long time.The Ukrainian finance ministry said that the new bonds would have a one-year maturity with the interest rate offered to investors “to be determined in the auction”.“The proceeds from the bonds will be used to meet the needs of the armed forces of Ukraine and to ensure the uninterrupted provision of the state’s financial needs under the war,” the finance ministry said.Ukraine’s announcement came on the same day the Russian rouble plunged by as much as 29 per cent and its bonds sustained a heavy blow after western allies hit Moscow with a string of unprecedented sanctions.
31  It was a big moment for a Polish foreign minister to declare in 2011 that he was “not so much afraid of German power; it’s German inactivity I’m starting to fear.” Radoslaw Sikorski’s words related to the eurozone crisis, but until days ago they might also have referred to Berlin’s seeming reluctance to impose serious penalties over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Germany’s weekend announcements that it would supply weapons to Kyiv — reversing its refusal to export arms to conflict zones — and sharply increase defence spending have overturned decades-old security and foreign policy doctrines. They are the most dramatic sign yet of how Vladimir Putin’s aggression is reshaping assumptions across Europe.The German transformation began last week when chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that certification of the Nord Stream 2 Russian gas pipeline was suspended. In quick succession Berlin’s three-way coalition later dropped resistance to suspending some Russian lenders from the Swift message system. It allowed other countries to send some German-made weapons to Ukraine, then announced its own plans to send missiles, armoured vehicles and fuel. Finally, Scholz unveiled a €100bn fund to modernise the German military, and vowed it would raise spending on defence from 1.5 per cent of economic output to the Nato target of 2 per cent.The chancellor also vowed to modernise fighter jets needed for its Nato nuclear sharing agreement — which involves German planes carrying US weapons to their targets in a conflict. And he promised to speed up efforts to reduce its reliance on Russian oil and gas.This is a watershed moment for Berlin, as commendable as it is overdue. It spells the end of the era of cautious engagement with Moscow in which even former chancellor Angela Merkel seemed to be losing faith in her final years. It is an admission of failure for Germany’s post-cold war hopes of Wandel durch Handel — change through trade — or that tightening economic ties would strengthen Russian democracy and embed it in the rules-based system. That belief, in turn, was influenced by Willy Brandt’s Ostpolitik, the detente with Soviet-bloc countries that many Germans believe helped to bring down the Berlin Wall.The weekend’s reversals involved compromises for each of the coalition parties — by Scholz’s SPD on raising defence spending, by the Greens on arms exports, and by the liberal Free Democrats on funding military upgrades through debt issuance. Christian Lindner, the Free Democrat finance minister, called this an “investment in our freedom”. Seeming to grasp the gravity of the moment, Scholz borrowed from Merkel’s willingness to occasion to make big policy leaps when she sensed German opinion was ready. More than 100,000 people joined a Berlin demonstration against the Russian war in Ukraine on Sunday.Germany’s commitment helped to galvanise the whole of the EU into breaking a taboo by agreeing to provide €450mn for weapons for Ukraine via a special fund set up last year — the first time the bloc has agreed to finance weapons deliveries to a third country. European countries are now ready to contribute more to their own security, with the US increasingly preoccupied by China.The EU collectively, and its biggest member state, are starting to move towards developing the “strategic autonomy” that its second biggest member, France, has advocated. But about two-thirds of Nato members, including Italy and Spain, do not spend the target of 2 per cent of GDP on defence. Germany is setting an example. Putin’s war in Ukraine should be a powerful incentive for others to follow.
32  Roman Abramovich’s ownership of Chelsea football club secured silverware for the team and a positive public image for its owner. But the club, along with Abramovich’s London listed steelmaker Evraz, is Russian-owned at a time when sanctions are widening. Abramovich has distanced himself from Chelsea, passing “stewardship and care” to its charitable foundation.Abramovich was not on a list of Russian individuals targeted this week by UK economic sanctions, though at least one opposition MP called for his assets to be seized in parliament. The EU is considering measures against other wealthy Russians who have made Europe their base.The move with the charitable foundation is unlikely to deflect too much attention away from the ultimate owner of the club, who has lent it £1.5bn.Steelmaker Evraz may be a softer target if the west has any intention of including it in widening sanctions. That would also mean a red face for Sir Michael Peat. The former private secretary to Prince Charles has sat on the board of Evraz since it listed in 2011, back when top tier Brits were in demand and added lustre to Russian businesses. Evraz paid Peat £224,000 last year. His plans to step down at the end of March were announced in January.The steelmaker represented a larger slice of Abramovich’s wealth until recently. The shares fell a further 29 per cent Monday bringing total declines for the year to over half. Its market capitalisation is now £2.1bn. Record steel prices allowed the group to pay $1.5bn in dividends last year. Payouts since listing total $6bn. Abramovich is the largest holder with 29 per cent, followed by chair Alexander Abramov who owns almost 20 per cent.High-profile assets such as listed business and football clubs are straightforward targets for any sanctions. Cracking down on transactions via the front companies and middlemen other oligarchs have used to cloak their activities is far harder. Without tougher disclosure of ultimate ownership, London’s Russian money-go-round will carry on spinning, albeit more slowly.
33  Football authorities have suspended Russia’s national team and clubs from major tournaments including this year’s World Cup, under intense pressure to punish President Vladimir Putin for invading Ukraine.World governing body Fifa and European counterpart Uefa said in a joint statement on Monday that Russian teams would be barred from competition “until further notice”.“Football is fully united here and in full solidarity with all the people affected in Ukraine,” the two organisations said.The move means the Russian men’s team will not be allowed to face Poland in next month’s round of qualifiers for the World Cup in Qatar later this year. The women’s team’s participation in Uefa’s Euro 2022 tournament is also in doubt. Spartak Moscow was also set to play against Germany’s RB Leipzig next month in the Uefa Europa League.Fifa’s change of stance comes after the Switzerland-based organisation faced huge criticism for an earlier decision that would have allowed the Russian national team to play in next month’s World Cup qualifiers. The head of Poland’s football association called Fifa’s original stance “disgraceful”, while the Swedish FA reinforced calls to prevent Russia from playing.Fifa accelerated the imposition of penalties after originally saying it would continue discussions with the IOC and Uefa “to determine any additional measures or sanctions, including a potential exclusion from competitions, that shall be applied in the near future should the situation not be improving rapidly”.The moves come after the International Olympic Committee on Monday recommended that sports organisers bar Russian athletes from competing in events.The IOC, which developed close ties to Putin and Russia as they worked together on the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, on Monday also stripped Putin of an honorary “gold” Olympic Order.The war in Ukraine has intensified scrutiny of the links between global sport and Russia, which hosted the 2018 Fifa World Cup, forcing teams and competition organisers to reconsider partnerships and sponsorships linked to the Russian state.Formula One, the global racing series, has abandoned the 2022 Russian grand prix, while Uefa, European football’s governing body, has moved the Champions League final from St Petersburg. Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich has transferred stewardship of European champions Chelsea to trustees of the club’s charitable foundation.Uefa also confirmed on Monday that it has scrapped its €40mn-a-year partnership with Russian state energy company Gazprom, which will no longer sponsor the Champions League or Euro 2024 in Germany.Clubs and their fans expressed solidarity with Ukraine at matches over the weekend, including at Sunday’s Carabao Cup final between Chelsea and Liverpool at Wembley Stadium.Football associations across Europe had hit out at Fifa for failing to ban Russia from competing in upcoming qualifiers for the World Cup, which is the Switzerland-headquartered organisation’s flagship event.Poland was scheduled to play Russia on March 24, with the winner to face either Sweden or Czech Republic to decide which team will compete in Qatar.All three sides had threatened to boycott matches against Russia, while England’s football authorities warned that the English national team “won’t play against Russia in any international fixtures for the foreseeable future”.Following the decision to suspend Russia, UK prime minister Boris Johnson said: “This is a powerful message from the international sporting community that we will not tolerate Putin’s abhorrent assaults on freedom and liberty. Well done Fifa and Uefa.”
34  The artillery barrage that Russia launched on Monday against the city of Kharkiv is a gruesome escalation of the tactics that Moscow has deployed in its five-day attack on Ukraine, and analysts warned it may only be a foretaste of worse to come.Authorities in the eastern city said heavy shelling in residential areas had killed and wounded civilians. Televised footage shared widely on social media showed a barrage of strikes around apartment blocks, with multiple flashes of explosions and plumes of smoke rising from buildings.“It’s a war, a real war,” Ihor Terekhov, Kharkiv’s mayor, told Ukrainska Pravda website.Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, wrote in a Facebook post that “Kharkiv has just been massively fired upon by grads [rockets]. Dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded.”The onslaught came after Ukrainian troops repelled a Russian incursion into the city on Sunday and followed intensive exchanges on the city’s outskirts a day earlier, according to the UK defence ministry. Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, is a key Russian military objective, along with the capital Kyiv.A senior US defence official said Russia was trying to encircle Kharkiv, a city of 1.4mn inhabitants, and was using long-range fire in its efforts to take control there. “We do believe their plans are to encircle the city and to try to take it that way because that has really been where the heaviest fighting’s been,” said the official.Pentagon officials said there were growing signs that Vladimir Putin’s forces were taking the same tack with Kyiv. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said on Monday that the country was braced for a crucial 24 hours, as Russian troops stepped up their efforts to encircle the capital.“We’re starting to see the same sort of approach being applied to Kyiv,” said the official, adding that Russian forces had advanced about 5km over the past 24 hours and were now within 25km of the city centre.The US official also said there were growing concerns that Russia’s frustration at the slow pace of its military assault on Ukraine could prompt it to use heavier bombing and missile attacks.Analysts said they feared that the escalation of force recalled the early stages of Russia’s levelling of Grozny in 1999. One of Putin’s first acts as president was a bombardment of the Chechen city as part of a war on Islamist separatists that left much of the city in ruins and killed up to 8,000 civilians.“Today’s pictures from Kharkiv certainly look like the beginnings of ‘Groznification’,” said Eliot Cohen, a professor at The Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.Despite Putin’s claims that he wanted to “liberate” Ukraine, Kharkiv lies in a Russian-speaking area of Ukraine, just 40km from the border. “Of course, Grozny was a Russian city too, but that didn’t stop Putin,” Cohen added.In a sign of what may be to come, other videos shared on social media showed Russian SU-34 fighter-bombers flying over the city.Olga, a Kharkiv resident who spoke to the Financial Times by phone, said she saw the rocket strikes while out buying groceries in the north-west of the city. The shelling intensified “and then the shrapnel started flying. We thought they shot a plane down”, she said. “It was deafening.”Analysts said the use of artillery barrages represents a Russian return to tried-and-tested military tactics after its advance in northern and eastern Ukraine bogged down after the failure of what Russian analysts described as an initial softly-softly approach.“The instructions from the Kremlin were.reduce Ukrainian cities to rubble while liberating them,” said Pavel Felgenhauer, a Russian military expert.But stronger than expected resistance incurred Russian casualties — as many as 4,500 according to Ukrainian authorities — and caused heavier than expected losses of tanks and other equipment. Russia has not provided a figure for the number of its personnel killed and injured.Ukrainian and Russian military claims cannot be independently verified.“Their attacking approach didn’t play to Russian tactics in the beginning [of the war] so the obvious recourse is fall back to a strategy that does work,” said Henry Boyd, a military expert at the International institute for Strategic Studies. “Kharkiv is already taking military barrages.”Analysts and officials have been warning that Russia’s setbacks, while spurring Ukrainian resistance, increased the chance of heavy bombardment and possibly assaults using thermobaric weapons, which use oxygen from the surrounding air to generate an intense, high-temperature explosion.Social media posts on Monday also appeared to show TOS-1 heavy flame throwers positioned outside the besieged southern city of Mariupol.Additional reporting by Max Seddon in Moscow and Guy Chazan in Lviv
35  Good eveningA torrent of news has underlined the threat to global recovery from the Ukraine crisis — as well as its potential to amplify other shocks — as the US and its allies stepped up efforts to isolate Moscow.Russia doubled interest rates to 20 per cent as sanctions sent the rouble plunging while moves were advanced to cut the country off from the global financial system. Meanwhile, Russian bonds tumbled as investors braced for the possibility of the country defaulting on its debt for the first time since 1998.Stocks in the US and Europe dropped on news of the tightening sanctions and specifically the uncertainty around Russia’s membership of Swift, the global financial payments system, in what some have termed “the weaponisation of finance”.This morning the US Treasury announced its most aggressive step yet, with a ban on US individuals engaging in any transactions with Russia’s central bank, its national wealth fund and its finance ministry as part of measures to stop Russian president Vladimir Putin and his inner circle from raising funds abroad.Tremors are being felt far away from the actual fighting in Ukraine. The price of Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, rose 4.2 per cent to top $102 a barrel, spelling out more problems for emerging markets on top of increasing costs for other commodities, while in the UK, petrol prices rose above £1.50 a litre for the first time ever.As our Big Read explains, governments were already struggling to cope with rising prices as they inched towards recovery, but the news that the world’s second biggest oil exporter had gone to war with a country at the centre of European energy infrastructure has the potential to completely recast the market.European natural gas prices have also surged on fears Russia could withhold exports, which account for about a third of the continent’s needs.The effect on business is also widespread, from airlines such as Finnair suffering from airspace bans, to European banks that have large exposure to Russia, to other multinational groups facing reputational damage as well as taking a hit from western sanctions aimed at destabilising the Russian economy. Some big names such as BP have already begun divesting their stakes in Russian companies.And while financial markets are often thrown into convulsion by world events, the current crisis could have much more long-lasting effects, says columnist Rana Foroohar. One of them, she argues, will be a quickening of the shift to a bipolar global financial system — one based on the dollar, the other on the renminbi.Key readsCorporate fallout by sectorExplainer: How central bank sanctions could hobble RussiaList of sanctions on Russian individuals and institutionsFor up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our live blogThe Covid surge in Hong Kong intensified, filling up hospitals and mortuaries and prompting an exodus of residents.

36  FTSE 100 gold producer Polymetal lost half its market value on Monday as the west ramped up sanctions on Russia over its attack on Ukraine and one of its biggest shareholders prepared to sell.Shares in the London-listed company, which operates eight mines and a state of the art processing plant in Russia and Kazakhstan, dropped 56 per cent to 351.2p, its lowest level since listing in London more than a decade ago.Analysts said investors were dumping stocks exposed to Russia after the EU, UK and US announced new economic restrictions on Moscow over the weekend.“There is a wall of sellers and very few buyers,” said Jonathan Guy, analyst at Berenberg. “It’s a crazy market.”Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, one of Polymetal’s top 10 shareholders, has said it will dump all of its Russian investments as part of a wider package of support for Ukraine.Analysts expect Polymetal, whose £1.6bn value is down from £7bn a year ago, to declare a final dividend of 75 cents a share when it reports results on Wednesday.Analysts reckon the money needed to cover the dividend has already been sent to Polymetal’s bank account in Cyprus but the company could decide not to make the payment and preserve cash in light of heightened market volatility.“Obviously that’s a big concern for Polymetal shareholders because a lot of them hold it for the dividend as much as the gold exposure,” said Guy.Polymetal makes most of its revenue from selling gold to Russian banks, which in turn dispose of the metal on international gold markets. But it also sells concentrated gold ore to China where it is processed by local smelters.With domestic Russian banks effectively cut off from the international banking system, domestic producers will be looking to Russian’s central bank as the buyer of last resort, according to analysts. This should provide them with the roubles needed to pay wages and supplies.The London Bullion Market Association, which oversees London’s $5tn gold market, has already revoked the membership of three Russian banks — Otkritie, VTB and Sovcombank.Russia’s central bank on Sunday said it would resume gold purchases two years after it ended a long-running buying spree that helped prop up local producers.It stepped up its purchases of gold following the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and at the end of November last year was sitting on a hoard of just under 2,300 tonnes, according to the World Gold Council.At current prices, its gold stockpile — the sixth largest in the world — is worth $153bn and accounts for roughly a fifth of the bank’s official reserves.Polymetal was not the only Russian gold miner hit hard on Monday, with Petropavlovsk falling 15 per cent to a three-year low of 8p. The gold producer needs to refinance a bond in November in which roughly $300mn of principal is outstanding.Peter Malin-Jones, analyst at Peel Hunt, said that while the company would be able to refinance the loan with Russian banks it was not clear how it would repay bondholders.“The challenge is not refinancing the facility but actually repaying it,” he said.Polymetal ended 2021 with net debt of $1.65bn, according to Guy. Almost 40 per cent of its debt is with European banks and if it is forced to refinance that debt domestically or with Chinese banks it is likely to face higher rate of interest, he said.
37  A majority of Finns are in favour of joining Nato for the first time in the Nordic country’s history as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine pushes the once neutral state and its neighbour Sweden towards the military alliance.A poll for Finland’s state broadcaster Yle showed 53 per cent of Finns supported joining Nato, 28 per cent were against and 19 per cent did not know. The last time Yle conducted such a poll in 2017 only 19 per cent were in favour of joining while 53 per cent were against.Former Finnish prime minister Alex Stubb called it a “historic shift”. It follows a similar rise in support for Nato membership in Sweden.Both Finland and Sweden are militarily non-aligned but have not been neutral since joining the EU and have the closest partnerships with Nato of any non-member countries. Nato recently said it would share its intelligence on Ukraine with them, in addition to conducting exercises and exchanging information before Russia’s invasion.The Yle opinion poll published on Monday showed the majority in favour of Nato membership increased in the event that either the country’s political leadership advocated it or if Sweden joined the alliance. There is at present no political majority in either country in favour of membership. But even prominent Finnish opponents of joining Nato concede they could be won over if geopolitical tensions continued to build in the region.Analysts said the increase in support for Nato in Finland and Sweden represented one of the main negative consequences for Russian president Vladimir Putin over his war against Ukraine. “The unthinkable might start to become thinkable,” former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt said about the Finnish poll.Russia’s foreign ministry repeated last week its message that “Finland’s accession to Nato would have serious military and political repercussions”.Finnish and Swedish politicians have brushed aside such warnings, reiterating in the past two months that they have the option of joining Nato as sovereign states.The Baltic countries in particular have long argued in favour of membership for Finland, with its highly trained military that beat the Soviet Union in the 1939-40 winter war, and Sweden, whose island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea is regarded as a strategic outpost.Rihards Kols, head of the foreign affairs committee of Latvia’s parliament, told the Financial Times: “Their membership would only improve regional security and the ability to deter the aggressor. Whenever I met my Finnish and Swedish colleagues I always ask: ‘When are you joining Nato?’”Finland and Sweden have both broken with tradition to send military equipment to Ukraine. Sweden is sending 5,000 anti-tank missiles, the first time it has sent defence equipment abroad since it helped Finland in the winter war. “This is a huge change in mindset,” added Kols.Finland’s centre-left government said on Monday night that it would send 2,500 assault rifles together with 150,000 rounds as well as 1,500 anti-tank weapons to Ukraine.
38  Boris Johnson on Monday distanced himself from comments by his foreign secretary Liz Truss after she expressed support for Britons who want to go to Ukraine to fight against Russian armed forces.Truss on Sunday said she would “absolutely” support British citizens who wished to volunteer to fight in defence of Ukraine, saying the battle was crucial to protecting “freedom and democracy” in Europe.But Downing Street said that while “we fully recognise the strength of feeling in British people wanting to support Ukrainians”, the government advised against travel to the country.There was further UK policy confusion when the prime minister’s official spokesperson said the government backed regime change in Russia, only for Downing Street to then retract the statement.The British government has said it will not send troops to fight alongside Ukraine’s armed forces after Russia’s President Vladimir Putin launched a full invasion of the country last week.Asked if she would back Britons going to Ukraine to help in the fight, Truss told the BBC on Sunday: “I do support that and of course that is something people can make their own decisions about. If people want to support that struggle I would support them in doing that.”But UK government officials suggested privately on Monday that it may be illegal for Britons to travel to Ukraine in order to take up arms.Defence secretary Ben Wallace warned untrained volunteers not to go against the UK travel advice and suggested said there were “better ways” for Britons to assist amid this “dangerous” situation.Meanwhile, the Kremlin suggested Putin’s move to put Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert followed “unacceptable” statements made by Truss over the weekend.Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesperson, said: “There were statements by various representatives at different levels about possible conflict situations and even confrontations and clashes between Nato and the Russian Federation.“We consider such statements absolutely unacceptable. I will not name the authors of these statements, although it was the British foreign secretary.”It was unclear which statements by Truss were deemed unacceptable. As well as backing Britons travelling to Ukraine to fight the Russian forces, Truss also raised concern about other countries getting sucked into the conflict, plus Nato.She told Sky News the conflict “is about freedom and democracy in Europe because if we don’t stop Putin in Ukraine, we are going to see others under threat: the Baltics, Poland, Moldova and it could end up in a conflict with Nato”.UK government officials described Putin’s nuclear alert as a “distraction technique” from Russia’s “slower than expected” military progress in Ukraine.One said: “Nothing Liz has said warrants that sort of escalation, and we obviously take it very seriously and want to keep the situation calm.”Meanwhile, Johnson’s official spokesperson said the sanctions imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine were designed to “bring down the Putin regime”.However, challenged on whether removing Putin was official UK policy, Downing Street quickly retracted the statement. “The prime minister’s view is that Putin’s regime, and Putin, must be treated like a pariah state,” it said.
39  Switzerland broke with its longstanding tradition of political neutrality on Monday, announcing that it intended to match EU sanctions on Russia — including those directed personally against President Vladimir Putin — in response to the invasion of Ukraine.The step was a “unique and difficult” decision but “morally” imperative because of Russia’s brutal military campaign against its neighbour, federal president Ignazio Cassis said at in a press conference in Bern, flanked by three other members of the country’s seven-person ruling executive.“In view of the violation of international rights in recent days, the Federal Council has chosen to respect those values that form the basis of our civilisation,” Cassis said.Switzerland will mirror the full range of EU sanctions applied on February 23 and 25, the government said.As well as targeted asset freezes against Russians and Russian organisations, Bern said it would implement a travel ban on five oligarchs close to Putin. Visa-facilitation services — which have made it easier for all Russians to enter Switzerland since 2009 — will also now be ended, including for holders of diplomatic passports. Swiss airspace has been closed to all Russian airlines since 3pm local time on Monday.Long seen as one of the world’s most accommodating countries for Russians to party and do business in, Switzerland will now become one of the least accessible.Finance minister Ueli Maurer said he did not expect the measures to affect the Swiss financial system. Russian wealth accounts for about 1 per cent of annual foreign direct investment into Switzerland, he told reporters, equivalent to about SFr7.5bn ($8.2bn), based on government data.He added that matters could change as a result of the consequences of the war. As well as being a location for Russian personal wealth, Switzerland is also a foreign hub for some of the country’s biggest businesses — including the state-owned gas giant Gazprom and Nord Stream 2.A significant portion of Putin’s alleged wealth has, in recent years, been traced to the country: the 2016 “Panama papers” leak of documents from the offshore law firm Mossack Fonseca allegedly identified millions held in Zurich by the Russian cellist Sergei Roldugin, apparently on behalf of the Russian president.The Swiss have come under increasing pressure in recent days from European allies to act against Russia, even though doing so transgresses the country’s longstanding — and almost politically sacrosanct — commitment to international neutrality.EU high representative Josep Borrell said he was “very happy” with the Swiss decision to move in lockstep with the bloc in its efforts to punish Russian belligerence. Russian oligarchs have now lost a major haven for wealth in Europe, he added.Bern has meanwhile continued to stress it is still hopeful of a diplomatic resolution to the Ukraine crisis, and repeated an earlier offer of mediation between Kyiv and Moscow made last week.
40  The closure of Russia’s stock market on Monday and restrictions on the trading of Russian equities and bonds in international markets means these securities will no longer meet index providers’ minimum liquidity requirements needed for their inclusion in benchmarks such as the MSCI Emerging Markets index and JPMorgan Emerging Markets Bond (EMBI) indices. Index providers generally make changes in financial benchmarks on a quarterly basis but these arrangements have been thrown into disarray by the international sanctions imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. MSCI discussed whether to remove Russian stocks at a meeting of its index policy committee over the weekend after imposing a freeze on all Russian securities that are constituents in its benchmarks on February 24. Another meeting of the committee has been arranged for today. “The Russian market is effectively closed. It is now uninvestable. Excluding Russian stocks from MSCI’s indices may be the next step but that decision has not yet been made formally by the index policy committee. If we were to make this decision, we would consult with clients and give as much notice as possible before implementing this decision.” said Dimitris Melas, head of index research and chair of the index policy committee at MSCI. MSCI’s policy is to announce index changes after the close of the US market and, where feasible, it aims to provide advance notice of at least two full business days before implementation. It also usually holds a lengthy consultation with its clients about possible changes to index constituents, a process that is likely to be accelerated to just a few days given the fast-changing nature of the Russia crisis.More than $60bn sits in exchange traded funds that follow the MSCI emerging markets index but this is only a portion of the undisclosed total in index-tracking mutual funds, segregated mandates and structured products that are tied to the benchmark.Investors in all of these products will incur losses once investment managers try to sell any Russia holdings, given that any potential buying interest is likely to be minimal until the Ukraine crisis is solved. Russian stocks account for 2.2 per cent of the MSCI emerging markets index, making it the eighth-largest country constituent in the benchmark. Russia’s weighting has shrunk from 3.6 per cent at the start of the year as investors have reacted to the growing tensions over Ukraine. Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank and a target of sanctions, is the third-largest Russian stock in the index, after the energy companies Gazprom and Lukoil.On Saturday, Mateusz Morawiecki, the Polish prime minister, called on MSCI to act following the decision by international governments to remove some of Russia’s banks from Swift, the global interbank payments network.“We also have to address the MSCI index, not only Swift. And our sanctions have to relate not only to the Russian oligarchs, but also more broadly to Russian business,” Morawiecki told German news broadcaster ZDF.JPMorgan is expected to announce after the close of the US market on Monday that it will remove Russian bonds from the environmental, social and governance (ESG) based versions of its widely followed emerging market bond indices. However, it is unlikely that any announcement regarding the wider family of emerging market indices will be made today, according to someone with knowledge of the matter. Russia’s weight within JPMorgan’s EMBI family of hard currency-denominated sovereign debt ranges from 4.9 per cent for the EMBI+ index to 1.6 per cent of its EMBI Global Diversified version. These indices are tracked by $415bn of assets. Russia’s weight in the local currency equivalent, tracked by $245bn of money, has fallen from 4.4 per cent to 3.6 per cent since the start of the year.Timothy Ash, a fixed-income strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, said index providers should stop stalling and kick Russia out immediately. “Governments should be telling index providers to wake up. They cannot operate with their heads in the sand,” said Ash. Click here to visit the ETF Hub
41  Russian bonds tumbled on Monday as investors braced themselves for the possibility that the latest round of western sanctions on Russia could push Moscow to default on its debt for the first time since 1998.US and European moves over the weekend to cut Russia off from the global financial system, as Moscow stepped up its invasion of Ukraine, have fanned concerns that foreign holders of Russian debt will not be able to receive interest or principal payments.Sanctions against the Russian central bank are expected to seriously hamper its attempts to deploy its more than $600bn of foreign reserves to shore up its finances, leaving markets contemplating the possibility that a country with debt of only 20 per cent of gross domestic product could fail to repay lenders.Russian president Vladimir Putin on Monday afternoon fanned fears over a government default by announcing a ban on all Russian residents from transferring foreign currency abroad, including to service overseas debts.“A Russian default is now a real possibility,” said Tim Ash, economist at BlueBay Asset Management. “It’s utterly staggering how the mighty have fallen.”Russia’s dollar-denominated bonds plummeted on Monday, with its largest — a $7bn bond maturing in 2047 — halving in price to 33 cents on the dollar, a level associated with high levels of distress, according to Tradeweb data.The moves came after S&P Global downgraded Russia’s credit rating to “junk” status late on Friday.The cost of buying derivatives that insure against a Russian debt default soared. The price of Russian credit default swaps, which offer holders an insurance-like payout if the country defaults, rose sharply, with five-year CDS surging 20 percentage points to 37 per cent on an “upfront” basis, according to traders in the derivatives market.CDS flips to being quoted on an “upfront” basis when fears of financial distress become elevated. This is because the cost of buying protection against default soars well above the standard running cost defined in the derivative contracts, so traders start quoting the additional payment they require at the start of the transaction.The trading levels on Monday mean it would cost $37mn to insure $100mn of debt against default for five years, on top of $1mn a year in premiums.A Russian default would be painful for overseas investors, who are already reeling from the decline in bond prices. At the start of the year, foreigners held $20bn of Russian foreign currency debt, as well as local debt worth more than 3tn roubles.Some investors cautioned against reading too much into bond prices given the extremely strained trading conditions on Monday. “I think the current pricing might be depressed by forced liquidation, and does not correctly reflect default probabilities,” said one fund manager.Russia might even prefer to refuse to repay its debt to conserve precious dollars, given the sanctions on the central bank, said one emerging markets fund manager. However, he added that Monday’s price declines were driven by some holders being forced to sell their bonds and “do not correctly reflect default probabilities”.While the Russian state had a strong balance sheet before its invasion of Ukraine, traders and investors are increasingly worried that sanctions and other measures could prevent it from making interest payments to international investors. These technical factors could still trigger a payout on the CDS contracts.There are also growing concerns these factors could interfere with the process used to determine the payouts on CDS contracts, as it requires traders to deliver Russian bonds into an auction.“The risk in our view might arise in a scenario where current restrictions are potentially extended to include a complete ban on secondary trading,” Citigroup credit analysts wrote in a note to clients on Friday.Ray Attrill, a strategist at National Australia Bank, warned that a Russian sovereign default would also echo through the European banking system, estimating that banks in France and Italy each own about $25bn of Russian government bonds, and Austrian banks held roughly $17.5bn of exposure.“A default would be of macroeconomic significance,” he said. “It would have significant implications for bank balance sheets and lending capability — as we last saw post the 2011-2012 Greek debt crisis and restructuring.”
42  Roman Abramovich is in Belarus “trying to help” end the war in Ukraine after Kyiv asked him to assist in peace talks, a spokesperson for the Russian-Israeli billionaire told the Financial Times.The spokesperson said the Chelsea football club owner “was contacted by the Ukrainian side for support in achieving a peaceful resolution, and that he has been trying to help ever since”.Talks between Russia and Ukraine began on Monday on the Belarusian border, five days after Russian president Vladimir Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine. Kyiv is demanding an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine.David Arakhamia, head of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky’s party in parliament, confirmed that Abramovich was playing an “advocacy” role in the negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow.“Yes I confirm this. He is [in an] advocacy role.no idea who invited him but he plays very positive role in the process,” said Arakhamia, who took part in Monday’s negotiations.The Kremlin declined to comment on Abramovich’s involvement.Alexander Rodnyansky, a Kyiv-born film producer, said Ukrainian officials asked him to broker the talks after reaching out to the Russian-speaking Jewish community in the hope of finding a suitable intermediary.“The Ukrainians had been trying to find someone in Russia who could help in finding a peaceful resolution,” Rodnyansky said. “They reached out for help and Roman is the person who decided to help and to mobilise support for a peaceful resolution.”Rodnyansky said Abramovich’s influence over the Kremlin “was limited” but added that the billionaire was the only Russian figure who had agreed to help.“I don’t know if there will be impact but we know Zelensky’s staff and I am from the Ukraine and they are grateful for the efforts,” Rodnyansky said.Abramovich’s involvement comes after he said on Saturday that he would relinquish “stewardship” of his English Premier League club, a move that a friend of the billionaire said was an effort to get ahead of any potential sanctions he could face over his links to the Kremlin.A day after Abramovich stepped back from running Chelsea, the club released a statement saying: “The situation in Ukraine is horrific and devastating. Chelsea FC’s thoughts are with everyone in Ukraine. Everyone at the club is praying for peace.”Abramovich’s daughter Sofia, 27, shared a post on Instagram last week that read: “Putin wants a war with Ukraine,” according to screenshots posted on social media. “The biggest and most successful lie of Kremlin’s propaganda is that most Russians stand with Putin,” it said.Abramovich’s role in the Ukraine-Russian negotiations was first reported by the Jerusalem Post.Abramovich earned his fortune in Russia’s turbulent 1990s by acquiring privatised oil and gas assets from the state, then selling them back to the Kremlin at a large profit.His ownership of Chelsea, which he bought in 2003, has made him a household name in English football and beyond, as well as making him a symbol of Russian billionaires with a large footprint in the UK.He owns an estate on the so-called Billionaires’ Row in Kensington Palace Gardens and, together with business partner Alexander Abramov, controls London-listed steelmaker Evraz.In 2018, Abramovich withdrew his UK visa renewal application after authorities delayed its processing following the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury with a nerve agent. He has remained active in club affairs but prefers to watch most of Chelsea’s matches on television, according to friends. The oligarch became an Israeli citizen in 2018 and obtained a Portuguese passport in 2021.
43  With the Russian stock market suspended by its central bank, the VanEck Russia ETF, which is traded on the CBOE and has around $1.3bn of assets, is almost the next best thing we have to see how traders are weighing the effect of Western sanctions on the Eurasian nation.And the answer — down 27.5 per cent today in morning trading — says it all.For those who want to know, here’s how its portfolio looked as of the end of last month:With the ADRs (shares deposited in a foreign bank, and then made available to trade on a foreign exchange in the local currency) of its 2nd largest position, Sberbank, down 70 per cent in the UK this Tuesday, a haircut of a third just might be the best it’s going to get for a while for those who decided to bottom fish Russian stocks over the past few weeks.Click here to visit the ETF Hub
44  Spilling red ink over stranded assets is becoming a habit at BP. Russia’s assault on Ukraine could result in even bigger writedowns than the climate change-related ones in 2020. Jettisoning its near-20 per cent stake in Russian state oil company Rosneft could incur non-cash charges of up to $25bn. But the reputational damage to the UK-listed oil group of continuing to do business in Russia would have been much greater.The $25bn, which includes $11bn of accumulated foreign exchange losses, is the charge for a complete write-off. BP need not go so far. It could trim that by opting to write down just the difference between the market value and $14bn book value until it finds a buyer. That would be a struggle, though not impossible. A state-backed Chinese or Middle Eastern group might be interested.Other energy companies with large Russian investments will also come under pressure to divest. Norway’s Equinor has already made a move. Shell is ending its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and is pulling back from all its joint ventures with Kremlin-backed Gazprom. ExxonMobil owns a big stake in projects in the Russian Far East. TotalEnergies has a 19.4 per cent interest in Russian natural gas producer Novatek. The pressure might even extend to Russian allies. Italy’s Eni, for example, is heavily involved in Kazakhstan.But the Rosneft stake was particularly high-profile. BP can afford to take the hit. Rosneft was likely to account for 6 per cent of cash flow from operations in 2022, according to Jefferies. Losing that will not undermine its distribution policy even if BP cannot sell the stake. The company is on track to increase its dividend at 4 per cent a year to the end of 2025. The share price, though down about 6 per cent on Monday, is still marginally ahead for the year.Shedding its stake in Rosneft will help accelerate BP’s realignment away from oil and gas. Its ownership of a company with very different climate ambitions had long jarred. Given the mounting political dangers of doing business with Russia, the divestment of the Rosneft stake should have happened years ago.
45  Six Turkish opposition parties pledged to overhaul the country’s electoral laws and institutions as they signed an “historic” pact aimed at bringing an end to president Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s almost two decades in power.Leaders of the country’s biggest political parties — with the exception of a key pro-Kurdish party — on Monday vowed to limit Erdogan’s role and restore the rule of law after what they say is years of democratic backsliding as the president established a system of one-man rule.“We are determined to build a strong, liberal, democratic and fair system that establishes the separation of powers with an effective and participatory legislature, a stable, transparent and accountable executive, an independent and impartial judiciary,” their joint declaration said.Kemal Kilicdaroglu, of the secularist Republican People’s party (CHP) and Meral Aksener, of the right-wing IYI party, were among the party leaders who signed a pact that marked the most significant moment in an effort by Erdogan’s rivals to unite against him that began five years ago.They were joined by Ali Babacan and Ahmet Davutoglu, who both served as senior ministers under Erdogan in the past but later quit his ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) to form two separate breakaway groups. Two other small parties, the Islamist Saadet (Felicity) party and right-wing Democrat party also took part.The declaration took place against the backdrop of mounting public discontent about the economy, particularly soaring inflation that reached almost 50 per cent last month, that has eroded the popularity of Erdogan and AKP.In a nod to the country’s deep cultural and social faultlines, the six parties said that they strived to build a democratic country “where individuals can freely express their thoughts as equal and free citizens and live in accordance with their beliefs”.Seren Selvin Korkmaz, executive director of the Istanbul-based think-tank IstanPol, described the declaration as “a historic day for Turkey”, adding that the fragmentation and polarisation of Turkey’s opposition had hampered their ability to present a credible challenge to Erdogan. “It is crucial because these kinds of regimes are very vulnerable when the opposition is united,” she said. At the heart of the declaration was a promise to abolish the presidential system of governance, introduced in 2018 after a referendum, that has concentrated huge powers in the hands of Erdogan.Other pledges included placing a seven-year term limit on the president and stripping the leader and his council of ministers of powers to announce a state of emergency.The six parties vowed to implement rulings by the constitutional court and European Court of Human Rights — something that Erdogan has repeatedly refused to do in recent years. They said that they would guarantee the independence of Turkey’s central bank, which has faced heavy interference from Erdogan in recent years. The president’s rivals face an uphill struggle in convincing voters that they could fix the country’s economy and, if they win, repairing institutions, analysts say.Despite the show of unity, tensions remain over who will be the opposition’s joint presidential candidate.Notable in their absence from Monday’s event was the Peoples’ Democratic party (HDP). A left-wing party with strong links to the country’s minority Kurdish population, the HDP helped the opposition alliance to win control of Turkey’s largest cities in 2019 local elections. The party’s supporters will be crucial to any campaign to defeat Erdogan but are seen as too divisive to have an official role within the opposition.
46  The US has taken its most aggressive step yet to cripple Russia’s economy and financial system, announcing a ban on transactions with Russia’s central bank and new sanctions on the Russian Direct Investment Fund and its chief executive Kirill Dmitriev, a key ally of President Vladimir Putin.The move by the US Treasury on Monday morning follows a joint pledge by western nations on Saturday to block Russia’s ability to access roughly $630bn in foreign reserves and impose huge costs on its economy in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine.A senior Biden administration official said the new measures would take effect immediately and were unveiled before US markets opened on Monday to prevent “asset flight”, after learning that the Russian central bank was trying to “move” some of its foreign reserves around.“The unprecedented action we are taking today will significantly limit Russia’s ability to use assets to finance its destabilising activities, and target the funds Putin and his inner circle depend on to enable his invasion of Ukraine,” said Janet Yellen, US treasury secretary.The US Treasury said its Office of Foreign Assets Control would prohibit US individuals from engaging in any transactions with Russia’s central bank, its national wealth fund and its finance ministry. In addition, the US said it would place sanctions on the RDIF, Russia’s most prominent sovereign wealth fund, as well as Dmitriev to stop Putin and his inner circle from raising funds abroad, including in the US.  “This fund and its leadership are symbols of deep-seated Russian corruption and influence peddling globally,” a senior Biden administration official said.US officials described the actions taken on Monday as an attempt to neutralise Russia’s efforts to create an economic buffer in recent years with the accumulation of foreign reserves. “If their currency was plummeting, they could use those reserves to support the rouble and to defend it,” said one senior Biden administration official, adding that the US steps would “nullify” that “insurance policy”.However, the US Treasury said it would issue a licence to allow “certain energy-related transactions” with the Russian central bank, as the Biden administration sought to mitigate some of the fallout on global energy prices and the US economy.Despite Russia’s efforts in recent years to reduce its exposure to the dollar and its large domestic stockpile of gold, a large portion of its reserves reside overseas. The largest share is held in China, at more than 14 per cent, but the bulk of the remaining reserves are in the US, Germany, France, the UK, Austria and Japan.Russia will continue to earn large amounts of foreign exchange, however, through its oil and gas sales, which have helped to bolster its current account surplus to a record $19bn. The proceeds could then be used to shore up the economy and pay for imports.Still, the move by the US and its allies to impose sanctions on Russia’s central bank led to a sharp drop in the value of the rouble on Monday, an emergency interest rate increase by Russia’s central bank, and a meeting between Putin and his economic advisers at the Kremlin.In a speech delivered on Monday, Russia’s central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina said the condition of the Russian economy had “altered dramatically” but pledged to “use the necessary tools very flexibly” to deal with the “totally abnormal situation”.A senior Biden administration official said inflation was likely to spike, while purchasing power and investment were likely to drop in the country. “This is a negative and vicious feedback loop that Putin has triggered,” the official said.
47  The writer is professor of law at University College London and author of ‘East West Street: On the Origins of Genocide and Crimes against Humanity’President Vladimir Putin’s decision to launch attacks on Ukraine poses the gravest challenge to the post-1945 international order, one premised on the idea of a rule of law and principles of self-determination for all peoples and the prohibition of the use of force. It is not the first time that Russia has taken a military interest in the territories it now seeks to occupy: in September 1914, Russia occupied the city of Lviv, causing tens of thousands to flee westward, including my ten-year-old grandfather. The Soviet Union returned in September 1939 for a second bite, and then again in the summer of 1944, remaining in control until Ukraine achieved independence in 1991.The use of Russian military force in these areas is therefore not unfamiliar, although for Europeans who have lived for three generations without experiencing it on such a scale, last week’s events have been a shock. History does not just go away, and memories are easily reignited. One of the differences today is that rules exist to protect us from such actions, reflected in the Charter of the United Nations, the closest thing we have to an international constitution. It is the Charter’s most significant commitments that Putin has shredded. His televised speech offered a set of fanciful reasons for the invasion: a Greater Russia, a fake Ukraine, a Nazi Ukraine, a genocide being committed against ethnic Russians etc. The claims are familiar, of the kind that motivated the 1938 Nazi playbook on Munich and Slobodan Milosevic’s hopes for a Greater Serbia.Putin has gambled, hoping that the west will blink. Following its own failures, including an illegal, failed war in Iraq, and the recent collapse of political will in Afghanistan, along with the embrace of oligarchical money and dependence on Russian gas, he hopes that the west doesn’t have the stomach to stand up to his actions. He may be right, but his bet poses a grave challenge, and one that sanctions and financial measures alone cannot address.Much more is needed, and it is needed fast. In the face of so flagrant a violation of the rules, it is lawful to act jointly to protect Ukraine and the fundamental rights of its people, by offering military hardware, taking steps to prevent Russia from using air power and, ultimately, putting boots on the grounds to enforce safe areas and draw lines that Russia must not be allowed to cross.There is, too, the matter of criminality, even if I am not starry eyed about such labels. Putin’s use of military force is a crime of aggression, the waging of illegal war, an idea that originated at Nuremberg as “crimes against peace”. Horrific images appear to show the targeting of civilians, which is a war crime, and may well also be a crime against humanity (a legal concept with origins which, like the term genocide, may be traced to the city of Lviv). The International Criminal Court — a child of the Nuremberg Tribunal — has jurisdiction over some of these crimes (war crimes and crimes against humanity, but not the crime of aggression) committed on the territory of Ukraine. Russians are subject to its jurisdiction, and being president does not confer immunity. The ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, has the power to open a formal investigation and, if the evidence supports and the judges authorise, to proceed to an indictment and prosecution.The ICC has a gap, however, as its jurisdiction does not yet extend to the crime of aggression perpetrated on the territory of Ukraine. Why not create a dedicated international criminal tribunal to investigate Putin and his acolytes for this crime? After all, it was a Soviet jurist, Aron Trainin, who did much of the legwork to bring “crimes against peace” into international law. As Francine Hirsch has noted in her book Soviet Judgment at Nuremberg, it was largely Trainin’s ideas that persuaded the Americans and the British to put “crimes against peace” into the Nuremberg Statute and the indictments against the German defendants.Putin knows all about Nuremberg: his older brother died in the Leningrad siege at the age of two, and he seems to be something of a defender of the famous 1946 judgment. Three years ago he castigated the European Parliament for challenging the Tribunal’s conclusions, to the effect that it was the 1938 “Munich Betrayal” that brought so much horror, allowing Czech territories to be annexed in the forlorn hope of appeasing Hitler.There can be no appeasing of Putin. Chechnya, Georgia, Crimea and now all of Ukraine. On it goes. Let him reap what he has sowed, including the legacy of Nuremberg. Investigate him personally for this most terrible of crimes.
48  The writer is defence minister of LatviaRussia’s war against Ukraine is the most significant conflict in Europe since the second world war — but its reverberations will be felt well beyond the European continent.Any democratic leader who looks at the Ukrainians’ valiant defence of their country and does not feel ashamed at not providing more weapons to Ukraine has either their heart or their mind in the wrong place. Any leader who still believes that Ukraine should not have been given lethal support, or should not be assisted with all available military equipment, is out of step with the new international order.In invading, Moscow has deliberately chosen to be an enemy of the democratic world. We must support Ukrainians in this fight, but we also have to start rebuilding our own defences. This will be the only way to defend our values, freedom and peace.Changes to longstanding policies are usually the product of a strategic shock. While the best outcome that Russia can hope for in this war is a Pyrrhic victory, it is also abundantly clear that western policy up to now has failed utterly because diplomacy was not backed up militarily. In defending their homeland with such heroism, the Ukrainian people are buying the west time to make amends — we now have to act very swiftly. Our current extraordinary unity must be transformed into action in order to maintain the momentum.Financial sanctions and the ejection of some Russian banks from the Swift cross-border banking network is just a first step. Every day that Russian forces remain on Ukrainian territory more punishment must be visited upon Vladimir Putin’s regime to stop the aggression.So far the Ukrainians have displayed a strength and resolve that has surpassed everyone’s expectations — Russia’s most of all. Thanks to their bravery, resilience and success, there is a real chance that the Russian offensive will be blunted and reduced to a crawl and that the Ukrainian state will endure, with no prospect of a puppet government installed in Kyiv. The Ukrainian people are not giving up. But they need arms to defend themselves.The Baltic states have long understood the kind of existential threat that Ukraine is now facing. For this reason, we have punched above our weight and, with some danger to our own security, moved to help Ukraine shore up its defences, including with Stinger and Javelin missiles. We continue to supply their armed forces with weapons, munition, fuel and other supplies. The military support also given to Ukraine by the US, UK and Poland over the past few months has been exactly what you would expect from countries that have a realistic understanding of Russia’s intentions. Now the whole democratic world is seeing Putin’s true face and has shifted firmly against tyranny.But Ukraine needs more than weapons and hope. It needs membership of the EU and Nato. It would be a disgrace if we did not meet the request for EU accession made by President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday. Ukraine is fighting for a free Europe on our behalf. Since it is fighting our war, it deserves everything it asks for.At the same time, the EU must finally take its own security and defence capabilities seriously. It is clear that Putin lives in an alternate reality in which he nurtures ambitions on the scale of Stalin’s. The nuclear threat he issued over the weekend is an obvious sign of this.European countries need better air defences and more artillery, tanks and other weapons — not endless position papers and new strategies. Nato also has to review its posture on the eastern flank in order to adjust to the new reality, shifting from forward deterrence to defence. Air defence of the Baltic states remains a glaring gap in the alliance’s defence posture, inviting escalation. This gap must be closed as a matter of urgency.A radically new geopolitical situation calls for robust leadership, a clear-eyed assessment of the threats the west faces and resoluteness in defence. With more countries committing military aid to Ukraine and applying ever tougher sanctions on Russia and Putin’s inner circle, we are finally putting adequate defence and deterrence measures in place.There is much that we need to relearn, but one thing is certain: democracy has triumphed over tyranny in the past and it will do so again. But it is important that we have the will to fight for it and the ability to defend ourselves. Ukrainians are fighting for all of us. They deserve better and we will do better. Slava Ukraini!
49  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
50  Half a million Ukrainians have fled the country since the Russian invasion and more than 100 civilians, including children, have been killed, the UN has said.“More than 500,000 refugees have now fled from Ukraine into neighbouring countries,” Filippo Grandi, commissioner of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said on Monday.Many more have been internally displaced, the UNHCR added. The Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights said 102 civilians had been killed so far in the conflict from Thursday morning to Sunday night, including seven children, though it warned the real figure was likely to be considerably higher.“The military attack on Ukraine is putting at risk countless lives,” said Michelle Bachelet, high commissioner for human rights, at the 49th session of the council in Geneva.“Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes,” Bachelet said on Monday. “The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher.“Meanwhile, millions of civilians, including vulnerable and older people, are forced to huddle in different forms of bomb shelters, such as underground stations, to escape explosions,” she said.The UN has ratcheted up its pressure on Moscow, raising its voice on human rights violations in Ukraine in the wake of Russia’s invasion, and said its humanitarian agencies were stepping up their operations in the war-torn country.“Conflict is the utter negation of human rights across the board,” the head of the UN said in a speech on Monday, adding that Russia’s military might in Ukraine was leading to “the escalation of human rights violations”.The “inevitable result of war” has cost civilian lives and driven many from their homes to face hunger, poverty and economic disruption, said António Guterres, the UN secretary-general.“Freedom of expression is under attack, with reports of journalists and activists arrested,” Guterres added. “We must show all people in Ukraine that we stand by them in their hour of need.”His comments came as Nigeria’s president highlighted reports of mistreatment of African refugees fleeing Ukraine, pointing to claims on social media that authorities were preventing black people from boarding buses and trains out of the country.“In one video widely circulating on social media, a Nigerian mother with her young baby was filmed being physically forced to give up her seat to another person,” president Muhammadu Buhari wrote on Twitter on Sunday night. “There are also separate reports of Polish officials simply refusing Nigerian citizens’ entry into Poland from Ukraine.”The government said that 4,000 Nigerians, mostly university students, were stranded in Ukraine.“We understand the pain and fear that is confronting all people who find themselves in this terrifying place. We also appreciate that those in official positions in security and border management will in most cases be experiencing impossible expectations in a situation they never expected,” Buhari added.“All who flee a conflict situation have the same right to safe passage under the UN convention and the colour of their passport or their skin should make no difference.”
51  China has long hoped for independence in cross-border payments and a widely used digital currency. Despite heavy investment and effort, those goals have remained elusive. Now the EU plans to expel some Russian banks from Swift, the world’s interbank payments network. This may just be what China needs to make its version of Swift, the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (Cips), a serious proposition.Backed by China’s central bank, Cips offers clearing and settlement services for cross-border renminbi payments. The small share of the currency in international payments — 2 per cent — means Cips is a long way from challenging Swift. The US dollar remains dominant in global payments with a share of around 40 per cent.Russia, however, may have little choice. There are too many constraints on its own local alternative, SPFS. The Russian central bank set this up in 2014 following previous threats to disconnect its banks in the wake of its invasion of Crimea. But there are only 20 foreign banks on SPFS, too few to make it particularly useful.That compares with more than 1,200 financial institutions in 100 countries, including big global banks, that are active on Cips. More than 20 Russian banks are already connected. Digital payments between the two countries have risen sharply in recent years. So has settlement in renminbi, which quadrupled to almost a fifth of all trade between the two in 2020. Russia’s central bank has invested in Chinese assets even as it has cut exposure to the US and western Europe.Chinese payment solution providers stand to benefit as payment volumes grow. Shares of Client Service International and Lakala Payment rose about 5 per cent on Monday. These Chinese payments fintechs provide third-party services including central bank-led initiatives. Lakala’s stock had fallen 15 per cent over the past year because of the slow rollout of the local digital renminbi.The polarisation of world politics is nudging China and Russia closer together. A common cause for both is to reduce the use of dollars worldwide. Tough new sanctions on Russia give China the chance, via Cips and other projects, to promote the renminbi as an alternative.
52  We’re doing something new, trialling an experiment with audio newsletters read by Microsoft Azure Al.I wish I’d been wrong last week that the first wave of sanctions weren’t enough to deter Vladimir Putin. But if anything it seems I wasn’t optimistic enough that Germany, with its Nord Stream 2 suspension, was finally twigging it had been far too lenient on Russia.Over the weekend a whole swath of international and particularly European, and particularly German, verities about international relations and trade have been hurled overboard. The disinvestments, asset freezing and travel bans, the Swift payment restrictions, the seizure of Russian central bank assets, let alone the defence spending commitments and arms shipments: all breathtaking.We’ll see in the days ahead what impact this battery of policies has, though the market reaction this morning suggests “a lot”. The still-missing bit is restricting Russian gas exports to western Europe, which are excluded from the US financial sanctions. Germany and other countries continued, bizarrely on the face of it, to buy gas through the pipelines in the days after the invasion.Russia can keep going for quite a while on the hard currency from gas exports even if its central banks’ assets are frozen, so to that extent this shoots a big hole in the sanctions package. However, what it also does is severely deter Russia from switching off the gas to blackmail western Europe in case it bankrupts itself. You aren’t much of a monopolist if you don’t have the power to cut production.Below, in a special extended Trade Secrets, we look at how the Ukraine invasion will effect the global trading order, and particularly Europe’s role in it, and the intersection of national security and trade by recalling a recent rather embarrassing incident where the US sided with Russia against Ukraine at the World Trade Organization to punch holes in international law there. Charted waters looks at how regulations have hit cross-border M&A in the pharma sector.Next Monday, the newsletter will be in the extremely capable hands of Trade Secrets alumnus Claire Jones while I take a short break.I’m writing this from Germany. There’s no better place to observe how a new European and international order is being changed in a crisis.Before the invasion, the 1970s Ostpolitik line of engagement rather than confrontation with Russia had a powerful pull. I found a hugely entertaining interview in the New York Times in 1982 headlined “Helmut’s Pipeline”, in which the NYT’s resident conservative William Safire berated the then chancellor Helmut Schmidt of the Social Democratic party for making Germany dependent on Soviet Russian gas. You can still argue engagement with Moscow was the right idea during the cold war, but it was horrendously ill-suited to Putin’s aggressive Russian nationalism, indeed imperialism. Now Olaf Scholz, an SPD chancellor only a couple of months into office, has overturned decades of German certainties.The EU is changing at lightning speed, its member states arming Ukraine and themselves. It’s particularly impressive given that the EU’s initial response to a new challenge (the eurozone sovereign debt meltdown and the migration crisis) tends to be slow, halting and often wrong-headed.What else is changing in the international order? Suddenly, as a club of rich democracies, the G7 has a role again in coordinating sanctions efforts. China, whose presence was deemed necessary for any serious conversation about global governance, is in a rather uncomfortable position in lining up with Russia.Seizing the moment, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky is applying for membership. A few member states (including, predictably, Poland) immediately weighed in on its behalf.Before this weekend I’d have regarded Ukraine joining the EU to be somewhat missing the point apart from as a symbolic move to commit Kyiv to looking westwards. As I argued a few weeks ago (it seems like about a decade now), it was the EU assuming that trade on its own could do the job of foreign policy and signing a politicised “deep and comprehensive free trade agreement” (DCFTA) in 2014 that was the trigger for Putin’s seizing of Crimea.There are still significant issues with meeting a bunch of criteria, even assuming Ukraine will emerge as a free and independent country after the war. The DCFTA hasn’t ended economic dysfunction, and the EU really doesn’t need another corrupt and authoritarian country on its eastern flank.But you can now imagine the EU playing at least a supporting if not a primary security role alongside Nato, coordinating elements of national armed forces even without running its own. The EU does in theory have its own mutual protection clause, but not all member states have signed up and there’s no mechanism to put it into action. If the EU wants to become a fully-fledged security power to match its powers in trade, it’s got a long way to travel yet. Mind you, the rate it’s going it’ll be there by Thursday morning.Heard the one about how the US backed Russia against Ukraine and punched a hole in the web of international law? In 2016, not long after Putin seized Crimea, Ukraine brought a case to the WTO about Russia blocking trade transit across its territory. Russia argued that its actions were justified under a national security exemption to trade rules and it was illegitimate for the WTO dispute settlement system even to judge what its national security needs might be.Traditionally, governments have been sparing in the use of the loophole, acutely aware that widespread use of a self-judging exemption would basically destroy the WTO system. Although not directly affected by the case, the US came down strongly.on Russia’s side, one of those decisions that looked bad at the time and worse now.Why back Putin? Because Donald Trump, absurdly, wanted to invoke national security to block imports of steel and aluminium to the US, including those from staunch foreign policy allies like the EU. A makeshift EU-US deal has put that litigation on hold but similar WTO cases brought by other countries remain pending.The Biden administration continues to maintain some of those tariffs and defend those cases. It says that it’s being reliant on imports at all that’s the problem, even if they’re sourced from allies. But for commodities as generic as steel and aluminium that doesn’t pass the laugh test either.Russia won the case against Ukraine, though importantly the ruling did establish that in principle it was legitimate for WTO dispute settlement to assess the validity of national security concerns. Now, it’s true that WTO rules aren’t of the same fundamental nature as the UN Charter’s protection of peace, security and self-determination. It’s also true that the idea of self-judging national security interests is an established one.But that, in a sense, is the point. It’s not a good look for one of the traditional anchors of the multilateral rule-based system, the US, to cheer on a government like Russia’s and misuse national security loopholes itself. If you’re really going to make trade and strategic policy cohere, national security needs to be invoked transparently and judiciously, not to excuse blatant protectionism.The reshoring crowd will no doubt seize the Ukraine invasion to push their case against whatever imports they and industry lobbyists feel like. But if trade is now a purely unilateral self-determining national security tool you might as well pack up the international order altogether and go back to a system of power relations. Having trade policy try to do national security on its own is a mistake, but then so is allowing spurious national security arguments to dictate trade.Joe Biden made regulation of drug prices and curbs on mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical sector a priority when he was elected US president.As Biden prepares to deliver his first State of the Union address to Congress tomorrow, many analysts say that the administration’s efforts to boost the power of consumers at the expense of the pharmaceutical industry have had only mixed success.Nevertheless, the uncertainties over drug pricing and the Federal Trade Commission’s flagging of tougher antitrust scrutiny have had a chilling impact on dealmaking, as the following chart shows.The Ukraine crisis has set back hopes of a swift global economic recovery from the pandemic.The US is trying to cut Russia off from semiconductor supply.FT journalists assess the possible damage to supply chains from a prolonged war in Ukraine.Australian winemakers, seeking alternative export markets after being blocked by China, are marketing a new brand in the US advertised by criminal celebrities including Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg.
53  The collapse of the Russian rouble has provided another reminder for investors in emerging markets that contagion persists as a risk.From Asia to Latin America, stocks, bonds and currencies fell sharply as markets woke up to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last Thursday. Some of those markets extended their losses on Monday after sanctions against Russia’s central bank at the weekend sent the rouble plunging as much as 29 per cent.“We’re entering a new phase where we get broader EM risk-off given the Russian shock over the weekend,” said Kevin Daly, a debt portfolio manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “The sub-Saharan Africa complex is down 1 to 3 [percentage] points,” he added, referring to sovereign bond prices in the region, which dropped in a flight to quality across global markets.So-called risk-off events, when investors rein in exposure to riskier markets are, it turns out, still bad for EMs as a group.Since the 1990s, when debt crises swept from Asia to Russia to Latin America in rolling waves of contagion, many governments have built buffers to external shocks, such as budget and current account surpluses and large reserves of foreign exchange. But the pandemic has drained those resources, leaving many economies exposed.The immediate impact of the invasion on Russian assets last Thursday was “catastrophic”, said Timothy Ash of BlueBay Asset Management. “I’m staggered that people didn’t think [the invasion] would happen,” he said. The country’s currency, stocks and bonds all fell steeply, dragging other EM assets down almost in tandem.Russia’s markets staged a partial recovery before the weekend but Monday’s collapse of the rouble has renewed jitters in EM. The fallout from widespread sanctions on Russia will have unpredictable effect on banks and financial flows.And even before the sanctions, investors were worried about the impact of higher prices for oil and other commodities on inflation and growth. This spells trouble, especially at a time when emerging market output growth — and the shrinking differential between growth rates in emerging and developed economies — is causing concern for investors.“You have to model this as a classic oil shock, where EMs will inevitably suffer,” said Bhanu Baweja, chief strategist at UBS Investment Bank.It is not only that there are more oil consumers than producers in the benchmark MSCI emerging markets equities index, he notes. As energy and food prices rise — both likely, should the war drag on — developing countries will be hardest hit by inflation, as food and fuel make up a bigger share of household consumption than in advanced economies.Central banks in emerging markets have already shown that they are willing to raise interest rates to avoid any repeat of the runaway inflation that has plagued them in the past, even if this means putting an additional brake on growth. That would add to the threat of stagflation, with slow growth accompanied by rising prices driven by bottlenecks and currency weakness.Ukraine “will play into the global stagflation story”, said Ash. Baweja at UBS said Brazil, where consumer demand is falling short of expectations, provides a test for other emerging markets of whether stagflation will take root.Adding to the mix is uncertainty over US monetary policy. As analysts at BCA Research noted on Friday, a tightening of financial conditions triggered by the conflict might cause the Federal Reserve to slow the pace of interest rate rises. But if rising energy prices keep inflation higher, they added, the opposite may happen.This has profound implications for EM investors. Rising US interest rates suck money out of EM assets and tend to lead to dollar strength, which raises financing costs for developing countries and saps investment.In the short term, many analysts regard a sovereign default by Ukraine as all but inevitable. “I don’t think debt service is a priority in the middle of a war,” said Ash. On Friday, S&P Global Ratings downgraded its ratings on Russian bonds from investment grade to speculative, and moved Ukraine’s deeper into speculative territory. Action by JPMorgan on the position of either country’s bonds in its benchmark indices was likely soon, according to a person familiar with internal discussions.MSCI, the provider of benchmark equity indices, announced a freeze on any changes to the weightings of Russian equities in its indices and said it was considering further actions including deleting certain companies. The longer-term, broader fallout of the Ukraine invasion remains, of course, as uncertain as the war.
54  We’re doing something new, trialling an experiment with audio newsletters read by Microsoft Azure Al.Continuing on with the topic of my most recent Swamp Notes, I want to explore the impact the war in Ukraine might have on deglobalisation and economic decoupling between the west and Russia/China.As I argue in my column today, there’s a strong case to be made that this is a real pivot point for the global financial system. Sanctions against Russia, although completely necessary, will make that country more dependent on China, which will look to settle more and more energy transactions in renminbi. Witness in the past few days gas deals between the two countries and a lifting of a Chinese export ban on Russian wheat. Commodity hoarding and economic nationalism is just getting started.All of this is part of a long-term strategy by China to reduce its dependency on the dollar; both Russia and China have been increasing gold reserves in recent years as part of this effort. We won’t move to a post-dollar world anytime soon (the dollar is 60 per cent of global reserves), but I wouldn’t be surprised to see the renminbi play a much bigger role in the global financial system within, say, the next decade. I also expect China to speed up its selling of US Treasury bills in 2022, which is going to raise a very tricky issue for the Federal Reserve, which is starting its own programme of quantitative tightening (more on that in a future note).In the US, one immediate question is whether war in Ukraine makes America double down on more economic self-sufficiency (or protectionism, depending on your point of view), or whether inflationary pressures actually push businesses (to the extent that they still can) to source more from China and other countries where supplies are still cheap.As I noted a few months back, the Covid-related fears of personal protective equipment shortages didn’t stop various US states from going right back to buying cheap Chinese masks as soon as they were available. As you might remember, China hoarded them at the start of the coronavirus outbreak for obvious reasons. Businesses worried about keeping margins up in the wake of already spiralling inflation may be inclined to try and source as cheaply as they can, wherever they can. Certainly, they are lobbying to keep the loopholes that allow them to do so.But, as I argued in a column last week, that may no longer be politically possible. Countries worried about conflict are likely to try and build as much self-sufficiency as possible, looking to bolster national or regional supply chains and to find new sources for raw materials. Witness Germany pulling the plug on Nord Stream 2 (it’s about time) and European politicians starting to talk about speeding up the transition to clean energy in order to reduce dependence on Russia once and for all. See also the semiconductor chip wars that are at the heart of the new Great Power conflict between the US and China, with Europe somewhere in between as per usual.In the short term, though, nobody can go it alone. In an ideal world, US energy could fill the gap for Europe, but Americans are already exporting about as much as they can to the continent (indeed, the lack of additional US shale energy for export is a cudgel that Republicans are now using to try and undermine Joe Biden’s investment in green energy). I’m expecting energy prices to rise and for US shale oil to become very important once again.Meanwhile, Russia and China are drawing closer to Iran.To me, this would be an ideal time for the US and Europe to come together and war game a new energy security strategy to buffer European vulnerabilities in the short term, and a longer-term agreement about how to approach climate change (how wonderful would it be if the two regions together took the lead on cutting-edge clean technology such as green batteries, rather than ceding that territory to China). I also think that they need a strategy not only for de-dollarisation but de-euroisation, as Russian energy no longer flows to the continent.I may be desperately hoping for upside here, but perhaps Russia’s actions have the potential to strengthen transatlantic ties and turn what seemed to be a tripolar world with the US, Europe and China heading in different directions, into a more bipolar one. That would probably be a more stable world. Gideon would you agree? And, to put the question you asked me last week back to you, what am I getting wrong about the European world view?With the Ukrainians fighting back and Putin waving his nukes around, it’s hard to concentrate on the economics.But you raise some crucial and fascinating issues. I think one of the Russian calculations from the beginning has been that China would “backfill” for them on sanctions — and that the special relationship between Putin and Xi would mean that Russia could never be isolated, and the economic damage could be managed.I think the Chinese would like to help. But they will be thinking very carefully about the risk of American and EU secondary sanctions. What if a Chinese bank tries to do business with one of the Russian financial institutions that the west has targeted — such as Sberbank or VTB. Might they find themselves targeted by American financial sanctions and cut off from the dollar market? Chinese financial institutions have been wary of running that risk — even when their own nation’s interests are in play. My favourite anecdote on this topic is that Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive officer, cannot find a bank that will deal with her — even in Hong Kong — and has to be paid in cash because she has been targeted by US sanctions.The same goes for semiconductors. Will Chinese suppliers fill the gap left by the west in the Russian market? Very tempting — unless it means you get cut off from US tech and markets, as a result.Finally, you ask about European attitudes. I think there has been a total mood shift in the past couple of days. Look at the shifts by the German government on military aid to Ukraine, on a Swift ban for Russia and on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. These are policies that Germany has opposed for many months, if not years. But they have been pushed through in days.I think Europeans suddenly feel that peace on their continent and their freedom is at stake, and they are now ready for some economic hardship in order to hit back at Russia. The transatlantic alliance has also been revived, and I give credit to the Biden administration for their patience in working with the Europeans. I shudder to think what would have happened if Trump had been in power.Edward Luce is on book leave and will return in mid-March.And now a word from our Swampians.In response to ‘Biden, Trump and the “who lost Ukraine” debate’: “If the US and Europe would have had more foresight when the Berlin Wall fell and Gorbachev was open to democracy. We should have pumped money in there to reboot their economy, Russia would have been a democracy by now. We left them in the cold then, missed our chance and are harvesting the results now.” — Pieter Walraven, Unawatuna, Sri LankaIn response to ‘It’s the geopolitics, stupid’: “Is it really important for the US to concentrate on the proliferation of democracy in the world rather than simply becoming a good citizen of the world and minding its own business?.If you look at the continental European constitutions of labour rights, you will notice that in our factories and offices the workers are much more invited and empowered to raise their voices than even in the US.” — Hartmut Oertel, Freiburg, Germany
55  Greetings from New York where I, like many, have been unable to take my eyes off my Twitter account as horrifying and heartbreaking events unfold following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The events present a mounting challenge to the ESG world.One sign of this came with the dramatic news on Sunday that BP, the British energy group, will divest its stake in Rosneft, the Russian energy company. Another emerged when the $1.3tn Norwegian sovereign wealth fund announced plans to divest its Russian assets too. These moves are likely to encourage further divestments — as we point out below, in a note outlining the list of European companies that are entangled with Russia’s sovereign wealth fund. (Check it out for some surprising names.)Separately, this week we are likely to see a number of western companies announcing aid for Ukrainian refugees and citizens; Elon Musk’s decision to reposition his Starlink satellites to provide internet access for Ukraine is notable in this respect. And there will be intensifying discussions about the green energy implications of the war. Last week, for example, Bill McKibben, the veteran environmental campaigner, told western leaders that “if you want to stand with the brave people of Ukraine, you need to find a way to stand against oil and gas”, to reduce energy dependence on Russia.But it is far from clear whether western governments will listen. Either way, see below for last week’s extraordinary Atlantic wind power auctions and new research on the energy holdings of ESG funds. Also note another fast-developing biodiversity issue that is being overshadowed by the Ukrainian news: the split between consumer groups such as Coca-Cola and Nestlé, and chemical giants such as ExxonMobil, Dow, and Shell in the plastics war. Gillian TettWhat does the following list of companies have in common? Japan’s AEON Infrastructure Corporation, France’s Schneider Electric and Dalkia SA (part of EDF Group), Spain’s waste management company Urbaser, Germany’s wholesale-retailer Metro Cash & Carry, and Siemens Mobility, and Britain’s Aggreko group*.The answer, as one eagle-eyed Moral Money reader has pointed out to us, is that these entities all embarked on joint ventures with Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Russian Direct Investment Fund, in 2019, according to the RDIF website. So did financial companies such as France’s sovereign wealth fund, Italian development institute Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP), the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia, and the United Green Group (the British investment holding entity) to name but a few.So how will ESG investors treat the groups on this list, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine? How will the companies respond? The only honest answer is that we do not know, since events are moving so fast that most corporate boards and investment committees are in a state of shock.What is clear is that this list of companies is just the tip of the iceberg and there will be further scrutiny. Pressure on ESG investors to act is rising, particularly given that Norway’s $1.3tn sovereign wealth fund has decided to cut all its Russian exposures.Meanwhile, corporate boards are taking pre-emptive measures. The most startling of these is the eye-popping $25bn writedown that BP announced yesterday as a result of its divestment of its Rosneft stake. However, this will not be the last. Moral Money will be watching to see how ESG investors respond, and we are keen to hear from readers about where to look. (Gillian Tett)A few years ago my family participated in an initiative to help build housing in a refugee camp in Colombia. After building, my teen daughters decided to tidy up the plastic waste on the dirt tracks around us. Big mistake. As soon as we started yanking the old plastic rubbish out of the ground, more plastic came to the surface. To our shock we realised that the entire camp was living on a large waste fill that was only concealed by a thin layer of dirt, and plastic was quite literally embedded into the hill.That plastic serves as a potent symbol for ESG investors as a UN gathering to cut plastic waste gets under way today in Kenya. Nobody doubts the need for action on biodiversity terms. As Sarah Morath, an associate professor at Wake Forest University, notes in this punchy piece, scientists calculate that by 2025, “some 100mn to 250mn metric tons of plastic waste could enter the ocean each year. Indeed, by 2050 there could be more plastic in the ocean than fish, when measured by weight”. Yikes.This has prompted countries such as Peru and Rwanda to propose measures to cut pollution from the entire plastics supply chain, from chemical production to disposal. This has been backed “by at least 58 countries”, my colleague Camilla Hodgson notes. And some big consumers of plastic, such as Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Unilever and Nestlé, are backing this initiative. They argue that if a treaty emerges that “covers the whole lifecycle of plastics, not just the management of waste, and targets a reduction in the production and use of virgin plastics” this will spark more research and development into plastics alternatives.Plastics makers are, unsurprisingly, opposed to the idea of production cuts. The 190-strong American Chemistry Council group, which includes ExxonMobil, Shell, and Dow, is trying to water down the initiative. They want any deal to focus on reuse of plastics, to promote a circular economy, and measures to tackle waste. Japan and some other developed countries have also pushed for a more modest initiative “that focuses solely on plastic waste in oceans, with an emphasis on what happens to the used material”. The US government seems to back this.Does this make the talks pointless? Not necessarily. Morath points out that the UN and other bodies have brokered international treaties before to tackle issues such as acid rain and mercury contamination, and “plastic [is] a good candidate.[since] like ozone, sulfur and mercury, plastic comes from specific, identifiable human activities that occur across the globe”. Moreover, the US is keen to get a deal, making progress in Kenya more likely.But it will be interesting to see which version of these proposals prevails — and whether the issue becomes a new front for ESG activists and/or sparks activist action against chemicals companies. Until now, campaigns by non-governmental groups have had only limited success. But ESG activists are jumping into all manner of new battles right now, with some unlikely alliances emerging (just look at Carl Icahn’s astonishing battles with McDonald’s in relation to pigs).Either way, it is clear there will be huge business opportunities for any green entrepreneur who can develop a functioning alternative to plastic. Watch this space. (Gillian Tett)Propelled by the global energy uncertainty, which arrived on top of rising inflation, the S&P 500 energy sector is up 23 per cent for the year and is the only sector in positive territory.As stock prices rise they become ever larger holdings in index funds. Now, energy stocks are increasingly becoming larger holdings in ESG ETFs.BlackRock’s iShares “aware” ESG ETF is the world’s largest with $24bn of assets under management. As of February 24, ExxonMobil was the fund’s 24th largest holding, up from 39th place at the end of 2021.In the second-largest ESG ETF in the US, TotalEnergies, the French oil major, is now a top 10 holding, up from 14th place at the end of 2021.The reordering is to be expected. These ETFs track an underlying index, in both cases from MSCI, and passively follow the ebb and flow of the market. But the growth of energy stocks in ESG funds is a reminder to investors that they need to look under the hood to understand what they might be buying.

56  Shares of Germany’s listed defence contractors soared on Monday after Chancellor Olaf Scholz declared the country would pour more than €100bn into modernising its depleted armed forces.Stock of Rheinmetall, which makes tanks and armoured vehicles for Nato countries, rose more than 30 per cent in early trading in Frankfurt, while shares in Munich-based Hensoldt, which makes electronic sensors and is part-owned by US private equity group KKR, leapt by 45 per cent.BAE Systems shares also rose 14 per cent, hitting record highs. The British group has a joint venture with Rheinmetall.Defence companies have previously been shunned by some institutional investors, who are mandated not to invest in weaponry.But Germany’s new commitment to spend more than 2 per cent of annual gross domestic product on defence in the face of Russian aggression, alongside a one-off €100bn, has already led to analysts upping their share-price targets for the contractors.Scholz’s unexpected announcement on Sunday came days after German general Alfons Mais took to LinkedIn to declare that the “Bundeswehr [Germany’s armed forces], the army that I have the privilege of leading, is more or less bare”.He added: “The options that we can offer the politicians to support the alliance are extremely limited.”One European industry executive also cautioned that it would take time for Germany’s defence boost to translate into material orders.“We need to understand what the government wants. As of this morning, we have not had any discussions yet. Cycles are quite long in this industry,” he said.“It takes quite a bit of time to build these types of equipment. While more immediate orders for munitions were more likely, any munitions would need to fit with what Ukraine needed in the short term.” Hensoldt, a spinout from Airbus whose products are incorporated into fighter jets and navy vessels, already relies on German contracts for more than half of its sales. The German development bank KfW is its largest shareholder, giving Berlin the ability to block a hostile takeover attempt.About a third of sales at Rheinmetall, whose origins date back to the 19th century, are connected to German contracts. Rheinmetall had already in February posted record results for the last financial year, and has seen increased demand since the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014.Submarine maker Thyssenkrupp also benefited from Scholz’s announcement, with shares up more than 8 per cent. Shares in Jenoptik, whose electro-optical thermal imagers and rangefinders are used for military reconnaissance, were up more than 5 per cent.With Nato forces being deployed to Ukraine’s neighbouring countries, industry experts expect spending to increase on items such as ammunition. Analysts at Jefferies highlighted Britain’s BAE Systems and Chemring among those companies likely to benefit.Additionally, Germany’s decision to reverse course is expected to boost spending on several pan-European programmes, including the Future Combat Air System to build a new fighter jet that has been mired in disagreements between its industrial partners.Chancellor Scholz said at the weekend that the Bundeswehr needed “new, strong capabilities”, including fighter jets, drones and tanks.Plans are also likely to be accelerated for the Franco-German next generation tank programme, led by a consortium consisting of Germany’s Rheinmetall, Kraus-Maffei Wegmann and France’s Nexter.Analysts at Berenberg said they thought the potential for a follow-on order for the Eurofighter Typhoon by Germany to replace its ageing Tornado aircraft had “strengthened”. The aircraft is made jointly by BAE Systems, Airbus and Italy’s Leonardo.
57  The European Central Bank has warned that the European subsidiaries of Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank, face failure because of the impact of sanctions, as shares tumbled on Monday at those lenders with the most exposure to the country.The European arms of Sberbank are already failing or likely to fail under the weight of western sanctions and after “significant deposit outflows”, according to the ECB.The assessment “follows a rapid and significant deterioration of the liquidity situation” at Sberbank Europe in Austria and its subsidiaries in Croatia and Slovenia, the Single Resolution Board announced on Monday.The SRB, which handles the resolution of failing banks in the EU, said it had suspended payments, enforcement and termination rights — meaning that most payment or delivery obligations stemming from any contract with one of Sberbank’s EU subsidiaries were temporarily suspended.“Depositors will be able to withdraw a daily allowance amount, determined by the respective national resolution authorities,” it said, adding that deposits of up to €100,000 would be protected at the bank. The deposit guarantee is for clients of each subsidiary separately. Sberbank’s Austria-based subsidiary had €13.6bn of assets at the end of last year.Sberbank Europe has about 800,000 retail and corporate customers in central and eastern Europe, with total assets of €13bn. The Russian bank established its European subsidiary when it acquired Austria-controlled Volksbank International in 2012.Sberbank Direct, its online banking operation, has been offering German depositors interest rates of up 1.5 per cent on their savings — much higher than the near-zero rates offered by most domestic lenders.Shares at European banks with the biggest exposure to Russia fell sharply on Monday morning, with Raiffeisen, the Austrian bank that generates close to a third of its profits from the country, falling 18 per cent.Raiffeisen’s shares have fallen more than 50 per cent over the past three weeks, with Monday’s drop in response to western sanctions that sent the rouble tumbling 29 per cent and led to Russia’s central bank raising its main interest rate from 9.5 per cent to 20 per cent.The Austrian lender is one of the three western banks with the biggest operations in Russia, including Italy’s UniCredit and France’s Société Générale. But while all three have a similar share of the Russian domestic market, the country accounts for a far larger portion of Raiffeisen’s profit pool.Shares in UniCredit dropped almost 10 per cent on Monday, down 28 per cent in the past three weeks, while SocGen’s shares, which fell a similar amount on Monday morning, are also down 28 per cent since February 9.By comparison, the Stoxx Europe 600 Banks index fell 5.5 per cent on Monday, and is down 16 per cent over the past three weeks.The three banks’ Russian subsidiaries have not been included in the western sanctions lists, which have focused on domestic players, and they have not been removed from the Swift global payments messaging system.Johann Strobl, chief executive of Raiffeisen, said in a statement: “Our Russian subsidiary bank has a very strong liquidity position and is recording inflows. The capital position is also strong.“Our Russian clients have confidence in our bank. This has been shown time and again in past crises.”UniCredit said it was continuing to watch developments in Russia and that its “capital and liquidity positions remain very strong”.SocGen said its Russian subsidiary, Rosbank, had “mainly local activities and is autonomous in terms of both liquidity and operations”.Shares in state-controlled Sberbank, which did not immediately reply to requests for comment, have fallen more than 50 per cent over the past three weeks as tension on the Ukrainian border escalated into a full Russian invasion.Sberbank was barred from making US dollar transactions last week, while VTB Bank, Russia’s second-biggest lender, had its assets frozen. They are expected to be taken off Swift.Sberbank and VTB account for more than half of Russia’s banking assets. Yet the country’s third-largest lender, Gazprombank, which acts as a conduit for Russia’s gas exports, has not been placed under sanctions.VTB has a subsidiary in Frankfurt that is supervised by the German authorities. VTB Bank (Europe) SE has been prevented from transferring funds back to Russia and is being closely monitored by the Bundesbank, Germany’s central bank, and by BaFin, its financial watchdog.According to BaFin, VTB Bank (Europe) SE is not accepting new customers, but existing ones who are not subject to sanctions can use their accounts as normal.VTB Europe offers retail and corporate banking across Europe, as well as an investment bank, VTB Capital, that has a prominent City of London office facing the Bank of England.Gazprombank has an EU-based operation in Luxembourg called GPB International. But its parent has not been subject to the same sanctions as Sberbank and VTB.“The base case for Russian banks is deteriorating very fast,” said Marco Troiano, head of financial institutions at Scope Ratings.
58  A day before the UN Security Council voted on a US resolution condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Washington reached out to one of its most important Arab partners as it sought to rally support against President Vladimir Putin.The United Arab Emirates had taken a temporary seat on the council this year and US secretary of state Antony Blinken called his Emirati counterpart, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan, to reiterate the “importance of building a strong international response to support Ukrainian” sovereignty.But when it came to the vote on Friday, the UAE ignored Washington’s pleas and instead joined China and India in abstaining in a public display of Abu Dhabi’s frustrations with US policies.For decades the Gulf’s two powerhouses, the UAE and Saudi Arabia, have marched to America’s beat, but Friday’s decision underlines how they are pursuing more independent foreign policies as they deepen relations with Washington’s adversaries in Moscow and Beijing.“We no longer need a green light from America or any other western capital to decide on our national interest,” said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, an Emirati political science professor. “We are not with or against — that is the position. If America is upset, they will just have to level with that.”The response of most Gulf states, which for decades have viewed the US as the guarantor of their security, has been muted as they attempt to pursue a neutral stance to preserve co-operation with Moscow on geopolitical and energy issues, while deflecting western accusations that refusing to condemn Russia amounts to support for the invasion.Anwar Gargash, a UAE presidential adviser, said on Sunday the Gulf state “believes that taking sides would only lead to more violence”. He insisted Abu Dhabi’s priority was to “encourage all parties to resort to diplomatic action and to negotiate to find a political solution”.Emile Hokayem, a Middle East expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the UAE’s abstention “at a time of western consensus has surprised some western officials”. But he added that the UAE’s “hedging behaviour has been ongoing for some time”.Both the UAE and Saudi Arabia believe successive US administrations have been disengaging from the Middle East. They have been privately expressing their disgruntlement with US policies since former president Barack Obama was perceived to have ignored the interests of long-term Arab partners during the 2011 popular uprisings and when he signed up to the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.Abu Dhabi’s concerns came to the fore in December when it suspended talks with the Biden administration over the UAE’s bid to buy US-made F-35 jets, angered by Washington’s restrictions on their use. This year, it has chafed at what it considers the Biden administration’s tepid response to attacks on Abu Dhabi by Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen. The US has deployed additional military assets to the UAE, part of a Saudi-led coalition that has been fighting the Iran-allied Houthis since it intervened in Yemen’s civil war in 2015. But Abu Dhabi wants Washington to designate the Houthis a terrorist organisation and impose tougher sanctions on the Yemeni group.The Biden administration appears reluctant to do so as it holds indirect talks with Iran on the revival of the nuclear accord, and heeds warnings that such a move would exacerbate Yemen’s humanitarian crisis.President Joe Biden has also annoyed Riyadh by criticising human rights abuses and refusing to talk to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s day-to-day ruler.In contrast, Putin was one of the few world leaders to embrace Prince Mohammed after the royal was widely blamed for the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents. The Russian president publicly high-fived the crown prince at a G20 meeting weeks later.Saudi Arabia, which has not issued statements on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, also has shared energy interests with Moscow as they are the main players in Opec+, which Russia joined in 2016.Despite oil prices soaring above $100 a barrel, Riyadh has resisted US pressure to pump more oil, with analysts saying it believes raising supply would make little difference. In a phone call with French president Emmanuel Macron, Prince Mohammed said the kingdom was committed to Opec+, according to a Saudi statement on Monday.Ali Shihabi, a Saudi commentator, said the US had “sent multiple signals and actions” that its alliance with the kingdom was no longer a relationship Riyadh could rely on.“Hence Saudi leaders have decided that they have to build multiple alliances and relationships with other major powers, mainly China and Russia,” he said.He added that Riyadh had invested heavily in building ties with Moscow and regarded Opec+ as a strategic relationship critical to the “lifeblood” of the kingdom’s economy — oil.“This is not something the kingdom will flush down the toilet now,” he said. “Russia has proven that it remembers its friends and also its enemies and the Opec+ agreement signed by the kingdom is one the Saudi leadership will strictly adhere to. Western politicians have a short memory. Saudi leaders do not.”Saudi and Emirati officials still insist that the US is their primary foreign partner. Yet as the US has talked up its pivot to Asia, Moscow has been deepening its presence in the Middle East.Russia turned the tide of the Syrian civil war by intervening militarily in 2015 to back the Assad regime; it deployed mercenaries from the Kremlin-linked Wagner Group to Libya to fight alongside a UAE-backed Libyan warlord; and it has nourished political links with regional powers including Iran.“Russia, like China and others, are trying to fill the vacuum left by America. and Russia is well positioned to play a bigger role,” said Abdulla. “They are winning. Putin has calculated it very well.”But, advising caution, Hokayem said “western resolve and possibly success in Ukraine may change Emirati calculations, showing the limitations of Russian soft and hard power”.
59  Good morning. At the highest level, the best answer to the question “what does the Russian invasion of Ukraine mean for investors?” is “who cares.” What matters, ultimately, is that peace is restored and tyrants are defeated. But Unhedged is not a newsletter about what matters most; it is a newsletter about understanding markets. So a few more tentative notes on markets and the war follow.Sanctions and markets US and European sanctions in response to Russia’s aggression take a large number of forms. A good summary from my colleagues Eir Nolsoe and Valentine Pop can be found here. For investors, though, two types matter most. The first are sanctions on Russia’s central bank, which will prevent the bank from accessing its reserves denominated in Euros and dollars. The second prevent Russian financial institutions from using the Swift global financial messaging system, which will make it difficult for those institutions to complete cross-border transactions.Before discussing what these two mean for markets, it is important to note that, as of writing, how and how extensively these sanctions will be applied remains unclear. As of Sunday evening eastern time, the best statements of where we are remain this statement from the European Commission and this press briefing by a White House official. Both are now a day old. Further announcements could come at any moment, and could change everything.The sanctions against the central bank will make it increasingly difficult for it to provide Russian citizens with dollars and euros, and make it impossible for the bank to use dollars and euros to defend the value of the rouble in global markets. In the long term a weak rouble hurts the Russian economy by making imports expensive. In the short term this may mean that reports of long lines at Russian ATMs may turn into a violent crash of the rouble, as Russians scramble to buy FX.In very early Asian trading Monday, the rouble hit 119 to the dollar, a staggering 42 per cent move from Friday’s close of 83.The impact of the Swift lockouts remains less clear, because we don’t know who will be cut off. The EC says only “selected” Russian banks will be hit, and the US says only “sanctioned” ones will be. The world awaits the details. So far, it seems the west will try to keep Russian energy, especially gas, flowing west, but that could change. Because energy is Russia’s most important source of dollars, we are still well short of what my colleague Martin Sandbu calls “shock and awe” financial sanctions.Despite the claims of the White House, this is not yet the Iran model. What makes a Swift lockout work, and gives the Iran model force (as Claire Jones explains here) is the US authorities making it clear that any bank that operates in the US that transacts with any Russian bank is in big trouble. We may get there yet.It is pretty clear, though, that the sanctions will have the effect of making energy and other commodities, from wheat to nickel and palladium, more expensive. This will contribute to inflation as it drags on growth. The question is the strength of the sanctions and therefore the extent of this stagflationary effect. The question is complicated because it is not clear how global central banks can respond to it, given that they are already in an accommodative position relative to inflation. Gemcorp economist Simon Quijano-Evans summed it up in an email:This is not to say the Fed will back off from hiking rates at the next few meetings. That is very unlikely. But the terminal policy rate is now harder to predict.All else equal this is probably bad news for stock valuations. Absolute Strategy Research, who describes the situation as a “supply shock,” makes this point succinctly:This, in turn, should mean that investors favour defensive sectors. This is already happening. Here is ASR’s chart of global equity sectors’ moves last week:But flight from risk and pressure on valuations is not likely to be the driving forced in markets in the coming days and weeks. The driving force will be liquidity.There are a couple of ways to look at this. The first is just by thinking about margin calls. Russia is a big economy, with financial surpluses and lots of rich companies and individuals with lots of real and financial assets. Those companies and oligarchs will have assets funded in part with leverage. This morning, whoever provided that leverage is going to want their money back immediately. But it’s not clear that they will be allowed to get it back if they are dealing with a sanctioned entity. So now the lender has a hole in its balance sheet, and the lenders’ lenders will probably be aware of this fact, inspiring them in to call in their loans, and so on (worries about this explains why, for example, the shares of banks in places like Austria got whacked last week). What happens, for example, to planes leased by Aeroflot? The global companies that have leased the planes may not be able to accept payments for them. So presumably they will want their planes back? Can they get them? I don’t know (here is a Bloomberg story on this from yesterday).The point is that, as Unhedged’s friend Edward Al-Hussainy of Columbia Threadneedle puts it: “You don’t know where these waterfalls will come to an end.” Nor do you know what is being sold because people don’t want it, or instead because it is liquid and something has to be sold. US stocks are selling off in overnight trading now, for example. This could well be a liquidity grab rather than a flight from risk (that said, in extreme situations, the two are impossible to distinguish). In a much-discussed note released over the weekend, Credit Suisse strategist Zoltan Pozsar put the same basic point another way. Cutting off Russian banks from international finance will mean payment failures, which could create conditions not unlike the early days of the pandemic:For extremely courageous investors in possession of scarce liquidity, this will mean some assets will be going on sale in the days to come. But a very long term view will be required. Expect to see irrational prices — that go on to get more irrational still.In a frightening time, a powerful (and numerical) reflection on how we spend our precious time, from Tim Urban in the New York Times.
60  For many months, the US, the UK and eastern European nations were the only ones sending arms to Ukraine. But over the weekend, France, Germany and other nations that had so far insisted on sending only non-lethal aid to Ukraine U-turned and said they would also send weapons. Last night, another Rubicon was crossed when EU foreign affairs ministers approved allocating €450mn from the bloc’s budget for arming Ukraine — for the first time ever. Defence ministers will meet today to iron out the details of how these supplies can be delivered, after Poland offered to serve as a logistics hub. I’ll look at what this latest measure means and why the timing of the policy change is still frustrating some officials.A fresh round of sanctions adopted last night includes another longstanding request from Kyiv, to cut off Russian banks (at least some of them) from the Swift messaging system and banning the central bank’s ability to fund the war on foreign exchanges. (Here is the FT’s explainer on how the sanctions against the Russian central bank are likely to work and here’s one on all the sanctions adopted so far by the EU, US and UK.)Meanwhile, the so-far reluctant Swiss are also falling in line, with the country’s president saying it was “very probable” that the Alpine country would follow the EU and freeze the assets of blacklisted Russians today. As hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees have started arriving in EU countries, we’ll also explore what measures the bloc is taking to speed up their reception, under a clause used only once before, after the war in former Yugoslavia.And with one aspect of the sanctions package likely also to apply to Russia’s gold reserves, we’ll analyse what this means for the country’s gold mining industry.The Financial Times is making key Ukraine coverage free to read to keep everyone informed as events unfold.

You can take out a Premium subscription hereA major shift occurred in the past two days, with nearly all western European nations (notably Germany and France but also the Nordics, Belgium and the Netherlands) announcing they will send weapons to Ukraine. And last night, so did the EU itself, with foreign ministers deciding to use €450mn in EU money for lethal aid to Ukraine, a first in the bloc’s history.“For the first time ever, the European Union will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and other equipment to a country that is under attack,” said Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president.Foreign ministers gathering by video link last night endorsed the plan, said EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, adding that Poland offered to serve as logistics hub for the deliveries. He said the money would be used to buy all sorts of equipment, including fighter jets — something the Ukrainians had asked for. Countries that are traditionally neutral, such as Ireland and Austria, will be able to contribute with non-lethal aid, which the EU will reimburse to the tune of €50mn.The fact that Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky refused to take a “ride out” of his country offered by the US, but also that Ukrainian soldiers and volunteers are putting up a much tougher fight than expected, combined with mass protests in Berlin and other European cities, have contributed to the policy shift, say EU officials.Still, some EU officials could not shake off the feeling that the time it took for this shift to happen in Berlin, Paris and other capitals, despite all the intelligence shared by the US and calls from central eastern Europeans to beef up support for Ukraine before the invasion, was underpinned by a certain degree of cynicism. The comment out of the Elysée Palace on Saturday noting drily that “Ukraine chose the path of resistance” almost rang like feigned surprise to some officials. “There was really a perception that Ukraine would fall in one to two days and the EU could just wait it out, before resuming talks with Putin,” said one EU official.The EU’s initial reluctance last week to go for full-blown sanctions right away could be interpreted as a way to hedge its bets, particularly given the amount of gas the bloc imports from Russia. But there was also the factor of Russia being a nuclear power — something that Vladimir Putin reminded everyone of yesterday when he put his nuclear forces on high alert. Russia stepped up artillery assaults on the capital Kyiv and the eastern city of Kharkiv, which it continues to encircle slowly. Inside Kyiv, however, Russian troops that had breached the city continued to encounter strong resistance. (More here)The UN refugee agency said yesterday that about 368,000 Ukrainians had fled the country, mostly into bordering EU nations Romania, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia. As the numbers grew, EU interior ministers gathered yesterday for an emergency council to consider further assistance for the refugees, write Javier Espinoza and Valentina Pop in Brussels. The EU commission is estimating that up to 7mn people might flee the war and destruction in their homeland. “We are witnessing what could become the largest humanitarian crisis on our European continent in many, many years. The needs are growing as we speak,” said Janez Lenarcic, the commissioner for humanitarian aid and crisis management. Speaking after the meeting, German interior minister Nancy Faeser said that there was a deal for a “temporary protection” clause applied after the war in former Yugoslavia, to be used for Ukrainian nationals fleeing the war. The European Commission will prepare the legal work and interior ministers will approve it at their regular meeting on Thursday, Faeser said. “Concretely, this means that we are creating the same, unbureaucratic procedures for receiving people fleeing from war. Refugees from Ukraine will not have to go through asylum procedures. They will be granted temporary protection in the EU for up to three years,” she said.The temporary protection status will also enable the refugees to get access to social welfare, employment and schools for their children, said the Danish interior minister. The EU home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, said that most Ukrainians who had arrived so far had their passports on them, which enables them to stay visa-free in the EU for three months. (Ukraine has a visa-free regime with the bloc.)“We need to be prepared for day 91 and for a much higher number of people trying to come who should be welcomed by the EU. That’s why I think it’s time now to activate the temporary protection directive, to support the Ukrainians,” Johansson said.She added that the refugees were already leaving the first countries of arrival and heading towards the EU countries with a large Ukrainian diaspora — Poland but also Italy, Portugal, Spain, Germany and the Czech Republic. Russia’s central bank could be forced to start purchasing gold from domestic miners frozen out of international markets by US, UK and EU sanctions, writes Neil Hume in London.The Bank of Russia owned just under 2,300 tonnes of gold at the end of November, according to the World Gold Council. At current prices, its hoard of the metal — the sixth largest in the world — is worth $153bn and accounts for roughly a fifth of the bank’s official reserves. Rumours that Russia might seek to sell down some of its holding following the invasion of Ukraine hit the price of bullion last week, which came close to breaking above $2,000 a troy ounce before retreating.But rather than selling gold in a main bullion centre such as London or Switzerland, Russia’s central bank is more likely to start buying the metal, traders reckon. That’s because domestic gold producers such as Polymetal or Polyus are likely to find it very difficult to access international bullion markets because of sanctions placed on Russian banks.As such, they are likely to turn to the central bank, which can provide the roubles they need to pay staff and supplies in exchange for gold.This is something that has happened before, according to analysts. Following the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Russia’s central bank stepped up its purchase of gold that domestic producers struggled to sell overseas. Between 2014 and 2019 it acquired more than 1,200 tonnes of gold, according to WGC data.For Moscow, the purchases were also a way of reducing the country’s exposure to US dollars in its official reserves.The Bank of Russia halted purchases in April 2020 as oil prices dived because of the pandemic, hitting Russia’s national income.Should the Bank of Russia want to sell any of its huge stockpile of gold, analysts reckon, it would have to turn to China where the metal could also be used as collateral for swap lines.

This new reality requires a clear response. We have given itGerman U-turn: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered a quick reset in Berlin, with chancellor Olaf Scholz yesterday announcing a €100bn fund to modernise the military and meet Nato commitments of spending 2 per cent of gross domestic product on defence by 2024. In recent days, Germany has also scrapped the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, approved cutting Russian banks from Swift and pledged to deliver weapons to Ukraine. UK visas: British MPs have demanded that the government makes it easier for UK residents to bring family members fleeing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to join them in Britain. The Home Office is at present issuing visas inside Ukraine only to close family members of British citizens who normally live in the country. Polish warning: In an op-ed for the Financial Times, Poland’s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki is giving an ominous warning on Vladimir Putin’s intentions going far beyond Ukraine. “Today, we are seeing that the price of European naiveté over Russia is Ukrainian blood,” he writes.Tow back to Russia: In an extraordinary exchange captured on a mobile phone, a Ukrainian man asked Russian soldiers who had pulled their tank to the side of the road and said they had run out of fuel whether he could tow them back to Russia 
61  At a briefing on Wednesday afternoon in London to discuss the outlook in emerging markets, executives at Ashmore, an investment house specialising in developing countries, kicked off by addressing “the elephant in the room” — Russia.The country had just recognised the independence of two regions in eastern Ukraine and the US was warning of an imminent broader land grab.The situation, Ashmore pointed out, was fluid. It demanded a “very, very careful” approach from fund managers. But the core view was that the Russian president would not send troops towards Kyiv. There would be no full invasion and instead, “a good chance that soon we won’t be talking about it”. A few hours later, Russia invaded its neighbour on multiple fronts.Even investors generally downbeat on Russia and sceptical of its motives have been blindsided as President Vladimir Putin has exceeded expectations for the ferocity of his campaign, writes markets editor Katie Martin in this column.“Investors are on the back foot,” agrees Dominic Armstrong, chief executive of Horatius Advisory. “No one expected to see cruise missiles fired into Europe in 2022 in a hostile attack.”In this analysis by the asset management team we explore how many investors called it wrong. And the broader financial shockwaves will be difficult for investors everywhere to navigate, given the complex interplay between the impact on stocks, the financial sanctions that are being slapped on Russia, rocketing commodity prices, the drag on global economic growth from heightened geopolitical uncertainty, and any response that central banks may take. Armstrong adds:Meanwhile investors’ ability to buy and sell Russians assets such as stocks and bonds has deteriorated sharply in a sign that western sanctions are eroding the country’s links to foreign capital markets.Here’s Merryn Somerset Webb on why the crisis in Ukraine is adding a further dose of uncertainty to markets.And Mohamed El-Erian, an adviser to Allianz and Gramercy, looks at six factors to guide investors during the Ukraine turmoil. He writes:It’s starting to look as though being compared to Warren Buffett might be some kind of curse for UK stockpickers. First Nick Train, founder of Lindsell Train and one of the fund managers hailed as the UK’s answer to the Sage of Omaha, admitted to “arguably the worst period of relative investment performance” in two decades. Now, an even more popular name has found himself on the wrong side of the market.Terry Smith, who grabbed headlines this year with his jabs against Unilever’s undue focus on the “purpose of mayonnaise,” is one of the UK’s best-known investors. The Fundsmith founder has an army of retail followers who buy his funds in droves. Their loyalty has been rewarded with a 500 per cent rise in Smith’s flagship Fundsmith Equity Fund since inception, translating to double digit annualised returns, net of fees.But the £26bn fund performed worse than its wider market benchmark by a narrow margin in 2021, and has tumbled around 15 per cent this year so far, as Joshua Oliver and Robin Wigglesworth explore in this piece.Many of the fund’s biggest bets, such as PayPal and Facebook owner Meta Platforms, have inflicted serious damage as tech stocks have sold off amid expected interest rate rises. This chart from Pensioncraft, showing the drop in Smith’s stock picks from their recent highs, does not paint a pretty picture.Ian Aylward, head of fund selection at Barclays, said Smith’s focus on so-called “quality growth” companies has been “unwavering”.These losses highlight long standing concerns from some analysts that British fund buyers are too attached to star managers, like Train or Smith, whose performance can swiftly deteriorate. But from his base on the island of Mauritius, Smith brushed off the brutal start to the year as a mere bump in the road:Russia’s status as one of the world’s leading producers of many raw materials presents a dilemma for western policymakers as they hit Moscow with severe economic sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, writes Akila Quinio. More than 15 per cent of total natural gas supply stems from Russia, making it the world’s second-largest producer. The nation accounts for more than a tenth of global market share for oil, and is a major exporter of base and precious metals ranging from gold to nickel to iron ore.Russia also produces more than two-fifths of the world’s palladium, according to data from US bank Stifel. The white metal, which resists corrosion, is often used as a catalytic converter for cars and a component of laptops and mobile phones.Escalating tensions in eastern Europe come at a moment when inventory levels for many commodities were already squeezed. Demand has outstripped supply as economies emerge from coronavirus-induced lockdowns, leading traders to stockpile raw materials — further stoking persistently high rates of inflation.The world’s considerable dependence on Russian commodities underscores the challenges faced by governments in Europe and the US as they retaliate against the assault on Ukraine while striving to mitigate damage to their own economies.Profits at the Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate soared in the fourth quarter but Warren Buffett said that he and longtime right-hand man Charlie Munger had found “little that excites us” as they sought out new investments.Allianz Global Investors, one of Europe’s largest asset managers, and activist Cevian Capital are urging investors to vote against companies that fail to link executive pay to climate targets.Hedge funds and other investors could be forced to share more information with regulators and the public about their bets that individual share prices will fall under a new rule proposed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday.McDonald’s is learning the hard way.

This sublime portrait from 1938 encapsulates his two lovers of the period: the blonde, youthful, guileless Marie-Thérèse Walter and the dark-haired, vulpine Dora Maar. It’s a close contender for my favourite Picasso, up there with Boy Leading a Horse at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.Which is your favourite work by Picasso? 
62  The reserves — worth $630bn, as of the end of January — are made up of assets and deposits denominated in the world’s major currencies (that is, the dollar, euro, sterling and the yuan). As well as almost 2,300 tonnes of gold. The stockpile was there so that the central bank could intervene in foreign exchange markets, shoring up the rouble in the event of volatility. There’s a Jedi mind-trick aspect to building up reserves too — if markets know you’ve got a load of them, they’re less likely to challenge you to use them. The sanctions imposed by the US, EU and UK against the central bank are likely to render a lot, if not quite all, of these reserves useless. To understand what the CBR is, and isn’t, likely to have at its disposal when the banks open tomorrow morning, it’s worth taking a close look at what’s known as the “Data Template for International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity”. The snapshot below was taken from the Twitter account of former Alphavillain Matthew Klein. We tried to find the official data on the central bank’s website, but it was no longer available. Securities make up a little more than half ($311bn) of what the CBR had at its disposal. According to its annual report, these assets were mostly highly rated, with just 6.8 per cent of them holding less than an A rating. Given their high ratings, most of them will probably be highly liquid and easy to sell in times of panic. But how does the Russian central bank turn these securities into cash in the event that it needs access to dollars or euros fast? Well, it needs to rely on global finance. Here’s how Ousmène Mandeng, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and Political Science who has spent decades working in the field of central bank reserve management, explained it to us: Foreign exchange reserves are not held by central banks. Securities and money never move, everything is external.In the case of securities, central banks would ask their brokers to sell the asset in question.In the case of, say, a German government bond [that the CBR owns], the broker in Frankfurt will call other brokers to announce the sale and, once a price is agreed, will instruct the custodian of the security to transfer it to the buyer. Upon receipt of payment into a bank account, typically in Frankfurt, the custodian will instruct the central security depository to assign the buyer as the new owner. The central bank’s then credited the proceeds at their account with the broker. The proceeds could then be used to instruct the broker, or foreign exchange dealers, most of whom are in London, to buy the rouble at a specific rate. The seller will usually be a Russian commercial bank. Seller and buyer may well share the same correspondent bank. Once the purchase is made, the Bank of Russia would instruct its correspondent bank to credit the seller’s account with euros. Stopping the central bank using its securities to stabilise the rouble would, therefore, involve instructing the financial intermediaries that feature on this chain — brokers, custodians, central security depositories, foreign-exchange dealers, and correspondent banks — to freeze assets and stop acting on behalf of the central bank. Judging by its recent behaviour, there’s much to suggest the US will be willing to do just that. In recent years, Washington has often furthered its foreign policy through what’s referred to as the “weaponisation of finance”. What that has meant in practice is using the dollar’s global dominance to cut the monetary authorities of Iran, Venezuela, and (most recently and very controversially) Afghanistan off from access to their own reserves. There is a paradox at play here, between what the US is willing to do to its political enemies and the rules for the private sector. Sovereign immunity normally protects a foreign central bank’s assets, usually held at the New York Fed, if they are “held for its own account.” That balm has, however, been tested over the years in various US lawsuits against defaulting governments, as bondholders spied rich pickings in their foreign-exchange reserves. Yet none of those lawsuits has gone as far as the US government’s evermore frequent targeting of the central banks of its enemies. In targeting central banks, the authorities have invoked counter-terrorist and human rights legislation, alongside the US International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The latter in particular has proven a potent measure. The most direct way to sanction the CBR will be to put it on the so-called Specially Designated Nationals list, which despite its name includes institutions not just individuals. This would bar US entities from dealing with them. When it comes to dollar access, that would put to a stop to every step of the process outlined by Mandeng.The second chunk of reserves the CBR holds are in the form of currency and deposits. These are worth $152bn. Of this $152bn, about two-thirds is held in official institutions. That includes other central banks, the Bank for International Settlements and the IMF. Central banks in the Eurosystem, where about a quarter of the CBR’s assets are held, have already frozen the central bank’s accounts. The European Central Bank has said it will implement all sanctions decided by the EU and European governments. Joachim Nagel, the Bundesbank’s president, said earlier today that he “welcomes the fact that comprehensive financial sanctions have now been imposed and has campaigned for them.” The BIS said: “[Our] policy is that the institution does not acknowledge or discuss banking relationships. The BIS will follow sanctions, as applicable.”It’s unclear how other authorities will behave. Notably China. According to the CBR’s annual report, as of the start of 2021, 14 per cent of foreign exchange reserves were held in China — the biggest share for any one state. Almost 13 per cent of the reserves are in yuan or assets denominated in yuan. Mandeng says that China may offer a means for Russia to continue trading with at least some parts the world: Russia may accept payments for its exports in renminbi and increase imports paid in renminbi from China and possibly other countries accepting renminbi. As renminbi-based payments will most likely be conducted by institutions outside the immediate influence sphere of the West, this would work. The other third of the CBR’s deposits are held at private banks. Again, it’s impossible to say what share of this $57bn is held in the US, UK or EU. But as almost 60 per cent of the CBR’s reserves are in either dollars, euro or sterling, it’s fair to guess that it’s more than half. Financial intermediaries in the rest of the world may also not want to deal with the CBR, even if they are not directly covered by the sanctions. When the US puts you on its blacklist, it can have a chilling effect. Famously, Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s leader, resorted to “piles of cash” after local institutions were reluctant to bank her and other city officials who came under US sanctions. And then there’s gold, the historical favourite of central banks worldwide. Including Russia’s monetary guardian. The CBR’s holdings are large — the fifth largest in the world — and, according to industry trade body the World Gold Council, they’ve been among the biggest buyers of late. According to its annual report, the entirety of the $130bn-worth of bullion is all stored in vaults within the Russian Federation. Holding all your gold this close to home is unusual. Most of the world’s central banks keep a large portion in vaults beneath the Bank of England’s headquarters in Threadneedle Street, or close to Wall Street, in the coffers of the New York Federal Reserve. The reason being that the City of London and New York are the twin centres of the global gold market, making it easier to buy and sell bars. Holding the gold in Russia, and not in London or New York, will make it more difficult for the central bank to dispose of it in large quantities. At the same time, having it close to home makes it very difficult for the US, UK and EU to successfully impose sanctions on Russia’s bullion. Financial pariah it might be, but people who know the market believe it would be foolish to assume that Russia will be entirely frozen out. The lure of gold has been an ever-present throughout history — particularly in periods of geopolitical uncertainty. If Russia is selling below market rates, then we think someone, somewhere will be willing to take the risk. We’re not going to pay too much attention to what else the CBR may, or may not, have at its disposal come the morning. SDRs or a few billions in banknotes are not going to halt a currency’s collapse. Think differently? Thoughts in the usual place. Along with any guesses on where the rouble will end the day tomorrow.
63  Vladimir Putin has mounted the biggest military offensive in Europe for more than half a century in an effort to bend Ukraine to his will. But the Russian president’s quieter tightening of his grip over neighbouring Belarus will also have far-reaching consequences for the continent’s security.Although formally Russia’s ally, Belarus’s leader Alexander Lukashenko has long tried to maintain a measure of independence. But in recent months, his resistance has waned. Despite Belarus’s constitutional status as a neutral nation, the president has allowed Russian troops to use it as a launch pad to lead the assault on Kyiv, while on Sunday he held a referendum that might allow Russia to station nuclear weapons in Belarus.“This is a huge shift,” said a senior security official from central Europe. “It’s a new reality, militarily and strategically.”Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, Russia and Belarus signed a treaty in 1999 pledging deeper political, defence and economic integration. But for most of his almost three decades in power, Lukashenko has sought to avoid slipping completely into Russia’s orbit.Many of the treaty’s aims, such as the creation of a political confederation, have not been implemented. Lukashenko has also sought to counter Moscow’s economic sway as Belarus’s biggest trading partner by periodically warming relations with the EU, and the country did not recognise Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea.But since August 2020, when Lukashenko claimed victory in a deeply flawed presidential election, he has had less room for manoeuvre. His savage crackdown on the huge protests that followed shocked Belarusians, turned him into an international pariah and made him more dependent than ever on Putin’s political and economic support to remain in power.“Belarus has always tried to chart this middle course, going to the EU, going to Russia. But Lukashenko lost,” said William Alberque, a former Nato official who is now director of strategy, technology and arms control at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “Putin said ‘pay up’. And he did.”For central and eastern Europe, Lukashenko’s change in stance brings risks. One of the most immediate is a shift in the balance of power around the Suwalki gap, the 65km-long stretch of land that makes up the Polish-Lithuanian border and links the Baltic states to the rest of the EU.Bordered to the west by the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, and to the east by Belarus, the strip of land has long been seen as one of Nato’s weak points. If the 30,000 Russian troops that have poured into Belarus since earlier this year remain, Moscow’s ability to cut off the Baltic states from the rest of the EU will be greatly enhanced.“This is a material change,” said François Heisbourg, a French defence analyst. “It essentially means that it would be rather difficult to support the Baltic states militarily if the balloon went up.”In response to the additional Russian forces in Belarus, Nato members have boosted their presence in neighbouring countries. The UK, Germany, Denmark and Norway have sent troops to the Baltics, while the US has sent soldiers to Poland.Many in central Europe want the alliance to go further. “This is a fundamental shift not only in regional but also in European security,” Marcin Przydacz, Poland’s deputy foreign minister, told the Financial Times at the weekend. “The response must be the deployment of heavy armoured military units. This is a task for Nato.”To present a credible deterrent, the alliance’s eastern flank needed significantly more troops, said Heisbourg. “You have 190,000 Russians around Ukraine,” he said. “We should be ramping up not from 5,000 to 10,000, but to 50,000: more Nato forces, in a permanent posture, in the vicinity of Belarus, and further behind.”A shift in Belarus’s nuclear stance would also change security calculations. Russia could already launch missiles from Kaliningrad. But according to Alberque, sending them from Belarus would boost the Kremlin’s ability to target some parts of Europe with short-range weapons.“There is no evidence at all that Belarus is ready to host the permanent stationing of nuclear weapons on their territory. However, can they have temporary stationing? Yes, absolutely,” Alberque said.“The idea that Belarus is an independent country that we have to deal with independently in terms of security policy or defence is gone.Any type of Russian force can be deployed to Belarus at any moment Putin chooses,” he added.For now, officials in central Europe do not think the Russian troops in Belarus pose as big a threat to their countries as to Ukraine. But they worry that if the western response to Putin’s moves in Ukraine and Belarus is insufficiently robust, he could try to “test” the alliance elsewhere.“Putin’s obsessed about Ukraine, and that has been visible for years,” said the central European security official. “But if you look at [the demands Putin made of the west before invading], it’s not just Ukraine. The second was effectively about rendering central and eastern Europe a buffer again.”
64  Now, business leaders wonder if they will have to rip up the rule books again — as a result of the British government’s plans for an independent, post-Brexit, data regime.“Companies have paid the price of achieving GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] compliance,” says Adam Rose, a partner at lawyers Mishcon de Reya. “If the government turns around and says you didn’t need to bother doing any of that, or will have to jump through new hoops, that’s going to annoy them.”The volume of data produced globally is hard to comprehend. According to the World Economic Forum, the estimated number of bytes in the digital universe in 2020 was 40 times greater than the number of stars in the observable universe. And although the creation and transfer of that data across the world can appear seamless, a complex architecture of rules and regulations govern what companies must do to keep it all safe and secure. “If you asked most people, they would be surprised to know that information can’t flow freely around the world,” says Ross McKenzie, partner at lawyers Addleshaw Goddard. “But there are laws in the UK and Europe that limit companies from sharing data internationally.”In the UK and the EU, the rules on GDPR govern the way data can be stored and transferred internationally. The UK, however, plans to water down its data protection rules and pursue agreements with non-EU countries — such as Australia and the US — in a mass overhaul of its data regime, post-Brexit. UK culture secretary Oliver Dowden calls the plan a “Brexit dividend” for the economy. However, critics fear it could end the free flow of information between Britain and the EU — hurting businesses and citizens.“Data is a huge part of UK plc’s value,” says Rose. “We are a stable place to do business with strong laws, good data centres, good data scientists. The UK is a major centre for data-based industry and there is a risk of diverging from our main trading partner, which is Europe.”In a consultation unveiled in September, the UK government set out plans to roll back key elements of EU data protection regulation that it had put on its own statute book during Brexit. Those plans include deleting or rewriting GDPR’s article 22, which guarantees human checks on decisions made by computer algorithms and, according to campaigners, provides a safeguard against machine bias. Such moves put the UK on a collision course with the EU. The latter has warned that it will remove its data-sharing agreement with the UK if the privacy of its citizens is threatened. The EU lets data flow freely from the EU to the UK as a result of a so-called adequacy decision. This means the European Commission has ruled that Britain adequately protects personal information and can be trusted with the data of its citizens.Every piece of legislation. that creates significant divergence from the way things are done in the EU comes with the risk that it is harder to trade with the EUBut, if Brussels decided the UK no longer adhered to sufficient data standards, it could revoke the ruling, thus halting the free flow of information across the Channel.“Every piece of legislation being looked at that creates significant divergence from the way things are done in the EU comes with the risk that it is harder to trade with the EU,” says James Mullock, partner at lawyers Bird & Bird. “We have an adequacy decision that enables data to flow to the UK from Europe. Any divergence [in rules] potentially puts that adequacy decision at risk.” To avoid falling foul of regulation, companies already have to carefully police the way they handle data. “Because of Brexit, the UK has a completely separate approach” to data sharing, says McKenzie at Addleshaw Goddard. Multinational corporations with pan-European operations “have to deal with both the UK regulators and the European regulators. It’s a massive compliance burden.” Businesses are, he adds, “screaming out for data protection lawyers and compliance specialists”.In July 2020, a European ruling, prompted by an activist’s battle with Facebook, threw up a hurdle for businesses transferring data between the EU and the US. The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) removed an agreement, that companies relied upon to easily move data, because of concerns about surveillance by the US state.Before the CJEU ruling, companies relied upon the so-called data protection shield to conduct transatlantic trade. Now, EU companies must conduct individual assessments of each data transfer to a non-EU country in order to ensure compliance. Any data breach now brings the risk of financial penalties for European companies, following the introduction of he GDPR rules and Brexit. Organisations can be liable for fines from the Information Commissioner’s Office in the UK and from regulators in Brussels.UK-based businesses, meanwhile, have an even more complex landscape to negotiate, as a result of Brexit, adds Mullock. Companies fall under “two regulatory regimes”, he points out. With the fines that come with GDPR breaches, “that is a real concern and could create double jeopardy for businesses.”Keep up to date with the latest developments, post-Brexit, with original weekly insights from our public policy editor Peter Foster and senior FT writers.

65  By that benchmark, global policymakers are ahead of the curve in devising standards for cryptocurrencies, which emerged just 13 years ago with Bitcoin’s January 2009 debut. Forums such as the Basel Committee of Banking Supervision, the Financial Stability Board, and the securities regulator Iosco are already discussing global standards for crypto. But this year has brought new urgency to those talks, as crypto markets’ explosive growth, coupled with their increasing links to the regulated sector and the currencies’ widespread adoption by individuals, have prompted the FSB to warn that stability risks could “escalate rapidly”.“Anything that is growing and not regulated can cause enormous problems if we don’t get to grips with it,” warned Mairead McGuinness, the EU’s commissioner for financial services, at an FT event on February 17. She described how young people are now investing in crypto as a “pastime” and taking financial advice from the video sharing platform TikTok. Anything that is growing and not regulated can cause enormous problems if we don’t get to grips with it“The collective activities are alarming if they’re not regulated, and this is why there is a global need for principles around the whole crypto space,” she stressed.The borderless nature of cryptocurrency trading companies, whose decentralised businesses can be scattered across physical territories and servers, further underscores the need for a global approach to policing them. “There are cryptocurrency businesses that appear to be everywhere and yet physically are nowhere at all,” said Mark Steward, head of enforcement and markets oversight at the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, at the same February 17 event. “That’s a real red flag for everyone and it’s something that should concern regulators all over the world.”Halfway around the world from the FCA, Ashley Alder — head of Hong Kong’s Securities & Futures Commission and chair of global securities regulator, Iosco — sees co-ordination between the various domestic and international regulators as “of paramount importance”. He says he wants to “explore a holistic and integrated approach to virtual asset activities, and to reduce regulatory arbitrage”, ie any variation in rules between territories.However, while policymakers in major financial centres agree on the need for global standards, Benoît Coeuré, the then head of the Bank for International Settlements innovation hub, warned in December of the risk that jurisdictions pursue “different tracks and produce a system which is globally inconsistent”. The EU has already set out its proposed regional principles in the Markets in Crypto Asset (Mica) directive. This was presented to the European parliament in October 2020 and is expected to come into force around 2024 — covering everything from the custody of digital assets to sales and trading of them, offering advice, and exchanging them for hard currency.Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, Alder says his agency has been “pragmatically and creatively applying its existing powers” so that it can regulate crypto as it would regulate other securities. Or, as he puts it: “On the basis of a ‘same business, same risks, same rules’ approach.” More formal rules are coming. Hong Kong is now developing legislation that will make sure that all crypto assets are captured by the same regulation “regardless of whether crypto assets traded on these platforms fall within the traditional definition of ‘securities’.” Neighbouring China has taken a more absolute approach. In September, the authorities declared all crypto activities “illegal” and vowed to investigate Chinese nationals working for foreign crypto exchanges. Singapore has instead brought crypto into its anti-money laundering regime. According to a spokesperson for the Monetary Authority of Singapore, regulators are “ready to adapt our rules as needed to manage the policy balance” between supporting innovation and managing risks.In the US, Securities & Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler has been pushing for Congress to give his agency — and others, such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission — powers to deliver “more robust oversight and investor protection” in the large parts of the crypto market that are “sitting astride” the regulatory framework. He has warned that these are “rife with fraud, scams and abuse”. The CFTC has also warned of the dangers of “regulating through enforcement” and called on Congress to frame clearer rules for what’s legal and what’s not. In the UK, the FCA has begun registering cryptocurrency companies for compliance with anti-money laundering rules and has warned of a crackdown on advertisements once crypto comes into the FCA’s financial promotions regime. “Legislation is needed more broadly here,” Steward said at the recent FT event. In addition to these national regulatory moves, all the major territories say they are mindful of global developments and participating in international discussions. One official points out that the EU’s Mica directive was designed to implement international recommendations where they existed, including the work that the FSB had done around stablecoins — a type of cryptocurrency whose value is backed by real assets, such as traditional currencies, gold or short term bonds. Still, that does not mean differences in regulatory treatment will not creep in — even among regimes with a shared aim of protecting consumers and maintaining financial stability. For this reason, crypto regulation has now shot up the agenda of the FSB. Klaas Knot, the FSB’s chair, says: “The FSB would be naturally positioned to take that lead. We have the convening power. we bring together the central banks, the finance ministries, which represent the ultimate legislators, the supervisory agencies, both banking, insurance, securities and some international organisations. They’re all at the FSB table.”Knot expects that the FSB’s work on global crypto standards could progress “quite a bit in 2022”. The next step would be publishing those standards and having them swiftly implemented by the 24 member countries of the FSB — and others beyond. Everyone is hoping that swift action can ensure crypto’s fate is less ignominious than that of Monte dei Paschi: once famous as the world’s oldest bank, now best known as the institution brought closest to collapse by the eurozone’s financial crisis.

66  He has been appointed director-general of Europe’s new Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Agency, launched last September, to scan for new threats and identify potential solutions — with an annual “peacetime” budget of €1bn, which will increase during emergencies.According to most in the pharma industry, the pandemic has shown innovation at its finest — and this work should be incentivised by investment and protected with intellectual property rights. But civil society advocates believe the West has failed to deliver equal access to vaccines to developing countries, and suggest that future funding should come with a commitment to waive patents. Delsaux admits it will be “challenging” to bridge this gap. “I know it’s a very important issue,” he says. “Of course, I hear what the industry is saying, and I hear what civil society is saying. And we know we’ll have to face it and to find a way out.”HERA’s formation has been further complicated by the EU’s plan to review all regulations related to the pharmaceutical industry by the end of the year. Nathalie Moll, director-general of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, says HERA and the EU pharmaceutical review are “locked together”. There is overlap on broad issues — such as ensuring the European medicines regulator can move as nimbly as others — and on specific measures, like the incentives for combating antimicrobial resistance by investing in new antibiotics. However, Moll worries that the EU could be too prescriptive in how it funds research, and fail to understand how breakthroughs occur. For example, BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine come out of investments that the German biotech had made in cancer therapies.“If we get it right, and the pharma legislation review has all the right policy instruments and environment, it will attract innovation into Europe and feed into a HERA that works,” she says. “If you get it wrong, you will see innovation leaving. It doesn’t matter how many HERAs you have, setting up a response will be harder if you don’t have innovation here and are dependent on the other countries.” She believes in improving access to medicines but says this challenge should be addressed separately, fearing it is “risking penalising innovation”.But Ellen ’t Hoen, a lawyer and public health advocate with Medicines Law & Policy, a think-tank, says HERA should guard against pandemic preparations becoming “another Big Pharma bonanza”. She suggests the agency is right to emphasise the importance of financing research and development, but that it also needs to consider how to ensure intellectual property — and the technical knowhow required to implement it — is shared. “This will be wonderful corporate philanthropy, if it comes without strings attached that ensure the measures become internationally available,” ’t Hoen says.Rosa Castro, manager of the European Alliance for Responsible R&D and Affordable Medicines — which comprises consumer, patient and public health organisations — warns that innovation should only be part of the plan to respond to a future outbreak. “If you look at what’s happening right now, we have the fantastic development, from a scientific point of view, of vaccines and their approval,” she says. “[But] the big problem we have is access around the world.” We have the fantastic development, from a scientific point of view, of vaccines.[but] the big problem we have is access around the worldHERA’s mission also includes leading the response to threats when they develop. To do this, it is building a bloc-wide stockpile of medicines, and creating a network of “ever warm” domestic production facilities for essential drugs, known as EU FAB. But the industry is concerned that other EU rules — such as limits on state aid, outside of the poorest regions — could interfere with efforts to improve preparations for a future pandemic. Generic-drug manufacturers are pressing the EU to recognise the need for reliable supplies of even the least innovative medicines, backing a French proposal to suspend state aid rules and allow more government investment in the production of drugs. Michele Uda, director-general of the Italian generics and biosimilars association, says the EU needs to understand that there is important innovation in the manufacturing of off-patent drugs, such as the sterile injectable medications that were in high demand during Covid surges. “You can have the best Covid antivirals but, if you don’t have the drugs for ICU, you can’t keep the patient alive,” he points out. Unlike its US forerunner, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, HERA has to juggle the needs and desires of 27 countries. And, as many other countries rush to secure their own domestic production — prompting fears of even more ruthless vaccine nationalism — Delsaux says his agency also understands the need to work closely with the rest of the world.HERA has already been in touch with countries from Africa to Asia to the Americas, giving it a more international perspective than BARDA’s “more inward focus”, he notes. It wants to help build production capacity and surveillance for future threats in Africa. “Clearly, we don’t want to be limited to Europe, we really want to reach outside of the EU,” Delsaux says. “We realise that, if we want to find a solution for the next crisis, like the one in which we are, we need to help poor countries.”This article has been amended to clarify that Nathalie Moll said HERA and the EU pharmaceutical review were “locked together”, not that HERA and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations were
67  In March last year, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) joined with its EU, UK and Canadian counterparts to announce they would rethink their approach to M&A by “Big Pharma”, noting the high volume of recent deals and fast-rising drug prices. Two months later the Biden administration also backed a patent waiver for Covid-19 vaccines. This sent shivers through an industry that relies on intellectual property to generate profits and attract funding to develop new products.But, as President Biden prepares to deliver his first State of the Union address to Congress on March 1, many analysts say that the administration’s efforts to boost the power of consumers at the expense of the pharmaceutical industry have had only mixed success. Drug pricing reforms that would give government agencies more power to regulate pricing remain stalled in Congress. Meanwhile, European opposition to a Covid-19 patent waiver has blunted efforts to conclude talks on sharing intellectual property.Nevertheless, the uncertainties over drug pricing and the FTC’s flagging of tougher antitrust scrutiny have had a chilling impact on dealmaking. These twin factors have contributed to a slide in valuations across the biotech sector — where business models rely on the prospect of future M&A to tempt venture capital groups, and other investors, to fund risky early-stage development.According to industry data group Evaluate Pharma, there were just 112 biopharmaceutical takeover deals, worth $85bn, in 2021 — almost a third fewer than in 2020. At the same time, the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has fallen by more than a quarter since peaking in February 2021, reversing strong gains made during the prior two-year bull market. This compares with rises of two per cent and 11 per cent for the wider Nasdaq and S&P 500 indices respectively.“Whenever a regulator implements a new regulation or, in this case, potentially a new way of interpreting to what degree they will regulate something, what is needed the most is clarity,” argues Brad Loncar, a biotech investor.“As far as I know, since the FTC made this announcement in March of last year, there has been no clarity offered on what might change compared to past reviews.”This shift in emphasis by regulators, towards promoting more competition and restraining price increases, has caused many analysts to predict that the era of pharma megadeals — such as Bristol-Myers Squibb’s $74bn acquisition of Celgene in 2019 — may be over. And it has also created uncertainty over how regulators will treat acquisitions of smaller companies with unique technology and drugs in development. Some pharma executives have warned that any step up in regulation to block smaller deals could undermine the funding structure of the entire biotech industry.“I understand they [FTC] are concerned about antitrust but they also have to understand that the expertise of a biopharmaceutical company is very different than that of a small biotech company,” says Dean Li, president of Merck Research Laboratories. “I don’t know that they totally appreciate the total ecosystem.” He adds that drugs developed by smaller biotechs are typically brought to market with the support of larger companies — through clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing — for the benefit of consumers.Analysts say there is still no clear guidance on what types of deals could fall foul of the tougher approach signalled by the FTC and other global regulators, which established a multilateral working group last year to consider pharma consolidation.Arman Oruc, partner in the antitrust and competition practice at law firm Goodwin, says the working group is still consulting. It remains to be seen, he adds, whether it will shake up regulatory approaches to procedures, remedies, divestitures and other elements of dealmaking. The degree of interaction between the FTC, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority, the European Commission and the Canadian Competition Bureau had already been increased but there have not, as yet, been any unusual regulatory decisions or outcomes on M&A transactions, Oruc says.“It’s definitely more probing,” he explains. “In terms of the analysis, they [regulators] kick a lot more tyres, if you will. They look into a lot more issues. And they certainly go into a level of detail that the agency [FTC] didn’t go into, let’s say, even in a transaction like the [2009, $68bn] Pfizer-Wyeth combination — a mega-deal like that.”This tougher scrutiny by global regulators comes at a time when some big pharma groups, such as Pfizer, are flush with cash due to revenues earned from Covid-19 vaccines and treatments. On February 8, Albert Bourla, Pfizer chief executive, said the company would accelerate its business development efforts and expected to add at least $25bn in revenues through M&A by 2030.Other big pharma companies, including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck and Amgen, are actively seeking to replenish their drug pipelines ahead of the loss of exclusivity later this decade of several blockbuster drugs, which each earn more than $1bn per year.David Elkins, chief financial officer at Bristol-Myers Squibb, says the company remained optimistic about adding to its drug pipeline and did not see a big change in the regulatory environment. BMS is particularly interested in acquiring early stage prospects, as well pursuing mid-stage bolt on acquisitions, he adds.The next test case many of us are watching is Pfizer’s acquisition of Arena Pharmaceuticals.As more of these things happen, there will be greater regularity clarity on what can and cannot go through“We think there is significant competition in the marketplace, and there are plenty of assets in the therapeutic areas that we’re in,” Elkins says. “There is still significant unmet medical need. So, you know, we remain optimistic about the prospects for future business development.”Some industry experts say there is a need for test cases to be concluded in order to ascertain the full extent of the new boundaries in which the sector must operate.“The next test case many of us are watching is Pfizer’s acquisition of Arena Pharmaceuticals,” says Loncar. “As more of these things happen, there will be greater regularity clarity on what can and cannot go through.”Pfizer agreed a $6.7bn purchase of Arena, a company with some overlapping of drugs targeting inflammatory bowel diseases, in December 2021. It had expected to close the deal within the first half of 2022 but recently notified investors that it had resubmitted its acquisition notice to the FTC. The move gives the regulator an extra 30 days to review the deal.If regulators allow the Pfizer-Arena deal to proceed, it could unleash pent-up demand for M&A. If, however, they intervene it would send a negative signal to the industry, according to analysts.“With more certainty will come more deal volume,” says Loncar. “Big companies have cash they need to spend; what is needed is a clear idea of the guardrails around how — not if — to spend it.”The Trade Secrets Newsletter is the FT’s must-read email on the changing face of international trade and globalisation.

68  And although the business world overwhelmingly favoured remaining in the EU, it welcomed the prospect of lighter touch regulation when Britons voted to leave. The Institute of Directors found that 60 per cent of its members wanted to reduce the volume of “unnecessary red tape” from Brussels.Little over a year since the UK’s legal exit from the EU single market, on January 1 2021, Britain’s leading business organisations report that members are tired and frustrated by the lived experience of Brexit. Small businesses with less time, money and staff to absorb the costs of regulatory requirements — which had hoped to gain most from post-Brexit deregulation — have found it hardest to adapt to the customs and export rules that apply when trading with the EU as a “third country”.Mike Cherry, chair of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) says: “Small firms were promised that one upside of leaving the EU would be reduced red tape. They live in hope of delivery.” The British Chambers of Commerce has been equally scathing. In a report to mark the end of the first year of the implementation of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the BCC found that nearly half of all members surveyed had struggled to trade with the EU.The difficulties include the bureaucracy of the EU and the new UK regulatory requirements — such as the UKCA quality control mark and the creation of a “UK Reach” chemical safety database — that duplicate EU rules for no obvious commercial gain.These systems were born of the UK decision to prioritise full legal separation from Brussels, and the EU’s determination — explicitly stated by Michel Barnier — that the UK should lose its position as a “regulatory and certification hub” for the EU single market.The chemical industry estimated that creating a UK version of the EU Reach (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) regulatory mechanism would cost £1bn. The sector has battled since the end of the Brexit transition period to get the British government to reduce the burdens of registering for the scheme. Talks continue. In a concession in December, however, the government extended the UK Reach registration deadline to 2025 and offered to explore “a new model” to “reduce the need for replicating EU Reach data packages” — a key industry demand — from February.The industry is coy about raising expectations. But Stephen Elliott, chief executive of the Chemical Industries Association, says the aim was “effective regulations and standards that achieved better outcomes for the UK growth, net zero and levelling up agenda”.For British manufacturers — many operate as intermediates in complex supply chains that run back and forth across Europe — the biggest Brexit bugbear has been the government’s decision to create a copycat version of the EU’s “CE” quality and safety standard.Here, again, the deadline for compliance has been pushed back — by a year to January 1 2023 — following intense lobbying from organisations such as the BCC and Make UK, the manufacturers’ lobby. Industry, however, is still complaining about the burden.At least for now, the UKCA mark follows the same underlying standards as the EU’s CE mark, meaning that it requires businesses that want to place goods on the UK market essentially to duplicate their EU registrations.This can mean simply filling in a form. For dangerous or complex industrial and electrical goods, though — ranging from elevator parts to construction adhesives — companies must have products assessed by UK “notified bodies”. But these bodies, businesses complain, have insufficient capacity to meet demand.In November, the Construction Leadership Council wrote to the UK business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng raising “urgent industry concern” about a system that, it warned, could cause shortages of key building products and damage the government’s levelling-up agenda. In October 2021’s BCC International Trade Survey, almost two-thirds of respondents for whom certification marking was applicable said they would prefer to revert to the EU’s CE certification marking system. Fergus McReynolds, director of EU and international affairs at Make UK, says that, while it welcomed the extra year’s breathing space, the UKCA mark was creating barriers to trade with little, if any, benefit when underlying UK and EU industrial standards were unlikely to diverge. “Creating parallel regulatory environments only creates additional bureaucracy and cost which is likely to damage the competitiveness of UK companies in international markets,” he adds.Make UK and BCC want the government to pursue “mutual recognition agreements” with the EU and create a forum in which UK business organisations can jointly consider how the UK should respond to future changes in EU legislation. If the UK does not mirror EU changes, industry fears this will lead to further “passive” divergence from EU standards over time and, therefore, further regulatory burdens for British exporters.The Trade Secrets Newsletter is the FT’s must-read email on the changing face of international trade and globalisation.

This would come not from “slashing red tape” — or from expensive UK copycats of EU regulations that businesses must comply with anyway to sell to the EU’s 450mn consumers. Instead, it would be through a lighter touch at home.Proposals in the government’s January Benefits of Brexit document promised an approach to domestic regulation where authorities “work collaboratively with businesses to ensure there is a clear feedback loop between the regulated and the regulators”. The FSB’s Cherry believes a better future is possible and cites the Canadian province of British Columbia, where, he says, removing unnecessary regulation has resulted in significant economic growth and productivity gains.“This model could be implemented in the UK,” he says, “if we can embrace a culture where regulation is not the default response to policy problems”.Keep up to date with the latest developments, post-Brexit, with original weekly insights from our public policy editor Peter Foster and senior FT writers.

69  Fuensaldaña hardly exudes power, but the village in Spain’s heartlands of Castile-León is part of an upheaval that spells trouble for the country’s beleaguered centre-right opposition.Locals have given up hope of converting their 15th-century castle into a luxury hotel and reports suggest wolves have taken up residence in the neighbouring hills.But a strong performance by the hard-right upstart Vox party in Castile-León’s regional elections this month, coupled with the bitter feud that has ignited inside the centre-right People’s party, have the potential to reshape Spain’s political landscape.Days of recriminations involving accusations of corruption and espionage culminated on Thursday with the party engineering the exit of Pablo Casado, its national leader.The dispute, which pitted Casado against the party’s rising star, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, head of Madrid’s regional government, has underscored the weakness of the PP as it struggles to hold on to voters attracted by the populist message of an uncompromising new adversary.The effect of this turmoil “will still be felt in the general election scheduled for 2023”, said Carla Subirana, Europe analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. “Voters are likely to punish the PP to the benefit of Vox.”Traditional centre-right parties in most other European countries, including France and Germany, have faced similar pressures from the hard right.In Fuensaldaña, as in Spain as a whole, politics has moved fast since the days when the country was classified as an exception to the rise of the European far right because of an experience of fascism that was still within living memory.Instead, there is now a real prospect that Vox could become the leading opposition party. It won almost 18 per cent of the vote in the Castile-León regional election, up from 5.5 per cent in 2019, and in the aftermath of the Casado crisis has overtaken the PP in two national polls. In Fuensaldaña, Vox came first.“Lots of people here like me think the PP is weak and have voted for Vox,” said José Juan Fidalgo, who runs a woodwork company in the village.He said Casado lacked charisma compared with Santiago Abascal, Vox’s leader, and Ayuso, who emerged the victor in the PP’s internal war. “She should be our first female prime minister,” Fidalgo said.Ayuso, however, is not yet seeking a national role. She instead joined the overwhelming majority of PP regional leaders in backing Alberto Núñez Feijóo, head of the Galician regional government, to take over from Casado at an extraordinary party conference in April.Casado is reported to have agreed at a PP meeting late last week not to back a challenger to Feijóo in return for being allowed a dignified exit at the conference rather than being forced to quit immediately.Feijóo has established his authority by winning four consecutive absolute majorities in north-west Galícia region. His backers are now counting on his moderate, centre-right approach to rebuild the PP as a credible leader to oust the Socialists of prime minister Pedro Sánchez from power.His biggest challenge will be to give the PP a message compelling enough to win back voters tempted to back Vox.Many in Fuensaldaña expressed reservations over Vox’s plans to clamp down on immigration and scrap gender violence legislation but said they wanted stronger opposition to the Socialist-led government.Casado had insisted that his party should not form a coalition with Vox in Castile-León, for fear of setting a precedent for other regions or the nation as a whole. But his departure gives the regional party a free hand.In an interview with the Financial Times last year Casado — seemingly inadvertently — highlighted two of the problems that would bedevil his leadership. He declined to give a straight yes or no answer on whether Vox was a democratic party and expressed frustration with extensive media coverage of other PP leaders, including Ayuso.It was a prelude to the row that may have wounded Ayuso but has ultimately destroyed Casado, who less than two weeks ago accused his PP comrade of allowing her brother to profit from a €286,000 commission from a face masks contract with her administration.In his most explosive comment he told a radio interviewer: “Over and above whether it is illegal.the question is whether it is comprehensible that on April 1 [2020] when 700 people were dying in Spain [from coronavirus] you can do a deal with your sister and receive €300,000 in profits for selling masks.”Casado withdrew the claim a day later, after Ayuso said her brother received €56,000 not €286,000 and that it was not a commission but a payment for masks. Despite Casado’s entreaties she refused to enter into a peace settlement with the PP leader and it became clear that Casado’s position was untenable.How to deal with Vox will be one of the most pressing issues for his successor. But more important still will be whether the PP, which governed Spain for 15 years, manages to avoid being overtaken by a hard-right rival that entered the national parliament less than three years ago.“Given the potential risk of a demobilised centre-right electorate, a weak PP would make it challenging for the right to win the 2023 election,” said Antonio Barroso, deputy director of research at Teneo Intelligence. “Regional elections in Andalucía [region] later this year will provide the next important signpost of the party’s strength.”
70  Unfortunately for sufferers, the condition is also a rare one — only affecting an estimated one person in 10,000. For rare diseases such as this, data on the condition and how to treat it are scarce.In recent years, though, some significant breakthroughs in treatment have been made. One approach involves using gene replacement therapy to introduce a healthy version of the problem gene. “I’ve never seen anything like what is now happening with spinal muscular atrophy,” says Volker Straub, director of the John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Research Centre. “Now, this is a disease that we are almost about to cure.”The new therapies have also incentivised screening for the disease among newborns, which will in turn mean the treatments are more widely used — a virtuous circle. However, breakthroughs such as this remain very much an exception to the rule.Of the 6,000 to 8,000 diseases considered rare in Europe, 4,000 are extremely rare — conditions affecting one-in-100,000 to one-in-1mn. That compares with a common disease such as lung cancer, which affects 1 in 15. But, when the rare diseases are taken together, as many as 30mn people in Europe suffer from them, according to the EU. Many have yet to receive a diagnosis, though: on average, it takes four years for patients to find out what rare disease they are suffering from, according to Eurordis, a patients’ association.Experts in the field say that inadequate infrastructure for data sharing and international collaboration on research is the main obstacle to progress. Rare diseases are difficult to study as scientists must first find patients, who can only be found if they have been diagnosed. Yet, without sufficient research, many are not.However, if countries share data, then patients can be studied and effective treatments developed. Merely knowing how many people suffer from a disease can incentivise pharmaceutical companies to invest in finding treatments.“It’s a vicious circle,” says Anna Kole, public health policy director at Eurordis, a rare disease research alliance. “A company is not going to invest in an area of therapeutics where nobody knows anything.” Financial risks rule it out: the cost of researching and developing a rare disease treatment can run into hundreds of millions of dollars.As a result, until not long ago, rare diseases were not recognised as a problem to be addressed. But, in 1999, that changed in Europe, when the EU adopted a regulation on “orphan drugs”. This introduced incentives for developing treatments that, while life saving, were for conditions so rare that it would be financially unviable to produce them. The measures include fee waivers and a market exclusivity period.Still, there was little further progress until the advent in 2017 of European Reference Networks, which facilitate collaboration between hospitals and clinics across the continent. “The ERNs represent the biggest innovation in terms of care for rare diseases, pretty much ever,” says Victoria Hedley, rare disease policy manager at Newcastle University in England.Countries had been researching in isolation, essentially studying diseases from scratch, not knowing whether their neighbours may be working on the same condition. “You need to have as much data as possible,” explains Kole. “You need to understand who these patients are.”But, in spite of these advances, only six per cent of rare diseases have a dedicated treatment, according to Rare2030, a study led by Eurordis. Many patients often have to fund their own research and care. For the rest, there is either nothing or only drugs designed for other conditions. While these may lessen suffering, they cannot transform quality of life or address the underlying problem. Another big obstacle is the cost of treatments that are discovered, which can be very high, meaning health systems struggle to pay for them. For example, the National Health Service for England said in March 2021 that the spinal muscular atrophy treatment Zolgensma had a list price of £1.79mn per dose. It had, thankfully, been able to secure a “substantial confidential discount” on that price.You need to have as much data as possible. You need to understand who these patients areOnce there is a way to pool rare disease patients and track their conditions, though, small insights can add up. As with spinal muscular atrophy, a treatment can spur improvements in diagnostics. Kole says it can also prompt further questions: “How are we diagnosing these patients? Where is that data going? Who has access to it? And who is supplementing the data with evidence once they are using breakthrough therapies?”Yann Le Cam, chief executive of Eurordis, says there is now “a critical mass of knowledge which is growing”. With a comprehensive European rare disease plan, he says, the time for development and diagnosis could be reduced and the number of therapies could increase fivefold in ten years. However, this could only be achieved if data sharing was improved and countries built and shared national plans on rare diseases. The EU is currently targeting treatments that could be used for a variety of rare diseases. It hopes that, by tackling the common conditions or issues generated by rare diseases — such as a weak immune system — the treatments could work for several conditions at once.The Rare2030 report, released last year by key figures in the rare disease community, had as its main recommendation that should there be better European infrastructure for information sharing.And there is now a better chance of progress as the European Council presidency is held by France, which has been known to put rare diseases high on its agenda. A ministerial conference on rare diseases scheduled for February 28 will be the first such high-profile meeting on rare diseases in over a decade — and an opportunity to develop that European plan.“We have spent decades highlighting the problems and challenges,” says Kole. “We’re ready to come forward with some solutions.”

72  UK prime minister Boris Johnson is facing fresh calls to scrap or tone down the nationality and borders bill, which goes through the House of Lords this week, amid expectations that thousands of people fleeing war in Ukraine will seek refuge in Britain.The contentious bill would overturn traditional interpretations of the UK’s obligations under the United Nations’ Refugee Convention by making it a criminal offence to enter the UK by illegal means to seek asylum.The legislation would also offer only temporary protection to those who can demonstrate their right to refugee status but have entered the UK illegally to lodge the claim or came via a safe third country.The provisions could affect the rights of Ukrainians fleeing the war and travelling to the UK via Poland or Romania, which the government classifies as safe countries.Johnson on Sunday night announced £40mn of extra aid to help relief agencies deal with the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Ukraine.He also confirmed that any person settled in the UK would be able to bring their Ukrainian immediate family members into the country to the benefit of “many thousands of people”.However, the government is still set to face criticism for not doing more to help Ukrainian nationals as its borders bill is debated in the Lords.Opposition parties, including the Scottish National party and Liberal Democrats, have urged the government to scrap the legislation altogether, saying it “criminalised” asylum seekers.Baroness Philippa Stroud, a Conservative peer and former head of the Centre for Social Justice think-tank, criticised the proposed measures, which she said would create two tiers of refugee.“Just as over 100,000 refugees are fleeing war-torn Ukraine, Britain is about to enact the nationality and borders bill that would deny them even the most basic of rights,” she said.“It is a piece of law that means victims in the harrowing images we have all seen would be unable to call Britain a safe haven and would be held in perpetual sub-refugee status.”Stroud has written a rebel amendment seeking to overturn an existing ban on nearly all immigrants working while waiting for their asylum application to be processed.However, the government insisted its legislation would prevent further loss of life in the English Channel from gangs of people smugglers. “We have a shared moral and legal duty to address illegal migration collectively and urgently,” a government official said.The official added that the legislation reduced the “pull factor” to the UK and would make the asylum system fairer by differentiating between those coming through illegal routes and those using safe asylum schemes.Liz Truss, foreign secretary, said on Sunday that the government was looking at what more it could do to support Ukrainians fleeing the war: “I want to send a very strong message that the United Kingdom welcomes refugees.”The Refugee Council, a leading immigration charity, has said the nationality and borders bill stood in “stark contrast” to the prime minister’s promise to welcome to the UK Ukrainians fleeing war and persecution.It called on the government to make it easier for fleeing Ukrainians to reach the UK and urged ministers to offer humanitarian visas to allow desperate Ukrainians to come.
73  European aircraft leasing companies are facing a huge logistical challenge to recover hundreds of planes worth an estimated $5bn from Russia by the end of March under sanctions imposed after the country’s invasion of Ukraine.Russian aviation is a key target of the sanctions imposed by the European Commission. The measures prohibit the sale, transfer, supply or export of aircraft or any components. Leased aircraft are included as they fall under “supply”, three people briefed on the situation confirmed. As such, no new contracts can be entered into and existing ones have to be terminated within 30 days.“The 30 days is going to be really difficult for lessors to figure out how to terminate [contracts],” said one person in the industry who asked not to be named. “The bigger issue is how do you repossess that many aircraft in that time?”Leasing contracts include provisions that allow the lessor to recover its planes in case of sanctions. However, the rapidly evolving situation, including growing restrictions on Russian airlines being able to use European airspace, means groups face a tough task to recover the planes, according to one of the people.“All aircraft must be removed from Russia by the end of March. Whether the airlines will comply or not, no one knows,” said the person.The Russian aircraft market is dominated by lessors, including Russian state-backed banks and foreign companies. Non-Russian lessors have 515 planes in Russia, with a combined market value of close to $10bn, according to data from Cirium, the aviation consultancy. One industry executive estimated that European lessors account for up to $5bn of this.Among western lessors, those based in Ireland are the most exposed. The Irish government on Sunday confirmed the March 28 deadline for terminating Russian aircraft leases as part of EU sanctions. It also said it would close its airspace to Russian planes.There are 238 commercial aircraft, with a market value of $4.1bn, leased to customers in Russia from 10 Irish domiciled operating lessors, according to Cirium.AerCap, the world’s biggest lessor, has 154 planes leased to Russian customers, with an estimated value of $2.2bn, 5 per cent of the value of its global fleet.SMBC Aviation Capital is the next most exposed in Ireland, with planes valued at an estimated $1.3bn leased. Avolon has planes with an estimated value of $266mn leased, according to Cirium, 1.6 per cent of the value of its fleet. “If those lessors are given only one month to terminate leases and recover the aircraft from the customers to a storage location outside of Russia, that will be a significant logistical challenge perhaps made even greater, if not impossible, by the increasing airspace restrictions,” said Rob Morris, head of consultancy at Ascend by Cirium.SMBC Aviation said it was “carefully monitoring developments in Ukraine and are engaged with all relevant authorities. The business will respond accordingly to ensure the fullest adherence to any relevant sanctions when the full details emerge.”AerCap and Avolon both declined to comment.Experts said the leasing sanctions were the most immediate worry for the industry. Initial concerns had focused on whether airlines would continue to be able to pay for their leases after the EU, the UK and the US sanctioned several Russian banks. Lessors usually take their payment in US dollars or euros.Aeroflot, Russia’s flag carrier, has leased about 50 per cent of its fleet by value from non-Russian lessors, according to industry consultancy Alton Aviation. The airline took delivery of several Airbus and Boeing aircraft last year. Aeroflot declined to comment.The sanctions on the provision of spare parts — vital to keep planes in the air — are already having an impact, with Dutch carrier KLM on Saturday asking two flights bound for Russia to turn back.Russia’s airlines could also face maintenance issues. Aeroflot’s technical maintenance is mainly tied to the German hub, and any restrictions by Germany will be of grave significance, the person close to Aeroflot said. “If maintenance, the supply of spare parts is limited, this would be truly critical, because the company would not be able to operate aircraft. There is critical dependence there.”Rolls-Royce said it had “paused all activities with effect from February 25 2022” with regards to Aeroflot. The UK aero-engine group is a key supplier of new engines, servicing and parts to the Russian carrier.
74  Moscow’s hope for a lightning assault on Ukraine’s largest cities of Kyiv and Kharkiv has been hampered by fierce resistance from Ukrainian troops, raising fears of an all-out artillery assault on the urban centres.Ukrainian troops repelled a Russian incursion into the eastern city of Kharkiv on Sunday as Moscow’s forces continued to slowly encircle the capital Kyiv, where defending troops have retained control despite four days of attacks.Western intelligence officials said they had been surprised by the level of resistance from Ukrainian troops, particularly in cities, and their ability to slow the Russian advance and delay Moscow’s key objectives.The resistance in Kyiv and Kharkiv came as Russian troops instead made significant gains on the country’s southern coast, as Moscow sought to cut Ukraine off from the Black Sea.Ramzan Kadyrov, the strongman leader of the province of Chechnya who commands some of Russia’s most feared units, said Russia’s tactics were not working and should be intensified by using more weapons.“They’re armed to the teeth with new weaponry and ammunition, new generation heavy artillery, and we’re still placing our hopes on the Ukrainians’ coming to their senses,” Kadyrov wrote on messaging app Telegram. “I’ve developed tactics and strategy against terrorists many times and fought in battle. In my understanding the tactics we’ve chosen in Ukraine are too sluggish.”“We have to change.That’ll be more convincing for them,” Kadyrov said, calling on Russian president Vladimir Putin to “give all special forces the order to finish off the Nazis and terrorists” in Ukraine. Putin has described the leadership in Kyiv as “terrorists” and “neo-Nazis”.A senior US defence official said Russia had deployed two-thirds of the combat forces it had amassed on the border before the invasion — an estimated total of 150,000 troops.“Despite the shortcomings they’ve had with logistics and sustainment and in some of their manoeuvres, they still have an awful lot of combat power that is viable and arrayed in and outside Ukraine,” he added.Russia’s focus on encircling Kyiv has raised fears of a fierce bombardment of the city and its residents as their ability to flee is curtailed. People there have sought refuge in cellars, underground garages and metro stations as they brace themselves for a full-scale assault.“The Russian military’s default setting when they get stuck, as happened in Grozny, is to destroy, destroy, destroy,” said another western defence source, referring to the capital of Chechnya.One of Putin’s first acts as president was to oversee a bombardment of Grozny as part of a war on Islamist separatists in early 2000 that left much of it in ruins and killed up to 8,000 civilians, before installing Kadyrov’s father as head of the republic.Overnight on Saturday, Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, the country’s second-largest city, with 1.4mn inhabitants, was subjected to “intensive exchanges of artillery”, the UK defence ministry said.On Sunday afternoon, Kharkiv’s mayor said Ukrainian forces were back in full control of the city, after repelling a Russian incursion involving special forces and light vehicles. Citizens were warned to stay in their homes.While the invasion has been obstructed by logistical struggles and a failure to capture and hold some strategic sites, officials cautioned that Russia’s superior military capabilities and its ability to continue to ramp up deployments would tell over time.“The conflict began as a choice made by Putin, and the problem is that now having committed himself, it has become a war of necessity,” said a western official. “So Putin needs to win and in order to win Russia may turn to indiscriminate force.and I will be very concerned about what they do.”Meanwhile, in southern Ukraine, Russia’s assault by troops assembled in Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014, has seen it take control of a number of key locations, such as Melitopol close to the coast.Russia’s blockage of port cities Berdyansk and Mariupol has in effect created a Russian-controlled land bridge from Crimea to areas of eastern Ukraine held by Russian-backed separatists, according to Rohan Consulting, a conflict analyst.Separatist forces from the self-declared Russia-backed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk also claimed to have made advances west, into towns north of Mariupol, but these were unable to be independently verified.If Russia is able to capture or blockade Odesa, a major port to the west of Crimea, it could seal off Ukraine’s access to the Black Sea — the critical export route for the country’s economy.There were also unconfirmed reports of Russian airborne troops landing in western Ukraine.But the Russian military’s key strategic objective still appeared to be the capital.Russia is “prioritis[ing] the encirclement and isolation of Kyiv”, the UK defence ministry said, bypassing other towns as columns of troops sent from Russia and Belarus race towards the city.Russian troops, which have already taken control of areas north and west of the capital, were fighting for control of Vasylkiv, to Kyiv’s south-west, in the early hours of Sunday morning, Ukrainian officials said.An oil depot there was set alight, sending flames billowing into the dawn sky, while air-raid sirens blared on Saturday night and Sunday morning.Additional reporting by Demetri Sevastopulo in Washington
75  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
76  Norway’s $1.3tn oil fund will dump its Russian investments as part of a wider package of support for Ukraine, highlighting how the international financial pressure on Moscow is being ratcheted up.Norges Bank Investment Management, the sovereign wealth fund housed inside Norway’s central bank, has been instructed to immediately freeze all new investments in Russia and to begin unwinding its existing $3bn worth of Russian holdings, according to a statement from the Norwegian government on Sunday evening.“Russia’s attack on Ukraine has challenged Europe’s security in a way we have not seen since the second world war,” said Jonas Gahr Store, Norway’s prime minister. “It challenges our norms, our values and the principles that our democratic society is based on.”The fund — the world’s largest sovereign wealth investor — held NKr27bn ($3.1bn) in shares in the country at the end of 2021, according to a spokesperson. That equates to 0.2 per cent of NBIM’s total of assets under management.“We will implement the decisions made by the Norwegian government and now freeze the fund’s investments in Russia, meaning we will neither buy nor sell shares,” NBIM said in a statement to the Financial Times. “Together with the ministry of finance, we will prepare a plan to divest from the Russian market.”Nicolai Tangen, the state fund’s chief executive and a former hedge fund manager, had this week indicated that he thought divesting from Russia altogether was a bad idea.“This is obviously a dilemma, but selling out of a market is not black-or-white,” he told a local newspaper. “The Moscow stock exchange has fallen markedly in recent days, and if we sell our stocks now, Russian oligarchs would be able to buy these on the cheap.”Norway has long stressed that the sovereign wealth fund is a non-political, long-term investor, but increasing pressure on the government to act more forcefully in response to the Ukrainian invasion pushed the government to act.“Given how the situation has developed, we consider it necessary to pull the fund out of Russia,” said Trygve Slagsvold Vedum, the Norwegian finance minister.The government also said it would allocate up to 2bn kroner for humanitarian aid to Ukraine and provide military equipment such as helmets and protective vests. Norway has already given 250mn kroner in humanitarian aid following Russia’s attack on Ukraine, it said, mainly to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the Red Cross and the UN Humanitarian Land Fund.“Russia’s acts of war lead to great civilian casualties, destroy basic infrastructure and drive people into exile. We are therefore increasing our humanitarian aid in connection with the Ukraine crisis,” said Gahr Store.Norway said that sanctions would isolate Russia financially “by hitting the central bank and taking a number of Russian banks out of the Swift payment system”.Norwegian airspace has also been closed to Russian flights.
77  Putin’s decision to prepare Russia’s nuclear weapons for increased launch readiness sparked immediate condemnation from the US and Nato that it had made the world “much more dangerous”.*“This is not only an unnecessary step for him [Putin] to take but an escalatory one,” said a senior US defence official. “Unnecessary because Russia has never been under threat by the west or by Nato and certainly wasn’t under any threat by Ukraine. And escalatory because it is clearly potentially putting at play forces that, if there’s a miscalculation, could make things much, much more dangerous.”Announced amid an invasion of Ukraine that has struggled to achieve Moscow’s primary objectives and a day after the US, EU and other western allies unveiled potentially crippling economic sanctions, it signalled the Kremlin felt that it had no option but to intensify its threats, analysts said. “There’s a real possibility Putin could turn to nuclear weapons if he continues to experience military setbacks and sees the diplomatic and political situation crumbling,” said Caitlin Talmadge, a nuclear policy expert at Georgetown University. “It’s not just a response to how his conventional campaign [in Ukraine] is going but to these other developments, with sanctions and Germany sending weapons to Ukraine,” she added. “The entire picture to him looks pretty bleak. If he wanted to use tactical nuclear weapons to achieve [his aims] in Ukraine, he could do that.”Putin’s order, which applies to Russia’s traditional nuclear deterrent and its new hypersonic missiles, does not mean he is ordering preparations for a nuclear strike. But according to Russia’s nuclear doctrine, published in 2020, the Kremlin “reserves the right to use nuclear weapons”, including “for the prevention of an escalation of military actions and their termination on conditions that are acceptable for the Russian Federation and/or its allies”.Western countries interpreted that as a lowering of the bar for the use of nuclear weapons: until 2020, Moscow’s stated policy was to use nuclear weapons when “the very existence of the state is threatened”. Matthew Kroenig, a nuclear expert at the Atlantic Council, said Putin’s response on Sunday was textbook Russian strategy.“This really is Russia’s military strategy to backstop conventional aggression with nuclear threats, or what is known as the ‘escalate to de-escalate strategy’. The message to the west, Nato and US is, ‘Don’t get involved or we can escalate things to the highest level’,” Kroenig said, adding that he thought Putin was bluffing.Putin’s decision followed a warning he issued at the outset of his invasion of Ukraine last Thursday, that any attempt by other countries to “meddle” would be met with consequences, a phrase interpreted to mean possible nuclear attacks.

Since the start of the invasion, Russia has failed to capture Kyiv or Kharkiv, Ukraine’s two biggest cities, and suffered heavy losses against a far stronger Ukrainian defence than even its allies expected. In addition, western countries have agreed on a sanctions package that cuts off some Russian banks from the global Swift financial messaging network and attempts to prevent Russia’s central bank from using its $630bn worth of international reserves, the toughest economic restrictions imposed on Moscow.The nuclear announcement also came shortly after Russian and Ukrainian government delegates agreed to meet for talks, the first such discussions since the invasion began. Lawrence Freedman, emeritus professor of war studies at King’s College London, said Putin might see the threat of a nuclear strike combined with the offer of a potential peace deal as a “way out of this mess he is in”.“While this might be an attempt to deter the west from imposing new, harsh sanctions on the country’s financial sector or supplying weapons to Ukraine, the move escalates tensions between Russia and the west to an unprecedented level,” said Andrius Tursa, eastern Europe expert at political risk consultancy Teneo. “The fact that Putin is turning into a pariah on the international stage makes him even more dangerous and unpredictable.” Under the order, Russia could begin dispersing intercontinental ballistic missiles from their bases and fitting them to long-range heavy bombers, threatening the US, or move tactical warheads from their centralised storage facilities to their deployment locations, threatening Ukraine, said James Acton, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment. “Equipping bombers with warheads and then having those bombers in the air is clearly a more aggressive signal than keeping those bombers on the ground,” Acton said.While conventional clashes between nuclear-armed Pakistan and India in 2000-2001 alarmed the world and Israel began preparations to make nuclear weapons deployable during the 1973 Yom Kippur war, Putin’s decision is the first time a recognised nuclear state has overtly moved to such a state of preparedness since the 1962 stand-off between Washington and Moscow over Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba.Putin’s order is a “preliminary command” rather than active preparations for a strike, said Pavel Podvig, a senior research scientist at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research in Geneva.“In peacetime, the system is there but the circuitry is disconnected. So you cannot physically transmit the signal even if you want to,” Podvig said. “Even if you press the button, nothing would happen.”Podvig warned, however, that “there is a deficit of rational thinking in certain quarters” that added to the tensions. “People said invading Ukraine was crazy and irresponsible — this is an order of magnitude higher.”*This story has been amended to clarify that the move is not the first of its kind since the Cuban missile crisis
78  Vladimir Putin put Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert during a fourth day of bloody fighting in Ukraine on Sunday as the west stepped up its efforts to punish Moscow for starting Europe’s biggest military offensive since 1945.Putin’s move came after US and western allies agreed to impose sanctions on the Russian central bank and eject a group of the country’s lenders from the Swift messaging system — which is crucial for global payments — in some of the toughest such measures taken against a G20 economy.Nato and the US condemned Moscow’s decision, which the Biden administration described as a “totally unacceptable” escalation.“It is clearly potentially putting at play forces that, if there’s a miscalculation, could make things much, much more dangerous,” said a senior US defence official.The Pentagon declined to say if it had altered its nuclear posture in response to the move by Putin.In Germany, Chancellor Olaf Scholz ripped up the playbook of postwar policy when he unveiled plans to invest massively in the country’s armed forces and spend more than 2 per cent of gross domestic product on the military.“With the invasion of Ukraine, we are in a new era,” he told a special session of the Bundestag, where many MPs wore yellow and blue in support of Ukraine.As Ukrainian forces continued to resist Russian assaults on the capital Kyiv and second-largest city Kharkiv, President Volodymyr Zelensky said he had agreed to send a delegation to peace talks with Russia “without preconditions”.But Ukrainian officials pointed to the contradictions in Russia’s actions, on the one hand putting its nuclear forces on high alert and on the other appearing to initiate peace talks.Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, described Putin’s nuclear order “as an attempt to raise the stakes and put additional pressure on the Ukrainian delegation” to the talks. “But we will not give in to this pressure,” he said.Russia’s president issued the order to put the country’s strategic deterrence forces, including the units in charge of its nuclear capabilities, on high alert in response to what he called “illegitimate western sanctions”.At a meeting in the Kremlin, he told his defence minister and chief of general staff that “western countries aren’t only taking unfriendly economic actions against our country.but leaders of major Nato countries are making aggressive statements about our country”.Jens Stoltenberg, Nato secretary-general, told CNN that Putin’s statement “added to the very aggressive rhetoric we have seen from Russia for many months and especially over the last couple [of] weeks where they are not only threatening Ukraine, but also threatening Nato ally countries”.Linda Thomas-Greenfield, US ambassador to the UN, said Putin had “tried everything possible to actually put fear in the world”.Putin’s order, which applies to Russia’s traditional nuclear deterrent and its new hypersonic missiles, does not mean he is ordering Russia to prepare for a nuclear strike. But it is consistent with a doctrine published in 2020 under which Russia reserves the right to use its nuclear weapons “if the very existence of the state is threatened in the case of aggression from regular weapons”.Last week, Putin warned any countries thinking of stopping his attack on Ukraine that Moscow would visit “consequences that you have never dealt with in your history”.Unveiling the new list of sanctions late on Saturday, the US, UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and the European Commission said they would prevent Russia’s central bank from using its international reserves to undermine broader sanctions.The countries’ leaders added that they would remove some Russian banks from Swift, ensuring they were “disconnected from the international financial system” and harming their ability to operate.The sanctions have sown fear in Moscow and other Russian cities. Queues of Russian citizens waited outside empty cash machines for fresh batches of money to arrive on Sunday as concerns grew that the measures could spark financial chaos.As bankers fretted about the consequences of mass withdrawals, the central bank sought to calm depositors and markets by pledging to continue supplying banks with rouble liquidity with no limit.Russia’s president also faced an implicit rebuke from one of Russia’s richest men, the oligarch Mikhail Fridman.In a letter to staff, Fridman wrote: “I do not make political statements, I am a businessman.I am convinced, however, that war can never be the answer.”Following Fridman’s statement, a second oligarch — the fervently pro-Putin metals magnate Oleg Deripaska on whom the US has imposed sanctions — released a short statement calling to end the war.Deripaska wrote on Telegram: “Peace is very important! Negotiations must begin as soon as possible!”Zelensky announced that he had agreed to talks which will be held on the Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River. He said the talks were agreed in a phone conversation with Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko.Zelensky said Lukashenko had “taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on Belarusian territory remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation’s travel, talks and return”.Russian airlines were also cut off from the skies above Europe over the weekend. On Sunday afternoon, the EU announced a total ban on landings, take-offs and overflights of its airspace. Other countries to announce bans included Ireland, the UK, Norway and Canada. The US and France called on its citizens to consider leaving Russia, citing the rising number of flight cancellations.On the ground in Ukraine, the mayor of Kharkiv claimed Ukrainian forces were back in full control of the country’s second city after repelling a Russian incursion. The attack included special forces and marked the first time Russia’s forces had entered since the invasion began.“We have complete control over Kharkiv!” Oleh Synegubov, head of the regional administration, said in a Telegram post.A senior US defence official said the Russian military had moved large numbers of forces into Ukraine over the past 24 hours — about two-thirds of the estimated 150,000 troops it had amassed on the border. Russian forces remained 30km from the centre of Kyiv, unchanged from an assessment on Saturday.Russia has stepped up artillery assaults on both Kharkiv and the capital Kyiv, which it continues to encircle slowly. Inside Kyiv, however, Russian troops who had breached the city continued to encounter strong resistance. Residents sought refuge in cellars and metro stations.Ukraine’s defence ministry claimed on Sunday the country had in four days destroyed dozens of Russian planes and helicopters, hundreds of tanks and armoured vehicles, and killed or injured thousands of troops. Valery Zaluzhny, commander of Ukraine’s armed forces, also said 100,000 extra Ukrainian soldiers had joined the fight, half of them volunteers. The claims could not be independently confirmed.“We are already winning,” said Olha Stefanishyna, deputy prime minister. “The military operation planned by Putin has already fallen down. It was a failure.”In southern Ukraine, however, Russia appeared to be making progress. The army said it had sealed off the cities of Kherson, between Crimea and Odesa, and Berdyansk on the Sea of Azov; taken over the town of Genichesk, near the Crimean border; and seized control of Chornobayivka airfield outside Kherson.Russian and Ukrainian military claims cannot be independently verified.
79  BP is seeking to divest the near 20 per cent stake in Russian state-oil company Rosneft it has held since 2013 in the starkest sign yet of the corporate backlash against Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.The UK-listed oil group said in a statement on Sunday that it would no longer report reserves, production or profits from Rosneft, and its chief executive, Bernard Looney, would resign from the Rosneft board “with immediate effect”.BP did not specify how and when it might divest the Rosneft stake. It could write off the shareholding, sell it back to Rosneft or find another buyer. Analysts have speculated that a state-backed Chinese or Middle Eastern group might be interested in the shareholding, but it is thought that BP could struggle to find a bidder. The Qatar Investment Authority is already a major Rosneft shareholder.BP said the changes in the accounting treatment of the Rosneft stake would lead to two “material non-cash” charges in its first-quarter results that could amount to as much as $25bn: an $11bn charge related to foreign exchange losses, and the difference at that time between the “fair value” and the “carrying value” of the stake, which is currently $14bn.The other BP-nominated director, Bob Dudley, BP’s former chief executive, will also step down from Rosneft’s board, the oil major said.Helge Lund, BP’s chair, described Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as an “act of aggression which is having tragic consequences across the region”.He said BP had operated in Russia for more than 30 years, “working with brilliant Russian colleagues”.“However, this military action represents a fundamental change,” he added. The board had concluded that the company’s involvement with Rosneft “simply cannot continue”, Lund added.BP’s move, which came as Norway’s sovereign wealth fund said it was divesting of all of its Russian assets, will increase pressure on other oil and gas majors and commodity traders with investments in Russia, such as Shell, TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil, Trafigura and Vitol.BP has previously been criticised for its 19.75 per cent stake in Rosneft, which has been under US and EU sanctions since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. But the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has resulted in sweeping sanctions against Putin’s regime, has increased scrutiny of the partnership.One UK asset manager with a large shareholding in BP described the move to offload the stake as a “good decision” and “inevitable”.BP said it would also exit three other joint ventures with Rosneft, potentially bringing an end to a lucrative, if often contentious, 30-year relationship between BP and Russia. BP’s former joint venture with a consortium of oligarchs, TNK-BP, became so fraught in the 2000s that in 2008 Dudley, who then headed that business, was forced to flee the country.BP sold its 50 per cent share in TNK-BP to Rosneft in 2013, for $12.5bn in cash and a fifth of the state-controlled oil company.The Rosneft stake has been similarly profitable. Last year BP reported profits of more than $2.4bn from the shareholding and collected $640mn in dividends.But as tanks, potentially fuelled with diesel from Rosneft — a main supplier to the Russian military — poured into Ukraine, the calculus for the UK oil major changed.Looney said he had been “deeply shocked and saddened” by the offensive, which had “caused us to fundamentally rethink BP’s position with Rosneft”.In a statement on Russia’s state-owned news agency RIA Novosti, Rosneft said BP’s decision “destroys a successful 30-year co-operation” and thanked the UK company for “decades of joint work”.BP’s announcement came just days after Looney was summoned to a meeting with Kwasi Kwarteng, the UK business secretary, to discuss the company’s involvement in Russia.Kwarteng said on Sunday: “I welcome BP’s decision to exit its shareholding in Rosneft oil company. Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine must be a wake-up call for British businesses with commercial interests in Putin’s Russia.”Additional reporting Neil Hume and Jim Pickard in London
80  The boss of McKinsey & Company in Ukraine has accused Moscow of criminal aggression against the country as the consultancy’s global managing partner announced the firm would no longer work for government entities in Russia.“At this point, it should be clear to any unbiased observer that the current Russian government is not simply reckless — it is criminal,” said Oleksandr Kravchenko, McKinsey’s managing partner in Ukraine, in a post on LinkedIn.“It has committed a military crime by launching an overt direct aggression against a sovereign state, it has committed crimes against humanity by consciously shelling and bombing civilian targets (including hospitals, schools, kindergartens, residential buildings and objects of infrastructure), it is about to commit more,” he wrote in the post.Meanwhile in a separate post on LinkedIn, McKinsey’s global managing partner Bob Sternfels called Russia’s actions in Ukraine “indefensible” and announced that the consultancy “will no longer serve any government entity in Russia”, where the company has more than 400 staff and partners. Sternfels did not define “government entity” but he did not appear to rule out McKinsey working for state-controlled companies in Russia.Sternfels said Russia’s government had carried out a “brutal and senseless invasion of Ukraine”.On Sunday evening Christoph Schweizer, chief executive of Boston Consulting Group, also condemned Russia’s invasion.“We are not working for the central government in Russia,” he said in a post on LinkedIn. “In light of the ongoing war, we will not take on any work for the government, and we are thoroughly evaluating our entire portfolio of work in Russia.”The statements are significant because most large professional services firms with operations in Russia have avoided condemning the country’s actions. McKinsey’s website says it acts for 21 of the 30 biggest Russian companies.Executives at other professional services firms told the Financial Times that they did not want to speak out for fear of endangering their employees on the ground in the country and risking a backlash from Russia’s government, which could damage their business interests there.“Business will want to keep its head down and not take sides,” said a senior partner at another global consulting firm.McKinsey, which Sternfels said does not currently carry out work for the central government in Russia, has faced scrutiny for reportedly serving regimes with a record of human rights abuses, such as Saudi Arabia.The firm, which does not disclose its financial performance but is reported to have annual revenues of more than $10bn, advises hundreds of the world’s biggest companies.Kravchenko, who leads a team of more than 40 consultants in Ukraine, said international sanctions imposed on Moscow were not enough. He went further than Sternfels, calling on companies to cease doing business with any group in which Russia’s government had even a 1 per cent stake.Kravchenko said companies should also “freeze to the maximum extent possible (meaning anything short of violating human rights or endangering human life) any business in or with Russia”.Companies should “close your books to the new business, start shutting the doors of your offices and outlets, stop accepting new orders and consider cancelling the outstanding ones, and above all stop paying any taxes in Russia”, he said.“This is not about taking a political stance. This is simply about refusing to be associated with immoral and criminal behaviour,” Kravchenko said. Failure to act would mean being “complicit” in the loss of Russian and Ukrainian lives, he added.A person briefed on McKinsey’s position on the respective viewpoints said Kravchenko’s views were his “personal perspective” while Sternfels’ statement represented the firm’s position. McKinsey declined to comment beyond the LinkedIn statements.The statements by McKinsey and BCG are likely to increase pressure on other professional services groups to condemn Russia’s military aggression in Ukraine and to ditch clients linked to the government, even if they are not the subject of international sanctions.
81  British businesses are sceptical that the government and EU will resolve problems at the UK border and instead believe it will fall to them to reduce costly delays, according to a survey.ClearBorder, a training consultancy, surveyed 150 mostly small companies and foundthat only a third of respondents were “very or somewhat confident” in the government’s ability to improve import and export procedures. But there were higher levels of faith in suppliers and the logistics industry.The report comes after the introduction of new Brexit customs checks on January 1 on goods entering the UK from the EU. Some companies have complained that the additional paperwork requirements have led to hold-ups.Christopher Salmon, founder of clearBorder and a former adviser to Brexit minister Lord David Frost and cabinet office minister Michael Gove, said the government “needed to pull its finger out” if it expected to deliver on its border strategy for 2025, which envisages a single interface for all customs declarations.“It’s all quite arcane and antiquated at the moment.you have systems that can’t talk to each other,” he said.“Things won’t go back to the way they were but they can be a lot better than they are now,” he added, pointing to the creation of HMRC’s online tax self-assessment system as a blueprint.Over four-fifths of survey respondents said they had experienced delays in importing goods since January 2021, and two-thirds had encountered them when exporting.Meanwhile, a third have had goods rejected or impounded while half of importers of perishable items said they had experienced items becoming unsellable as a result of delays.“There may not be the long queues of lorries at ports that some had predicted but [that] does not mean there aren’t issues,” said Salmon.“Instead, the impact of delays is spread along the supply chain,” he added. A majority of companies are now holding more inventory, which consumes more working capital, and 38 per cent said they had established a subsidiary in the EU to make the process smoother.Salmon attributed delays reported by businesses since the documentation checks began partly to lower levels of familiarity with new requirements among overseas suppliers, especially within smaller companies, but added that “there has been a spirit of muddling through as everyone learns how to run the border”.“The difference is that this time the UK is in control of the pace of implementation,” he said, contrasting its “pragmatic” approach with the EU’s introduction of full controls in January 2021.So far, UK authorities have prioritised the flow of goods and physical inspections of items entering the UK from the EU — as opposed to just the accompanying documentation. Additional customs regulations are expected from July 1.However, Salmon said that if the border processes could be speeded up, the UK would have valuable software and expertise that it could sell to the rest of the world.“I cannot think of a trade border anywhere else in the world where such a volume of trade passes through at such a rate,” he said of the Strait of Dover.
82  Ukrainians are displaying exceptional courage as they withstand the onslaught of Vladimir Putin’s forces. By day four of the assault on Sunday, Russian troops had taken control of no large population centres. The Russian-speaking second city of Kharkiv and the capital Kyiv were resisting. Western democracies have meanwhile found the will to impose sanctions of unforeseen severity, targeting Moscow’s central bank reserves and barring some lenders from the Swift messaging system. The Russian president’s plans for a walkover have been confounded.Putin’s war looks ever more of a miscalculation. Yet that could make him more dangerous. On Sunday, even as his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to talks on the Belarus border, Putin put his strategic nuclear forces on special alert.The intensity of Ukraine’s resistance reflects in part the rebuilding of its military since 2014. This is no longer the resource-starved, raggle-taggle force caught off guard by Russia’s aggression in Crimea and Donbas. Kyiv governments since then have invested in it, and western allies helped to train it. Anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles supplied by some foreign partners have assisted in slowing Russia’s advance and ability to take control of the skies.The defiance shows, too, the spirit of Ukraine’s people. It confirms the sense of national identity that has solidified from the Ukrainian-speaking, Europe-leaning west deep into the Russian-speaking east. Ukrainians are displaying great bravery, from civilians mass-producing Molotov cocktails to border guards responding with a Russian expletive to a Moscow warship demanding their surrender. Through efforts such as a hotline for families of killed and captured Russian soldiers, they are evincing a common humanity. Their comic-actor president has emerged as an able and inspiring war leader, refusing to flee the capital.Shocked by Putin’s aggression, and shamed perhaps by their failure to do more to avert it, international democracies are finally responding with punitive financial and economic measures, and dramatic shifts in policy. Germany has dropped its longstanding refusal to export arms to conflict zones to enable it to supply Ukraine, and pledged a huge boost to military spending. Central bank and Swift sanctions are a big step towards shutting Russia out of the global financial system. Russians were on Sunday queueing at banks and ATMs to withdraw cash.Ukraine’s military still faces overwhelming odds. But every day it holds back Putin’s forces multiplies the costs that Russia will bear. Prolonged wars are expensive, and the unexpected vigour of the Ukrainian resistance amplifies the effects of western financial sanctions. This, though, entails new risks. One is that a collapsing rouble and spiralling prices could spark a backlash among Russians who never sought this war — against not Putin, but the west. Communications aimed at cutting through state propaganda to reach ordinary Russians are vital.Another fear is that slow progress in Ukraine will prompt Putin to order his army to use its more terrifyingly destructive weapons, against civilians too. Or Russia’s president, feeling cornered, could be tempted to lash out beyond Ukraine. Placing his nuclear forces on alert, aiming to intimidate the west, is a dangerous escalation by a leader who has made Russia’s nuclear doctrine more threatening since the Soviet era. Yet a swift subjugation of his neighbour would have raised the risk, too, that an emboldened Putin might try to go further. The world is living through a perilous moment. Ukrainians are offering it a lesson in fortitude.
83  Russian airlines will be cut off from almost all of European airspace after the EU announced plans for a flight ban following the invasion of Ukraine.The EU intends to shut its airspace to Russian planes, meaning they would not be able to fly over the bloc or land at any airports within it.“Our airspace will be closed to every Russian plane — and that includes the private jets of oligarchs too,” Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission’s president said on Sunday.The combined action came after more than a dozen EU countries unilaterally closed their airspace, while the UK, Norway, Canada and Iceland have also announced similar measures.“Our European skies are open skies. They’re open for those who connect people, not for those who seek to brutally aggress,” Belgium’s prime minister Alexander De Croo said on Twitter.The bans apply to all Russian airlines, including flag carrier Aeroflot, and leave the country’s carriers with dwindling options for flight paths into western Europe.EU officials met on Sunday evening to discuss a range of new actions against Russia, including the flight ban.Several flights on Sunday turned round midflight and returned to Russia, including an Aeroflot flight between Moscow and Frankfurt, according to tracking service Flightradar24.The wave of restrictions came as EU sanctions against Russia prompted Germany’s flag carrier Lufthansa and KLM to suspend flights to the country for the next seven days.Air France has also suspended flights to Russia and through Russian airspace until further notice. As a result, all flights to China, South Korea and Japan are temporarily suspended while the carrier considers alternative routes bypassing Russia.Moscow has responded with tit-for-tat flight bans for airlines from many countries, leaving European airlines rushing to reroute aircraft and facing longer journey times to many parts of Asia.About 600 flights per day that take off or land in Europe would normally fly through Russia’s airspace, according to data from Cirium.Many airlines would typically use Russian airspace when flying the “great circle route” over northern Russia and into parts of Asia, including China and Japan.European airlines have different levels of exposure to Asia, which is still closed to many visitors because of coronavirus. At the extreme, Finnair has built its long-haul business model on routes east over Russia.Finnair warned it faced “significant consequences” and the loss of many of its routes to Asia. “For many of our north-east Asia flights, rerouting would mean considerably longer flight time, and operations would not be economically feasible,” the airline said on Sunday.Virgin Atlantic has suspended a route that transported cargo between London and Shanghai, while British Airways confirmed it would reroute to avoid Russian airspace, leading to longer flight times and higher fuel costs.Speaking before the rapid set of flight bans, one European airlines executive predicted bans from Russian airspace would be “catastrophic” for the industry.However, the damage is mitigated by very weak demand for flights to Asia.BA was not currently flying any services to China or Japan, while it would normally operate multiple flights a day, its chief executive Sean Doyle said on Friday, as he played down the impact of the bans.Azerbaijan Air Navigation Services said it had opened up alternative air traffic routes for airlines looking to avoid Russian airspace without adding huge diversions to flights.Additional reporting from Sam Fleming in Brussels, Richard Milne in Oslo, Valentina Pop in Brussels, Jude Webber in Dublin, Nastassia Astrasheuskaya in Moscow, Joshua Oliver in London, Sarah White in Paris and Joe Miller in Frankfurt
84  In the space of 30 minutes, Olaf Scholz overturned decades of German foreign and defence policy.Speaking to the Bundestag in a special session on Sunday, the chancellor announced a massive €100bn fund to modernise the military. He also vowed that Germany would finally meet its Nato commitment to spend 2 per cent of gross domestic product yearly on defence — up from the 1.5 per cent currently spent that has long frustrated allies.The plans could mark a watershed moment for the way Europe’s largest economy engages with the world.Coming into office barely three months ago, Scholz’s cabinet had taken the reins from Angela Merkel with an ambitious plan of domestic modernisation, and seemed reluctant to be sidetracked by a foreign entanglement or make any moves that could hit the economy.“President Putin created a new reality with his invasion of Ukraine. This new reality requires a clear response,” Scholz said. “We have given it.”His words left observers reeling. Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany, who earlier on Sunday criticised the government for doing too little for Ukraine, called the Bundestag session a “truly historic moment”.Images of the destruction visited on Ukraine — and growing public outrage over German hesitancy to act — have pushed Scholz’s cabinet to outline a plan of action that critics and allies alike had unsuccessfully demanded for years.The new plan upends many traditional German policy dogmas — from pointing to its second world war legacy to justify avoiding military expenditures, to its focus on trade and dialogue instead of tougher stances toward authoritarian states.“There has been a lot of shock, but also a sense of shame and guilt — that we underestimated what Putin would do, that we believed our weapons wouldn’t make a difference,” said Thorsten Benner, head of the Global Public Policy Institute in Berlin.For weeks, the government stood by a longstanding German policy of not delivering weapons to active conflict zones. Foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said that sending weapons would only increase the likelihood of violence.Scholz, meanwhile, sparked pundits’ derision and social media memes over his seeming refusal to utter the words “Nord Stream 2”, let alone threaten to halt it. He finally agreed to suspend the Kremlin-backed pipeline this week, after months of dodging US pressure and sticking to the line of his predecessor, Merkel, that it was purely a commercial project.On Sunday, Baerbock acknowledged the country was making a “180-degree turn”.“Perhaps it is the case that Germany is today leaving behind a form of special restraint in foreign and security policy,” said Baerbock, from a Green party long known for its pacifism.“If our world is different, then our politics must also be different.”The first signs of the shift came on Saturday night when Germany, the last big country to resist plans to suspend Russian banks from the international payment system, Swift, finally accepted the move.That same evening, after weeks of dragging its feet over allowing Estonia to send some East German howitzers, it agreed both to allow the transfer, and for the Netherlands to send 400 German-made rocket-propelled grenades.Soon after that, Berlin announced its own plans to send missiles, armoured vehicles, and 10,000 tons of fuel.Now, Benner said, Germany may become increasingly willing to provide arms to like-minded allies.The new proposals required the three parties that make up the German government to kill some of their most treasured policies.Scholz’s centre-left Social Democrats are relinquishing their more open stance toward Russia, a principle many of its stalwarts held dear. They will also bolster support for a nuclear sharing agreement with Washington many were long wary of.The chancellor now plans on replacing Germany’s ageing Tornado jets, which can be loaded with nuclear missiles, with US F-35 fighter jets. He vowed, however, that the next generation of planes and tanks would need to be built in Europe — and in particular, France.The Greens accepted a pledge to increase capacity for coal and gas reserves — as well as to Scholz’s plan to build two liquid natural gas terminals to bring in LNG from Qatar and the US as a way to reduce its energy dependence on Russia, which provides Germany with 55 per cent of its imported gas.From Germany’s pro-business and fiscally orthodox Free Democrats, finance minister Christian Lindner made an impassioned argument for taking on debt to fund the new plans: “It is not a debt, it is an investment in our future.”The speeches on Sunday were met with bursts of applause and standing ovations in parliament.But the real test is yet to come, when the aftershocks affect Germans themselves — whether they are cuts in Russian energy supplies, higher energy costs, or financial chaos for businesses resulting from the Swift sanctions.“You can’t change a world view overnight,” Benner said. “They will need to bring along the German public.and convince them the easy years are over, the good ride most of us have had since 1989 is something we will need to fight for again.”Scholz made a strong attempt in his Sunday speech.The question facing Germans, he said, was “whether we allow Putin to turn back the clock, or whether we mobilise our power to set boundaries for warmongers like Putin”.
85  Vladimir Putin is a “genius”, chortled Donald Trump. The former US president was speaking on the very eve of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — and was lost in admiration for the “very savvy” man in the Kremlin.So what has this genius achieved? Four days into the invasion and Russian troops have failed to win the quick victory that Putin was counting on. Ukrainian resistance is much fiercer than the Russian leader anticipated, as Ukraine’s army fights back and the population mobilises. Captured Russian soldiers have been filmed complaining that they were told they were going on a training mission.The international response has also been tougher, more co-ordinated and united than Putin bargained for. Russia is being cut out of the global financial system. Most European airspace has been closed to Russian airlines. There has been a historic reversal in German foreign and security policy — with Berlin finally sending weaponry to Ukraine and pledging to spend more than 2 per cent of gross domestic product on defence. The Nato alliance has been given a new sense of purpose. Russia is turning into a pariah, with even China failing to back it at the UN — it abstained instead.Inside Russia itself, panicked citizens are rushing to withdraw money from banks. The rouble has plummeted in value, as has the Russian stock market. Small demonstrations against the war have broken out across the country, with the protesters swiftly arrested. Local celebrities, oligarchs and even the children of some Russian officials have condemned the conflict. Putin’s own officials look visibly uncomfortable as they take his orders in front of television cameras. The Russian official media have been left in the incredible position of denying the extent of the war, as it continues to insist that this is just a special military operation to support the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.Meanwhile, Ukraine itself is receiving a level of international admiration and recognition that is unprecedented since the country won independence in 1991. Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, once derided as a comic actor out of his depth, has won international acclaim for his inspirational leadership. His physical bravery on the streets of Kyiv is a marked contrast to the cowardice of Putin, who is too scared of a virus to allow his own officials within breathing distance. Calls for Ukraine to be put on a fast-track to EU membership are growing.Putin has achieved all of this in a mere four days. Genius, sheer genius!But a humiliated and cornered Putin is likely to become even more dangerous and ruthless. That was underlined on Sunday, when the Russian leader put his country’s nuclear forces on alert.Unable to achieve the easy victory that he anticipated, Putin seems unlikely to back down. Pride, paranoia and his own personal survival point to the use of ever more radical and dangerous tactics. One senior western official predicted to me that “Putin will only dig in and this will get very ugly”.Western security analysts have been warning of the possible use of thermobaric missiles in Ukraine — “flame-thrower” bombs which Russia has deployed in Chechnya and Syria and can cause huge loss of life. The nuclear threats that Putin is deploying, while clearly intended to intimidate, cannot be entirely discounted given his state of mind.Since Putin himself seems highly unlikely to retreat, there appear to be few peaceful ways out of this conflict. One small ray of hope is offered by the announcement that Russian and Ukrainian negotiators have agreed to meet at the Belarus border. But there is, as yet, no sign that Putin is prepared to back away from his maximalist demands that would involve further dismemberment of Ukrainian territory and the de facto end of the country’s independence. The fact that the man originally nominated to lead Russia’s delegation is a junior former official, noted for his extreme nationalism, is not a promising sign.It may be that the only real route to peace would be for the Russian governing elite somehow to force Putin out of power. The videos that their leader has released showing him humiliating members of the security establishment, as he compels them to endorse his policies, are meant to demonstrate his total authority. But they also highlight misgivings within his own inner circle.However, the current Russian system is less collective than even the post-Stalin Soviet Union. High-ranking Soviet officials were able to force Nikita Khrushchev from power in 1964. But Putin rules more like a pre-Soviet tsar. It is hard to see how internal opposition to him, within the government, can mobilise.It is possible, however, that as the human and economic costs of the war mount it will become more difficult to contain the public protests against the conflict. Russian troops within Ukraine may also become demoralised as they take losses and are ordered to use brutal tactics against civilians. Eventually some combination of elite anxiety, military failure and popular discontent could force the Russian leader out of office. But — for now — the danger that Putin poses to Ukraine, Russia and the world is only growing.
86  Volodymyr Zelensky’s response was unequivocal. Offered evacuation by the US from Kyiv on Friday, he replied: “I need ammunition, not a ride.”That evening at a crisis summit of Nato leaders, dozens of western countries declared they would give the Ukrainian president what he had asked for to support his country’s resistance against Russia’s invasion.The US pledged $350mn of military aid, in addition to the $650mn it has committed over the past year. By Saturday evening, even Germany had reversed its historic position of never sending weapons to conflict zones.But promising aid is one thing, western defence sources and analysts caution. The challenge is to deliver it to Ukraine’s armed forces fast enough, or to a resistance movement should the Zelensky administration fall.“The political rhetoric of support for a resistance is easy, delivering it in practice is harder,” said John Raine, senior adviser for geopolitical due diligence at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, in London.“It requires investing in the legal and political structures needed to sustain it, and the supply chain logistics that actually dock the military aid with the resistance forces that will use it.”The first challenge is to ensure deliveries are of appropriate military equipment that augments existing capacity and requires little training.“Simple kit is best,” one senior defence source said. “That means secure communications and night vision equipment, handheld anti-tank and anti-air craft missiles, and of course ammunition.”“Ukraine’s forces will be using between four and 10 times what they would expect to use from exercises, and the less well-trained may be using more still,” he added.Getting the supplies to Ukrainian forces is also a challenge. In the lead-up to Russia’s attack on Thursday, Nato allies could deliver equipment by air or land, direct to military depots. But Ukraine’s skies are now dominated by Russian fighter jets, and Nato allies have said they will not provide air cover as that would effectively mean declaring war on Moscow. Many Ukrainian airfields have also been rendered unusable by missile strikes.As a result, future deliveries will have to move in more covert conveys through contested territory, most likely from Poland which shares a 535km border with Ukraine and has been the main destination for the Nato troops deployed to its eastern flank this year.On Saturday, there were reports that airborne Russian forces had landed in western Ukraine, potentially complicating deliveries further.“Nothing has been cut off by the Russian advance,” a senior western intelligence official said. “There’s a broad range of.political and military assistance that can still be provided.”There are some simple guidelines such aid convoys will probably follow, defence sources say. Trucks will need to avoid moving in bumper to bumper convoys and travel at a variable pace so they are harder to track and attack, and carry air defence weapons such as Stinger missiles and multi-barrel machine guns to deter Russian jets.“The important thing is guard the handovers, get the supplies to the right place and then disperse them. You can’t just deposit in a depot,” said the defence source. “It’s complex but not difficult.”Such operations become harder if field units are encircled — as may soon happen to Ukrainian troops fighting in the east of the country.“Ukraine’s tactical units started the conflict with 10 days of munitions and that will now have been reduced,” said Jack Watling, research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London. “There is more in stockpiles but it has to be moved out to operational units.tricky if they are being surrounded.”For now, supply convoys are getting through. Russia may also have to divert units to try to intercept deliveries, although on Sunday a senior US defence official said there were no indications that had happened yet.But the challenges rise if Kyiv is taken, the Zelensky administration falls and Ukraine’s army and territorial reserve fragment into a mosaic of resistance forces, armed militias and civil movements.“Nato only works with governments,” another western intelligence official said.Weapons might also fall into Russian hands and be turned against the resistance. Poland, although it recently signed a tripartite security agreement with Ukraine and the UK, might balk at remaining a base for supplies in such a confusing scenario.“It is one thing to accept refugees, as Poland is so commendably doing now,” said a senior former western intelligence official. “But it is another thing to shift weapons clandestinely across a border at night — an action Russia might view as a casus belli.”Western experience of supporting rebel movements — be that in Central America or Afghanistan in the 1980s, or Syria in this century — has been fraught with legal, political and ethical controversy. The one country that has made it a central tenet of its military strategy is Iran, which has cultivated and sustained a network of allies across the Middle East, analysts said.Sustaining resistance movements “can be a highly dynamic process as the conflict evolves often unexpectedly”, Raine said.Nor is there any recent precedent of western countries supporting the resistance movement of an internationally recognised government in exile. The last time that happened, analysts say, was during the second world war, when Charles de Gaulle rallied the French resistance from London.“If the government falls, Zelensky will need to escape Kyiv for Lviv or Poland,” said the defence source. “There is a large and rich Ukrainian diaspora that can provide support. He represents hope, and the promise that Ukraine will return. It’s important that he survives.”Additional reporting by Demetri Sevastopulo in Washington
87  The US and its western allies unveiled the most punitive penalties to date against Russia, the latest in a barrage of sanctions rolled out in response to the country’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.The measures announced on Saturday take direct aim at Russia’s central bank and seek to hobble the country’s connectivity to the global financial system. They are intended to destabilise the Russian economy, building on sanctions imposed in recent days that target oligarchs as well as its banks, high-tech companies and aircraft makers.“It’s becoming increasingly clear that Russia is going the way of Cuba and Iran in terms of the significance of the sanctions being imposed,” said Daniel Tannebaum, a former US Treasury sanctions official who is now a partner at Oliver Wyman, a consultancy.A senior US administration official added that the new measures amount to Russia “getting kicked off the international financial system” and becoming a “global economic and financial pariah”.Here is how the new restrictions may work in practice.The US, UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and the European Commission on Saturday said they would block Russia’s central bank from using its roughly $630bn stockpile of foreign reserves, harming its ability to shore up its economy and shield it from the costs associated with its attacks on Ukraine.The sanctions were announced alongside plans to eject some Russian lenders from the Swift financial messaging system, which is used to communicate the details of trillions of dollars’ worth of daily payments between banks.Their primary aim is to hamper Russia’s ability to circumvent the extensive sanctions that have been imposed on the country.“It’s a direct attempt to strike at Russia’s ability to weather out sanctions, because the way they would weather out sanctions is by relying on their reserves,” said Daniel Glaser, who served as assistant secretary for terrorist financing and financial crimes at the US Treasury department from 2011-17 and is now at K2 Integrity, a risk advisory firm.“The less control they have over their reserves or the less they could do with their reserves, the more vulnerable to the second round of pressure they become,” he added.The US and its allies have not yet specified how the new regime against the Russian central bank would work. Glaser said the most “straightforward” US method would be to add it to the Treasury’s “specially designated nationals” list — where assets of individuals and companies are blocked and US individuals and commercial banks are prohibited from dealing with them.The country’s foreign exchange reserves are a pillar of its economic strength, and the western allies are attempting to undermine its ability to tap the stockpile. While Russia has aggressively pared down its dollar reserves, a notable chunk of its foreign exchange stockpile is held overseas in the US, Germany, France, UK, Austria and Japan.If Russia were unable to sell large swaths of its foreign assets in exchange for local currency, it would be hamstrung in its ability to defend the rouble. Elina Ribakova, deputy chief economist for the Institute of International Finance, said imposing sanctions on the central bank could eventually lead to bank runs. Russians have already been flocking to banks to withdraw cash amid fears that the country’s financial system will seize up.“I have great confidence the effects of these measures will be felt immediately in Russian financial markets,” a senior US official said. “Market participants understand that without Russia having the ability to defend its currency, it will go into freefall.”The country’s record-high $19bn current account surplus, amassed on the back of its significant energy exports, will offer some protection. Russia continues to earn large amounts of foreign exchange via oil and gas sales, which should support the economy and help pay for imports. And the Russian central bank said it was propping up domestic lenders by offering them rouble liquidity.Lacking access to the reserves to guard against the rouble’s collapse, the central bank would be left with only two clear options: raising interest rates, and capital controls.The central bank may seek help from China, where more than 14 per cent of its foreign exchange reserves are held — the biggest single foreign share. It is not clear, however, whether China will want to provide it. While rushing to Russia’s aid would undermine US dominance of global finance, Chinese banks could fear secondary sanctions that would cut off access to dollars and euros.The central bank could also try to sell a chunk of its 2,299 tonnes of gold, the fifth largest stockpile in the world, to friendlier governments. This gold is held in locations in the Russian Federation, according to the central bank.But Sergei Guriev, an economist at Sciences Po university in Paris, said selling those reserves would also be difficult.“Whoever says it will be easy to sell gold or yuans must be kidding — Chinese state banks are already blocking financing of Russian oil sales. China is afraid and rightly so of secondary sanctions. This is really a game changer,” he said.The direct exposure of western financial institutions to Russia is modest, partly due to sanctions imposed after its 2014 annexation of Crimea, as well as the rise of more investor-friendly economies in Asia.Foreign investors held $20bn of Russia’s dollar debt and rouble-denominated bonds worth $37bn at the end of 2021, according to data from the Russian central bank.Russian bonds comprise about 6 per cent of JPMorgan’s widely tracked index of emerging market local currency debt, and roughly 3 per cent of the foreign currency version. Russia only accounts for 3.4 per cent of MSCI’s widely tracked emerging markets equity index, less than Saudi Arabia or South Africa.The measures could leave Russian securities listed on overseas markets out in the cold, as banks become reluctant to permit intermediate trading and investors grow wary of adding any exposure.The local impact will be severe, according to Peter Williams, an analyst at Evercore ISI. “Russia banks and financial markets will likely face substantial stresses when they open, given the memories of the 1990s,” he said.In terms of banks’ exposure to Russia, the Bank for International Settlements estimates that foreign banks’ claims on the country’s banks stands at only $29.3bn, and overall claims on Russian entities amount to about $89bn, JPMorgan noted.That said, Europe in particular is heavily exposed to Russia’s enormous energy sector. “Russia accounts for well over 10 per cent of global oil and natural gas production and plays a significant role in European natural gas markets,” the bank said in a report this weekend.The proposal to sever a number of Russian banks from the Swift network aims to ensure those lenders are “disconnected from the international financial system”, according to the allies.This would come on top of existing, more targeted individual sanctions on Russian banks. The move follows pleas from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky for banks to be cut out of the network, making it more difficult for Russians to make cross-border transactions.Again, the details have not been set out, but officials say they do not want to undermine western economies’ ability to purchase Russian fossil fuels, meaning there will be significant carve-outs from the Swift ban. One way of achieving this would be to permit energy-focused Russian banks to remain on the network.Yes. The US has frozen the central bank assets of hostile regimes including Venezuela, Iran and, more recently, Afghanistan. Iranian banks were also forced off the Swift network by President Donald Trump in 2018.The Iranian sanctions could provide a blueprint for the Russian central bank ban. The sanctions, imposed by the Trump administration in 2019 after the relaxation of earlier measures imposed by President Barack Obama in 2012, froze central bank assets held in custodial accounts in the US.In addition, the Iran sanctions stopped financial institutions from engaging in transactions on behalf of, or offering other services to, the central bank.“I believe we are on a conveyor belt towards Iran-style sanctions, which included this action against their central bank,” said Edward Fishman of the Center for a New American Security think-tank, before the latest moves were announced.Reporting by Colby Smith, Claire Jones, Sam Fleming, Demetri Sevastopulo, Max Seddon, Tommy Stubbington and Robin Wigglesworth
88  Markets often react strongly to geopolitical events, but then later shrug them off. Not this time. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a key economic turning point that will have many lasting consequences. Among them will be a quickening of the shift to a bipolar global financial system — one based on the dollar, the other on the renminbi.The process of financial decoupling between Russia and the west has, of course, been going on for some time. Western banks reduced their exposure to Russian financial institutions by 80 per cent following the country’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, and their claims on the rest of Russia’s private sector have halved since then, according to a recent Capital Economics report. The new and more aggressive sanctions announced by the US will take that decoupling much further.It will also make Russia much more dependent on China, which will use the US and EU sanctions as an opportunity to pick up excess Russian oil and gas on the cheap. China is no fan of Vladimir Putin’s war. But it needs Russian commodities and arms, and sees the country as a key part of a new Beijing-led order, something Moscow is aware of.“China is our strategic cushion,” Sergei Karaganov, a political scientist at the Moscow-based Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, told Nikkei Asia recently. “We know that in any difficult situation, we can lean on it for military, political and economic support.”That does not mean China would break US or European sanctions to support Russia, but it could certainly allow Russian banks and companies more access to its own financial markets and institutions. Indeed, just a few weeks ago, the two countries announced a “friendship without limits”, one that will certainly include closer financial ties as Russia is shut out of western markets. This follows a 2019 agreement between Russia and China to settle all trade in their respective currencies rather than in dollars. The war in Ukraine will speed this up. Witness, in the past few days, China lifting an import ban on Russian wheat, as well as a new long-term Chinese gas deal with Gazprom.All of this supports China’s long-term goal of building a post-dollarised world, in which Russia would be one of many vassal states settling all transactions in renminbi. Getting there is not an easy process. The Chinese want to de-dollarise, but they also want complete control of their own financial system. That’s a difficult circle to square. One of the reasons that the dollar is the world’s reserve currency is that, in contrast, the US markets are so open and liquid.Still, the Chinese hope to use trade and the petropolitics of the moment to increase the renminbi’s share of global foreign exchange. One high-level western investor in China told me he expected that share would rise from 2 per cent to as high as 7 per cent in the next three to four years. That is, of course, still minuscule compared with the position of the dollar, which is 59 per cent.But the Chinese are playing a long game. Finance is a key pillar in the new Great Power competition with America; currency, capital flows and the Belt and Road Initiative trade pathway will all play a role in that. Beijing is slowly diversifying its foreign exchange reserves, as well as buying up a lot of gold. This can be seen as a kind of hedge on a post-dollar word (the assumption being that gold will rise as the dollar falls).New US limits on capital flows to China on national security grounds may speed up the financial decoupling process further. If US pension funds can’t flow into China, self-sufficiency in capital markets becomes ever more important. Beijing has been trying to bolster trust and transparency in its own system, not only to attract non-US foreign investment, but also to encourage an onshore investment boom in which huge amounts of Chinese savings would be funnelled into domestic capital markets.While sanctions against Russia herald more decoupling, it is also possible that the economic fallout from the war (lowered demand, even higher inflation) would push America and other nations into succumbing to pricing pressures that would favour Chinese goods. While there is likely to be a lot of political posturing on both sides of the aisle about standing up to Russia and China, it takes a long time to decouple supply chains. Policymakers in Washington have yet to get really serious about it.Beijing, on the other hand, is quite serious about the new world order that it is pursuing. In his 1997 book, The Grand Chessboard, Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former US national security adviser, wrote presciently that the most dangerous geopolitical scenario for the west would be a “grand coalition of China, Russia, and perhaps Iran”. This would be led by Beijing and united not by ideology but by common grievances. “Averting this contingency, however remote it may be, will require a display of US geostrategic skill on [all] perimeters of Eurasia simultaneously,” he wrote.Financial markets are going to be a major field of battle. They will become a place to defend liberal values (for example, via sanctions against Russia) and renew old alliances. (Might the US and Europe come together to forge a strategy on both energy security and climate change?) They will also be a lot more sensitive to geopolitics than they have been in the past.
89  Until a few days ago, the EU’s debate on “strategic autonomy” pitted states calling for self-sufficiency in vital products against those preaching “interdependence”.Vladimir Putin’s war of aggression in Ukraine shows both sides were focused on the wrong adversary and the wrong sectors. The acute geostrategic challenge is not, it turns out, dependence on China for semiconductors or face masks but Russia’s ability to shrink the supply of oil, gas and raw materials to western users.The task is also more existential than they imagined: not retaining economic or technological leadership but countering a land war in Europe of the kind the EU was founded to make impossible. Really being an actor in your neighbourhood, let alone on the global stage, at times requires a much more direct approach.The good news is that, as often before, a crisis has united and focused EU leaders’ minds. With western partners, they have agreed unprecedented sanctions at record speed: targeting Putin personally, ejecting select Russian banks from the Swift cross-border banking network, and restricting some of Russia’s central bank reserves. But the EU remains too tempted by fine-tuned calibration. That is a good ideal for normal legislation and regulation, and a very bad one for a power contest.It was a mistake to hew to a gradualist approach before Putin’s invasion and think it could be deterred by ominously promising severe consequences always left up one’s sleeve. This reduced the EU to a reactive role, which Putin — a KGB man to the core — could manipulate through his mastery of confusion, ambiguity and contradiction.It also meant EU actions were priced in. Deterrence would have required “overreacting” to Putin’s escalating threats since last year, not reacting proportionately. Only hitting back much harder than expected would have met him at his own game and had any chance of frustrating his calculations.The time for deterrence is over; the fight must now be taken to the aggressor. Europe will not do so militarily (though it must keep sending arms to Ukraine). Instead, this again implies the financial equivalent of “shock and awe”. The EU, with the broader west, has the capacity. The question is whether it has the will to wield it fully.The debate on cutting Russia out of Swift is illustrative inasmuch as it is a bit of a red herring. Swift is a messaging system; it is harder for banks to transact without it but not impossible. Conversely, other measures can also block transactions thereby making Swift less relevant. But loopholes — such as EU and US concern about being able to pay for Russian fossil fuels — make partial sanctions only somewhat better than none.They could do much more: freeze all assets of every person and entity connected to the Russian state, including all Russian foreign reserves they can reach; publicise the nature and ownership of such assets; and criminalise all transactions with Russia-linked financial institutions and intermediaries that enable them. This means the US, the UK, and EU tax havens must stop their repugnant laundering of money and reputation for Putin’s gangster class. Is the west willing to maximally isolate the Russian economy, not just “selectively”?Make that choice, and ending Swift access fully follows as one technicality among many others. Simply put, the west can tell everyone to pick economic connections with Russia or with itself, just as the US told the world to choose between its financial system or Iran’s.This would engineer a Russian economic collapse, capital flight and bank runs at least on foreign currency deposits. Putin has built a war chest of reserves, but probably more than half could be seized. Moscow would surely stop oil and gas shipments, forcing the question: which of Russia and the EU is more dependent on the other?The answer lies in the politics of energy prices, which Putin no doubt thinks have shifted in his favour. But EU leaders can prepare their people for yet higher prices as an unavoidable sacrifice for freedom in Europe, while helping vulnerable states and households. The potential reservoir of support for this stance is a strength Putin’s autocracy does not enjoy.This would be a big step up from anything the EU has yet done. It would mean a de facto policy of regime change. But Ukrainians today face a replay of Europe’s 20th-century nightmares. So if not now, when? Everything we know about Putin should make us expect that his assault will turn more savage. The EU has the ability to demonstrate that overwhelming power can also take a civilised form.
90  Germany has announced a big shift in defence policy in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with Chancellor Olaf Scholz pledging a jump in military spending and a revamp of the armed forces.“With the invasion of Ukraine, we are in a new era,” he told a special session of the Bundestag on Sunday, where many MPs wore yellow and blue in solidarity with Ukraine.For weeks, Scholz’s government has withstood fierce criticism from rivals and allies over its reluctance to take a more aggressive position towards Russia. But he said recent developments and his own conversations with Vladimir Putin had convinced him the Russian president aims to build a new Russian empire, and that the defence of peace and democracy in Europe must be bolstered.Scholz vowed to invest €100bn this year in a special fund to modernise Germany’s military and, in the coming years, to boost yearly defence spending above 2 per cent of gross domestic product.As a Nato member, Germany has already pledged to spend 2 per cent of its GDP on defence but, like many of its European allies, it has almost never reached that target.The pledges mark a critical turning point for Germany, which under Angela Merkel’s 16-year leadership pursued a policy of cautious engagement with Russia, for example backing the Nord Stream gas pipelines.Merkel also resisted pressure from the US, in particular from then-president Donald Trump, to boost its defence spending. Germany refused to send weapons to Ukraine, strictly adhering to a restrictive arms export policy that bans weapons sales to conflict areas.But Berlin has been forced to overturn those stances amid growing political and public pressure as Ukraine came under fierce attack. On Friday, Germany not only agreed to allow countries with German weapons to send deliveries to Ukraine, it also offered to send missiles, fuel and vehicles via Poland.Scholz also vowed to bolster the German presence in eastern European Nato allies and to modernise the fighter jets needed for its nuclear sharing with the US. He pledged to purchase drones — long a contentious issue in Germany — and to build next-generation fighter jets and tanks that “should be built here in Europe, with European partners, especially France”.The question facing Germans, Scholz said, was “whether we allow Putin to turn back the clock, or whether we mobilise power to set boundaries for warmongers such as Putin”.Germany has also promised to speed up efforts to decrease its dependency on Russian fossil fuels. Scholz announced plans to construct two liquefied natural gas terminals as quickly as possible, and to build coal and gas reserves, buying more gas on global markets. But Scholz said he remained committed to Germany’s vow to become carbon neutral by 2045, and said he also wanted to build up renewable energy “as fast as possible”.About 55 per cent of Germany’s gas imports come from Russia, a significant economic weak spot as it works with western allies to increase pressure on Putin.German finance minister Christian Lindner said on Sunday he also supported a push for more renewables, calling energy security a new priority and saying “renewable energy is freedom energy”.
91  People in Moscow and other Russian cities stormed ATMs and bank branches in search of cash, both in roubles and dollars, as they feared a collapse of the national currency and inability to use international payment systems.Queues of people seeking to withdraw foreign currencies started to form as early as Thursday morning, after the decision by Russia’s president Vladimir Putin to start a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, sending the rouble to its historic lows. A Financial Times reporter could witness that some branches of international banks ran out of US dollars by midday that day.The search for cash continued into the weekend as EU countries were agreeing measures to curtail the Russian central bank’s ability to use its foreign currency reserves and cut off some Russian lenders from the Swift global payment system. Worrying they would not be able to pay with their Visa and Mastercard cards, ordinary citizens went looking for any cash in any currency.On Sunday, the central bank sought to calm markets and depositors by pledging to continuously supply banks with rouble liquidity, with no limit on the amount banks wanted to borrow. It also said it would “significant expand” its so-called Lombard list, which includes the securities it would accept as collateral to help banks cover their refinancing needs.“The Russian banking system is stable, has sufficient capital reserves and liquidity to function without outages in any situation. All client funds are secure and available at any time,” the central bank said in a statement.Russia’s domestic payment messaging system, developed in the event the country’s banks are cut out of Swift, would continue to work “in any scenario,” it added.Late on Saturday, some people sat at the banks in front of empty ATMs waiting for fresh batches of cash to arrive. Many more went lining up in the early hours of Sunday, after the US and its European allies announced punitive measures on the Russian central bank and the country’s biggest lenders.“I withdrew money at the beginning of all this, and I am going to go search for an ATM again now. Because I want to have a month worth of cash in case there are technical glitches with cards. I already had problems paying for a taxi with Google pay yesterday,” said Ekaterina, a Moscow resident.“I believe my bank is not under sanctions, and I doubt my money will disappear altogether, but there is a risk I won’t be able to buy food,” she said. “We simply do not know what to expect of the government. I can’t forecast, so I want cash to be around.”Bankers are worried of the effect such withdrawals will have on the banking system.An executive at a western bank in Moscow said: “Their cash withdrawals are harming Russia, the banks’ liquidity is falling.” Sanctions on the central bank limit its ability for forex interventions, which it had used before to stabilise the rouble and not let it into free float and collapse.“I cannot even imagine the rouble tomorrow when trading opens up,” the banker said on condition of anonymity. “The central bank will try to support [the rouble], the question is [for] how long. Non-residents are selling Russian assets, getting rid of the rouble and it is very bad for us.”
92  If not now, when? The EU will expel some Russian banks from the global interbank payments network Swift — but may still permit some banks to take payment for the energy exports that are its main overseas earner. No wonder Ukrainians are disappointed.“If the EU does not close the financial system to Russia, it can still access cash and pay for warfare,” said Max Dzhyhun, a political consultant speaking from an undisclosed location within Ukraine.The fog of war cloaks the meeting rooms of Brussels as well as the outskirts of Kyiv, where Ukrainian soldiers and civilian volunteers are bravely resisting the Russian army. But if EU sanctions exclude energy payments via Swift, it would be a glaring omission. Utilities in Germany would still be able to make streamlined payments to Russian energy giants such as Gazprom for the gas many Germans depend on to heat their homes.The energy policy errors of politicians such as former chancellors Gerhard Schröder and Angela Merkel are returning to haunt them.An energy payments carve-out would be consistent with western leniency towards Gazprombank. The US has hit other big Russian banks with sanctions far tougher than those applied to the financial services arm of the gas giant.There is a disconnect in EU sanctions. On one hand, ministers are dithering over Swift. On the other, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, has pledged with other Western leaders to freeze the assets of the Russian central bank.On Friday one US sanctions expert had classified this as a move more radical than kicking all Russian banks off Swift. “The west may be reserving this as a sanction in case Russia starts menacing Moldova or Poland,” he said.The failure of Russia to secure a swift victory in Ukraine is forcing the EU’s hand. Von der Leyen pledged on Saturday night to “paralyse” the Russian economy by moving against its billions of dollars of overseas assets.Russia has planned for this, building defences against asset freezes on its central bank for years. Ten years ago, 90 per cent of its foreign exchange and gold reserves involved western counterparties or issuers, according to Sven Behrendt, of GeoEconomica, a German political risk consultancy. He estimates that less than 45 per cent of its estimated $622bn in ready funds now meets that description, using Russian data from earlier this year.We can assume Russia’s central bank has been whittling down its exposure to western sanctions even further in recent weeks, buying gold, yen and Chinese securities. But it cannot insulate the Russian state from the unpredictable financial shocks widening sanctions may trigger. A further collapse in the rouble, capital flight and bank runs are all now on the agenda.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

93  Mikhail Fridman, one of Russia’s richest men, said the war in Ukraine was a “tragedy” and called on the “bloodshed” to end after President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of the country.In a letter sent to staff at his London-based private equity firm LetterOne on Friday and seen by the Financial Times, the billionaire said he was “convinced” that “war can never be the answer”.“I was born in Western Ukraine and lived there until I was 17. My parents are Ukrainian citizens and live in Lviv, my favourite city,” Fridman wrote in the email. “But I have also spent much of my life as a citizen of Russia, building and growing businesses. I am deeply attached to Ukrainian and Russian peoples and see the current conflict as a tragedy for them both.”Fridman continued: “I do not make political statements, I am a businessman with responsibilities to my many thousands of employees in Russia and Ukraine. I am convinced however that war can never be the answer. This crisis will cost lives and damage two nations who have been brothers for hundreds of years.”“While a solution seems frighteningly far off, I can only join those whose fervent desire is for the bloodshed to end. I’m sure my partners share my view.”The Ukraine-born Fridman, who normally avoids making political statements, is the first Russian businessman to speak out against the conflict amid preparations for extensive US, UK, and EU sanctions against oligarchs with significant presences in the west.Following Fridman’s statement, a second oligarch — the fervently pro-Putin metals magnate Oleg Deripaska on whom the US has imposed sanctions — released a short statement calling to end the war.“Peace is very important! Negotiations must begin as soon as possible!” Deripaska wrote on Telegram.Fridman divides his time between Moscow, where the Russian edition of Forbes estimates his fortune at $15.5bn, and London. The Sunday Times ranked him as the UK’s 11th-richest man last year.Roman Abramovich, a Russian oligarch who owns Chelsea Football Club, said on Saturday that he was ceding “stewardship” of the English Premier League club to its charitable foundation.Though several prominent Russians have expressed their opposition to the war, they have mostly come from the ranks of entertainers such as the actress Liya Akhedzhakova, television presenter Ivan Urgant, and journalists including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dmitry Muratov.Like Fridman, most of the celebrities have avoided criticising Putin directly or blaming Russia for starting the war, instead choosing to call for a more general end to hostilities.Fridman and his partners own Alfa-Bank, Russia’s largest privately held bank, as well as supermarket chain X5, the country’s largest, and mobile carrier Veon.Their significance to Russia’s economy was underlined on Thursday when Petr Aven, Fridman’s business partner, attended a roundtable of top oligarchs and state company heads in the Kremlin, where Putin explained his rationale for starting the conflict and discussed measures to mitigate western sanctions.Fridman, who confirmed to the FT he sent the email, is also an important figure in Ukraine, where Alfa-Bank is one of the country’s largest lenders, and he is funding a memorial to the Babiy yare massacre of Jews by Nazi Germany during the second world war.The US and EU put Alfa-Bank under sanctions that restrict its ability to raise debt financing on international markets but do not go as far as the measures used to block major state lenders such as VTB from the global financial system.After selling their stake in oil major TNK-BP to state-run giant Rosneft for $14bn in 2013, Fridman and his partners set up LetterOne, which is predominantly focused on energy and technology investments.Its holdings also include Holland & Barrett, one of the largest health foods retailers in Europe, which it acquired in 2017 for £1.8bn.John Browne, the former chief executive of BP, served as chair to L1’s energy unit for six years before stepping down last year.Last year, Fridman told the FT the general environment in the UK for oligarchs had “deteriorated because of the stand-off between Russia and the west,” but added that “on a personal level, it’s become a bit more friendly, because people made a distinction between the general Russian oligarchs label and us personally.”
94  The US and western allies will place sanctions on Russia’s central bank and remove some of the country’s lenders from the Swift global financial messaging system, in their harshest response yet to the invasion of Ukraine.In a joint statement on Saturday, the US, UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and the European Commission said they would prevent the Russian central bank from using its international reserves to undermine broader sanctions.“[Vladimir] Putin’s government is getting kicked off the international financial system,” said a senior US official, who added that the measures would push the Russian currency “into freefall”.The leaders said they would eject some unnamed Russian banks from Swift, ensuring they are “disconnected from the international financial system” and harming their ability to operate. They also vowed to crack down on “golden passports” that let wealthy Russians buy citizenship, and to impose sanctions on officials and elites close to the government.The joint action on sanctions is an escalation in the west’s financial and economic response to Russia’s invasion. “We will hold Russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for Putin,” the leaders said in their joint statement.The Biden administration official said Putin had turned Russia into a “global economic and financial pariah”.“What we are committing to do here is to disarm the central bank,” the official said, adding that the action would affect all of the institution’s roughly $630bn in foreign reserves.“Without being able to buy the rouble from western financial institutions. Putin’s central bank will lose the ability to offset the impact of our sanctions,” he said. “The rouble will fall even further, inflation will spike and the central bank will be left defenceless.”European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said she would propose to EU leaders that they should “paralyse the assets of Russia’s central bank” to freeze its transactions and make it impossible to liquidate assets.Josh Lipsky, director of the Atlantic Council’s Geoeconomics Center who previously worked at the IMF, said before the announcement that hitting the central bank would be an “extraordinarily significant and damaging move” to Russia’s economy.“A G20 central bank has never been sanctioned before. This is not Iran. This is not Venezuela,” said Lipsky.Edward Fishman, a former US official now at the Center for a New American Security, said it could present a “devastating blow” to the Russian economy that would eclipse the significance of a Swift ban. The US has previously sanctioned the central banks of only Iran, Venezuela and North Korea.A US official declined to say if Washington would sanction the central bank further by adding it to the Treasury’s “Specially Designated Nationals” list, which Fishman described as “the single most impactful sanction that you could apply to Russia, and you could do it with a stroke of the pen”.“It would render a sizeable chunk of their foreign exchange reserves unusable overnight,” Fishman said.Such a move would ban US entities from dealing with the central bank, which would mean institutions would be “skittish about moving any assets on behalf of the Russian central bank”, he said.Zelensky had pleaded with western capitals to use Swift to pressure Russia. Cutting banks out of the network will make it more difficult for Russians to make cross-border transactions.Swift said on Saturday that it was “engaging with European authorities to understand the details of the entities that will be subject to the new measures, and.preparing to comply upon legal instruction”.The body has found itself in the spotlight during international crises, most notably over Iran’s nuclear programme. In 2012 and 2018, it was pushed to shut out Iranian banks targeted by sanctions. The US official said the new move against Russia was the “Iran model”.The goal will be to avoid undermining mechanisms for western economies to purchase energy from Russia.The allies have not finalised the details, but will either carve out certain energy-focused banks or use product definitions in the Swift system to permit energy-related transactions.Follow on Twitter: Demetri Sevastopulo, Colby Smith, Sam Fleming
95  Yana Shevchenko is freezing, her phone is dying and she doubts she has the strength to push her way on to the next train out of Lviv. But nothing will deter her from her dash for Poland — and safety.“I just want to get out of here,” the computer programmer from the city of Kharkiv said. “And away from this bloody war.”It might sound like a simple aspiration, but thousands of others have the same idea. Lviv railway station swarms with people displaced by Russia’s offensive against Ukraine, many desperate to make the 100km journey to the Polish town of Przemysl and escape the war.Lviv, Ukraine’s westernmost city, has become the destination of choice for people fleeing the Russian invasion that has targeted some of Ukraine’s biggest population centres. Many come from the capital Kyiv, which has been subjected to a barrage of artillery and long-range missile strikes, some of them hitting residential areas.The displaced are, in many cases, opting to sit out the fighting in Lviv, a relatively safe haven, while others are using it as a landing stage for destinations further west, beyond Ukraine’s borders.The historic city, which used to be part of the Austro-Hungarian empire and survived second world war occupation by Germany largely unscathed, is bursting at the seams.Some think it could become Ukraine’s alternative capital if Kyiv falls. The UK embassy has moved there, though other countries, such as the US and Israel, have already switched their diplomatic presence from Lviv to Poland.The city’s history as a cradle of Ukrainian nationalism would make it an ideal candidate. “Lviv is the least Sovietised and least Russified city in Ukraine,” said Yaroslav Hrytsak, professor of history at the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv. “It has the atmosphere of a European city.”Yet some fear its relative calm could end at any time, and with it its role as a conduit to safety. “We’re preparing for the worst-case scenario — columns of Russian forces moving on Lviv,” said Serhiy Kiral, its deputy mayor.Already, he said, Lviv was awash with rumours about Russian spies and saboteurs painting suspicious marks on buildings that could direct artillery fire at them, or act as guides during aerial attacks.Many of Lviv’s residents seem braced for catastrophe. Long queues have formed next to cash dispensers, some of which have run out of money.Food shops have emptied out, hotels closed down and new arrivals hunt vainly for places to stay. The city’s roads are snarled up with cars, buses and transit vans shuttling people west.Some are going in the opposite direction, among them Slavik Korshunov, a Ukrainian living in Warsaw who said he had come home to fight. His plan was to report to his local army recruitment office on Monday. “No one else is going to help us,” he explained. “We’ve been left on our own.”Kiral, the deputy mayor, said long queues of would-be recruits had formed outside the offices of Lviv’s territorial defence units.Even non-combatants are fired up. Larisa Lesnichenko, a music teacher, said she planned to travel back to her hometown of Kryvyi Rih, in central Ukraine, having been on a brief holiday near Lviv. “I was born in this country and I’ll stay here,” she said. “If I have to, I’ll tear [the Russians] apart with my own teeth.”Travelling with her is Alexander Fomin, a retired miner. “The Russians thought we’d welcome them with flowers,” he said. “Instead they got funeral wreaths.”In Lviv city hall, volunteers manned telephone hotlines for displaced people from across Ukraine asking where the border crossing into Poland is and how to get there. The council has set up reception centres in 260 locations in and around Lviv, some of them in schools and gyms.Oleh Malets, who runs the co-ordination centre for displaced people, said all of them would be full in a matter of days. “Some 885 people have arrived in the last two days alone,” he said. “And more trains and buses are arriving every hour.”Already, according to the UN refugee agency, almost 120,000 people have fled Ukraine into Poland and other neighbouring countries since the Russian invasion started.At Lviv railway station, Yana Shevchenko keeps an eye out for her train as she is jostled by dozens of other would-be passengers.“I saw things like this in movies but I never thought it would happen to me,” she said. “I just want to be safe.”
96  As Vladimir Putin launched his military assault on Ukraine, the country’s media censor issued a series of stark warnings. Any outlet that cited sources other than the Kremlin or its armed forces could be banned, even for using the words “attack, invasion, or declaration of war” to describe it.“We stress that it is Russian official information sources who have accurate and up-to-date information,” the censor Roskomnadzor said.Such fierce enforcement of the official narrative for the “special military operation” that Russia’s military began in Ukraine on Thursday is part of a huge propaganda barrage accompanying the invasion.“It’s like a movie. The super commandos are conducting a special military operation and everything is super,” said Tikhon Dzyadko, editor of TV Rain, one of 10 media outlets to be threatened with a ban. “This is all done to make sure that society doesn’t know there’s a real, bloody war going on, so they’re trying to hide information from them as much as possible.”The campaign builds on a well-oiled machine that has shaped Russians’ perceptions to deliver sound support for previous conflicts in eastern Ukraine and Syria, as well as a brutal crackdown on dissent at home and in neighbouring Belarus.This time, however, the picture being painted by the Kremlin is so at odds with the reports from Ukraine itself that even top officials and spin-doctors have struggled to handle the cognitive dissonance required.Putin has framed the war as an operation to liberate Russian speakers in the separatist-controlled Donbas border region — leading news anchors to largely avoid so much as mentioning the fierce battles going on across the rest of Ukraine.As Ukrainians across the country shelter underground from Russian air strikes, news channels have run footage of peaceful days in Kyiv and repeated the military’s denials that it is launching strikes on populated areas, or even fighting there at all.“The Ukrainian authorities.are in fact waging war with their own population in cities where there are no Russian troops, first and foremost in Kyiv,” said Artyom Sheinin, host of a political talk show on state TV.The efforts not to mention the war, or even call it one, have left Russian media outgunned by a huge wave of posts by Ukrainians on social networks that they have struggled to counter.When Russia captured the city of Melitopol on Saturday, it claimed locals had put up no resistance and the elderly had welcomed them by waving red flags. That account was immediately tested by a video on social media showing a man angrily berating troops to their face.The reality of the conflict even appears to have surprised some of the invading forces themselves. In videos posted by Ukrainians, men said to be Russian soldiers are seen admitting they did not know where they had been sent, with some stuck on the roadside after their vehicles ran out of fuel.“They live in Putin’s cartoons. They really believe that the population will greet them here and that the military will surrender,” said Kostyantyn Batozsky, a Ukrainian political analyst.“It’s in the worst Soviet tradition of denying reality: they denied Chernobyl, and exactly the same thing is happening.”Even some of Putin’s most ardent supporters appear concerned that Russia is struggling to wrest control of the narrative.“There’s not nearly enough official information,” Alexander Gamov, a veteran reporter for a pro-Putin tabloid, complained to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on a Saturday call with reporters.“It’s just lots of half-baked rumours in the information space, and the official narrative is just drowning. Media are forced to fill that vacuum with Telegram channels and so on,” he said.Russia began to change tactics on Saturday, after Ukraine claimed it had withstood a fierce night-time assault on Kyiv and its president Volodymyr Zelensky posted social media videos showing himself and top aides still in the capital — in contrast to Putin’s self-imposed seclusion.State TV abandoned some of its usual weekend programming for special episodes of political talk shows repeating the government line.On Sheynin’s talk show, analyst Kira Sazonova said Russia’s military had “found themselves in a difficult situation precisely because they have the best intentions. to place humanitarianism above military objectives.”Russia’s struggle to keep control of the war’s story, however, may not necessarily have consequences for Putin’s approval ratings. State television is the primary source of news for four out of five Russians, while the country has begun limiting access to Facebook and Twitter since the invasion began.In the run-up to the conflict, when Russia repeatedly denied it would invade and mocked western warnings that later turned out to be accurate, the Kremlin’s messaging seemed to have worked.Sixty per cent of Russians believed the west was the cause of the tensions, 16 per cent blamed Ukraine and only three per cent thought Russia was responsible, according to a poll published on the day of the invasion by the independent Levada Center.Yet the longer the war goes on, the more Russians’ perception of it may change, said Nikolai Petrov, a senior research fellow at Chatham House.“All alternative voices have been suppressed, any possibility of organising protests has been destroyed, but that doesn’t mean that the Kremlin can do whatever it wants for as long as it wants,” Petrov said.“Information about what happens in Ukraine gets passed along from person to person — you can’t shut it off. That’s why they’re counting on it being relatively quick and bloodless in Russians’ eyes,” he added. “But it might turn out totally differently.”
97  The US has for years used the power of the dollar to cut adversaries off from global finance. Now, it is using the prevalence of American technology to cut Russia off from global chip supplies. Far-reaching export controls announced by Washington are intended to isolate Russia from the world’s tech economy and stymie its military capabilities, while allowing ordinary citizens in the country to still buy mobile phones, dishwashers and laptops.The measure is part of a wave of US and western sanctions in retaliation for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that have also targeted financial institutions, leading companies and the wealthy oligarchs that surround the administration of President Vladimir Putin.The tech-related export controls are “novel and complex” in their structure, said Kevin Wolf, a former senior commerce department official, designed to have an impact on government and industrial groups rather than ordinary consumers. “What the administration has done here is set out a structure to cut Russia off from chips and said that this is a policy and a mission,” said Wolf. “And this isn’t going to go away. There is massive allied co-operation on this.”The move shuts off supply from leading US groups such as Intel and Nvidia.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, which controls more than half the global market for made-to-order chips, has also pledged full compliance with the new export controls. The US honed its ability to cut companies off from semiconductors by using its export control powers on Chinese telecoms company Huawei during the Trump administration.After first restricting the sale of US technology to Huawei by putting it on its trade blacklist, Washington ratcheted up pressure by applying the so-called foreign direct product rule. This allowed the US to reach beyond borders and control products made outside the country if they are designed or manufactured using American technology.“Huawei was a trial run,” said Christopher Timura, a trade lawyer at Washington’s Gibson Dunn. “The US didn’t see a dramatic impact on Huawei until it developed the entity list foreign direct product rule.”Using this same power against Russia broadly for some items, and more stringently against a specific list of 49 military entities, means the country is now effectively denied access to high-end semiconductors and other tech imports critical to its military advancement. “Russia is very well prepared but over time this is going to degrade their military capabilities severely,” said Julia Friedlander, a former US Treasury official.The blockade will also affect Russian tech more broadly, said Jim Lewis, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “This puts paid to Russia’s tech ambitions. Russia was already falling behind in emerging tech, and this just pushes them further back.”Putin has tried to wean Russia off dependence on foreign technology after western governments peppered the country with sanctions following its invasion of Crimea in 2014, but the measures had little success. Yandex, Russia’s leading US-listed tech giant, boasts one of the world’s leading supercomputers that powers its automated online translation services and relies on hardware made by US-based Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia. Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesman, said in January that “dishwashers and other such household items are not the most sacred things in our society, as important as they are for home comforts”.Russia has vowed to respond to the sanctions “based on its own interests” and warned that its countermeasures might be “asymmetric”.Despite these far-reaching US restrictions, analysts have predicted that some Chinese companies, especially those that have themselves been the target of US sanctions, might help Russia circumvent the export controls.“Now that it’s almost certain that Huawei’s competitors like Ericsson would pull out of Russia and from co-operation in making 5G equipment, this will create space for Huawei,” said Artyom Lukin, an associate professor at Far Eastern Federal University in Vladivostok. “Huawei could monopolise the Russian telecom equipment market: as a result of western sanctions, China could gain 100 per cent control over our country’s tech supplies,” Lukin added.US restrictions on tech exports to Russia might also lure Chinese semiconductor companies to jump into the gap. SMIC, China’s largest chipmaker, is itself under US sanctions. The company was put on the entity list after the US government determined some of the chips it made ended up with users defined as military-linked. SMIC has since lost access to the equipment it needs to build production lines at the most advanced process technology level. It has, however, been able to continue buying machinery for expanding capacity using slightly older technology.A senior Biden administration official rejected the idea that China would help Russia circumvent US sanctions.“China alone can’t supply all of Russia’s critical needs for the military,” the official said. “And it certainly can’t compensate Russia for everything that we’re essentially restricting through these rules, especially as it relates to the production of semiconductors. China accounts for only 16 per cent of global capacity.”Martin Chorzempa of the Washington-based Peterson Institute think-tank said: “Even China, with its thriving technology ecosystem and immense government subsidies, has failed to produce advanced chips. It’s unimaginable that Russia would be capable of doing so.”Additional reporting by Max Seddon in Moscow
98  The couple had been searching for a large enough space away from the city for some time. In the summer of 2019, they finally found what they had been looking for: an estate on the Côte d’Azur that had been the hideaway of the ballet dancer Sylvie Guillem. Equidistant from the Préalpes d’Azur hiking trails and the sea, the two-storey house is surrounded by 1.2 acres of terraced land, planted with olive and citrus trees and awash in Mediterranean light. Between the towering cypresses are glimpses of the nearby medieval historic centre of Saint-Paul-de-Vence, one of the oldest towns on the French Riviera.“I don’t know why we didn’t do this sooner,” says Levy. He is sitting in the house’s winter garden, at a table of his own making: the tabletop, which he designed for the surfaces company Compac, is a thin, asymmetrical slice of black quartz with a futuristic natural pattern. Once a white-plastered outdoor terrace, the space had been glassed in, and a small fireplace added in one corner. Today it functions as the family’s dining room, filled with light as well as dozens of eclectic objects, from Levy’s design prototypes to pieces picked up on the couple’s travels. The cultish award-winning Mistic vase and candleholder, six glass tubes that twist together, sits next to a menorah he made in his studio from offcuts of wood. His Mercury designs, silvered hand-blown glass bubble-shaped sculptures, are installed on one of the walls, while several baskets hand-woven by Australian indigenous artists are hung opposite.Ouvrier, who made a living as a model while also studying at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, knew upon seeing the house that it was The One: “I made Arik fly the next day from LA,” she says. Guillem’s studio – 150sq m at the heart of the ground floor, with soaring ceilings and skylights – captivated them both. But it was the expansive grounds, which skew more wild than manicured and are home to a mix of fruit trees and fields of wildflowers, sloping down to a stone lap pool, that clinched the deal. “The greatest luxury of this property is that only a small part of it is actually built upon,” says Levy.Another attribute in its favour was the fact that the house required no major renovations. They moved right in, and focused immediately on filling it with their own art, Levy’s design projects and pieces from their collection. The latter range from a David Nash drawing to centuries-old artefacts from New Guinea. The soaring studio, divided by a tall shelving unit, is a sort of greenhouse of experimentation and creativity, located just past the winter garden and the small but much lived-in kitchen.The garden is like a living organ of the houseDown the hall is a living room, with an unusual floor that has two large Japanese tatami mats embedded within it. (“Sylvie would do stretching exercises or dance on them,” explains Levy). The 60sq m space is lined with personal objects: an old surfboard and guitar of Levy’s, early 20th-century warrior body armour from Papua New Guinea, a Baccarat vase, a kinetic sculpture, a basket-like lantern woven from multicoloured electric cords (from a series called Umbilical – Levy made the first one 30 years ago). The aggregate resembles an outsized cabinet of wonders. The only bedroom on the ground floor – a small space that looks over the outdoors sculpture area and view – is Levy and Ouvrier’s. A maze-like lower floor – subterranean on the entrance side of the house, but opening to the garden out back – holds a further six, for their daughters and guests.Although Levy and Ouvrier work in completely different mediums and use contrasting techniques (her work is entirely handmade; his is partly engineered, and typically produced by workshops), their output somehow feels part of the same ecosystem. On one side of the studio, Ouvrier’s large-scale pieces, dynamic images of tree trunks or rhizomes, are both painted on and carved into large rectangular pieces of plywood, like woodcuts; several are combined into triptych screens. One of these, with its gold-leaf background, resembles a detail out of some massive medieval illuminated manuscript. On the space’s other side, Levy’s sculptures and prototypes are a variety of dimensions, many of them fabricated from stainless steel polished to a mirror’s surface and mounted on black stands. Long a prolific industrial designer (he has created lighting for Baccarat and Vibia, and furniture for Vitra and Ligne Roset), Levy has recently been compelled to pursue his art – playing with those fractal and geometric forms found in nature, particularly in minerals and ice. The results look like monumental gemstones, or totems from another planet.Both admit having similar goals in their art making – namely, to confront viewers with abstract ideas of nature and inspire inquiry. “I want people to wonder about what is in front of them,” says Levy, “and to ask, ‘Is it solid or liquid? Is it getting crystallised or evaporating?’ And then reflect on their own state of mind.”In many ways, they acknowledge, it hadn’t been possible to cultivate a wider perspective on their work until they had moved into this studio and started living with their art. “Now I wake up and my sculptures are some of the first objects I see,” says Levy. “They change depending on the time of day, and the quality of the light. Before, when I was working out of my own studio in Paris, sometimes I didn’t even see the final work until it was packed into a crate and sent to an exhibition. Then someone would buy it and I would never see it again. It’s such an important thing to live with the work.”Almost from the beginning, their life embedded in the Mediterranean landscape sparked other ideas and projects. They spent more time together, much of it exploring their acreage. “Because you see it from every window, and because it’s so alive, the garden is like a living organ of the house,” says Levy. “I’ve always lived in cities, so to be here is for me both a revelation and a revolution.”We want to spark dialogue about creativity and the environment and natureThe terraces were already densely planted with olive, citrus and colossal cypress trees, as well as stands of lavender, fig trees and agapanthus. Not only did Levy and Ouvrier embellish further, adding mimosa, avocado and Mirabelle plum trees, but Levy also began to place his sculptures throughout. Today there are more than two dozen of his works scattered across the land. In late spring, the couple will open the sculpture park, as well as part of their house, for visits to small groups. “We love having guests and sharing our space with others,” says Levy as the three of us amble along a path that weaves sharply down through olive groves and small fields of uncut grass and wildflowers. We stop at a monumental meteor-like work called RockGrowth; a much larger version of it, the height of a seven-storey building, is due to be installed in front of a new contemporary satellite space of the State Hermitage Museum in Moscow later this year. “It’s all about setting the stage for a meaningful exchange.”“It’s also about showing our work and sensibility and ideas in the context of our larger vision,” adds Ouvrier. “We want to spark dialogue, about creativity and the environment and nature.”Back up at the house, we sit on the sun-drenched stone terrace, partly covered by a bamboo pergola. From here we have a perfect view of Saint-Paul-de-Vence and its 16th-century ramparts. Once the stomping ground of Matisse, Chagall and other post-impressionists, today the village has, for its modest size, an impressive number of important contemporary art destinations. These range from the famous La Colombe D’Or hotel, with its Calder-adorned pool, to the Maeght Foundation, a remarkable collection of 20th-century artworks – there’s a Giacometti courtyard and a Miró labyrinth – set in and around a striking modernist home designed by the Spanish architect, Josep Lluís Sert.Levy and Ouvrier are keen to be part of this story, whether it’s with their contemporary sculpture park or other future projects, which include a jewellery line inspired by their collection of found natural objects, such as seed pods and pieces of coral. The move into nature has awakened something new: “Our suitcases have always been full of stones or small pieces of driftwood,” says Levy. “But since we moved here, we are energised by the idea of creating work out of that – out of the magic that is all around us.” Arik Levy Sculpture Park, 06570 Saint-Paul-de-Vence, ariklevysculpturepark.com
99  As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has intensified, so have the rhetorical gymnastics of diplomats from the country’s giant neighbour that is also one of its few large remaining international partners: China.Their attempts to balance Beijing’s policy of support for global peace and stability while avoiding any criticism of Moscow are a sign that the war is unlikely to derail China’s quasi-alliance with Russia, diplomats and analysts said.“The Chinese foreign ministry is doubling down on their alignment to Russia, so we are learning in real time what they mean when they say there are ‘no limits’ in their partnership,” said Evan Medeiros, a China expert at Georgetown University and former senior Asia policy adviser to Barack Obama.China’s close ties with Russia theoretically created a “strategic trilemma” for Beijing, potentially clashing with its other foreign policy principles, such as protection of states’ sovereignty, and with other important economic relationships with the US, Europe and elsewhere, he said.“But they are clearly privileging their alignment with Russia and pursuing something I would call pro-Russia neutrality.”Beijing has been here before. Both in 2008, when Russia sent troops into Georgia, and in 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea, Beijing avoided directly backing Russia’s actions but also refused to criticise them.“China and Russia handle their partnership on two levels. On one level is rather non-committal rhetoric about conflicts in each other’s neighbourhoods, and on another is the strong alignment when it comes to great power competition,” said Alexander Korolev, a lecturer at the University of New South Wales who researches the China-Russia relationship.“There is a stronger rhetorical support from China for Russia in its resistance against Nato expansion this time.”When Russian president Vladimir Putin visited Beijing for the Winter Olympics this month — he was one of the few foreign leaders to do so — Chinese president Xi Jinping threw his weight behind Putin’s opposition against Nato expansion. On Friday, China abstained in a vote on a UN draft resolution condemning Russia’s attack on Ukraine.Some western analysts wonder, however, whether this time, by starting a war in Europe, Putin may be putting too great a strain on the partnership.“Russia does have a penchant for destabilising actions, while China has this desire to rise to great power status on its reputation for prudence and stability,” Andrea Kendall-Taylor, senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and a former intelligence officer working on Russia, said at a debate this week.She added this contradiction might introduce fissures in the relationship. “So far it has deepened without any side having to incur any cost for the other. That is going to be put to the test in this case,” she said.Until the eve of the attack, Chinese state media was still calling US warnings of a Russian invasion disinformation. “It was a shock to wake up to [the invasion] because we still thought that he was bluffing,” a Chinese diplomat said, referring to Putin.“There is an element of surprise in the expert community and among the public about the mode and scale of Russia’s action,” said Zhang Xin, a Russia expert at East China Normal University. “It is possible that more concrete information was exchanged between the two leaders.”Zhang said it was “slightly embarrassing” for the government to reiterate principles, such as respect for territorial integrity, while accommodating Russia’s military action and also being at odds with Chinese interests such as the aim for common development and prosperity in Eurasia.But this seemed to be a minor concern for Beijing. “No matter how much bloodshed we see in this conflict, unless it becomes an all-out regional war and great powers get pulled in, I don’t think it will have an impact on China’s bilateral ties with Russia,” Zhang said.One reason is the personal stamp Putin and Xi have put on the relationship.“There is definitely some personal rapport and chemistry between them, to the extent that you could almost speak of a personal alliance,” said Artyom Lukin, an associate professor at Far Eastern Federal University in Vladivostok, who believed Putin informed Xi of his plans.“Putin is not completely mad — he must have understood that he needed support from China on this. Moreover, not informing Xi could have been a personal affront.”Analysts also said Xi had shown a higher acceptance of risk and friction in foreign policy during his nearly nine years in office than his immediate predecessors, reflected in his pursuit of a more confrontational and assertive stance in disputes with neighbours. This made Putin’s actions more palatable to him.Sanctions may be a more serious test. China is expected to offer Russia respite, for example by increasing commodities trade through state-owned policy banks that have less trouble circumventing US sanctions.“Look to North Korea for reference: All trade with them is banned under international sanctions and yet China accounts for 95 per cent of their foreign trade,” Lukin said.This week, China removed restrictions on imports of Russian grain, opening up another source of agricultural export revenues just as Moscow faced new western sanctions.China’s foreign minister Wang Yi warned on Saturday that sanctions would not only hurt the economies of Moscow and the west but would also prevent a political resolution of the conflict.“Sanctions won’t solve [old] problems,” said Wang in a phone call with Annalena Baerbock, his German counterpart. “They will create new ones.”In Washington, policy experts therefore believe that only raising the cost of backing Russia could make China think again.“I don’t think Beijing is terribly uncomfortable with Putin’s play. So if you want to change that calculus, you have to change the pay-off,” said Yun Sun, director of the China programme at the Stimson Centre.“If Russia works with Chinese financiers, in order to block that channel, the US needs to increase the cost for China Eximbank and China Development Bank,” she added.But for now, western governments have their hands full with responding to Russia’s invasion. “The Russia conversation is moving fast,” Medeiros said. “But the ‘what do we do about the Russia-China relationship’ conversation — it has started, but it has not reached terminal velocity.”With additional reporting by Sun Yu in Beijing
100  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
101  Roman Abramovich said he was ceding day-to-day management of Chelsea football club, as Russia’s assault on Ukraine leads to calls for targeted western sanctions on the elite group of oligarchs with links to President Vladimir Putin.The Russian-Israeli businessman announced on Saturday that he would relinquish the running of the English Premier League team to its charitable foundation.Abramovich was not on a list of Russian individuals targeted this week by UK economic sanctions, despite calls from at least one Labour MP that his assets should be seized.Abramovich’s ownership of Chelsea has made him an unlikely household name in English football and beyond, while also serving as a stark and early example of how Russia’s elite sought to snap up trophy assets in the UK.“He’s really doing it to stop the club becoming hostage to anti-Russian sanctions, which are going to be around for a while now,” a friend of the billionaire told the Financial Times.The announcement does not mean that Chelsea is for sale but is intended to blunt concerns that have gripped the club, its coach and players since the war began earlier this week, according to people close to the situation.“During my nearly 20-year ownership of Chelsea FC, I have always viewed my role as a custodian of the Club,” Abramovich said. “I have always taken decisions with the Club’s best interest at heart.”“That is why I am today giving trustees of Chelsea’s charitable foundation the stewardship and care of Chelsea FC,” he added.Bruce Buck, an American who is the club’s chair and who has worked closely with Abramovich for years since his time as a senior lawyer in the London office of US legal firm Skadden Arps, declined to comment.The war in Ukraine has triggered the beginnings of a western sporting boycott of Russia. The Champions League final, the biggest game in European club football, was moved from St Petersburg to Paris this week and this season’s Russian Formula One Grand Prix has been cancelled.The International Olympic Committee has urged sporting bodies to stop holding events in Russia or its close ally Belarus. Other sporting groups have withdrawn or begun to re-evaluate sponsorships from Russian companies.Buyers have been circling Chelsea for years. Abramovich appointed US merchant bank Raine in 2018 to put a value on the team after multiple interested buyers made approaches to acquire it.Earlier that year, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the billionaire founder of chemicals group Ineos, withdrew a bid after being cited a sale price in excess of £2bn, according to people with knowledge of the talks. Private equity group Silver Lake also showed interest that year.Abramovich’s Fordstam entity, through which he owns Chelsea, has accumulated losses of almost £1.1bn through June 2021. Fordstam has close to £1.5bn in debt in the form of loans from Abramovich. In theory, he could call in the debt, which would need to be repaid within 18 months.Abramovich’s wealth transformed Chelsea into one of the most powerful teams in global football, spending hundreds of millions of pounds on superstar players and coaches.Under his ownership, the club has twice won the Champions League, among numerous major titles. He celebrated on the pitch with players after Chelsea won the Fifa Club World Cup tournament in Abu Dhabi this month.His fortune helped Chelsea revolutionise football on and off the pitch, creating a domestic rival to the then-dominant Manchester United and ushering in a new era of big money foreign owners in the Premier League.Abramovich earned his fortune in Russia’s turbulent 1990s by acquiring privatised oil and gas assets from the state, then selling them back to the Kremlin at a large profit. He owns an estate on the so-called Billionaire’s Row in Kensington Palace Gardens and, together with partner Alexander Abramov, controls London-listed steelmaker Evraz.In 2018, Abramovich withdrew his UK visa renewal application after authorities delayed its processing following the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury with a nerve agent. He has remained active in club affairs but preferred to watch most of Chelsea’s matches on TV, according to friends. The oligarch subsequently became an Israeli citizen that year and obtained a Portuguese passport in 2021.After Russia invaded Ukraine, his daughter Sofia, 27, shared a post on Instagram that read: “Putin wants a war with Ukraine,” according to screenshots posted on social media. “The biggest and most successful lie of Kremlin’s propaganda is that most Russians stand with Putin.”On Saturday, Garage, the Moscow contemporary art museum he co-founded with his former partner Dasha Zhukova, said it would “stop work on all exhibitions until the human and political tragedy that is unfolding in Ukraine has ceased”.
102  Russia poured more troops into Ukraine and intensified its bombardment of strategic positions around the country after coming up against strong resistance.Ukrainian forces have succeeded in slowing Russia’s advance into Kyiv but western officials warned of a “long fight” ahead, as Moscow stepped up the biggest military offensive in Europe since 1945.With a Russian onslaught on Kyiv possible within hours, western capitals rushed forward with promises of military aid to Ukraine and began to prepare heavier financial sanctions against Moscow.German chancellor Olaf Scholz said Berlin would send weapons directly to Ukraine — a remarkable shift after weeks of saying doing so would contravene a longstanding German policy.“The Russian invasion marks a turning point. It is our duty to support Ukraine to the best of our ability in defending against Putin’s invading army,” Scholz wrote on Twitter. “That is why we are supplying 1000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger [anti-aircraft] missiles to our friends in Ukraine.”Berlin also dropped its opposition to cutting Moscow off from Swift, saying it was now in favour of “targeted” restrictions on Russian access to the global interbank payments system.Officials in Kyiv said the city remained under government and military control on Saturday, as outgunned troops continued to resist. The mayor’s office ordered a continuous curfew until Monday morning to allow Ukrainian forces to clear Russian “sabotage and reconnaissance groups”.“We held firm.we have withstood and successfully repelled enemy attacks,” said Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.The Kremlin said its forces advanced after claiming to have paused their assault on Ukraine following an order from Vladimir Putin. The Russian president ordered the attack to resume after Kyiv ignored Moscow’s call for negotiations. A Ukrainian official denied Kyiv had rejected talks.Russia has increased the use of artillery and long-range missile strikes on Kyiv and other cities as it struggled to make incisive troop gains on Friday night. “This is going to be a long fight,” said one western official.A missile hit a high-rise apartment block on the outskirts of Kyiv and there were reports of heavy bombardments in other cities. In Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city, a person contacted by the Financial Times reported intense artillery fire throughout Saturday. The Zelensky administration also said there was fighting in Kherson, Mykolaiv and Odesa.Western officials said Russia’s primary objective remained the capture of Kyiv and that its forces did not appear to be trying to seize urban centres, although Moscow said it had taken control of Melitopol in the south.With thousands of people fleeing the capital, Ukraine’s military called on those who were staying to fight. But western military officials warned that the arrival of tens of thousands of troops advancing south from Belarus, north from Crimea and west from Russia would put intense pressure on Kyiv that could lead to the capital falling within days.The Pentagon said Russia had deployed about half of the 150,000 combat troops it had amassed along Ukraine’s borders into its territory, up from a third on Friday. Western defence officials said Russian formations were about 30km north of the capital by late afternoon, with smaller numbers of Russian troops closer to the capital.Kyiv’s troops blew up the railway junctions connecting the Ukrainian railway system with its Russian counterpart on Saturday afternoon, Ukraine’s state-owned railway company said.Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky, claimed that as of Saturday morning, Ukraine had killed more than 3,500 Russians and captured almost 200 more. Oleksiy Arestovych, another adviser to Zelensky, said Russian forces had lost about 14 aircraft including Ilyushin IL-76 transport planes carrying paratroopers, eight helicopters, 102 tanks and 536 armoured personnel carriers.Russian and Ukrainian military claims cannot be independently verified.As western powers discussed hitting Russia with heftier sanctions, the US released an additional $350mn to support Ukraine’s military effort. France, the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium and Estonia were among the Nato countries that made fresh pledges of weaponry to Kyiv.Russian airlines were cut off from an increasing swath of European airspace on Saturday after Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovenia all announced bans on Russian airlines flying over their countries.The Baltic states joined the UK, Bulgaria, Czech Republic and Poland in sealing off their skies. Russia has responded with like-for-like bans, and several airlines including British Airways and Aeroflot have begun to make costly diversions on some routes.Additional reporting by Erika Solomon in Berlin, Demetri Sevastopulo in Washington, Polina Ivanova in Chisinau, and Philip Georgiadis and Adam Samson in London
103  British MPs have demanded that the government makes it easier for UK residents to bring family members fleeing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to join them in Britain.The Home Office is at present issuing visas inside Ukraine only to close family members of British citizens who normally live in the country. A temporary consulate in Lviv, western Ukraine, is the only place issuing these.Other Ukrainians, including family members of the tens of thousands of Ukrainians resident in the UK, must apply through a British consulate in a neighbouring country such as Poland, Hungary, Romania or Moldova.Without a valid visa, Ukrainians will be barred from boarding flights, trains or ferries to the UK.Yvette Cooper, shadow home secretary, said the Home Office should ensure Ukrainians with family in the UK could “swiftly” join them “as a top priority”. The department should post staff to neighbouring countries and reception centres and “remove bureaucracy and delay”, she added.Meg Hillier, Labour MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch, which has a significant Ukrainian population, said the government needed to “step up” and make sure that Ukrainians could request visas without visiting a consulate, adding that it should not be necessary for everything to be done at an in-person meeting.“There are other ways of carrying out checks,” she said.Stuart McDonald, a Scottish National party MP and member of the Commons home affairs select committee, said Ireland had lifted the requirement for Ukrainian citizens to acquire a visa before coming to the country, while Ukrainians require no visa to enter countries in Europe’s Schengen free-movement zone.“It’s up to the British government to explain why it can’t follow the example of EU countries,” McDonald said. “If people have family members [in Ukraine] why make them jump through any hoops at all?”Stella Creasy, Labour MP for Walthamstow, said the current situation felt “like Afghanistan again”, referring to last August when many parliamentarians were overwhelmed with requests for help rescuing relatives when the Taliban swept to power.One of Creasy’s constituents, Fozan Dar, a UK citizen, ended up trapped in Ukraine because the visa for his Ukrainian wife to travel with him to Britain was not issued until commercial flights from Ukraine had stopped. The couple remain in the country and have been offered no help to leave.“It’s no good saying we’re standing with the people of Ukraine if we’re not going to stand with our own people in Ukraine and help them get to safety,” Creasy said.Another Labour MP, Yasmin Qureshi, who represents Bolton South East, which has a longstanding Ukrainian community, has tabled a question for home secretary Priti Patel asking her to consider easing the curbs on travel to the UK for Ukrainians.“A lot of them have family and friends here,” she said of the people seeking to leave Ukraine. “If they’re able to come out, there should be something done to help people to come here.”Patel on Thursday said her department stood “shoulder to shoulder” with Ukraine following the Russian invasion and announced that she was waiving application fees for visas for Ukrainian citizens seeking to join family residents in the UK under family reunification rules.The department announced five special concessions for Ukrainians in the UK, including the right to extend seasonal worker visas — normally restricted to six months — until December this year.The British government said its priority was to support British nationals resident in Ukraine and their dependants who wanted to leave the country.“We are working around the clock to process visa applications and are processing many applications in a matter of hours,” it saidIt said it had sent extra staff to visa processing centres in nearby countries, including Poland, Moldova, Romania and Hungary.“We are working with other European countries to ensure that responses to any migration issues are practical and in the best interests of the Ukrainian people,” the government said.* This story has been amended since original publication to clarify that only dependants of UK citizens resident in Ukraine can apply for visas in the Lviv consulate. Ukrainians can seek visas in neighbouring countries
104  The top floor of an office building in central Kyiv, its windows taped over with sheets of A4 paper, has been transformed into a makeshift military supply depot, as ordinary Ukrainians take up arms to defend their city from Russian invaders.By Saturday, three days into Russia’s assault on Ukraine, armed men in military fatigues — with yellow masking tape encircling their sleeves to mark themselves as Ukrainians — were organising patrols and assistance to the troops defending Kyiv as enemy soldiers closed in. Russian agents are believed to already be in the city centre.Inside the office block that has been abandoned apart from the volunteers, automatic weapons were propped up against the walls, and the floor was littered with boxes that previously contained drones destined for frontline troops.In an adjoining room, young volunteers were busy writing posts for the “Ukraina: operativno” channel on the social media platform Telegram, informing Ukrainians about the progress of the war and how to help their country’s defence. The kitchen was well supplied with bottled water and stocks of last-minute food supplies as most of Kyiv’s grocery stores closed.As Ukraine is left to defend itself after Russian president Vladimir Putin’s order to invade early on Thursday, civilians and the Ukrainian diaspora have stepped in with donations of money, clothes, food, power banks and weaponry.In a country with a long history of partisan warfare, Ukrainians say they expect civilian fighters to engage the Russians in a fierce battle if troops advance toward the city centre.“Kyiv is not a simple place where the Russians can just walk around,” said Serhiy Prytula, a television celebrity turned politician who joined Ukraine’s Maidan democratic uprising in 2014 and this week put on a uniform as a volunteer fighter. “I think they have some mistaken illusions if they imagine this is a country where people are afraid.”The boundary between civilian volunteers and combatants has been blurred, after a weapons distribution scheme announced this week led about 18,000 people to pick up guns in Kyiv alone.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has transformed its people, starting with President Volodymyr Zelensky, who some Ukrainians formerly dismissed as a frivolous figure but has, in the space of less than a week, stepped into a Churchillian role.Since the invasion, his office has regularly published what are essentially proof of life videos filmed in the government complex, featuring morale-boosting messages from the Ukrainian leader, who says Russia wants to assassinate him. “We held firm,” Zelensky said in an address on Saturday morning. “We have withstood and successfully repelled enemy attacks.”Putin’s goal of securing a quick victory has been thwarted in several places, including Kyiv and the second-largest city Kharkiv.With Russian heavy vehicles halted for now on Kyiv’s outskirts, young people have been gathering in bars, restaurants, and other sites around the city to make Molotov cocktails.Ukraine’s military has urged people to make the home-made weapons, and the internal affairs ministry’s official Telegram channel this week published a how-to information graphic. The ministry on Friday urged people to use them in Obolon, the northern suburb where Russian troops’ advance has halted for now.Oleksandr, 28, who ran a clothing company before the war began, has been using petrol and jam jars.“It’s very easy to destroy a tank by throwing just one or two at the back,” he told the Financial Times. “It will go inside the engine because there is a place where it takes in air. Then you can open the place where the crew sits and put a Molotov inside.”Oleksandr learnt how to make the petrol bombs late last year after joining weekend training sessions organised by the Azov Battalion, a rightwing militia group.Some of Ukraine’s civilian fighters are conflict veterans who gained combat experience during Russia’s hybrid invasion of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine in 2014-15.“This is our land, and we don’t have any choice,” said Roman Sinicyn, a former businessman and political activist who volunteered as a fighter in the Donbas in 2014. “I’m going to fight.”His job now, he said, was “to help our guys have more supplies” and engage any invaders he encountered. “For sure, if I see some Russians I’ll kill them,” Sinicyn said.Years of conflict first in eastern Ukraine and now the nationwide war with Russia meant that “nobody is afraid”, said Masi Nayyem, a lawyer and war veteran.Nayyem, 37, was born in Afghanistan and migrated to the Soviet Union as a child. Ukraine, he said, “is my home”.Like others in Kyiv, he is baffled and disappointed by the west’s failure to stop Putin. “I think it’s not a question of whether we win, but when we win,” he said. “But if Russia wins now, it means the whole order built after world war two will be destroyed.”
105  The writer was commanding general of the United States Army Europe, 2014-17Gaining and retaining the initiative is the aim of every commander. To be able to choose the time and place of an attack, or to keep the enemy guessing as to how we might act, gives a huge advantage. Yielding the initiative to the enemy puts us at a disadvantage.It’s time for us, the west, to regain the initiative in the greater Black Sea region and to get the Kremlin worrying about what we are doing, rather than waiting to react to what they are doing. In this respect our relationship with Turkey, a Nato ally, is vital.Over the past few years, most discussions about Ukraine’s security have taken place as if this country located in the heartland of Europe were an island. Controversies over whether or not to supply the Ukrainian armed forces with Javelin missiles or Stinger air defence systems reflect this confusion. But Ukraine’s strategic importance is because of where it sits on the map — on the north coast of the Black Sea, an area which is of strategic interest to us as well as to Russia.Under Catherine the Great, the tsarist empire seized the Crimean peninsula in 1783. The aim was to give Russia a year-round warm water port on the Black Sea. Because of Crimea’s proximity to the Turkish Straits, Russia gained an outlet to the Mediterranean and, beyond, to the world’s oceans.We need a strategy for the greater Black Sea region that includes repairing our unhealthy relationship with our Turkish ally. Turkey gives the west its greatest potential leverage in the current crisis — namely, sovereignty over the Turkish Straits, via the 1936 Montreux Convention.Turkey has the authority to close the Straits to Russian naval vessels for its violations of the Convention, including the use of submarines conducting operations while supposedly en route to maintenance at Russian ports. President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is further justification for Turkey to close the Straits to the Russian navy.Doing so would shock Russian military commanders and force them to consider the wider implications of their assault on Ukraine. However, Turkey would need to feel like an essential western ally in the region, not simply a partner for our convenience.On Saturday, a senior Turkish official denied that Turkey had closed two key waterways to Russian warships, saying that Ankara is still evaluating its response to a plea from Kyiv to do so.But were Turkey to accede to that plea, we would have to undertake a concerted diplomatic effort to build confidence in our Turkish allies that they wouldn’t be left alone when, as one can safely predict, the Kremlin strike back. In short, it is time for Turkey-USA 2.0 — a carefully planned process of rebuilding trust between Washington and Ankara. A good first step would be to immediately cease giving weapons to the YPG, a Syrian Kurdish militia. Turkey considers the YPG to be linked to the PKK, or Kurdistan Workers’ party, an organisation fighting in south-eastern Turkey and northern Iraq that is classified as terrorist by the US and EU.We have other near-term options that could make a difference to Moscow’s calculations. For starters, we need to exert relentless diplomatic and economic pressure on Russia. The Kremlin’s all-out offensive on Ukraine does not have to signal the end of diplomacy. In fact, the Biden administration deserves credit for a comprehensive effort that may yet yield results. However, a second point is that we need to implement severe sanctions that will communicate clearly to Russia that it, not Ukraine, will become an “island” in the world.Finally, we need to arm Ukraine, giving it the capability to strike the illegal Kerch Strait bridge and threaten the Russian naval base at Sevastopol. We should consider a quarantine of Russia’s naval base at Tartus in Syria and challenge Russia in international waters and airspace over the Black Sea. In all these ways we can regain the initiative that we allowed Moscow to seize.
106  The helicopter-led attack by Russian paratroopers on the Hostomel airfield north of Kyiv on day one of the invasion started an operation whose success could have significantly boosted Moscow’s hope of seizing control of Kyiv in a lightning assault.But its difficulties in securing the heavily strategic runway underscored both the level of Ukraine’s fierce resistance and the high-risk nature of Russia’s invasion strategy, that has brought mixed results, said intelligence officials and defence analysts.“What’s clear is that if Moscow had hopes of quick and easy gains, they were terribly optimistic,” said Michael Kofman, senior research scientist at CNA, a US-based think-tank.“Some of the big risks taken by the Russian military.don’t appear driven by sensible operational requirements,” he said. “Moscow’s thinking on this war seems to have been coloured by war optimism.”Those early disappointments were still only likely to delay, rather than change, Russia’s ultimate goal of capturing Kyiv and unseating the administration of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, said western officials.Russian forces were eventually able to fend off Ukrainian counter-attacks and hold Hostomel, in Kyiv’s north-west suburbs, late on Friday but only after significant damage to the airstrip.Moscow had targeted the facility with the intention of using it to fly in large numbers of assault troops aimed at a swift capture of the capital. Those airborne deployments were instead diverted to an airfield 250km away in Belarus, Russia’s ally in the war, and forced to travel south by land.The initial failure to capture and hold Hostomel has played a big role in Russia’s slower-than-hoped advance on Kyiv, said western officials, who added that Russia has also made less progress than Moscow had expected in the east of the country.The Pentagon on Saturday said the Russian military appeared to be “increasingly frustrated” at the slow progress, and that its momentum was being slowed by “fierce resistance”.A senior US defence official said Russia was facing the stiffest resistance on two offensive axes: from Belarus towards Kyiv and the assault on the eastern city of Kharkiv, where he said there was still “heavy fighting”.“The Putin plan was a short, decisive victory. A lot of guys were saying, ‘It’ll take five minutes, or two hours, and Ukraine will collapse’. Well, they’re not. The coming week is going to be really decisive,” said Pavel Felgenhauer, a Russian military expert.The early stages of Russia’s invasion had a heavy focus on airborne troops. The attack began with intense cruise missile strikes on crucial Ukrainian defence assets, including more than a dozen airfields, followed by assaults by special forces and paratroopers on important landing sites that would have facilitated the rapid deployment of more troops.Western officials cautioned that Russian military commanders may now shift from that targeted approach to a broader ground assault, after ratcheting up the number of troops involved in the invasion.The US official on Saturday said that more than half of the close to 150,000 combat troops that Russia had assembled on the borders of Ukraine in preparation for the invasion had been deployed, up sharply from one-third on Friday.“In the Kremlin they’ll now be reflecting on the plan not going as it was thought, and there will be all sorts of challenges around the logistics of supporting sustained combat they were not expecting,” said James Heappey, UK armed forces minister.The setbacks increased the chances that Russia would resort to heavy artillery bombardment, Heappey told the BBC. “What lies ahead for Ukraine are days of utter brutality,” he said.On Saturday afternoon, Ukraine still controlled much of the capital, despite some Russian incursions to the north and west of the city and heavy fighting overnight, including some artillery strikes on residential buildings.“Ukrainians have been defending extremely bravely and with enormous courage,” said a western official, who cautioned that Russia’s significantly larger military capabilities meant that Ukraine’s resistance could not last indefinitely.“We held firm.We have withstood and successfully repelled enemy attacks,” Zelensky said in a televised address. “We broke their plan.”Ukraine said it had destroyed more than 100 Russian tanks and killed 3,500 Russian troops. Military claims of losses on both sides cannot be independently verified.Felgenhauer said one critical victory that the Kremlin hoped for — a warm welcome from Ukrainians who see Russia as their historical brothers — had dramatically failed to materialise.“Maybe they believe their own propaganda that the Ukrainians will meet the Russian liberators with flowers, that the Ukrainian military will lay down their arms and everything will be nicely all wrapped up,” he said.“That’s the main problem.The Ukrainian people see they can fight back,” he added. “This war could become a very serious problem for Russia.”Additional reporting by Roman Olearchyk in Kyiv
107  The writer is a Cabinet Office minister and head of the prime minister’s policy unitNapoleon may have observed that an army marches on its stomach but it was one of his biographers, American journalist Ida Tarbell, who identified the true prerequisite for any military adventure. “The first and most imperative necessity in war is money,” she wrote. “Money means everything else — men, guns, ammunition.”Without the tidal wave of cash that flowed into Russia after the Iron Curtain tumbled, Vladimir Putin would never have been able to cement his grip on power or build the vast war machine that has been unleashed against the people of Ukraine.And it is by cutting off that most vital of supply lines that the free world will seek to both repel the invasion and demonstrate the high price of waging war against a sovereign state in the 21st century.As his tanks crossed the border, Putin’s reckless actions sent the rouble plunging to previously uncharted lows, vaporised half the value of Gazprom and wiped a record $250bn off the Russian stock market in just one morning.And that was before prime minister Boris Johnson unveiled the largest and most severe package of economic sanctions this country has ever imposed. Banks’ assets frozen, companies set to be barred from clearing services, arms manufacturers locked out of global markets and many of Putin’s oligarchs hit where they feel it most: their bulging wallets.Allies around the world have imposed similar measures, making Putin’s Russia not just a political pariah but an economic one.As one of the biggest financial centres, the UK is well-placed to take a leading role in sanctioning Russia. On Wednesday, Johnson and John Glen, the economic secretary to the Treasury, sat down with some of the leading city firms, regulators and institutions to discuss how we can work together to make our sanctions bite quickly.No reputable firm or diligent investor wants to do business, even at the furthest remove, with a regime with blood on its hands. So, in addition to the unprecedented action taken in concert with our global allies, I encourage every relevant UK business and financial institution to go further, faster wherever they can. From lawyers, bankers and accountants to real estate agents and insurance brokers — we all share the responsibility to act.None of this will be painless for British businesses and consumers. The interconnected nature of the globalised economy that allows us to target Russia so effectively means that the impact of some sanctions will, inevitably, be felt here too.We can also expect retaliation from Moscow — whether in tit-for-tat sanctions or through hostile acts such as cyber attacks — as Putin lashes out in an attempt to weaken our resolve.This government will do everything possible to shelter our country, our people and our industries from the impact of such actions, but sometimes, even in business, there is no hiding place or middle ground: you have to pick a side.Doing the right thing comes at a price — and if our commitment to freedom and democracy are to mean anything, then it is one we must be willing to pay.The world simply cannot afford for Putin to succeed in Ukraine. If this aggression goes unanswered, he will not be the only despot who is emboldened. Ukraine will not be the only territory threatened and violated. The world will become a less stable, less predictable and less safe place for communities and businesses alike.But if we are unwavering in our response, we can starve Putin of the resources he craves. We can undermine the circle of oligarchs who have propped up his regime for so many years. And we can send a message to the world that acts of aggression will end in military, political and financial failure.
108  S&P Global has cut Russia’s credit rating to “junk” status in the latest sign that western sanctions are already dealing a severe blow to the country’s financial markets.The move came as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered a string of downgrades from the big agencies, with Fitch Ratings lowering Ukraine’s credit rating and Moody’s Investors Service warning that both countries could face cuts.S&P said late on Friday New York time that it would reduce Russia’s rating from triple-B minus to double-B positive. S&P’s decision strips Russia of its investment grade standing at one of the main three rating agencies, pushing Moscow into a league of riskier countries that typically pay higher borrowing costs.“The downgrade follows the abrupt escalation of Russia’s military intervention into Ukraine, which has prompted a series of stringent economic and financial sanctions from the US, EU, and UK governments, among others,” S&P said.“In our view, the sanctions announced to date could carry significant negative implications for the Russian banking sector’s ability to act as a financial intermediary for international trade.”S&P said it could reduce Russia’s rating further over the next three months once its analysts have “more clarity on the full macroeconomic repercussions of the existing sanctions and the evolution of the geopolitical conflict”. The agency also lowered Ukraine’s rating to B minus from B.Moody’s also late on Friday said it had placed Russia’s credit rating on review for a downgrade, prompted by a “significant further elevation of the geopolitical risks”. Russia still holds an investment grade status both with Moody’s and Fitch.Russia’s financial markets were roiled this week after Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The country’s stock market shed a third of its value in US dollar terms, marking the worst week on record, according to Refintiv data.In another sign of the severe financial consequences of Russia’s attack on Ukraine, the cost to protect against the risks of holding Russian debt has soared. The spread on five-year credit default swaps rose above 900 basis points on Thursday, a historic high, before ending the week at around 500bp. It had started this year around 120bp.With its low debt levels and vast oil revenues, Russia is considered very unlikely to default on its debt. But investors are concerned about a situation where sanctions render it impossible for them to receive interest or principal repayments from Moscow.Investors are already finding it difficult to trade in Russian assets as banks, fund managers and trading infrastructure operators begin to remove Russia from global markets because of sanctions on Russian banks such as VTB. Swiss wealth management giants Credit Suisse and UBS have also slashed the amount they are willing to lend to private bank clients using Russian assets as collateral.Ukraine’s government debt has also tumbled, as the invasion fans fears that Kyiv will default on its debt. Ukrainian dollar bonds ended the week with prices below 50 cents on the dollar, a level that indicates investors are pricing in a high probability of not being repaid in full.Fitch lowered Ukraine’s rating from B to triple-C on Friday, close to the bottom of its rating scale, saying the invasion has “resulted in heightened risks to Ukraine’s external and public finances, macro-financial stability and political stability.” “There is a high likelihood of an extended period of political instability, with regime change a likely objective of president Putin, creating heightened policy uncertainty and potentially also undermining the willingness of Ukraine to repay debt,” Fitch added.
109  Wheat and other grain prices have soared since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But those prices are not an adequate picture of the problems with losing Ukrainian grain exports.The disruption of grain exports from Ukraine and Russia through the Black Sea will probably lead to physical shortages of food in the world, particularly for countries dependent on those supplies.If the war is prolonged, it will impact millions of people living in places such as Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Pakistan and Indonesia. That could have political consequences. Local and imported grain shortages have been cited as one of the causes of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings, as well as the Syrian civil war.It is all a reminder of the historic importance of Ukraine’s grain production. Evidence from the Nuremberg war crimes trials show the prospect of grain and grain lands were a big part of German motives for attacking Ukraine in 1941.And Lenin is credited with saying: “Wheat is the currency of currencies”. Even in the middle of the cold war, in 1974, the Soviet Union had to arrange and pay for huge wheat imports from the US.The post-Soviet governments in Russia and Ukraine did away with the micromanagement and confiscations that led to the Communist era shortages. Now Russia and Ukraine are, or were, among the largest wheat exporters in the world.According S&P Global Platts, Russia and Ukraine together were projected to export 60mn tonnes of wheat in the crop year of 2021-2022. All Ukrainian wheat exports, and most Russian exports, pass through terminals along the north shore of the Black Sea.It is not certain when Black Sea ports can reopen. Ships are not available for chartering, and even if the owners were willing, insurance would be unavailable.Americans, as expressed in campaign commercials, think their country is the breadbasket of the world. That was true, in part, for a while. But in the 2021-2022 crop year, the US is forecast to export 22mn tonnes, less than half the Russia/Ukraine total, according to S&P Global Platts. Canada should export about 15.2mm tonnes and the EU 37.5mn tonnes.Worse, given the effects of the war, the wheat carry-over — what’s left from past crops — is expected to be the lowest in at least five years, and by some accounts the lowest since 2008.According to the US Department of Agriculture’s November World Agricultural Supply and Demand estimate, the carry-over is estimated to be 16.19mn tonnes by June 2022. That is not enough to offset the Black Sea shortfalls, even it were all available.Russia has rail links east to China and smaller ports in the Baltic and Arctic. These are not as economic as shipping through the Black Sea, but the alternative routes could make a difference, especially to ensure its ally China does not go short of grain.In the next weeks and months, North African and Asian countries that depend on Ukrainian grain will be hoping the international community settles the Russian war quickly and that transport infrastructure and grain terminals are not sabotaged.Droughts in countries such as Iran, Syria, Iraq, Turkey, and Egypt have added to shortfalls in global wheat production.Some would suggest that other grain producing areas could simply plant more to offset the loss of Black Sea exports, but that would take time and be dependent on readily available fertilisers.And, since Russia has prohibited the export of nitrogen fertiliser until April and China the export of phosphate fertiliser until at least June 2022, more grain output from other producing areas is even more problematic now.If European authorities consider restricting heavy industrial users of natural gas, as they already did last autumn, they should probably set aside some gas for nitrogen containing fertiliser production. Otherwise European grain production will decline.
110  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has thrown policymakers, companies and markets into an inherently uncertain and unsettling world.The temptation for investors is to try to figure out what will happen next on the ground and react accordingly — understandable but very difficult to get right given the multi-faceted forces that have been unleashed by the turmoil, and those that are yet to come.The invasion not only has geopolitical, military and diplomatic repercussions but also economic, financial, social and institutional. They are felt across global, regional, national and individual levels. They are certain to interact with each other in variable ways that are hard to predict.Rather than base portfolios on shaky specifications of inherently uncertain outcomes, a better approach could well be to formulate more flexible responses based on the following six factors.First, even up to the eve of the invasion, many viewed what is happening today as highly unlikely. Few had a playbook prepared, and even fewer were sufficiently “self-insured” against the direct effects and negative spillovers.Second, we are early in the process — such large-scale military events are hard to reverse quickly. Even if this were possible, there is still a series of additional sanctions and counter-sanctions in the pipeline. And it would be naive to dismiss the possibility of other authoritarian regimes trying to exploit a situation in which the west is scrambling to respond.Third, just like their military counterparts, economic policymakers in the west lack the traditional flexibility to respond to the crisis, including the typical first movers in the central banking community. It is extremely rare for the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to start confronting a major new crisis with interest rates floored at or below zero and with central bank balance sheets already so bloated. In such a situation, “break the glass” emergency measures risk a much higher probability of collateral damage, unintended consequences, and more limited effectiveness.Fourth, while the hardest hit are those countries and companies with direct links to Russia and Ukraine, the economic effects are much broader.Stagflationary economic forces have already been released. The vast majority of countries and companies around the world are likely to experience some fall in demand and higher input costs.Fifth, this comes at a time when inflation is already a problem, risking a further de-anchoring of inflationary expectations, especially with the world’s most powerful and influential central bank, the Federal Reserve, already behind the curve in dealing with rising prices. Having repeatedly failed to exploit orderly policy windows, it no longer has “first best” responses available.Finally, flows and liquidity are added complexities for investors. Much of what happens in financial markets over the next few days is a function of the flows of funds, the depth of liquidity and the strength of the conditioning of investors to “buy the dip”.This increases the scope for intraday volatility and contagion whereby even the most solid companies are temporarily trading with unusually high correlation to the market as a whole. The most interesting tug of war will play out between, on the one hand, “pain trades” that force the sale of securities regardless of market conditions and, on the other, those buyers seeking to exploit what they regard as a rapidly reversible drawdown in market pricing.As initial conditions inevitably differ from country to country, from company to company, and from investor to investor, the specific implications of these six factors will differ in individual cases. For example, they will entail “do nothing” for some while others will need to scramble to realign suddenly unbalanced portfolios.What will be common, however, is the importance of financial resilience that allows investors to retain as much optionality as possible for the time being. Rather than reflecting indecisiveness, it is an important recognition of an extremely uncertain situation that is some distance from resolution. Eventually, the time will come for such optionality to give way to the need to focus on the attractive new possibilities to reposition portfolios as developments on the ground become a lot less unpredictable.
111  As images of Russian troops storming into Ukraine flashed on screens around the world, several senior Chinese foreign policy experts sent a flurry of text messages to friends and colleagues in the US: “Is this fake news?”In a briefing with reporters in Beijing hours later, Hua Chunying, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, repeated Russian defence ministry statements that Ukrainian cities would not be targeted and questioned whether the Russian invasion should be called “an invasion”.China’s refusal to acknowledge the all-out military assault that has included attacks on multiple cities, including the capital Kyiv, much less join in international condemnation of it, reflects the strength of Chinese president Xi Jinping’s relationship with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, experts said.After weeks of blaming the US for “hyping” the threat of war, China’s response also signals the fraught path the west will have to navigate as it seeks to punish Putin — a task that could be made much more difficult if Beijing maintains strong political and economic support for Moscow.Yun Sun, a China foreign policy expert at the Stimson Center, a US think-tank, said Beijing “has decided to side with Russia” and shifting its stance would be a question of degree, not direction.“We all know this [invasion is] blatant trampling over sovereignty and territorial integrity,” she said. “China is shaping the narrative that.Russia is the aggrieved party, Russia has been pushed and pushed by Nato, is a victim of the international system after the cold war and a victim of the United States.”She added: “Another message that has become increasingly salient and vocal is that ‘Ukraine deserved it’ — that came as a really big shock to me.”Xi and Putin spoke on Friday afternoon. China’s leader urged “negotiations” over Ukraine but did not refer to the invasion directly, according to statements released by both governments.He reiterated that Beijing respected all countries’ sovereignty and territorial integrity, without elaborating on whether Russia’s assault violated these principles.Hours later in New York, China abstained from voting on a UN Security Council resolution condemning the Russian invasion.Zhang Jun, China’s envoy to the UN, also repeated Beijing’s thinly veiled criticism of the US. “Against the backdrop of five successive rounds of Nato’s eastward expansion, Russia’s legitimate security aspirations should be given attention to and properly addressed,” he said.The speed at which Beijing has leaned towards Moscow has been “striking”, said Adam Ni, a former adviser to the Australian government now affiliated with the Australian National University.“China’s responses to the 2008 Russo-Georgian war and Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea were both cautious and ambivalent,” he added.Beijing now faced a “fundamental dilemma” in seeking to cement its ties with Moscow while keeping relations with the US and the EU on a stable footing, Ni said.“If the US and EU member states come to view Beijing as complicit in Russian aggression against Ukraine, then China may well pay a hefty price,” he said.One Asian diplomat said the Chinese government’s domestic messaging was consistent with the signals it sent with Xi’s face-to-face meetings with Putin on the eve of the Winter Olympics in Beijing this month, when he backed Russia’s opposition to Nato expansion.“China’s intention was to showcase to the world that Xi and Putin are on the same side against a coalition of western countries,” the diplomat said.Beijing’s propagandists and censors have swung into action, seeking to limit reports about the escalating military conflict as well as snuffing out criticism of Russia over the events.China Central Television, a state-owned broadcaster, has consistently relegated brief reports about the Ukraine crisis to the final minutes of its main evening broadcast.Some social media posts sympathetic to Ukraine’s plight have been removed from China’s internet.This week Horizon News, a Chinese outlet, issued instructions not to “post anything unfavourable to Russia or pro-western”, and only use hashtags “started by People’s Daily, Xinhua, or CCTV”, the big state news organisations.“Shielding Russia from negative coverage, injunctions against pro-western messaging, and especially orders to follow the lead of central state media are all common elements of official media directives,” noted China Digital Times, a group that tracks censorship directives and online discussion at the University of California, Berkeley.Yet it is also clear that many Chinese people are trying to follow events closely. On Weibo, China’s biggest social media platform, pages dedicated to developments in Ukraine have received billions of views, according to What’s On Weibo, a site that monitors trends on the platform.Additional reporting by Maiqi Ding in Beijing and Eleanor Olcott in LondonLetter in response to this article:Beijing’s ambivalence on the crisis speaks volumes / From Jing-Yuan Deng, Washington, DC, US
112  The US has joined the EU and UK in freezing the assets of Russian president Vladimir Putin and his foreign minister, under a fresh sanctions package intended to stiffen the west’s response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.President Joe Biden announced the sanctions on Putin and his team on Friday. In addition to Russia’s president and Sergei Lavrov, the country’s foreign minister, Washington also targeted General Valery Gerasimov, head of the country’s military, and Sergei Shoigu, the defence minister.“It is exceedingly rare for Treasury to designate a head of state. President Putin joins a very small group that includes despots such as Kim Jong Un, Alexander Lukashenko, and Bashar al-Assad,” the Treasury said, referring to the leaders of North Korea, Belarus and Syria.The US took the decision after Biden had a call with Ursula von der Leyen, European commission president, the White House said.Christian Lindner, Germany’s finance minister, also on Friday suggested that Berlin was open to the possibility of cutting Russia off from the Swift international payments system, a move that the German government had previously suggested it would not support.The sanctions on Putin and Lavrov follow similar measures the west has levelled against Russian banks and oligarchs in recent days in the hope of persuading Putin to change course in Ukraine — or at least make him pay an economic price for the invasion.Foreign ministers approved the EU sanctions package at a meeting on Friday, along with measures against Russian banks and industry.The UK will impose its own sanctions “imminently” against Putin and Lavrov, as Boris Johnson, prime minister, urged the west to take “immediate action” to oust Russia from the Swift international payments system to “inflict maximum pain on President Putin and his regime”.Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, was dismissive of such measures, saying: “Neither Putin, nor Lavrov have accounts in Britain or anywhere else.”Under the EU measures, Putin and Lavrov would not be subject to a ban on travelling, underlining the bloc’s willingness to keep symbolic diplomatic avenues open.The other proposals would freeze some transactions with a wide range of Russian banks, bar a number of state-owned companies from launching listings on stock exchanges in the bloc and stop Russian nationals from making big deposits in EU banks.The west has been facing calls to step up its pressure on Putin as he intensifies his assault on Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, on Friday criticised Europe for not imposing tough sanctions on Moscow, calling on Putin to negotiate in order to “stop the death”.Directly sanctioning foreign leaders is rare for the EU. Among those targeted before are Assad and Lukashenko.Speaking in Brussels on Thursday, Annalena Baerbock, German foreign minister, said: “We will hit the Putin system where it needs to be hit, not only economically and financially, but at its core of power. And that’s why we have to list not only oligarchs, but also the many members of parliament who have prepared these steps, and we are also now listing the president of the republic, Mr Putin and the foreign minister Sergei Lavrov.”Von der Leyen said she expected the measures to have “maximum impact on the Russian economy and on the political elite”.Paolo Gentiloni, the EU’s economics commissioner, said the second package was “very important and very effective” but would not be the last imposed by Europe.The EU has also been discussing whether to sever the access of Russian banks to the Swift network. Bruno Le Maire, French finance minister, said on Friday the EU wanted to cut Russia off from the world’s financial system and that depriving the country of access to Swift was still an option.Member states, including Germany and Italy, have been concerned that blocking Russia’s use of Swift would damage their own economies or financial systems. The move could, for instance, make transactions with Russian companies difficult for countries that buy its oil and gas.Baerbock said the experience of cutting Iran out of the Swift system showed how broad the impact could be.“It would also mean that people in Russia, for example, a granddaughter who lives in Europe would not be able to transfer money to her grandmother. That may sound small.but those who are responsible for this bloodshed will have ways and means, of course, to carry out their financial payments anyway,” the German foreign minister said.Later on Friday, Lindner said Germany was willing to consider the move but needed to calculate the potential impact on its economy.“We are open, but you have to know what you’re doing,” he said in Paris, according to Reuters.One senior European banker said cutting Moscow off from Swift could backfire on western countries given Russia has a fledgling payments system and could seek to increase its financial connections with China.Reporting by Eleni Varvitsioti and Henry Foy in Brussels, Victor Mallet in Paris, George Parker in London, Erika Solomon in Berlin and Javier Espinoza in Brussels.

113  Russia’s assault on Ukraine has led shares in major cyber security groups to rise, as investors bet that demand for their products will grow amid fear battlefield cyber attacks will spill over to computers around the world.The discovery in Ukraine this week of a “wiper” malware, which permanently deletes data on infected computers, accelerated a rush by companies to bolster their defences, lest it spread into other countries.CrowdStrike, which uncovered Russian hackers inside the servers of the US Democratic National Committee in 2016, rose about 10 per cent on Thursday, as did prominent threat intelligence company Mandiant. Both California-based Palo Alto Networks and Cloudflare jumped 12 per cent.Critical infrastructure groups, such as financial institutions, pipelines, aviation and electricity companies, were also urged to prepare for the possibility of debilitating attacks from Russia or Russia-affiliated actors, such as criminal ransomware groups, in the event of an escalation of cyber warfare.“This is not business as usual. There’s a war happening in Europe and war has evolved — the technologies we rely on can give opportunities for bad actors,” said Chris Krebs, former director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and head of cyber consultancy Krebs Stamos Group.“Given the heightened tensions, the fact that Russians have significant capabilities and given they have targeted us in the past for intelligence collection and other sorts of disruptive attacks. we need to take the time we have in front of us to be prepared,” he said.Intelligence agencies have warned for months that Russia’s assault on Ukraine would be accompanied by cyber attacks, including repeats of assaults on infrastructure, like the blackouts in 2015 in Kyiv that were blamed on Russian intelligence.Last week, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency warned of “consequences for our own nation’s critical infrastructure”, urging US companies to fortify their defences with the tagline “shields up”.President Joe Biden on Thursday hinted at the possibility of a tit-for-tat response: “If Russia pursues cyber attacks against our companies, our critical infrastructure, we are prepared to respond.”Reuven Aronashvili, who helped create the Israeli army’s “Red Team” unit, and now runs a cyber security company called CYE, said corporations were flooding his company with requests for help. “We are seeing a very significant increase — just in the last 48 hours, we’ve seen almost a 10-fold increase in demand.”He added that Russian organisations were also preparing for the possibility of being caught up in retaliation attacks from the west, something he had not witnessed before.Theresa Payton, a former White House chief information officer who is now chief executive of cyber security consultancy Fortalice Solutions, said the FBI “has been putting out bulletins all week about different concerns they have” through its InfraGard system, a partnership with the private sector designed to foster “the protection of US critical infrastructure”.“We have had some organisations ask us to help them accelerate rollouts of changes they were getting ready to make,” she added. “This week, it has been fast and furious.”In particular, there are fears that the wiper malware discovered last week, which has been lurking in some Ukrainian computer systems since December, could spread.A similar 2017 malware, nicknamed “NotPetya” and attributed by US intelligence to Russia, caused $10bn of damage to computer systems worldwide after “jumping the rails” of the Ukrainian targets it was designed to disable and hit major companies such as Maersk.This time round, the malware does not appear to initially spread as fast, but destroys data so efficiently that it makes infected systems inoperable, experts said. It is similar to a wiper malware discovered in January by Microsoft that had already spread to computers in Latvia and Lithuania, both Nato countries. Neither pieces of malware have been directly attributed to Russia.Some Ukrainian government websites have been brought down by “denial of service” attacks, where hackers use bots around the world to bring down websites by flooding them with requests for information. The US has blamed one of these attacks directly on Russia.While these do not represent a threat to other companies, experts warn that significantly more sophisticated attacks could soon be in play.“What we have seen by and large in the Russian attacks in Ukraine have been low-level harassment-type attacks,” said Greg Austin, who leads the Cyber, Space and Future Conflict Programme at International Institute for Strategic Studies. “In a sense we see that what the Russians were doing was experimental.they haven’t unleashed the full destructive potential they are planning to.”Suzanne Spaulding, security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former senior official at the US Department of Homeland Security, warned that Russia might also deploy painful ransomware attacks if cyber warfare escalates, and misinformation campaigns designed to destabilise markets.These may not come directly from the Russian state but from state-affiliated criminal groups or other “surrogates”, according to Mike Rogers, former director of the National Security Agency, who added that this allows Russia more plausible deniability for attacks.On Friday, the notorious Conti criminal ransomware group, which was responsible for a big attack last year on the Irish healthcare system, announced that it was lending the Russian government its “full support” and would use its resources to “strike back at the critical infrastructures of an enemy”.Shlomo Kramer, a co-founder of Checkpoint and chief executive of cloud security group Cato Networks, said the last-minute rush by companies to prepare themselves was the result of a lack of awareness, rather than capabilities.“The cyber market is just beginning and a little cyber war will cause the market to be much, much bigger,” he said. “There needs to be enough pain before the market can jump to the next level. I don’t know if this is the conflict that will create this, but sooner or later one will.”Additional reporting by Joshua Franklin in New York
114  Ukraine’s president urged citizens to hold fast as Russian forces pushed into the suburbs of Kyiv but faced stiff resistance that has so far prevented them from seizing any of the country’s biggest cities.Vladimir Putin, Russian president, had earlier called on the Ukrainian army to mutiny and spare the nation bloodshed as he expanded his assault, moving one-third of Russia’s assembled combat forces into the country, according to US estimates.Nato member states, meanwhile, pledged to continue supplying military weapons to Ukraine, including air defence systems. “We are in this for the long haul,” said Jens Stoltenberg, Nato secretary-general, after the alliance held a crisis meeting.The US, EU and UK also moved to impose sanctions directly on Putin and Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, a rare instance of levelling such measures against a foreign leader.With Ukraine’s citizens huddled in bomb shelters, fleeing, or arming themselves with makeshift weapons, President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared on television just before midnight local time on Friday and rallied them to fight.“Tonight the enemy will use all the forces at their disposal to break our resistance,” Zelensky said, hours after warning that Russian saboteurs had entered the capital and were seeking to kill him. “We have to persevere tonight. The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.”There were loud explosions in Kyiv on Friday and reports of Russian armoured vehicles advancing into the city’s northern district of Obolon, bringing street fighting to the capital, which has a population of 3mn.But western officials said tough Ukrainian opposition had slowed Russia’s attempt to encircle Kyiv and capture Kharkiv in the north-east, the country’s second-biggest city.Battlefield setbacks highlighted the challenge still ahead for Putin after he pit Europe’s biggest invasion force in half a century against an outgunned but determined Ukrainian military, seemingly ready to hold its ground in urban warfare.“In general, the Russians have lost a little bit of their momentum,” said a Pentagon official. “A good indication is that no population centres have been taken.”As Russian armoured columns moved to encircle Kyiv, Putin urged Ukraine’s armed forces to “take power into their own hands” and overthrow their government so they could strike a peace deal with Russia.In a social media post on Friday evening, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s president said discussions had begun with the Russians about a possible “negotiation process”. But it was not clear if the suggestion of talks was realistic, given Russia’s extreme demands.Air raid sirens sounded in the capital and authorities warned people to seek cover in shelters or subway stations amid the Russian bombardment. The Pentagon said Russia had so far launched 200 ballistic and cruise missiles during the invasion. The civilian exodus from Kyiv continued. Traffic was heavy on roads leading out of the capital, with some residents fleeing on foot from the centre with suitcases, hoping to hail rides from passing cars.Ukraine’s military called on residents of Obolon to inform them about the movement of Russian equipment into the city. “Make Molotov cocktails, neutralise the occupier,” the defence ministry said.Russia on Friday claimed it had captured Kyiv’s Hostomel airport, which is near the Obolon district, after it changed hands multiple times on Thursday in fighting involving special forces troops, assault helicopters and precision-guided missiles.Control of the runway could allow Russia to rapidly transport large numbers of troops directly to the capital.Russia ordered thousands more of the combat forces that it had amassed into Ukraine, including through amphibious assaults near Mariupol in the Sea of Azov, according to US officials.Ukrainian forces overnight destroyed bridges north of the city in an attempt to impede the Russian advance. Western military officials warned that the arrival of tens of thousands of troops advancing south from Belarus and north from Crimea would bring “overwhelming” military superiority that could lead to the capital falling within days.“They are putting up a fight and they are not doing horribly, but they are still overwhelmed,” said one senior western intelligence official. “I have no doubt they will continue to fight for as long as they possibly can.”Early on Friday, Ukraine’s defence ministry claimed its forces had taken down more than a dozen Russian aircraft and helicopters, along with scores of tanks and armoured vehicles. Zelensky said 137 of his countrymen had died. Russia provided no figures on damage to its military assets or on casualties.Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said intelligence estimates suggested Russia lost more than 450 personnel on the first day of operations, where it did not take “any of its major objectives”.While social media videos have shown both sides suffering battlefield losses since Thursday, precise Russian, Ukrainian and Nato military claims cannot be independently verified.Shocked world leaders have condemned what they cast as the most momentous challenge to the postwar order in Europe for 80 years. “[Putin] has much larger ambitions than Ukraine,” said Joe Biden, US president, on Thursday. “He wants to, in fact, re-establish the former Soviet Union. That’s what this is about.”Zelensky thanked western leaders for their support but questioned their willingness to go further. “Who is ready to fight with us? Honestly, I don’t see anyone.I’m asking them, are you with us?”Nato held an emergency summit of its members’ 30 leaders on Friday to discuss the invasion.On Friday, oil prices steadied after topping $100 per barrel on Thursday for the first time since 2014. Oil had risen as high as $106 before dropping back after the Biden administration announced a number of sanctions that focused on Russia’s financial sector rather than its energy industry.European natural gas prices retreated after surging almost 70 per cent to €142 per megawatt hour on Thursday. Futures linked to TTF, Europe’s wholesale gas price, fell more than 30 per cent on Friday to €92.50.European equities recovered their losses from the prior session. US stock markets also rose, with the benchmark S&P 500 ending the day more than 2 per cent higher.Additional reporting by Polina Ivanova in Kyiv, John Paul Rathbone in London and Leo Lewis in Tokyo
115  The incident taught Russia’s president a lesson he carried for decades. “Everyone should keep this in mind. You should never drive anyone into a corner,” he said.On Thursday, Putin ordered his army to attack Ukraine from the north, south and east in what could be the largest military operation in Europe since the end of the second world war. Despite months of western warnings about his plans for a brazen assault, Putin framed the invasion as a defensive operation — even going so far as to cite the relevant UN charter article — and claimed that Russia had “been left no chance to act otherwise”.His war in Ukraine marks the culmination of a slide into a paranoid autocracy that earns comparison with Russia’s most brutal rulers. Already a distant figure before the pandemic, the lengths the former KGB officer takes to avoid coronavirus have limited his human contact. Western visitors are forced to sit around a comically huge table. Allies toast champagne from opposite ends of a massive carpet. Even Putin’s closest advisers are rarely allowed to come within 10 feet without weeks of quarantine and testing.People who have known him for decades say this has deepened a pent-up resentment of the west and a fixation on Russia’s shared history with Ukraine — making him more aggressive and unpredictable than ever.“He’s even more isolated than Stalin,” says Gleb Pavlovsky, a former adviser. “In the last years of his life, Stalin didn’t come to the Kremlin and lived in his dacha, but the politburo came to see him and they talked and drank. Putin doesn’t have that. He’s as isolated as he can be. And in that situation rational issues become irrational.”A romanticised ideal of serving his country drew Putin, now 69, to join KGB counter-intelligence in the late 1970s. Before long, however, he was confronted with the Soviet Union’s long, dreary slide into collapse. Deployed to Dresden in East Germany, he watched helplessly as communist regimes in eastern Europe fell while nationalist movements at home pushed Mikhail Gorbachev to open up the country. One night shortly after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, Putin emerged from KGB headquarters to face an angry mob, then asked a nearby Soviet unit for support. The answer haunted him for years. “‘We can do nothing without an order from Moscow. And Moscow is silent’,” he recalled. “I had the feeling the country was no more. It was clear the Union was sick with a deathly, incurable disease called the paralysis of power.”Back in Russia, Putin left the KGB and quickly rose up the ranks as a trusted aide to Russia’s two most important democratic leaders — St Petersburg mayor Anatoly Sobchak and Boris Yeltsin, its first president. Once Yeltsin unexpectedly named Putin his successor on New Year’s Eve in 1999, Putin strove to restore the power Russia had lost. At home, he launched a brutal campaign to subdue separatists in Chechnya, brought the media to heel and defanged the country’s oligarchs. But abroad, he initially sought to ally with the US, asking Bill Clinton if Russia could ever join Nato and offering his support for George W Bush’s war on terror after the 9/11 attacks. “He basically wanted to be like a vice-chairman of the board,” says Samuel Charap, a political scientist at the Rand Corporation. “You don’t have to. change your fisheries code to match what Brussels tell you — you get a seat at the big boys’ table.”Putin’s entreaties fell on deaf ears, leaving him embittered at what he saw as the west’s refusal to take him seriously, according to a former senior Russian official. “It’s their fault. They should have supported us and integrated us into the world, but they worked against us.”Key turning points came in 2003 and 2004. Putin jailed Mikhail Khodorkovsky, then Russia’s richest man, while growing increasingly resentful of the US for the Iraq war, Nato’s expansion into eastern Europe and its support for “colour revolutions” in former Soviet states. The Orange Revolution in Ukraine, where protests overturned a Moscow-backed candidate’s fraudulent election victory, was a particularly sore point.“The fear of losing the post-Soviet space to Nato expansion became tied up with the fear of losing his own power,” says Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center.Gradually, a revanchist side began to emerge. Former aides to Mikheil Saakashvili, the leader of the “colour revolution” in Georgia, suspected something was wrong when Putin complained about Tbilisi’s “museum of Russian occupation” at a meeting in 2007 and reminded him of fellow Georgians such as Stalin and Beria who had sat at the heights of Soviet power. Saakashvili joked: “Why don’t you open a museum of Georgian occupation in the Kremlin?” His aides gasped in horror at Putin’s stony reaction. Putin’s resentment of the US and Nato came to the fore when Ukraine and Georgia applied to join the alliance in 2008. He warned Bush that Ukraine was “not even a real state”, according to a Russian account. Though Nato offered only a vague assurance the countries would eventually join the alliance, it was enough to prompt the then prime minister to launch a devastating five-day war against Georgia and send troops to occupy two breakaway border regions.But the muted western reaction, followed by a US attempt to reset ties with Russia, meant Putin’s use of force “was not addressed decisively enough”, says Kadri Liik, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “And that created a situation where things got worse and worse and worse.”Fears of western encroachment and domestic uprising became intertwined in Putin’s mind. In December 2011 he accused the US of “giving the signal” for protests preceding his return to the presidency, then described the 2014 revolution in Ukraine as an “armed coup”, prompting him to seize the Crimean peninsula.This severely damaged Russia’s global standing but Putin’s approval ratings at home soared above 80 per cent. With little meaningful opposition, his appetite for adventurism grew — culminating in a 2015 military intervention that turned the tide of the Syrian civil war.“Putin’s used to being lucky. That’s very dangerous for a gambler, because he starts believing fate is on his side,” Pavlovsky says. “When you play Russian roulette, you feel that God is on your side until the shot rings out.”As Putin’s circle became more limited, the picture of the world he received became more distorted. He and his confidants would increasingly spout bizarre conspiracy theories that the west was bent on destroying Russia through everything from gay marriage to anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny. “You eventually end up in a trap, because your inner circle tries to only tell you good news and what fits your views. Imagine Putin discussing the war in Ukraine with his generals — they’ll rapturously cry, ‘Yes, we can!’ Nobody will resist,” Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of the R.Politik analysis firm, says.Western countries found negotiating with an overconfident, isolated Putin impossible. Talks over the Donbas conflict, brokered by France and Germany, stalled. Ukraine then elected a new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, who took a bolder stance against Putin: the former comedian demanded Nato admit Kyiv and had Putin’s closest ally there arrested.“Russia’s political regime is this mafia-type state where letting insults drop means the leader loses his authority,” says Nikolai Petrov, a fellow at Chatham House. “There’s no way you can wipe that clean.”As the peace process deteriorated, Putin’s resentments of Ukraine and Nato spilled into the open. Last summer, he published 5,000 words casting aspersion on Ukraine’s right to exist in its current form and claiming the US was using it to threaten Moscow. Then, as Russia began massing troops on the border, Putin told diplomats to maintain “a certain tension” with the west. His demands that Nato pledge never to admit Ukraine and roll back the alliance’s eastern expansion would have rewritten the post-cold war security order. The west mounted last-minute diplomatic efforts. But when France’s Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Olaf Scholz met Putin around the huge Kremlin table, they were subjected to historical rants by a man who struck them as almost totally at odds with the outside world, according to aides.Their missions were doomed to fail. A day after agreeing to a Macron-brokered summit with the US, Putin recognised the Donbas separatists’ independence in a rambling tirade in which he threatened to hold Ukraine responsible for any “ensuing bloodshed”. It was a clear attempt to prepare Russia’s population for war against the “brotherly nation” of Ukraine — whose very existence in its current form, he claimed, was an existential threat.“At some point he didn’t think he had been driven into a corner so much as that he could get out of the corner. What did he have to be afraid of?” Stanovaya says. “He realised an aggressive, frightening Russia is an effective way to make the world start taking you seriously.” 
116  On Wednesday night, at a dinner party in Kyiv, Ukraine’s best-known novelist Andrey Kurkov has asked some of his friends to eat his famous borscht. He reveals gleefully that his recipe contains a Georgian plum sauce, which gives it that extra Kurkov oomph. Amid laughter and earnest talk we could be in London, Paris, New York or anywhere else in the western world, except for one thing. Before we start, we stand. Vodka shot glasses are raised for the toast. “To victory!”Even then messages were flying. The Russian invasion will start at 4am, they said. We had had similar predictions a week ago but then, somehow, I was not convinced.As dawn broke on Thursday and the Russian invasion began I started to walk. People had started to queue at ATMs to get cash. Then they began to queue at pharmacies. All across town people were tugging suitcases behind them, carrying water bottles, pasta and other siege food.At the Golden Gate metro station I met Anna, a 23-year-old bartender. She was taking her parents, dog and cats to safety. But Anna said she did not want to go. I asked if I could take a photo of her and the cats, thinking both were in the cat carrier, but she unzipped her backpack and out popped Belash, dazed and snow white. Anna said she intended to come back and fight.Up at St Michael’s Golden-Domed Monastery, priests were serving mass. They were not praying for peace though. They were “praying for Ukraine” said Father Michael. “We are not afraid because God is with us.” Let’s see. From there, it is a short walk downhill to Maidan, Independence Square. This is where the bid to create a modern, free and European Ukraine began in November 2013, with protests that turned into the revolution that overthrew President Viktor Yanukovych, who then fled to Russia.It was hard not to feel emotion. Jets roared overhead, invisible in the cloud. No way to know if they were Ukrainian or Russian. Then finally the square. It was grey, drizzly and cold. Maidan was deserted. A police car blocked the road in front of the memorials to the so-called Heavenly Hundred who died here in 2014. That was the beginning. Thursday was the day this chapter closed.As I have travelled across the country this past month I have asked people everywhere if they expected war. Almost to a man and woman they scoffed: “No, of course not!” The tensions were politicians playing games, Vladimir Putin trying to extort their country, meddling by the US and so on, but war.no way! It would be crazy. And it is crazy, but I am old enough now to know better.In Donetsk in 2014, in eastern Ukraine, at another dinner I told people that, that very day, I had seen separatists building roadblocks on the highway into town. I said that this reminded me of the weeks before the Bosnian war. “No, no” people told me. War would be crazy. It had been just the same in Bosnia. War tore Croatia apart in 1991 and even then their Bosnian neighbours insisted there would be no war.So now it has begun and where will it end? Lighting a fire is easy. Controlling it is different. By TSUM, Kyiv’s most luxurious fashion shop, six men in motley uniforms stood by a truck laden with knapsacks. “We are all war veterans and volunteers,” said Anton, a 33-year-old programmer. “We are just waiting to know where to go.” A lone band of brothers or the first of a thousand partisan resistance cells?What a tragedy is engulfing Ukraine and all Europe! From one end of the country to the other I could see how slowly but surely a new country had begun to emerge from the ruins of the old post-Soviet one. Despite the occupation of Crimea, despite the rumbling war in the east, a new generation of Ukrainians has been reclaiming its place in Europe — no longer somewhere on the periphery of Russia. And that is the problem, isn’t it?Putin imagines he can bring Ukraine to heel again but is he too late? My friend Ludmila is reporting for duty as a combat medic. Artem, my reservist friend in Odesa is waiting for orders to deploy and tens of thousands more are ready to fight to save their country’s future, to stop Putin dragging them back to the empire of the past.In his rambling and bitter speech on February 21, Putin castigated Lenin for creating a Ukraine out of the ashes of the Russian Empire. Historians can debate that but no one can doubt that Lenin was right when he said: “There are decades where nothing happens and there are weeks where decades happen.” This was one of those weeks. The air raid sirens are blaring again.Tim Judah is the author of ‘In Wartime: Stories from Ukraine’ (Penguin)
117  US and European stocks rallied on Friday as war in Ukraine raged, with investors watching for signs that the conflict with Russia would be contained to the two countries.The S&P 500 stock index, which had swung wildly on Thursday, advanced 2.2 per cent.The Wall Street benchmark had dropped as much as 2.6 per cent on Thursday before closing 1.5 per cent higher, as hedge funds unwound earlier bets that stocks would fall. Traders said that many investors had sought to reduce their positions given the uncertainty in the market and an uptick in volatility.The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite gained 1.6 per cent on Friday. Both Wall Street indices eked out moderate advances for the week.As Russian troops advanced on Kyiv, the US and EU imposed a range of sanctions on Moscow that stopped short of curbing energy exports, calming market jitters that a rising oil price would exacerbate already high levels of global inflation.“The news on sanctions yesterday was not as aggressive as perhaps some in the markets had feared,” said Sebastian Mackay, a multi-asset fund manager at Invesco.On Thursday, the White House explicitly excluded Russian oil and gas companies from a number of new sanctions announced against Moscow. The news helped reverse most of a rally that had pushed crude to almost $106 a barrel after the invasion of Ukraine.“I will do everything in my power to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump. This is critical to me,” said Joe Biden, US president.The decision to spare Russia’s energy trade “was a sigh of relief for markets”, said Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones.Brent crude fell 1.2 per cent to settle at $97.98 a barrel on Friday, while West Texas Intermediate, the US marker, was down 1.3 per cent.“We continue to expect volatility in the near term,” said Mahajan, “but over time, we would expect oil prices to moderate back down into the $70-$80 range”. In Europe, the regional Stoxx 600 share index gained 3.3 per cent, after dropping 3.3 per cent in the previous session and briefly entering a technical correction.Meanwhile, London’s FTSE 100 closed 3.9 per cent higher — recovering the previous day’s declines in its biggest single-day advance since November 2020. Russian stocks also rebounded after falling dramatically on Thursday.Maria Municchi, lead manager of a portfolio of multi-asset funds at M&G Investments, said investors would now also be seeking out bargains in heavily sold-off stock market sectors.“When you have these big moves in a very short period of time it is often exaggerated,” she said.Demand for haven assets also weakened on Friday. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note ended the day unchanged at 1.96 per cent. Germany’s 10-year Bund yield rose 0.06 percentage points to 0.23 per cent, reflecting a sharp drop in price of the benchmark European debt instrument.Spot gold lost 0.8 per cent to $1,889 a troy ounce. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against competing currencies and tends to rise in times of market stress, fell 0.6 per cent.Tancredi Cordero, founder of investment advisory boutique Kuros Associates, argued that a sustained equity market rally was unlikely, at least for the next few weeks.“Equity valuations are not as high as they were a couple of months ago but they are still high,” he said, noting that the Federal Reserve was readying to raise interest rates.“We’re on the edge of the cliff,” he added, estimating that the S&P 500 stock index “could fall another 5 to 10 per cent from here”.
118  Global corporate bond issuance has plummeted and the pace of equity fundraising has eased as corporate treasurers and investors wait out the market tumult created by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Companies around the world had raised around $60bn through bonds for the week to Thursday, down from more than $125bn in the prior full week and a year to date average of almost $100bn, according to data from Refinitiv. Euro and US dollar denominated deals contributed less than half of the total.Bond issuance got off to a slower start this year as choppy markets spooked by high inflation kept issuers on the sidelines. But the latest dearth of new issuance has come as treasurers and traders sit on the sidelines, rattled by geopolitical turmoil as Russia ramps up its offensive in Ukraine.The drop has been particularly noticeable for lower-rated, “high-yield” debt. Twitter is the only high-yield company in the world to come to market so far this week, according to Refinitiv, raising $1bn on Wednesday. A second high-yield bond deal announced by nutrition products group Bellring on Tuesday was pulled two days later due to “market volatility”.“It’s been incredibly volatile for the past few weeks,” said Marco Baldini, head of European bond syndicate at Barclays. “You have these small windows when you can get into the market and get a deal done. Now that you have a military conflict unfolding in Ukraine it’s going to make it even harder.”Spanish water management company FCC Aqualia had planned to issue a two-part green bond last week but decided to postpone due to market conditions, according to people familiar with the deal.This week, a handful of companies decided to hold-off issuing bonds at morning “go-no-go” calls with bankers.Those declines come as the flow of new equity raises had already slowed to a trickle, with the threat of rising interest rates coming into 2022 prompting a sharp sell-off in high-growth stocks. That scenario was then exacerbated by escalating tensions in eastern Europe.Companies have raised less than $2.5bn through US initial public offerings since January 1, compared with more than $24bn in the first two months of last year, according to Dealogic data. Just one company, private equity group TPG, has raised more than $250mn.And the developments in Ukraine, which have driven volatility across financial markets in recent weeks, are expected to dampen the IPO market further. No US IPOs were completed this week, and the one small deal that had been scheduled — for a UK-based cannabis company — was delayed.Some investors are also worried that a prolonged conflict will amplify pre-existing concerns over rampant inflation in the US. The stand-off has already pushed oil prices — an important input into inflation calculations — higher, fuelling concerns over more persistent inflation which had already been a primary cause of price swings from stocks to bonds this year.Overall, the US high-yield bond market is off to its worst start on record, for data going back to 2000 from Ice Data Services, falling 4.2 per cent so far this year.“The market is definitely in a challenging spot.The Fed has to figure out how to contain this inflationary pressure,” said John Gregory, head of leveraged syndicate at Wells Fargo. “Otherwise it can become a problem for the broader economy.”
119  The eruption of the biggest military conflict in Europe since the second world war caught many investors by surprise.Moscow’s stock market was hit by one of the biggest collapses in financial history this week after Vladimir Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine. The dollar-based RTS index shed 38 per cent on Thursday, while Russian bonds tumbled and the rouble plunged to a record low against the dollar.The ferocity of those declines underscored how even many savvy, well-connected Russian investors — who dominate activity on domestic markets — were shocked by Moscow’s incursion of its neighbouring country.“It looks like Putin’s greatest ever misjudgement,” said Charlie Robertson, chief economist at Renaissance Capital. “His assessment appears to be that people will continue to buy Russian gas, wheat and metals, so what if they don’t buy any Russian stocks and bonds?”Russian financial markets partially recovered during Friday’s session, with the RTS adding more than a quarter as traders assessed a wave of sanctions imposed by western powers that spared the country’s energy sector on which other parts of Europe are strongly dependent.Yet the broader financial shockwaves will be difficult for investors everywhere to navigate, given the complex interplay between the impact on stocks, the financial sanctions that will be slapped on Russia, rocketing commodity prices, the drag on global economic growth from heightened geopolitical uncertainty, and any response that central banks may take.“Investors are on the back foot,” said Dominic Armstrong, chief executive of Horatius Advisory, “No one expected to see cruise missiles fired into Europe in 2022 in a hostile attack.”The reaction of global stock markets reflected the challenging cross-currents that investors must now navigate, as they weigh how the war in Ukraine could influence central banks’ decisions to withdraw pandemic-era stimulus. Persistently high rates of inflation had already prompted traders to price in multiple interest rate rises this year in Europe and the US.Any toughening of western sanctions against Russia could pose the risk of disrupting commodity supply chains, stoking inflationary pressures even further and lessening the appeal of speculative and high-growth equities.The FTSE All-World index dipped has already fallen around 7 per cent this year, with falls this week fuelled by the Russia crisis adding to the decline.Some international money managers will be dealt an even harder blow by direct exposure to Russian securities, whether listed in Moscow or on global exchanges. Financial sanctions could ultimately turn these into uninvestable assets for most mainstream financial institutions.Russia is not nearly as big a component of emerging markets as it once was, given the shift towards Asia over the past decade. But for some investment funds it remains a popular bet, thanks to the growth of an affluent middle class, solid state finances and cheap valuations. More recently, Russian assets have also been a popular way of hedging against inflationary pressures, thanks to the uplift from rising commodity prices.“Investors are shocked, they didn’t see this coming,” Robertson said. “This has been as bad as it could possibly be.”The biggest western holders of Russian sovereign debt are funds controlled by German insurer Allianz, the New York investment firm BlackRock, Californian money management groups Capital and Western Asset Management and Vanguard, according to fund filings compiled by Bloomberg. Together these five investors own about $7.4bn of Russian bonds.Many equity funds — especially those that specialise in developing economies — also have exposure to Russia. For example, the MFS Emerging Markets Fund had 7.9 per cent of its $7.8bn assets invested in Russia at the end of last year while GMO’s $2.2bn emerging market fund had a 14.9 per cent allocation to Russian equities at the end of January.Calpers, one of the world’s largest public pension plans, has around $900mn exposure to Russia, after increasing its emerging market allocation last November to boost chances of reaching its return targets.The Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund managed by Justin Leverenz — one of the biggest dedicated EM funds with over $43bn of assets — had 9 per cent of its money in Russian securities at the end of 2021. Last month Leverenz dismissed the danger of “devastating” sanctions, arguing at the time that Russian stocks were a “cheap, symmetric bet”. “Talks of ‘devastating’ further sanctions seem largely fictional given the painful self-inflicted repercussions this would have on the global economy, and in particular Western Europe,” he told the Financial Times in late January. Leverenz did not respond to requests for an updated comment.Analysts stressed that aside from Russia’s significant role as an energy exporter, the country’s direct financial linkages to the outside world were modest, which would limit both the short and longer term impact. JPMorgan estimates that the total exposure of foreign banks to Russian banks, companies and the state only amounted to about $89bn.Nonetheless, a sense of confusion, uncertainty and even fear was the overriding message from the finance industry this week, after Europe was once again plunged into armed conflict.“Today we woke up to a world that was different than yesterday,” Ingvild Borgen Gjerde, an analyst at DNB wrote to the Norwegian bank’s clients on Thursday.
120  Volkswagen has been forced to idle two of its German plants after failing to obtain parts from Ukraine, in the clearest sign yet that Russia’s invasion of its neighbour is disrupting the European car industry’s supply chains.The carmaker’s Zwickau plant in east Germany will be idle for four days from next week, and the nearby Dresden plant will be closed for three days, a spokesman confirmed, adding it was impossible to say how long the shutdowns would last.VW has been unable to secure electrical wires from manufacturers in Ukraine, according to people familiar with the matter, and realised late on Thursday that it would have to cut back production. VW declined to name the supplier.On Friday evening, VW said its global network “includes a number of suppliers in western Ukraine” and may experience “disruptions in the supply chain".It is “reviewing alternatives” to its Ukrainian suppliers.Wiring harnesses, electric cabling inside the car, are a specialism of Ukraine and are also made in north Africa.Most Ukrainian factories, which had contingency plans in place earlier this week for an invasion, have shut. Bosch, which has 350 staff in the country and a factory supplying local garages, said it was looking at “measure to support and protect” its workers.VW's closures will lead to roughly 1,200 fewer cars being produced every day, and will particularly affect the manufacturing of VW’s electric ID models, made in Zwickau. Demand for the vehicles has been so high that VW’s own staff have been asked to drive petrol models for the moment to increase the available supply of battery-powered vehicles.Earlier on Friday, Volkswagen chief executive Herbert Diess said it was “too early to assess the impact” of the war in Ukraine on VW’s business. VW had already offered to fly Ukraine-based staff out of the country a few weeks ago, he added.As of Friday evening, Mercedes-Benz, Ford, Renault, Toyota and Jaguar Land Rover all also said they were so far unaffected by stoppages in the country.Mercedes said it was “monitoring the situation closely since it is still early to assess the full impact of this escalation on our business”.General Motors, which does not operate in Europe, told the FT on Thursday it had “limited supply chain exposure” to Ukraine.Although Russia and Ukraine are small markets for Volkswagen, which sold 9m cars globally in 2021, both countries provide raw materials and components that are crucial to the industry’s supply chain. One large car manufacturer told the Financial Times its employees were trying to work out whether rail deliveries that come via Russia would be disrupted.The temporary closure of VW’s factories echoes a similar move taken by the carmaker towards the end of 2020, caused by a shortage of semiconductors. The bottlenecks soon escalated into a serious crisis, leading to millions fewer vehicles being produced across the industry in 2021. Shifts at some VW plants are still cancelled because of a lack of chips.
121  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
122  Compared to the conventional ground warfare now under way, Ukraine’s online campaign to fight the invasion may be highly unconventional.As Quartz reports, it has been conducting meme warfare on Twitter, with political cartoons and jokes about President Putin and Russia. Then there is catfishing. The New York Post says Russian soldiers have been communicating with Ukrainian women on Tinder, opening up the possibility for military intelligence to set up fake profiles and find out troop locations and movements.Reuters reports the government of Ukraine is asking for volunteers from the country’s hacker underground to fight a cyber war. A defensive unit would protect infrastructure such as power plants and water systems. The offensive volunteer unit would help Ukraine’s military conduct digital espionage operations against the invading Russian forces.While the spectre of a nuclear conflagration is confining the armed conflict to Ukraine’s borders, there is nothing to stop it spreading online. One of the most chilling fears is that a regional conflict could escalate into an invisible global confrontation in cyber space, writes John Thornhill.For years, Russia has been the world’s most active nation state hacker, responsible for more than half of such cyber attacks. Its top three target countries have been the US, Ukraine and UK. Some commentators have argued that it is only a matter of time before the west experiences a “cyber Pearl Harbor”.1. Musk defends brother’s share sale Elon Musk has denied passing information that could have hurt Tesla’s stock price to his brother Kimbal, after a report that both men have become the subject of an insider trading investigation by US regulators. Kimbal Musk sold Tesla stock the day before his brother launched a poll on Twitter in November over whether he should divest a large slice of his own holding.2. US sues to stop Change ownership change The US Department of Justice has sued to block UnitedHealth’s $13bn acquisition of Change Healthcare, in the latest move by the Biden administration to clamp down on large takeovers. UnitedHealth’s health services arm Optum last year set out to buy Change, a healthcare insurance tech group.3. Coinbase set to suffer from crypto falls The US-listed crypto exchange breezed past expectations to report fourth-quarter revenues of $2.5bn — up from less than $500mn in the same period of 2020. But Lex points out falling crypto prices in the current quarter mean the company expects transaction volumes to fall, dragging subscription and service fees down.4. Consumers have a beef with plant-based meat Industry leader Beyond Meat reported quarterly losses of $80.4mn, more than triple those of a year before. Rival Maple Leaf Foods said that consumers viewed plant-based meat as an “expensive novelty”.5. Why do some great ideas fail to scale? In the unlovely jargon of Silicon Valley, products such as Coca-Cola or the iPhone “scale”. In other instances, early initiatives deliver a sensational result, only to fade at a larger scale. This phenomenon is called the “voltage drop”. Tim Harford explains why this happens to so many promising ideas.I tried Oppo’s Find X3 Pro last year and was really impressed by the cameras. The Chinese company’s flagship smartphone series has just been updated with three new X5s, including the Pro — there was no X4, but its innovative folding phone, the Find N, filled that gap.Techradar has had a hands-on with the new Pro version and reports the screen and cameras are the same, bar the removal of the microscope camera, which for me had been an unused gimmick. Oppo has teamed up with Hasselblad for new software features, including XPAN, which shoots like the old Hasselblad XPAN camera in grainy widescreen, and Hasselblad Master Styles, filters designed by the company based on famous photographers who use its cameras. The battery has around 10 per cent more storage than the X3 and Techradar says charging speed is greatly increased.Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight, says the X5 series will be key to Oppo growing its share in European markets, where it is well positioned to take over from Huawei as a leading Android challenger to Samsung. “The Find X5 family is a nicely designed range and the Find X5 Pro offers an eye-catching halo product, particularly the ceramic white variant,” he says.The X5 Pro starts at £1,049 in the UK and is available from March 24.
123  Even before Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine on Thursday, western governments were struggling with rising energy prices that threatened to derail economies emerging from two years of pandemic. Vladimir Putin’s aggression could now turn that threat into a reality.From crude oil to diesel to natural gas, the fossil fuels that power the global economy are trading at or towards record levels, threatening to redraw geopolitical relations between producers and consumers, drive up inflation and potentially even disrupt the fight against climate change.On Thursday, Brent crude, the international benchmark, almost hit $106 a barrel, its highest price since 2014, as traders digested the news that the world’s second biggest oil exporter had gone to war with a country at the centre of a web of energy export infrastructure.European natural gas prices also spiked this week, reflecting fears that Russia could retaliate by withholding exports accounting for about a third of the continent’s gas needs in retaliation for new sanctions and Germany’s decision to indefinitely suspend certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.Putin, Russia’s president, has not only led Europe into one of its worst conflicts since the second world war, but also worsened an unfolding energy crisis.“The next stage is an economic war,” says Daniel Yergin, vice-chair of IHS Markit and author of The New Map, a recent book on energy politics. “The ultimate consequence of this can be a big negative shock to the global economy.”Oil and gas-exporting autocracies in the Middle East are likely to gain, as they did in the great oil market bull run of 2005-08, which underpinned the Gulf’s economic and construction booms and entrenched the region’s autocracies. Russia also stands to benefit, as surging oil revenue fills the Kremlin’s coffers and enriches anew many of the same oligarchs that are now under western sanctions. Russia’s national wealth fund, worth $32bn in 2008, had a value of $175bn at the start of February, or about 10 per cent of gross domestic product — a useful buffer as western economic sanctions tighten.In western capitals, the crisis in fossil fuel markets could have been an opportunity for politicians to accelerate their green energy plans. But fears of inflation and energy security anxieties seem instead destined to trump climate policies, including the clean energy revolution promised by US president Joe Biden as he entered the White House last year. With midterm elections looming and his approval ratings sinking, petrol prices are the president’s priority.“Even modest fuel price rises have significant political ramifications,” says Morgan Bazilian, a former EU climate negotiator and now head of the Payne Institute at the Colorado School of Mines. “There are compelling reasons to move towards a low-carbon economy.but those have little sway in the myopic political discussions of the day.”The Russian offensive may have been the trigger for Brent’s leap above $100 a barrel — but deeper supply and demand fundamentals are behind the more than doubling of oil prices in the past 15 months.A little under two years ago, as coronavirus-induced lockdowns shattered global crude demand, even oil executives wondered if global consumption had peaked in the face of an accelerating energy transition to lower-carbon fuels.It was a gross misreading. The colossal pandemic stimulus undertaken by governments has put a huge tailwind behind an oil and gas demand recovery. Consumption in the US is running at record highs of near 23mn barrels a day, almost a quarter of the global total. The International Energy Agency says the world will burn 100.6mn b/d this year, a new high.“Demand has by no means adjusted to a low-carbon world,” says Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at Energy Aspects. The pandemic did not cut demand, it only suppressed it, she says, leaving an explosion to come as economies reopened. “People want to get out and about and travel.”Supplies of oil and gas are not keeping up. Between 2016 and 2019, spectacular growth in US oil output more than met the world’s extra annual demand. That is no longer the case. The 2020 oil crash slammed into an American shale patch from which investors were already fleeing. To win them back, companies have promised to prioritise profits over new drilling — a capital discipline mantra that is repairing balances sheets but slowing production growth.“We all learned some lessons,” says Rick Muncrief, chief executive of Devon Energy, one of the biggest shale oil producers in the US. “We’ll keep this discipline going.and I believe a lot of my colleagues feel the same way.”US production is rising, but remains 11 per cent below its pre-pandemic high and is far from matching global needs. ExxonMobil, BP and other oil groups have also held back capital spending — a reaction to shareholder pressure, in some cases, but also to models, such as last year’s 2050 net zero road map from the IEA, which said big new oil projects would not be needed in a decarbonising world.“Against that backdrop oil companies are saying, ‘are we really going to build a 20 to 30-year oilfield for the next three years? Clearly not’,” says Martijn Rats, a managing director at Morgan Stanley.Opec, the oil producer group led by Saudi Arabia, could step into the growing supply breach. But despite huge political pressure from Washington, Riyadh has balked at upping the pace of supply additions.Some analysts wonder if Opec is able to restore all the oil supply that was cut over the past 18 months in a bid to prop up prices. In earlier years, the cartel’s problem was producers busting through their quotas. Now some west African countries and even Russia and Iraq are struggling to pump enough.This is troubling an oil market that always banked on Opec maintaining an ample buffer of spare capacity in case of emergency. Christyan Malek, an analyst at JPMorgan, reckons that buffer could shrink to about 4 per cent of total global capacity, “well below the 10 per cent comfort level sought by consumers”.The lack of spare production capacity has left the oil market exceptionally tight, say traders, as reflected in the steep backwardated structure of its futures curve, with contracts for oil to be delivered immediately trading at a steep premium to those for delivery months hence.“The market is paying a huge premium for prompt barrels,” says Ben Luckock, co-head of oil trading at Trafigura. It would be “nigh on impossible” for the industry to supply enough oil in time to stop further inflation. “There are plenty of scenarios where oil, come summer, is $150/b,” he adds.Some analysts argue that a nuclear deal with Iran would allow the return of its oil to the market. They also predict that high crude prices will coax shale producers to pump more quickly than planned.But Luckock, Rats, and others say today’s market dynamics — including the raging thirst for diesel and other “middle distillates” — echo those of 2008, when Brent hit an all-time record of $147/b.Another lesson from 2008 — when Moscow’s preparations to invade Georgia added bullish momentum to crude prices — is that geopolitical eruptions, such as Russian tanks entering Ukraine, can take on outsized importance in a jumpy market.US officials have so far tried to downplay the physical threats to energy infrastructure in Ukraine. Biden explicitly spared Russia’s energy trade from the latest raft of “severe” sanctions announced on Thursday in what looked like an uncomfortable non-aggression pact with an industry that bankrolls the Kremlin. The US’s own modest imports of Russian oil have risen in the past two years, but the White House’s main concern is the global market. The sanctions concession pushed prices back below $100 a barrel on Friday.Traders remain concerned that the targeting of Russian banks involved in the oil trade will create counterparty risk. Trading in Urals, Russia’s main exported crude, was said to be “complete chaos” on Thursday, forcing barrels to trade at a record discount to Brent this week to entice buyers, according to pricing agency Platts.“The tightening of supply and demand made this a crisis-prone market,” says Yergin. “And the crisis is now here.”The same may be true for natural gas. Such is Europe’s dependence on Russian imports — which account for about a third of the continent’s gas needs — that European gas futures jumped almost 70 per cent to €142 per megawatt hour after the invasion began. A year ago they were €16.Tom Marzec-Manser, head of global gas analytics at consultancy ICIS, says that for now he expects Russian supplies to Europe to continue, saying the Kremlin has signalled that long-term contracts with customers in the continent would be honoured.But sharp reductions in its exports last year drove prices to record highs — and appeared politically motivated to some analysts. On Tuesday, after Germany cancelled its certification of the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, Dmitry Medvedev, the former Russia president and currently deputy chair of its security council, tweeted a thinly veiled threat about a forthcoming natural gas price shock.Any disruption of Russian supplies could not easily be fixed. As prices soared last year, liquefied natural gas shipments arrived in Europe from Australia, the US, Qatar and elsewhere. But those export plants are now running flat out.One new American project, Venture Global LNG’s Calcasieu Pass, is due to start exporting in the coming days, with most of its gas heading to Europe, including Poland. But as in the oil market, under-investment in new LNG output capacity in recent years has now left supplies trailing fast-rising demand, especially in Asia.“Many [people] were pushing hard on a transition away from gas,” says Mike Sabel, chief executive of Venture Global, “but they didn’t think through the implications of scarcity of supply and skyrocketing prices”.Europe has also lagged behind Asia in building new terminals to receive more shipments, hindering importers’ ability to secure more LNG if Russian pipeline exports were to be cut, say people in the industry. Qatar, another big producer, is also expanding its export capacity. But its new megaprojects won’t be online until around 2026.“There is very little flexibility in the supply side,” says Marzec-Manser.The rise in oil and gas prices comes at a difficult time for the global economy. Advanced economies in Europe, North America and Asia have grown much faster than expected since the worst moments in the pandemic, helped by unprecedented government support and vaccine rollouts.Rapid growth, a reconfiguration of spending towards goods and efforts to limit the burning of coal had already raised gas and oil demand in 2021, pushing inflation higher in most advanced economies to levels not seen in more than 30 years and creating the need to slow growth to control price rises.The IMF forecast in January that growth rates in advanced economies would drop from 4.4 per cent last year to 3.5 per cent during 2022.Those predictions were based on oil prices declining almost 5 per cent this year and averaging $77 a barrel. This week’s sharp rise in oil and gas prices will amplify the already difficult trade-offs between growth and recovery, especially in Europe, which is a significant net importer of oil and gas.Neil Shearing, chief economist of Capital Economics, says oil at $120 to $140 a barrel this year with corresponding increases in gas prices could raise inflation in advanced economies by a further 2 percentage points — pushing rates in many countries close to 10 per cent.From Whitehall to the White House, fears of higher inflation are leading western leaders into political compromises. Biden, who talked as a presidential candidate of making Saudi Arabia a “pariah” for its role in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, has in recent months sent emissaries to Riyadh to plead for more oil.The White House has already released stored oil from the US emergency stockpile and has considered possible cuts to federal petrol taxes — efforts to make it cheaper for motorists to burn gasoline that sit awkwardly with Biden’s pledge to lead an American clean energy revolution.In the UK, where petrol prices have hit fresh highs and households face rocketing heating and electricity bills, a government that touted its “green recovery” strategy now calls for more oil and gas drilling. France and Spain have reintroduced fossil fuel subsidies, just three months after pledging at the COP26 climate summit to eradicate them.Analysts say this simply reflects the political realities of a transition away from fossil fuels led by leaders who must win votes from drivers, in a world where geopolitics can still deliver energy price shocks.“Regime change appears to be crowding out climate change, and for good reason,” says Kevin Book, managing director at Washington consultancy ClearView Energy Partners. “The world is warming slowly, but Ukraine is boiling over.”Additional reporting by Amanda Chu in Washington
124  UK opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer has threatened to expel apologists for Vladimir Putin from his Labour party, after nearly a dozen of them signed a letter criticising Nato’s role in the Ukraine crisis.Their criticism of the western alliance was the latest sign of pro-Russian sentiment across the political spectrum in Britain and other western democracies.Politicians on the far left and populist right in the UK have expressed sympathy for Putin’s claim that Nato expansionism was forcing him to take action in Ukraine, but Starmer believes that view has no place in his party.A total of 11 Labour MPs were ordered to withdraw their names from a “Stop the War” statement which criticised Nato “sabre-rattling” in the run-up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.The MPs, mostly allies of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, swiftly withdrew their support, fearing expulsion. Corbyn, already suspended from the party over alleged anti-Semitism, had also signed the statement.A Labour spokesperson said: “With Keir Starmer’s leadership there will never be any confusion about whose side Labour is on — Britain, Nato, freedom and democracy — and every Labour MP now understands that.”The Labour left is not the only place in British politics where pro-Russian sentiments run strong. Populists and nationalists in the UK and other western democracies see something to admire in Putin.Donald Trump, the former US president, said in a conservative podcast, recorded as Putin ordered troops into eastern Ukraine: “How smart is that? Here’s a guy who’s very savvy.”In France, presidential candidates from the far left to the far right have been put on the defensive after having joined Putin in blaming Nato for the crisis, accusing the west of exaggerating the threat of invasion. Marine Le Pen, whose far-right Rassemblement National party was once financed by a Russian loan, and Eric Zemmour, the anti-immigration polemicist, have both had to swallow their words and criticise Putin.Jean-Luc Mélenchon, of the far left La France Insoumise (France Unbowed), has called for the withdrawal of “all foreign troops from Ukraine”, though he did not mention that the only foreign troops known to be there are from Russia.However, Alex Salmond, the former first minister of Scotland, has not been sufficiently alarmed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine to give up his slot as a presenter on the Kremlin-backed broadcaster RT.Salmond, former Scottish National party leader, has however suspended his talk show until “peace is re-established”. Nicola Sturgeon, his successor, said she was “appalled” that the show had continued.Meanwhile Nigel Farage, former Ukip leader and Brexit champion, prompted social media fury when he admitted on Thursday that Putin had gone “much further than I thought he would” by invading Ukraine.But Farage added on Twitter: “A consequence of EU and Nato expansion, which came to a head in 2014. It made no sense to poke the Russian bear with a stick.”Chris Bryant, a Labour MP, compared Farage to Lord Haw-Haw, a pro-Hitler propagandist from the 1940s.Farage told the Financial Times that none of his comments meant that “I like Putin” and he added: “Nato must now stand firm.”Arron Banks, an insurance tycoon who bankrolled Ukip and the Ukip-led “Leave.EU” pro-Brexit campaign in 2016, said on Twitter that although Russia “shouldn’t invade anyone” Ukraine was not a single unified country.“The EU stoked the fire burning in Eastern Ukraine on the Russia borders by pushing for membership & Nato expansion,” said Banks, who is married to the daughter of a Russian official.In 2020, the “Russia Report” by parliament’s intelligence and security committee said “Russian influence is the new normal” in British public life but came up with no new evidence of Kremlin meddling in either the 2014 Scottish independence referendum or the 2016 Brexit vote.The crisis is also awkward for UK politicians who have had financial links with Russian companies, including the ruling Conservatives who have taken over £2mn from donors linked to Russia.Former UK chancellor George Osborne last year won one of his first mandates since reinventing himself as an investment banker, securing his new employer, Robey Warshaw, a role advising EN+, a leading metals group founded by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. However, the contract was completed last year.Lord Skidelsky, the economist and Labour peer, stepped down as a non-executive director of Russian oil company Russneft in January, according to the House of Lords register of interests.Peter Mandelson, a former Labour cabinet minister, sold his shareholding in Russian conglomerate Sistema in June last year. He had been a board member until 2017.
125  Western nations this week unveiled a barrage of sanctions to combat Russia’s military aggression, but the list is far from comprehensive and there is little certainty they will put pressure on the government of President Vladimir Putin.Economists are confident the measures will hurt Russia far more than the EU, UK or US, but few think they will help bring a swift end to the Russian campaign, warning that the measures could take months or years to damage the country’s economy. Even then, the impact may not shape the Kremlin’s thinking on Ukraine.Jason Hungerford, a partner specialising in sanctions at law firm Mayer Brown, said that while sanctions could have an effect in changing behaviour, “this will be a very long game”.The sanctions imposed by Brussels, the UK and US over the past two days have hit Russia’s oligarchs as well as banks, high-tech companies and aircraft makers. But the energy sector and the Swift payments alliance have so far been exempt from the new measures.The EU said on Friday that it was preparing to freeze the assets of Putin and his foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, with additional measures against Russian banks and industry.Though Russian businesses admit the measures will take a toll on their operations, Putin has shrugged off the threat of sanctions, which he has said the west would have used against Moscow in any case as part of what he claims is a campaign to contain it.“We were preparing in some form for what is happening now from the point of view of restrictions and the sanctions policy,” he told a group of oligarchs on Thursday.Imposing the latest round of US sanctions, which included cutting off the state-owned lender Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank, from the US financial system, US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen said her aim was to impair the Kremlin’s ability “to use the Russian economy and financial system to further their malign activity”.In Brussels, Paolo Gentiloni, the EU’s economics commissioner, accepted that Europeans would “pay a price” for imposing sanctions in the form of reduced exports, reprisals and rising energy costs.But Europe’s problem in imposing economic pain on Russia is that the price it is willing to pay is not unlimited. With the bloc dependent on Russia for 40 per cent of its gas consumption, energy is off the sanctions list.This strategic weakness is compounded by the Kremlin’s “Fortress Russia” policy of recent years, which involved raising foreign currency reserves, limiting budget deficits and reducing trading relationships, especially with Europe, thereby increasing its economy’s resilience to sanctions. The policy was introduced to counter measures imposed following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.There is also the fear that China, Russia’s second-largest trading partner, might provide financial support, offsetting the impact of sanctions. President Xi Jinping merely urged “balanced negotiations” to resolve the crisis on Friday, and Chinese officials refused to call Russia’s onslaught on Ukraine a military invasion.Sberbank was the most significant target: by far Russia’s largest lender, it has about half of all Russian retail deposits. But its crucial role in the Russian economy appears to have warned western countries off cutting it out of the financial system entirely.The sanctions have so far stopped short of kicking Russia out of Swift, partly because it would impede the ability of European nations to buy Russian gas. Although global leaders and finance ministers have been divided on the issue, they say it is still a possibility. French finance minister Bruno Le Maire on Friday warned that cutting Russia out of Swift was “the financial nuclear weapon”.But senior bankers in Moscow told the Financial Times the new sanctions would still cause Russia significant pain.“The baseline is, they closed all our dollar accounts, and 65 per cent of international trade is in those. So they [Sberbank] can’t service any import-export whatsoever,” said a former senior Sberbank executive.“How do you give dollar deposits? You have to take cash out, and the bank doesn’t have it. And your open foreign exchange position requirements are balanced out through dollar transactions. I don’t know what you do with that, but the fact is they just don’t have them.”Sberbank, however, could still work with other US companies in areas such as information technology, another senior Russian banker said, whereas the other banks hit with sanctions, such as VTB and Otkritie, were barred from any contact with US persons. “Now anything and everything is banned. That’s a big difference,” the banker said.Clay Lowery, executive vice-president of the Institute of International Finance, which represents the world’s largest banks, said that by limiting Russia’s ability to transact in foreign currencies, “average Russians will feel the cost” and predicted Moscow would have to raise interest rates in response.Yet most economists do not expect a sudden collapse in the Russian economy, even if Russia’s output is now expected by many economists to contract over the year ahead.Capital Economics expected the financial sanctions to reduce Russia’s gross domestic product by 1 per cent and force the central bank to raise interest rates from 9.5 per cent to at least 12 per cent, squeezing Russian borrowers and companies. Although the country was “in a much stronger position than in 2014, the sanctions could still cause real damage”, it said,Modelling of trade flows by the Germany-based Kiel Institute for the World Economy showed that any tit-for-tat set of trade embargoes “would hit Russia much harder than the western allies” and said this suggested threats to cut off Europe from Russian gas were “not very credible”.In addition, financial sanctions would “weaken [the Russian economy] further over time”, said Holger Schmieding, chief economist of Berenberg bank. “Even Russia’s ample foreign exchange reserves of some $630bn are no substitute for dynamic trend growth,” he added.
126  Russia’s vicious assault on its neighbour is, above all, an immeasurable tragedy for Ukraine. The Ukrainian people will pay a terrible cost as they battle to defend themselves. Forced to fight alone, they face the prospect of the independence they have enjoyed for the three decades since the Soviet collapse being severely compromised, even snuffed out. But Vladimir Putin’s aggression has also brought to Europe something that had for long seemed unthinkable, and even in the last decades of the stand-off with the Soviet empire was avoided: a full-scale “hot” war between two of its largest countries. It opens new risks for the continent and the world over the years, and even decades, to come.The danger of a hot war is always that it will escalate. If he succeeds in swallowing or neutralising Ukraine, there is a risk an emboldened Putin will turn his sights to the Baltic states. That makes it vital for Nato to bolster frontline forces as a deterrent, even if this in itself could be seized on by Moscow as a provocation. Assuming escalation is avoided — and Putin’s war does not quickly destabilise his regime at home — the likelihood is that Europe is pulled into a renewed cold war. This will be in some ways similar to the last one, but more complex, and more perilous.If Russia gains sway over Ukraine, as it has over Belarus now that the tyrannical Alexander Lukashenko has traded sovereignty for Moscow’s help in crushing his domestic opposition, it will carve out a new sphere of influence in Europe. Rival blocs will once again face off along an extended border. Western liberal democracy will be pitted against not communist but nationalist authoritarianism.The dangers this time are starker. The Soviet Union by the 1980s was a gerontocracy with a stagnant economy. Russia’s leader today has shown he is ready to change European borders by force, faces few of the institutional checks of the late Soviet era, and has openly threatened nuclear war. He has spent a decade modernising his army and atomic arsenal.Moscow confronts, meanwhile, a Nato alliance whose supplies of combat-ready troops, tanks and planes have shrunk since the 1980s, even as it has expanded geographically and assumed responsibility for defence of ex-Soviet satellites and republics, from the Baltic to the Black Sea. This confrontation is shaping up just as the US is wearying of its outsize role in European security, and preoccupied with a new superpower, China, that has engaged in an even more aggressive and rapid military build-up than Putin. China and Russia have found common cause in seeking to limit US power and reshape the US-dominated global system.One similarity with the 1980s is that Russia’s economy is again stagnating, with real incomes falling. Indeed, just as Europe has tarried too long in weaning itself off Russian oil and gas, so Russia has done the same, failing to use its natural resource revenues to diversify its economy. If Putin is forced to become more autocratic to restrain a restive population, Russia may start to resemble even more the late USSR. Sanctions imposed over the Ukrainian war will intensify the pressure.Beyond the immediate crisis, then, Europe’s task may once again be to contain a hostile Moscow until a new leadership is forced to change direction. That means rebuilding its defences, and adopting a strategy to diversify its energy sources — at high speed, and high cost. Global democracies will have to rediscover, too, the resolve that enabled them to prevail in the last cold war. Three decades ago, they came to believe history was on their side. The calamity in Ukraine is a stark warning that they face a new struggle to prevail.
127  Good evening Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has shattered hopes of a strong global economic recovery from coronavirus, at least in the short term.The unfolding conflict has shaken financial markets, and geopolitical tensions are set to exacerbate high inflation and supply chain bottlenecks.Tough economic sanctionsby the US and Europe are hitting some of Russia’s largest banks and wealthy individuals while cutting off western exports of advanced technologies. But so far the sanctions have steered clear of Russia’s oil and gas sales — intended to spare the energy industry from what would otherwise be a brutal blow. Gas prices in the UK and continental Europe dropped more than a fifth on Friday, partially reversing a surge on Thursday that had triggered fresh concern about energy supplies and fears that the global economy could fall into a second recession in three years. Oil prices, which on Thursday rose above $105 a barrel for the first time since 2014, were also weaker on Friday.This highlights the dilemma facing western leaders: how to put pressure on Moscow without strangling its oil and gas production? Europe relies on Russia for about a quarter of its oil and more than a third of its gas.Economists have warned of the risks to business and consumer confidence if people start saving more and spending less as the crisis continues.Meanwhile, Hong Kong has launched a new round of spending vouchers as city authorities struggle to contain the Omicron coronavirus variant. The outbreak has overwhelmed the city’s healthcare system and government quarantine facilities. The subsidies, which will be given to permanent residents and some new immigrants, were announced on Wednesday, a day after Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam said all 7.4mn residents would have to undergo mandatory testing next month as the government maintains its controversial zero-Covid strategy.Strict travel restrictions and severe quarantines are forcing global businesses to rethink their operations in Hong Kong, and have prompted an exodus of several senior executives from the territory. The EU has warned that more than one in 10 expatriates from its member states have left Hong Kong because of its tough Covid controls.For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our live blog.The effects of sanctions on the Russian economy are likely to be profound, but that is unlikely to divert Putin from his chosen course, writes Gideon Rachman, the FT’s chief foreign affairs commentator. An economic rupture between Russia and the west will also have serious economic consequences for Europe and the US.UK consumer confidence plunged in February and many measures of spending remained below pre-pandemic levels as surging living costs hit morale even before Russia invaded Ukraine. The consumer confidence index fell seven points to minus 26 in February — one of the worst scores since the start of the pandemic.As Covid restrictions end in Britain, FT columnist Camilla Cavendish urges the government to think seriously about how young people may have been scarred by post-pandemic anxiety.

128  BP is under pressure to sever its ties with Rosneft over the Russian energy group’s central role providing fuel to Vladimir Putin’s armed forces, which are engaged in a bloody assault on Ukraine.Rosneft, in which UK-listed BP holds a 19.75 per cent stake, is one of the country’s largest crude oil producers and a main supplier of fuel to the Russian military.UK business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng summoned Bernard Looney, chief executive of BP, to a crisis meeting on Friday as the company faces calls from opposition MPs to divest its stake in Rosneft.Kwarteng is “uneasy” about BP’s involvement in Rosneft and asked Looney for a briefing on the company’s detailed exposure to Russia and future plans, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. “BP left the meeting with no doubt about the strength of the UK government’s concern,” the person said.Opposition politicians have called for BP to divest its Rosneft stake. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs a cross-parliamentary anti-corruption group, said: “It is totally shocking that BP — a major British corporation — is fuelling the invasion of Ukraine and profiting from Putin’s maniacal aggression. I fully expect BP to do the right thing by swiftly divesting.”Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, urged BP to give up its Rosneft investment “with immediate effect”. “It would be totally unacceptable for British companies to profit from investments in Russia after the illegal invasion of Ukraine,” he said.BP has been criticised before for its stake in Rosneft, which has been under US and EU sanctions since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Those measures were designed to ensure Rosneft could still export oil and gas but stymie its future growth. As a result, BP was still able to report profits of more than $2.4bn from its Rosneft stake last year and collect $640mn in dividends, while Looney has continued to sit on the Russian group’s board.But the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has resulted in sweeping sanctions against Putin’s regime and led to several European executives resigning positions on Russian boards, has increased scrutiny of the partnership. Kwarteng is also known to be uncomfortable about Looney sitting alongside Putin on the board of trustees of the Russian Geographical Society. The society is described as an institution that preserves Russia’s “historical, cultural and moral foundations”. A top 20 shareholder in BP said the company’s shareholding in Rosneft was increasingly problematic but that it would struggle to find a buyer even if it wanted to divest its stake.“It has to be worrying what that Rosneft fuel is being used for. But what would BP do? They’re a minority shareholder,” the person said. “The key thing is that anyone prepared to buy a big chunk in a Russian oil company is probably not someone you’d want to sell to.”The Russian government holds a 40 per cent direct stake in Rosneft, which is the largest oil refiner in the Russian Federation with 13 refineries. Its facilities processed 93mn tonnes of crude oil in 2020 and the company provides fuel to various parts of the Russian state, including the air force.In December, Rosneft’s aviation fuel subsidiary, Rosneft-Aero, sought a contractor to transport aviation kerosene from the Yaroslavl oil refinery to a Russian military airfield at Torzhok north-west of Moscow, according to a publicly available copy of the tender document provided to the Financial Times by Source Material, an investigative journalism organisation.BP and Rosneft declined to comment.In an interview with the FT this month, Looney said BP would worry about new sanctions if and when they materialised. “Let’s see what happens. There are sanctions today, we comply with sanctions,” he said.Bob Seeley, a Tory MP and Russia hawk, said that Britain’s interest would not be helped by forcing BP out of its legal contract with Rosneft, where it was a passive investor. “It feels like a dubious tactical moveto quote Sun Tzu, ‘tactics before strategy is noise before defeat’.”
129  At a briefing on Wednesday afternoon in London to discuss the outlook in emerging markets, executives at Ashmore — an investment house specialising in developing countries — kicked off by addressing “the elephant in the room”: Russia.The country had just recognised the independence of two regions in eastern Ukraine, and the US was warning of an imminent broader land grab.The situation, Ashmore pointed out, was fluid. It demanded a “very, very careful” approach from fund managers. But the core view was that the Russian president would not send troops towards Kyiv. There would be no full invasion and instead, “a good chance that soon we won’t be talking about it”. A few hours later, Russia invaded its neighbour on multiple fronts.The frippery of numbers, markets and money is, of course, at most a secondary concern for all right-minded people while the ensuing humanitarian and geopolitical crisis unfolds. Nonetheless, those paid to look after our pensions and savings for a living have an obligation to figure out what it all means.Immediately, it meant a historic crash in Russia’s stock markets, a blast of nerves across asset prices around the world and the growing likelihood that, through its dominance of multiple commodities, Russia’s sovereign hostile takeover campaign will complicate an already tricky global economic outlook by jacking up inflation.The fact that Russian stocks dropped almost 50 per cent at the start of trading on Thursday — one of the biggest drops in any stock market ever — gives a strong signal that a number of specialist investors failed to see this coming. Just hours before Russia’s full invasion began, analysts at banks and investment houses were busily issuing research notes all based around the same “core scenario”. “Most people thought we would avoid this,” said one emerging-markets investor. “We did, and we kept that view right up until the end.”Some fund managers had cut back their positions on Russia, in case the build-up of troops dented asset prices. But even investors generally downbeat on Russia and sceptical of its motives have been blindsided as President Vladimir Putin has exceeded expectations for the ferocity of his campaign.So now what? Russian markets have stabilised. The Moex stocks index is likely to end the week down by a relatively modest 27 per cent — a savage drop but still a bounce from the extreme low point of the week. It is very hard to see how this market can recover fully from here, or Ukraine’s for that matter. A debt default or restructuring for the latter feels inevitable.This is likely to cast a cloud over emerging markets assets as a whole. “Say I’m talking to a client who had been considering a Russian equities mandate.that’s not going to happen,” said the EM fund manager. “Not just for Russia, but if they were looking at any EM allocation, they want to pull out or they want to wait before they go in.”And yet, in many major markets, we are already back to business as usual. In the US, the S&P 500 index of stocks dropped on Thursday, but ended the day in the green. So did the Nasdaq Composite. In Europe — clearly the most vulnerable region to this war on its doorstep — stocks were well on their way to recovering losses by the end of the week.“The market does not yet fully understand the impact of this geopolitical shock,” wrote the investment team at Amundi. “This is not the time to try and buy the dip.” But that is what investors do best, and right now, fund managers seemingly judge that there is insufficient reason to believe this war will throw the global economy off course, especially as sanctions have so far not bitten too hard into Russia’s commodities trade.The rates strategists at Rabobank think you can look at this crisis in two ways — as a further prop for already punchy inflation or as a potential shock to growth. “For Fed officials, there is as yet no evidence to suggest the latter concerns are outweighing the former,” wrote Richard McGuire and Lyn Graham-Taylor at the bank.A string of Federal Reserve officials this week confirmed that policymakers were, of course, watching the Ukraine situation closely. Tom Barkin, president of the Richmond Fed, said the war was unlikely to shift the “underlying logic” of the plan to start raising interest rates. Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic said he was keeping a watchful eye, but that Fed policy was “poised to return to a more normalised stance”.Fed governor Christopher Waller, meanwhile, said “it is too soon to know how Russia’s attack on Ukraine will affect the US economy, and it may not be much easier by the time of our March meeting”. For now, all things being equal, he supported raising rates to counter inflation.As Rabobank said: “If the Fed believes it’s still business as usual, maybe the market should too”. All in all, Ashmore may still end up being right. Putin has shocked the world, but investors may no longer be talking about his impact on their portfolio in a few weeks.
130  War in the heart of Europe comes at an already difficult time for the global economy. The recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is not yet complete. Inflation is high and central banks are concerned that temporary, pandemic-related, supply chain blockages could set off a self-sustaining cycle of persistently higher inflation. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and its attendant impact on global commodity prices, will make every aspect of this outlook harder to deal with. The parallels with the 1970s, when the oil price shock from the Yom Kippur war combined with existing inflationary dynamics, raise the worrying spectre of stagflation.For the moment, the order of the day in markets is volatility. Asset prices have swung dramatically as traders attempt to understand the latest news. Gold and stock prices, as well as oil, have whipsawed. That will probably continue as more details emerge from the fog of war and investors digest what they mean for the outlook. Indeed, natural gas prices fell on Friday as US and European sanctions packages focused on oligarchs and banks rather than energy. That reluctance to target energy is understandable, if morally regrettable, given the dependence of much of Europe, and especially Germany, on natural gas from Russia — and the political sensitivity of US president Joe Biden’s re-election chances on petrol prices.Nevertheless, prices have still risen overall as traders anticipate disruptions to supply, whether accidental or deliberate, from the fighting. They are factoring in, too, the possibility that pressure will mount for even more aggressive sanctions such as cutting Russia off from the Swift interbank payments network. Benchmark oil prices reached $106 on Thursday, the first time they have risen above $100 since 2014, before falling back.That will add fuel to the inflationary fire. The war amounts to a supply shock — reducing the capacity of the global economy to produce goods and services. Such crises hit growth while raising inflation. That is harder for central banks to deal with than a fall in aggregate demand, when spending retrenches. Lower interest rates may be able to encourage investment and consumption in the short term, but they cannot do much to get more fossil fuels out of the ground.There will be some, smaller, offsetting impact on consumer and business confidence. Central banks are likely to continue to pursue tighter monetary policy, to prevent inflation from feeding off itself. But a pause in their plans, to see how the situation develops, would be sensible for the short term.Fiscal policy will ultimately have to take most of the burden of shielding the most vulnerable from the impact of higher prices. Government spending cannot ameliorate the effect of higher commodity costs but it can ensure they are shared between the whole of society rather than leaving just a few to shiver and starve from the combined impact of higher food and fuel prices — Ukraine is a major wheat exporter as well as playing host to gas pipelines. Transfer payments, funded by general taxation, will be needed.In the longer term, the invasion will shift the composition of government spending. Not only should it accelerate attempts by western economies to wean themselves off fossil fuels, especially those imported from Russia, but it likely means the end of the post cold war “peace dividend”. Defence investment will be added to an already long list of priorities for government spending. Investors have long feared a return to the stagflation of the 1970s; few, however, anticipated that it would come alongside a return to war.
131  Nato will have to strengthen its defences in eastern Europe after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the risk that Belarus will host nuclear weapons and Russian troops, according to France and the Baltic states.Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarus dictator, has over the past two years closely allied himself with Russia’s Vladimir Putin and allowed the country to be used as one of the launching pads for the invasion of Ukraine this week. Belarus is sandwiched between Russia to the east and Ukraine to the south, while to the north and west are the Nato members of Poland and the Baltic states.Belarus is also holding a referendum this weekend on future constitutional arrangements. French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Friday that the referendum — conducted without democratic oversight — could end Belarus’s status as a neutral state free of nuclear weapons.“Belarus also says it is prepared to permanently host Russian military forces,” Le Drian said in a statement. “We and our partners will have to draw all the consequences of this situation in the adaptation of Nato’s defence posture.”Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Poland called on Thursday for immediate consultations at Nato under the organisation’s Article 4, which allies can invoke whenever “the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened”. These concerns were discussed by Nato leaders at a crisis summit on Friday.Jens Stoltenberg, Nato secretary-general, said: “Russia is the aggressor, and Belarus is the enabler.”Belarus’s strategic value to Moscow has been shown this week as Russian troops deployed there staged an assault on Kyiv, reaching the city’s suburbs within 24 hours.When a critical Kyiv airport taken by Russia was recaptured by Ukrainian special forces, Moscow instead diverted incoming airborne deployments to a Belarusian airfield to travel south by land.Ingrida Simonyte, Lithuania’s prime minister, told the Financial Times that the situation in Ukraine and Belarus was “a complete game-changer for the European security situation”.“We think there will be a need to rethink the whole security situation if these Russian troops and weapons are here to stay [in Belarus] as they appear,” she said.Edgars Rinkevics, Latvian foreign minister, told a news conference on Friday: “We need to treat the Belarus and Russia border as one, as this is now one long border.Russia and its vassal country Belarus [means] we will need to divert resources [to invest in defending] that border that could be invested in education and health but this is a necessary investment.” Le Drian on Friday met Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the Belarus opposition leader, and said France and its EU partners were determined to help the country’s democratic forces.“If Russia controls Ukraine and Belarus then all of a sudden the Nato-Russia border jumps from around 1,300km to [around] 3,700km: and that requires a huge amount of planning about how you would manage that situation,” said a western defence official.Additional reporting by John Paul Rathbone in London
132  Gas prices in the UK and continental Europe dropped more than 30 per cent on Friday on relief that western sanctions had not dealt a crippling blow to Russia’s ability to sell energy and other commodities.Russia supplies about 40 per cent of Europe’s gas supplies, and concerns that flows could be disrupted after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine saw the price surge almost 70 per cent on Thursday.But prices cooled on Friday as traders analysed US president Joe Biden’s decision to include in his sanctions package a carve-out for energy payments, a crucial source of revenue for Moscow.He also said Russia would not be barred from the Swift international payments system, which the country’s big energy companies rely on to get paid for selling their oil or gas globally.“Biden was careful to explain that he was not sanctioning the Russian export of energy,” said David Aserkoff, analyst at JPMorgan. “His speech was at pains to say that while the goal was to damage the Russian economy, he sought to limit the impact on petrol prices and implicitly other commodities as well. This was also consistent with the view that sanctions are supposed to hurt the enemy, not oneself.”Futures linked to TTF, Europe’s wholesale gas price, fell 32 per cent to €92.50 per megawatt hour, having traded above €140 on Thursday, while the UK equivalent was down 31 per cent at 221p per therm.The fall came as Russian gas flows to Europe increased on Friday after European utility companies ordered more of the fossil fuel, which is used to heat homes and burned in power stations to generate electricity.However, analysts said this did not reflect a change in strategy by Russia’s state-run gas exporter Gazprom, which is still not making additional volumes available or filling their own storage facilities in Europe.They said European utility companies were ordering more gas under their long-term contracts with the Russian supplier because the structure of those agreements meant it was at present cheaper to nominate maximum volumes from Gazprom than to buy in the spot market.A small amount of Russian gas is also set to flow to Europe through Poland for the first time in weeks said Tom Marzec-Manser, head of gas analytics at ICIS, a consultancy.“We are seeing buyers across Europe wanting more gas from Russia [under long term contracts] than we have seen in a long time and that’s because the economics are favourable,” he said. “What’s interesting is that Gazprom is choosing to use the Yamal-Europe pipeline [via Poland] rather than send even more gas through Ukraine.”Gazprom’s policy of only fulfilling its contractual obligations and not selling in the spot market has been one of the key factors in driving gas up prices from €16 a year ago to a record above €180 before Christmas. That extraordinary surge has driven up energy bills for households and industry across the continent and added to inflationary pressures.Oil prices, which on Thursday rose above $105 a barrel for the first time since 2014, were also weaker on Friday. Brent crude dipped to about $98.18 a barrel.Russian exports account for between 6 and 7 per cent of global oil supplies, and concern about the impact of sanctions pushed the country’s flagship Urals grade trade at a record discount of more than $11 a barrel as buyers steered clear.“The Biden administration sanctions package was designed to have limited immediate impact on oil and gas flows, but don’t underestimate the level of self-sanctioning occurring in the market,” said Ben Luckock, co-head of oil trading at Trafigura, one of the world’s biggest commodity traders.Some refiners and shipowners were now “actively choosing to not buy Russian barrels or call at Russian ports”, he added.The cost of chartering a ship to carry crude oil from the Black Sea to Europe has also rocketed, making Russian barrels less attractive versus other grades.The Russian invasion of Ukraine has spooked oil markets because the market is already tight. Supply has struggled to keep up with resurgent demand as lockdown restrictions have eased.As such, some traders believe escalating tensions with Russia would increase the urgency for the US to agree a deal with Iran on its nuclear programme.“There have been some indications of progress,” said Amarpreet Singh, oil strategist at Barclays. However, Iran’s demand for a guarantee that future US administrations do not renege on the deal “is still a sticking point”.
133  Some of Europe’s biggest industrial groups have warned of further price rises in the face of energy cost volatility following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.European natural gas prices fell back to €94 per megawatt hour on Friday, after spiking 69 per cent to €142 on Thursday as the onset of war stoked fears of disruption to Russian gas supplies. European gas prices are almost six times higher than a year ago.BASF, the world’s biggest chemicals group, warned of renewed price increases on Friday after its natural gas costs alone rose by €1.5bn last year.Martin Brudermüller, chief executive of the German multinational, also raised concerns about a broader drop in industrial output as a result of the war in Ukraine, possibly hitting demand for building-block chemicals.“The war in Ukraine has the potential to significantly reduce growth of global GDP and industrial production,” he said.Natural gas is burnt to generate electricity or used as a direct feedstock by companies such as fertiliser and plastics makers. As its price has soared in recent months, European chemical and cement companies have sought to protect their margins by passing additional costs on to customers.BASF’s Belgian peer Solvay, which produces soda ash used in glass and detergents, said on Thursday it would accelerate price rises this year to cover the additional rise in energy costs.Meanwhile, Dominik von Achten, chair of HeidelbergCement, told analysts that managing energy inflation had become “an hourly management task now — it’s not daily.”After Berlin froze the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project between Russia and Germany this week and with western sanctions on Russian energy exports still a possibility, executives expect little short-term relief in the European gas market.Holcim, the world’s biggest cement producer, and French building materials conglomerate Saint Gobain said they were confident of passing price rises on to their customers and believed that efforts to renovate housing to reduce energy consumption would likely speed up.Jan Jenisch, Holcim CEO, told the Financial Times it was preparing to raise prices for its cement by more than the 6 per cent increase of last year, after severe cost inflation that included a Sfr550mn ($593mn) jump in energy costs.Despite the inflationary pressures and outbreak of war in Europe, he still expected construction demand to remain robust. “Poland, Romania, Czech Republic and Slovakia are EU-connected,” Jenisch said. “I cannot imagine they will go into a recession.”Petrochemical producers such as BASF, LyondellBasell and Ineos are also at risk from a potential surge in prices and limited availability of naphtha, a feedstock in plastics production.Ajay Parmar, senior analyst at consultancy ICIS, said half of Europe’s naphtha comes from Russia and that any reduction of supply could cause shortages.
134  Sometimes, usually against my will, I remember Donald Trump. You know, the one with the fake tan and small hands? Who looked straight at a solar eclipse and suggested you inject bleach? He still exists!This week, Trump’s acolytes launched Truth Social, a social network intended to rival Twitter, from which he is permanently banned. It hit technical problems immediately, with users unable to sign up. Donald, when they say move fast and break things, they don’t mean your own app! As the comedian Jimmy Kimmel put it: “Truth Social has been such a disappointment so far Trump may have to rename it.Don Jr.”Sadly, we still get to hear Trump’s views on Ukraine. Speaking at Mar-a-Lago, he described Vladimir Putin’s invasion in the only way he knows how: as a property deal. “He’s taking over a country — really a vast, vast location, a great piece of land.” He declared Putin’s “genius” and called his invasion plan “pretty smart”. Separately, he joked the US could use something similar “on our southern border.”Remember: if several thousand votes in Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin had gone the other way, this guy would still be president and this week would be even worse.Let’s imagine how much worse: if Trump were president now, he would at some point have referred to events in the wrong country, probably Uzbekistan. He would have tweeted about a basic aspect of geography, possibly the existence of the Black Sea, with the boast “not a lot of people know that”. Jared Kushner would have a role. In fact, given the inevitable staff turnover, he might by now have all the roles. And unlike Joe Biden, Trump wouldn’t have released the US’s excellent intelligence, because he wouldn’t have read it.Trump claims that Putin’s invasion “would have never happened” while he was president. Crimea was taken by Russia in 2014, when Barack Obama was in office, and the rest of Ukraine is now being taken under Biden. But let’s be serious: Trump undermined Nato and grovelled to Putin. In 2018, shortly after the Salisbury poisonings and a (rigged) re-election, Trump insisted on calling him. An official gave him briefing notes with the words: “DO NOT CONGRATULATE ON ELECTION WIN”. The first thing that Trump did on the call? Congratulate Putin on his electoral win!Dictators were never intimidated by Trump, whom they knew was all vanity and no strategy. It was on Trump’s watch that China’s Xi Jinping cracked down on Hong Kong, Belarus’s Alexander Lukashenko brutally put down protests and Saudi operatives murdered Jamal Khashoggi.All the while Trump was impotent. He did agree a deal with Xi, under which China would buy $200bn more US exports by the end of 2021. We now know that China bought none of these. He tried to negotiate with Putin one-on-one using what the author Michael Wolff referred to as his “anchor-tenant strategy”, based on wooing a star brand to a property developer. He came out humiliated.At the same time, Trump didn’t actually change Russia policy much. He imposed sanctions, because the adults in Washington insisted on it. But he couldn’t build alliances: he reportedly alienated Narendra Modi by telling the Indian leader, “It’s not like you’ve got China on your border.”Trump had no answers to the tragedies of Afghanistan, Syria and Ukraine. Yet the original sin wasn’t his. Much of it belonged to his predecessor George W Bush, who, by invading Iraq, triggered humanitarian and geopolitical nightmares that occupy the west to this day. The Iraq war was the backdrop for Putin’s infamous 2007 Munich Security Conference speech, in which he raged about unilateralism. Bush dirtied the idea of western military power, splintered the Atlantic alliance and stalled efforts to wean us off fossil fuels.For all his idiocy, Trump arguably inflicted less lasting damage — not least because he was too incompetent to win re-election. How about that: the racist, coup-attempting clown was the least disastrous of the Republican party’s last two presidents. Can’t wait to see your candidate for 2024, guys!
135  The writer is editor-in-chief of MoneyWeekYou don’t often lose all your money in an equity market. Every year Credit Suisse publishes its Global Investment Returns Yearbook, and in doing so remind us just how well things usually go.Credit Suisse’s database covers the returns on stocks and bonds for 35 countries. The results are mostly cheering. For example, since 1900 the US equity market has given an annualised real return of 6.7 per cent and the rest of the world has returned a perfectly acceptable 4.5 per cent.In two cases, though, they aren’t particularly cheering. In Russia in 1917 and China in 1949 investors suffered “total losses” after communist revolutions. Both markets reopened in the 1990s. There were no refunds.This week, with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, has not been quite on the same scale — but the 33 per cent fall in the Moex index on Thursday was a sharp reminder of the risk that investing comes with. It should also be a reminder of the extent to which uncertainty drives equity prices.There is endless guff talked about equity valuation, but at its heart it is very simple. A share is worth your forecast of what the total income from it will be over time, discounted for inflation and then discounted again for the extent to which you might be wrong. The number you are prepared to pay should be nothing more than the sum of the dividends you expect to receive adjusted for uncertainty. The more confusing the future looks for any particular stock or market, the less you should pay. Every complicated model you see that looks like it is about something else is actually nothing more than an attempt to get a handle on the likely scale and timing of the income you can expect. That’s it.So what about Russian equities? They are now, by any measure, cheap. Prices are moving around too fast to be precise, but think a price-to-earnings ratio of three to four times and a dividend yield of 10 per cent. But they also come with absolute uncertainty — we have no idea quite what the various sanctions currently being announced around the world will end up doing to the earnings bit of the price/earnings equation. For now, that means buying them is not an investment but a speculation. However, it isn’t just the Russian market that should be worth less as a result of the invasion of Ukraine — pretty much all stock markets now have a new overlay of intense uncertainty. The big fund management PR machine has been pretty active over the past few days, telling us to buy on the sound of cannon and noting that markets have easily brushed off many of the nasty global events of the past few years.Take the withdrawal from Afghanistan, the North Korean missile crisis and the 2017 bombing of Syria, said one manager: in all cases the market reaction was “surprisingly mild”. Buying the dip was the right thing to do.It probably won’t be this time because of inflation and the extreme levels of uncertainty it introduces into future income calculations. Ukraine is the world’s biggest exporter of sunflower oil, the second-largest producer of barley and the fourth-largest producer of potatoes. It is also rich in metals and minerals. Add in Russia’s dominance over key strategic metals and you can see the potential for a nasty inflation shock.This is all terrible for equities. The Credit Suisse yearbook gives us a few hints as to just how bad it could be. From 1914 to 2021 you can divide markets into periods in which interest rates were mostly rising and those in which they were mostly falling. During the former periods, when inflation was also on average 2 percentage points higher than otherwise, US equities offered a fairly meagre average real return of 3 per cent. In the falling rate periods that number was 9.7 per cent.Data for the UK tells the same story — 1.2 per cent in tightening cycles and 8.5 per cent in easing cycles. This doesn’t necessarily mean that markets should fall, but this round of inflation comes with unusual levels of uncertainty. Will central banks decide to tolerate more inflation than they might have otherwise, given the situation in Ukraine? Will there come a point when they have no choice but to push up rates first? Perhaps inflation at 8 per cent is worse than crashing equity markets?Then there is the question of who takes the inflation hit. Is it workers (who could see real wage declines), consumers (who could face higher prices) or shareholders (companies absorb the price rises and profit margins, and so potential dividend payouts fall)? Or indeed all three? And at what point will inflation become self-fuelling? Historically higher prices tend to start begetting still higher prices at about 7 per cent as consumer behaviour changes.It’s usually worth going with the optimists when it comes to stock markets. But with valuations still high, an inflation crisis, a supply chain crisis and a geopolitical crisis on the go, maybe not this time. The good news (sort of) is that there is one clear path ahead for investors. The crisis in Ukraine brings us back to basics and to a focus on energy security, food security and actual security. It might seem a little 1970s, but these are the places where there is some certainty — and where you should be invested.
136  Hours after architect Anna Gnedovskaya shared a Facebook post condemning her country’s invasion of Ukraine and calling for Russians to take to the streets in protest, the police came knocking on her door. She fled, but was detained on Friday.“Two policemen waited for her outside the building all night,” her son Viktor Tatarskii, a 37-year-old biologist from Moscow, told the Financial Times. They told Gnedovskaya — who did not attend the protest — to accompany them “as a witness of a fraud”, adding “but you understand everything yourself”, Tatarskii said.His mother — one of 1,500 opponents of the conflict detained across Russia in the hours following the invasion, according to official data — now faces a court hearing for allegedly threatening public order.Russia’s launch of what President Vladimir Putin called “a special operation” to “demilitarise and de-Nazify” Ukraine has dismayed many of its own citizens. Following his early-morning address to the nation on Thursday as the incursion began, people in Moscow and other cities were reported to be panic-buying food and withdrawing dollars from banks.As yet it is hard to accurately gauge public opinion of Putin’s plans. Ahead of the invasion, a Levada poll indicated that 60 per cent believed the west was responsible for escalating the crisis.The protests are far from the largest in Russia in recent years, where an intensifying crackdown on dissent has outlawed demonstrations without a permit and made taking to the streets almost impossible without the threat of jail. Russia also lacks the dissident tradition of Ukraine, where protests are a core part of political culture and many have criticised what they see as their neighbours’ passivity.But on Friday social media in Russia continued to teem with calls to halt the aggression and protesters plan another rally in Moscow next week.Tatarskii was one of thousands of mainly young people who took to the streets of Moscow, St Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Ekaterinburg and other major Russian cities on Thursday night to make their opposition clear.“I’m very much against war. I believe it’s a crime to have a fratricidal war,” he said, referring to Ukraine’s deep cultural and historical ties to Russia. “I’m against war in general, but this one is.an aggressive and criminal war.”Pavel Akimov was among those detained after he protested outside the Kremlin on Thursday carrying a poster reading “Putin=War.” The 32-year-old neurological scientist, who was released and faces a $200 fine for violating Russia’s restrictions on protests, compared the events to those in Germany at the dawn of the second world war.“There is a real feeling [as if] we are in the Berlin of 1939.that this is a historical moment,” he told the FT, speaking by phone from the police station. “This is real madness. On one hand, maybe it was expected, but on the other it is unimaginable.“No one needs this except Putin, so he can hold on to power,” he added. “It.means decades of degradation for Russia.” Dmitry, a student from Belgorod, a southern Russian town at the Ukrainian border, said he wanted the world to distinguish between Russians and Putin.“The Russians did not start the war.It was started by Putin and his criminal group, hiding behind the name of the Russians for their dirty actions,” he wrote on social media. “They have only two goals — money and power. They don’t care about refugees, the lives of civilians.“I know what the overwhelming majority of Russians are feeling — pain, fear, powerlessness and.shame,” he added. “Shame that the leader of the country you live in can doom millions of people to the horror of war with the snap of his finger.”Dmitry Muratov, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and editor of Novaya Gazeta, one of Russia’s few remaining independent papers, also expressed a sense of shame. The paper was published in both Russian and Ukrainian on Friday to express solidarity with Russia’s neighbour.“We do not recognise Ukraine as an enemy and the Ukrainian language as the language of an enemy. And we never will,” he said.Meanwhile, dozens of celebrities posted anti-war statements on social media, including singers Kristina Orbakayte, Zemfira and Valery Meladze and television hosts Ivan Urgant and Maxim Galkin.Such a move is risky in an environment where the culture industry is largely state-funded and heavily censored. Russia’s interior ministry has also issued a statement warning against online calls for people to join non-sanctioned demonstrations, saying it would “take all necessary measures to maintain order”.Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesman, said on Friday that the protesters “had no legal rights to [protest], to put forward their point of view, without going through the relevant procedures”.Putin “listens to everyone’s opinion and understands [how many] have a different point of view, as well as how many understand [why Russia was] forced” to attack Ukraine, he told reporters.“Of course, there are citizens who have their own point of view. Clearly we should do a better job explaining things to them,” he added.Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, thanked the Russian protesters.“Russian citizens who come out to the protests, we see you,” he said in a video address on Friday. “That means you have been heard. That means you believe us. Fight for us. Fight against war.”Additional reporting by Max Seddon in Moscow
137  Early on Friday morning Peter Javori, a 42-year-old father of two and his 18-year-old son, Doma, made it across the Ukrainian border into Hungary, visibly relieved at having escaped the worst armed conflict in Europe since the second world war.Russian troops had invaded Ukraine early on Thursday and Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky ordered a “general mobilisation” of men in the country of more than 40mn into the military.“I got very little from the Ukrainian government as I raised my kids,” Javori said, in Beregsurany on the Hungarian side of Ukraine’s western border. “I am not about to let them take my son into war. No way.”After just two days of fighting, Russian troops are on the verge of taking the capital Kyiv and Javori is one of thousands to flee to the Beregsurany border point.Leaders across eastern Europe have condemned the Russian aggression and vowed to help Ukrainians fleeing the war. Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia expect a big influx of refugees and are preparing for 1mn or more people in total, according to government estimates.In a video posted on Facebook by Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orban, a strategy map shows that as many as 600,000 refugees could arrive from beyond the Carpathian Mountains. While Orban made clear in a video statement that Budapest would not send troops or equipment to Ukraine or jeopardise its long-term gas shipment agreement with Moscow, he said: “We will naturally extend humanitarian aid.”Poland, home to a large Ukrainian community, said it would send a medical train to its border to treat Ukrainians wounded in the Russian attacks, and ship them to one of 120 available Polish hospitals, according to reports. Romanian defence minister Vasile Dincu on Wednesday said Bucharest would be able to handle half a million refugees.Romania, Hungary and Slovakia allow visa-free entry to Ukrainian nationals for a 90-day stay. Orban, who erected a double razor wire fence and vowed to keep migrants out during the 2015 migrant crisis, has taken a different tack now, partly because many of the arrivals are ethnic Hungarians and entitled to Hungarian passports, and partly because they did not transit another country before they reached Hungary. In a government decree published late on Thursday, Hungary said it would give temporary asylum to Ukrainian nationals who were fleeing the conflict, as well as third-country nationals with a legal status in Ukraine.Already at border points such as Beregsurany and Siret in Romania, cars are backed up several kilometres and thousands of people are queueing to get in.In Beregsurany, a four-lane road had more people on foot than vehicles, many of them families with children, bearing bags of clothes. Refugees put down their bags under a sign that read: ‘Welcome to Hungary!’ Nearby the Border Buffet served them coffee and snacks, and a dozen minivans waited to pick up those, such as Javori and his son, willing to pay €40 for a trip to Budapest.A dual Ukrainian and Hungarian national, Javori was initially turned back when he presented his Ukrainian passport, but allowed into Hungary on his Hungarian passport. He left his wife and daughter behind and was headed to Budapest, where he hopes to find work.“The women stayed at home, my daughter, my granddaughter,” he said. “They are afraid, too, but I don’t think Putin wants to enter Transcarpathia [the border region next to Hungary]. At least I sincerely hope so.”At the nearby train station in Zahony, Beata and her children had just arrived from Csongor with her three children to join her husband, who lives in Hungary.“We did not want to leave Ukraine, we have a good life there but when the state of war was ordered we had no choice, really. I didn’t give birth to these three to see them in harm’s way,” she said. She plans to head to the Hungarian city of Miskolc. “I hope it’s just a week or two, or even just a few days.”Alla, who also fled from Csongor with her two small children, left her sick father in hospital. “We thought they were still far enough from Russia to be safe, but last night the hospital was damaged in shelling there too,” she said.Like many of the new arrivals, Jozsef, a 35-year-old farmer, is unsure what comes next. He brought his wife and two children with him, and they hope to stay with family in Hungary then maybe move to the Czech Republic in search of work. “But we have no real plans. I don’t even know what we will do tonight, much less in the long run.”Andriy, a 25-year-old Ukrainian driver, said he used to be a policeman but, fearing he would be conscripted, quit to become a minibus driver last month. He stopped picking up passengers on the Ukrainian side on Monday, and for now plans to remain in Hungary.“My family is in Ukraine,” he said. “I worry myself sick, but they won’t be sent to the front like me. They told me to stay here and not risk it.”
138  Europe’s airliners normally fill the map with criss-crossing flights. This week, a gap opened over Ukraine following Russia’s invasion. On Friday, Russia banned British airlines from its airspace, in response to UK restrictions on Russia’s Aeroflot. This brings more headaches for European airlines hopeful that travellers would fly their friendly skies this year.Ukraine restrictions matter most to London-listed Wizz Air and, to a lesser extent, Ireland’s Ryanair. Both took a bet on expanding flights there. Wizz has upped its capacity flying there by two-thirds to more than 8 per cent of the total since 2019, says Bernstein’s Alex Irving. Indeed, four of its jets are reportedly grounded in Ukraine.These low-cost carriers were attracted by Ukraine’s growing middle class and young, mobile population — travelling for work in Poland and western Europe — and the relative shortage of competition.For British Airways, part of International Airlines Group, the issue is less about direct travel to either Ukraine or Russia. Those destinations do not loom large on BA’s radar. However, cutting off the airspace over Russia might do so, over time. In normal periods, BA has 7 per cent of its fleet on routes to Asia that are made shorter by flying over Russia. Flying a longer route could add an hour or more to flights.But these are not normal times. Continuing outbreaks of the Covid-19 pandemic in Asia mean that BA’s Asia capacity has fallen to just 1 per cent. So far, only British airlines appear to have received a Russian airspace ban. One European airline at risk from a ban extension is Finnair. The latter’s business model emphasises connecting European short-haul travellers to Asia by flying over Russia.Fears of protracted hostility may well reset a number of air routes over time, lifting fuel bills and possibly deterring some travellers. Airlines appear to have banked from one crisis into another.
139  The writer is prime minister of PolandThe Russian invasion of Ukraine ends once and for all an era of illusions about the west’s relations with Moscow. What has been clear to Poland for years must now surely be clear to all western countries. Russian aggression against independent Ukraine has shown President Vladimir Putin’s true face.Russia can be stopped only by western solidarity with Ukraine. There is no room for doubt here. The EU and Nato cannot allow for a moment the impression to form that they are willing to sacrifice the future of Ukraine to restore peace.Between November and December last year, I held consultations with several EU countries. At the time, we were in the middle of a gas crisis and Poland was struggling with provocations from Belarus, which is heavily dependent on Russia. I warned then that this could be a prelude to something much bigger and far more dangerous. On Thursday, the worst-case scenario came true.Russia’s actions are like dominoes, with one move triggering another. And Putin’s ultimate goal is clear: rebuilding Russia’s imperial power. Russia has turned its longing for the days of Stalinist domination of the Soviet Union into aggression in international politics. In Putin’s vision, the reassertion of Russian power requires the subordination of former Soviet republics, which are now independent states.The ruthless attack on Ukraine is another chapter in this story of the restoration of Russia’s imperial status. Putin has been implementing this plan for years. He started with an attack on Georgia in 2008, followed by the occupation of Crimea in 2014. And today he intends to subordinate all of Ukraine. And we should be under no illusions: this could be just the beginning. Tomorrow Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, as well as Poland, could be next in line.Transatlantic security is indivisible. A threat to one state in the Euro-Atlantic community is a threat to every member of Nato and the EU. All for one, and one for all. It was on this foundation, of solidarity and unity, that Europe built peace and prosperity after 1945. Now Putin is trying to blow up the entire postwar security architecture.Putin has so far succeeded in his pursuit of this goal because he has not faced proper countermeasures for some time. His long-term strategy has been based not only on shameless violence, but just as much on insidious propaganda and building up networks of economic dependency.Russia has set a trap for Europe in the form of energy dependence. The construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline connecting Russia and Germany has shown how many politicians in the EU are prepared to sell out western values for the chance to make a good deal. Germany’s decision to suspend the approval process was needed and expected, but this pipeline should be shut down completely. And, as I said at Thursday’s EU Council meeting, we should also talk about Nord Stream 1.Today, we are seeing that the price of European naivete over Russia is Ukrainian blood. For more than 30 years of relative peace, the west has clung to the illusion that the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union had brought about the “end of history”. Today, however, history is returning with all the force it can muster, including war — which is why politics, and politicians, must once again be serious. The blood of our Ukrainian neighbours, friends and brothers demands that we react decisively.The war that Putin has unleashed on Ukraine is also a battle for the soul of the west. This is the moment for us in the west to show that we will not submit to tyranny. It is time for us to show that values such as freedom and the right of the self-determination of peoples are not merely things we talk about, but also things we are willing to fight for.Poland stands side by side with Ukraine and its people. We will not countenance any compromise with Russia that would undermine the territorial integrity and independence of the Ukrainian state. There is only one way to prevent this from happening. A united west — the EU shoulder to shoulder with the US, UK and other allies — must impose economic sanctions on Russia that will completely dismantle the Putin regime’s operational capabilities. The package of sanctions that I and the other 26 EU leaders agreed on Thursday evening is welcome. The time for negotiation is over. Putin has broken every promise he has made in recent weeks. He must therefore face a response that is stronger than ever.The end of the era of illusions opens up a completely new chapter in the history of the EU, Nato and the west as a whole. This must be an era of responsibility. Russia must be made to bear the cost of breaking the fundamental principles of international law. All peace-loving nations must unite in sanctions against Russia, which should be aimed primarily at its political leadership and associated business elites.We must send a clear message to these individuals that there will be no return to “business as usual” until Ukraine is secure and sovereign within its internationally recognised borders. It is time to abandon the illusion that the world will become a safe place without our effort. Peace must always be fought for. It must always be earned.
140  Mykhaylo was one of several hundred men queueing up outside a military enlistment office in Kyiv’s central Lukianivska neighbourhood on Friday, looking for guns to fight invading Russian forces.He was also looking for a recipient for a donation of 60 bottles that might be used to make petrol bombs: “To, you know, greet the Russians — a big cocktail party”, he said. “A buddy of mine is getting processed machine oil to serve to the Russians.”As he was speaking, the waiting crowd scattered in panic as someone pointed to the sky at a surveillance drone hovering overhead that they feared could presage a Russian air attack. Someone in the heavily armed crowd fired an automatic weapon.“Close the skies! Hashtag, ban Russia from Swift!” Mykhaylo said with a caustic smile, spelling out two slogans being shared on Ukrainian social media in the days since Russia’s invasion this week. “And also, remove Russia from the UN Security Council.”Vladimir Putin’s troops were advancing into the outskirts of the capital city, steadily overpowering Kyiv’s defences. In an early morning video address, President Volodymyr Zelensky, dressed in a green T-shirt and military-style sweater, said Russia was aiming to assassinate him.By Friday morning the Russians had reached Obolon, a northern suburb, fuelling fears in Kyiv that street battles with the city’s invaders were coming next.Across Ukraine, people reacted with disbelief, determination, and raw anger — directed mostly at Russia, but also at western countries — to an attack on their state that had been building in plain sight for months, then this week escalated into a major European war.“It’s crap. What else can I say?” said Denys, an IT specialist standing nearby in the uniform of the territorial defence force, armed with a machine gun.“I think we’re just teetering on the brink of survival,” he said. “The country will either survive, or it will not — and it will be torn apart, and there will be no Ukraine afterwards.”He added: “I want Ukraine to keep going.”Putin’s air and ground attack on Ukraine brought with it images rarely seen in Europe since the second world war. In Kyiv and the eastern city of Kharkiv, people bedded down on metro platforms after air raid sirens wailed and officials warned residents to take shelter from air attack.In Kyiv, an elegant and, until this week, buzzing European capital of 3m whose residents like to compare it with Berlin, businesses closed and people crowded supermarkets to stock up on emergency supplies. Some grabbed suitcases to flee the Russian advance by car or on foot.Ukrainians hunkering in emergency shelters scrolled through news of the threat to their state on their phones. Online, people eased the tension and worry by trading humorous memes.One showed a plane flying over a war zone, with the US and EU flags and a smiley face emblazoned on its fuselage, tailed by a banner reading “YOU’RE DOING GREAT!”“All you need to do is to close the skies and sanction Putin personally,” a man outside the military recruitment office said when asked by a journalist for comments for a British newspaper. “And thank you, foreign love,” he added sarcastically. “God save the Queen! And kill Putin regime.”Ukraine’s official Twitter account urged users of the social media platform to “Tag @Russia and tell them what you think about them”.“It’s surreal,” said Yaryna Kozel, 21, a public relations professional taking cover in an emergency shelter in the downtown Podil neighbourhood. “I never imagined that it could happen in 2022 that people in one country could just kill people in another independent country.”Kozel found out about the Russian attack at 6am on Thursday, when she saw several missed calls on her phone from her manager. “I thought it was a cyber attack at first,” she said.She grabbed a first-aid kit, warm clothes and headed first to a hotel, then when it closed, to the shelter in Podil near her boyfriend’s home.On Friday she brought water, juice, bread, fruit, and sanitary napkins to the shelter, where she was reclining on a yoga mat. About 10 other people were staying there, and two dogs were also trotting around in the space. Muffled booms and, at one point, automatic gunfire could be heard from underground.Viktoria Zolotoverkha, who worked as a bartender before the war, left her neighbourhood after Thursday’s invasion because she felt it wasn’t safe, and tried to check into a hotel. “The Russians are attacking just regular buildings,” she said. “We don’t know what’s happening”.The hotel was closing, so she headed for the underground shelter.When asked for her opinion about the outbreak of war, Zolotoverkha said with a chipper smile and without hesitation: “Fubar”.“Fucked up beyond all recognition,” she said. “That’s how I feel.”
141  Few countries will escape higher energy prices following the invasion of Ukraine. But China is at least unlikely to suffer from disrupted coal supplies. New price controls announced this week to slow inflation are a sign of the country’s increasing reliance on the black stuff.Russia is a large coal supplier to the world, exporting about 200mn metric tonnes a year. Europe is one of its biggest customers, led by Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. The key Asian importers include Japan and Vietnam.If customers respond to sanctions and political risk by shunning Russian coal, the leftover supply could mean more options for China. So far, it has not condemned Moscow, sidestepping questions over whether Russia’s attack is an invasion. That could help Beijing’s plans to control coal prices — a crucial goal. China has struggled with inflation and power outages in the past year.China said this week it would limit the price of coal in its largest mining regions to control surging prices, setting the range for benchmark thermal coal at key mines between Rmb320 ($50) and Rmb570 ($90) a tonne.The controls will cap prices significantly below the nationwide price cap of Rmb700 a tonne set earlier this month. That should mean a lasting reversal of the sector’s year-long rally, which had been fuelled by coal coming back into vogue to address electricity shortages. Shares of local mining company Yankuang Energy Group more than tripled in the past year.Shares of local miners fell on Friday. The stocks included Yankuang, China Shenhua Energy and China Coal Energy. Other losers from the new policy are local energy-intensive industries such as steelmakers. These sectors should soon lose access to favourable electricity rates. Conversely, green energy stocks such as China Datang Corp Renewable Power and China Resources Power rose, in the expectation of higher demand for renewable energy.China is once again increasing its dependence on coal. But as the price caps bite, investors should move in the other directions.The list of significant coal importers was amended after publication.
142  Russian troops and armoured vehicles advanced into Kyiv’s northern suburbs on Friday as the city’s population was urged to take up arms, threatening a surge in violence as Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine shifts to urban warfare.An advance by the Russian military supported by cruise missile strikes and special forces assaults during the first 24 hours of the invasion brought troops into Kyiv on Friday morning, forcing many of its 3mn inhabitants to seek shelter.“We should be very fearful of high levels of violence in Kyiv,” said a senior western intelligence official, warning of “an incredibly brutal and lethal suppression campaign” in the capital, as residents reported the sounds of explosions around the city.Russian troops and armoured vehicles rolled into the residential district of Obolon on Friday, less than 15km from Kyiv’s centre, as Moscow said its troops had “blocked Kyiv.from the west”. The claim could not be independently verified.Moscow is pushing for a rapid seizure of the capital, which has been the core initial objective of its invasion, alongside a sustained assault on Ukrainian army positions in the east of the country.Ukraine’s defence ministry called on residents of northern Kyiv to “make Molotov cocktails, neutralise the occupier”, while defence minister Oleksii Reznikov said 18,000 submachine guns were being distributed to citizens in the capital.If Russian troops are able to secure the north of Kyiv, it would allow access to the capital for columns of significant reinforcements travelling south from Belarus, analysts have said.Western intelligence officials have warned that the encirclement of Kyiv by “overwhelming” Russian force could be achieved in a matter of days, raising the prospect of an intense assault on the city in an effort to force the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky to surrender.“The city has gone into a defensive phase. Shots and explosions are ringing out in some neighbourhoods, saboteurs have already entered Kyiv,” Vitali Klitschko, the city’s mayor, said on Friday.“The enemy wants to put the capital on its knees and destroy us,” the former boxing champion told reporters, as warning sirens blared across the city.Jack Watling, research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, predicted that “the next week is likely to be horrendous, as Russian forces push into cities and killing increases”.But, he continued, “if Russia is not able to crush the resistance [then the] conflict will protract. Moscow may have miscalculated about that: if you put people under sustained bombardment the will to resist rises.”Residents of Obolon have been ordered to remain in their homes or seek shelter. “Going outside is very dangerous now due to the approach of the enemy,” Kyiv’s city administration said in a statement.Traffic was heavy on roads leading out of the capital on Friday morning, while people and families could be seen walking away from the centre with suitcases as some tried to hail rides from passing cars.A western military official told the Financial Times that if Russian troops went into Kyiv, street by street fighting would be intense and “many Russian soldiers will feel very demoralised by finding themselves killing people just like them”.“I am pretty sure that Putin does not want Zelensky alive. We’re dealing here with a gangland boss who does not operate like a conventional statesman,” the official said. “Putin would like to suggest that there’s an equivalence between Zelensky and, say, Saddam Hussein in Iraq. But that’s clearly absurd.”Ukrainian forces destroyed bridges north of Kyiv overnight in an attempt to impede the Russian advance, while fierce fighting by special forces from both countries over Hostomel airport, north-east of the city, had stymied Russia’s efforts on Thursday to land troop-carrying aircraft there.Russia said on Friday afternoon it had captured the airport, and also claimed it had “disabled” 118 military facilities — including 11 airfields — nationwide, shot down five Ukrainian jets and destroyed 18 tanks.Russian forces in the east are also attempting to take control of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, and have shelled Odesa, a large Black Sea port. The capture of Kharkiv, 30km from the Russian border, would open up the eastern approach to Kyiv.“I find it hard to believe that Moscow was so uninformed about Ukraine that it expected no resistance,” said Henry Boyd, research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “We are only 36 hours into hostilities so it’s very early stages and from past experience half of what is reported turns out to be wrong.”“There’s been a lot of focus on the Kyiv airport,” he added. “It may well be that there are more significant developments taking place elsewhere that we can’t see, perhaps because of electronic warfare jamming electronic communications.”Additional reporting by John Reed and Polina Ivanova in Kyiv
143  The EU has warned that more than one in 10 expatriates from its member states have left Hong Kong because of its tough Covid-19 controls, as western consulates mount a diplomatic campaign to persuade the Asian financial centre to ease the restrictions.The warning, contained in an EU diplomatic letter to the government, follows panic among many expatriates in Hong Kong over an official policy of separating some Covid-positive children from their parents, as well as plans for mass testing and the continuation of harsh travel restrictions.Diplomats from the EU and the US were requesting a meeting with Hong Kong officials over the controls, said one person familiar with the matter, while another said at least 30 countries were jointly lobbying the government to soften the measures.“We estimate over 10 per cent of EU residents in Hong Kong have left in the past year and a half. We made it clear this is a conservative estimate, since what we are hearing over the past few weeks points to many more leaving Hong Kong,” Thomas Gnocchi, head of the EU Office to Hong Kong and Macau, told the Financial Times.“There is a large EU community and many EU companies in Hong Kong. We are conveying their wide-ranging concerns from the possibility of compulsory isolation, even if asymptomatic, to the closure of schools and reports of separation of young children.”Hong Kong is following China’s “zero Covid” policy, which, until the latest outbreak, had drastically reduced the number of deaths compared with elsewhere in the world.But the city has been swept by an outbreak of the Omicron variant, recording more than 70,000 cases since the surge began in late December, and more deaths than the total of the first two years of the pandemic.With the outbreak spiralling out of control, China’s president Xi Jinping stepped in this month and ordered city authorities to make fighting the virus its top priority.The Hong Kong government is planning drastic measures including mandatory testing for the entire population and then isolating those found positive in government quarantine facilities.The government also confirmed this week that, in certain cases, some children who had caught Covid would continue to be hospitalised away from their parents. The policy has applied to babies as young as one month old.“We worry about infection control measures [so] some children will be taken care of in paediatric isolation facilities by our professional staff,” said Lau Ka-hin, an official from Hong Kong’s Hospital Authority.The EU letter called for the government to allow Covid-positive asymptomatic patients to quarantine at home rather than at government facilities and adhere to World Health Organization isolation standards.The EU estimate of expatriates leaving the territory came from a survey of member states. The letter said it was in line with surveys showing a drop in the use of Hong Kong as a base for regional headquarters for non-Chinese companies.“After two years and not really seeing any exit strategy [from Covid], more and more people are considering moving away and what's happened in the past few days is accelerating those plans,” one European diplomat said.Among its other measures, the Hong Kong government has reimposed online schooling, while Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s leader, has abruptly brought forward the summer holidays to March in order to use school facilities for pandemic control activities. International schools are lobbying against the measure.The Hong Kong government on Tuesday also extended a flight ban on nine countries, including the US and the UK. Several global airlines have suspended flights to the territory altogether because of the stringent quarantine requirements on cabin crew and pilots.
144  The writer, a retired General in the British Army and author of ‘2017 War with Russia’, was Nato’s Deputy Supreme Allied Commander EuropeAt a single stroke, Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has announced a new era for Europe. Russia’s unprovoked attack on its democratic neighbour is nothing less than the return of what Otto von Bismarck called “the politics of iron and blood” to Europe. The world that we knew before February 24, in which the rights of sovereign states to live in peace was guaranteed by a respect for international law without armed force, has gone for ever.This is the return of warfare on a scale we have not seen since the second world war, a return to state-on-state warfare, a massive, premeditated, merciless and cruel assault by an ageing, isolated, nuclear-armed autocrat determined to re-establish Russian power in the former Soviet empire and to bend their populations to his will.Let us not be fooled. This is no limited attack to bite off a chunk of Ukraine. It is a massive, multi-axis conventional assault from north, east and south designed to destroy the Ukrainian armed forces, capture the state of Ukraine, install a puppet government and then incorporate it into the Russian Federation. Expect to see untold human suffering: appalling civilian and military casualties; massive destruction of cities and towns; countless refugees and a humanitarian catastrophe.The implications could not be more far-reaching — and not only for the people of Ukraine. First, it is a real and present threat to the Nato alliance. War has a dynamic of its own which, once embarked on, cannot be controlled. We should be ready for the worst: an attack by Russia from an occupied Ukraine or from Putin’s puppet state Belarus against a Nato member state. Here, after all, is the man who called for a new Yalta deal as “the most appropriate security settlement for Europe” — code for the re-establishment of Russian control in the former Warsaw Pact countries of eastern Europe, all of which are Nato members.If one Russian soldier steps across an inch of Nato territory, it means that all 30 member states will be at war with Russia. Under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, “an armed attack on one is an attack on all”. It also could mean nuclear war because Russia integrates nuclear thinking into every aspect of its military doctrine. Witness Putin’s chilling warning this week that anyone “who tries to stand in our way” will face “consequences you have never encountered in your history”.The only way to preserve the peace left in Europe is effective deterrence; conventional and nuclear. Under strong and unswerving US leadership Nato must man the ramparts on its eastern flank. The alliance must demonstrate unequivocally that it is ready and able to defend its land borders, airspace and sea lines of communication with capable, credible armed forces — and it must communicate that message to Putin.Thus far we have seen only token reinforcement. Mobilising and moving the levels of force required is a major challenge for Nato. Thanks to the cumulative disarmament in Europe of the past decade and half, there is not a single Nato nation, apart from the USA, which could put into the field the minimum requirement of a fighting division of three brigades plus all the combat support and logistics (around 25,000 men and women) at anything like the speed needed to deter Putin. Nonetheless, this is the challenge which must be met, whatever the cost.Next, we must support Ukraine. We cannot put Nato forces on the ground there or into the air above it. That would guarantee the start of the third world war. But we can provide equipment and other indirect support for as long as the Ukrainian armed forces can keep up the fight. Thereafter, assuming that Russia will eventually prevail, it means supporting, equipping and financing a resistance movement to set Ukraine ablaze and tie down the Russians in a long-term fight against an insurgency they can never win, and which will ultimately lead to Putin’s downfall.Meanwhile the pressure must be kept up on the diplomatic front in the UN and, on the economic and financial front, with sanctions. The latter must go for the Russian financial and economic jugular. And if these sanctions are harsh enough to hurt us in the west too, then that is part of the cost we must pay to undermine the Putin regime. We must not forget that we face an existential fight and, accordingly, we must be prepared to make sacrifices.This unprovoked and vicious assault has changed everything. And western allies are in for the long haul. At best, we should expect a new cold war for at least a generation on Nato’s eastern flank. At worst, we must be prepared for outright war with Russia. Above all, remember the line from the Roman general Vegetius: Igitur qui desiderat pacem, praeparet bellum — therefore if you want peace, prepare for war.Letter in response to this article:Where does conflict leave EU’s Schuman principles? / From Julian Charlton, Dublin, Ireland
145  Investors’ ability to buy and sell Russians assets such as stocks and bonds has deteriorated sharply in a sign that western sanctions are eroding the country’s links to foreign capital markets.Clearstream, a group that plays a central role in the European financial system, has cut off settlement of trades in roubles as banks, fund managers and trading infrastructure operators begin to remove Russia from global markets because of sanctions on Russian banks such as VTB.Luxembourg-based Clearstream told clients late on Thursday that settlement in transactions involving the Russian rouble, which covers assets such as stocks and bonds, would cease with immediate effect. At the start of trading on Friday, the London Stock Exchange also suspended VTB Capital, a unit of the Russian bank, from trading in the UK’s stock market.Clearstream said its decision was because of “increasing demand from its customers”, underscoring how sanctions are already beginning to affect brokers and asset managers. The US, EU and UK on Thursday announced tough sanctions on Russian financial institutions and individuals but stopped short of directly halting trading activity in existing Russian assets or cutting the country off from the Swift financial messaging system.Settlement houses play a lesser-known but vital role in the market by settling trades on behalf of investors. The two largest depositories, Belgium’s Euroclear and Clearstream, together hold about €50tn of assets in custody for global investors. Deals are usually finalised by transferring balances between customer accounts held at the depository.The Clearstream prohibition also blocked its customers from conducting rouble-based deals with clients of Euroclear. The latter has not halted settlement of deals in roubles. It declined to indicate whether it planned to do so following its rival’s move.Many of the Russia-related transactions between customers of Euroclear and Clearstream are facilitated by VTB, Russia’s second-largest financial institution. The US said the sanction on the bank would “sever a critical artery of Russia’s financial system”.The Clearstream move comes as Swiss wealth management giants Credit Suisse and UBS have also slashed the amount they are willing to lend to private bank clients using Russian assets as collateral, according to people familiar with the decisions. Both have also assigned a “zero lending value” to many Russian bonds, such as those of sanctioned banks VTB and Sberbank, effectively rendering them unusable to raise debtSimilarly, Credit Suisse and UBS had been forced to trigger margin calls after the value of Russian corporate and sovereign debt plunged on Wednesday, the people added. Clients have been required to add new cash or securities to their accounts to cover the shortfall. Bloomberg first reported the developments regarding the wealth managers.UBS declined to comment. Credit Suisse said it “serves its clients while complying with all applicable laws and regulations, including any sanctions from relevant authorities”.Traders said activity on Thursday — when the prices of many Russian assets swung sharply lower — was “chaotic” as banks began closing their doors to Russian names ahead of impending sanctions.Local brokers in Moscow, who act as intermediaries between big banks in London and the Moscow Exchange, struggled to keep up with demand, traders said. The situation was exacerbated by the Russian central bank’s decision on Thursday to implement a temporary ban on short selling, a method of betting stock prices will fall.As Russian bond markets collapsed on Thursday, fund managers said it became almost impossible to trade the country’s debt, with banks quoting huge differences in the prices buyers and sellers were offering for the assets. At one point, a leading bank was offering to buy Russian government bonds at less than half the price it was prepared to sell.“It’s still possible to sell [rouble-denominated Russian bonds] but you would have to pay a lot for the bank to take the clearing risk,” said one portfolio manager. Another investor at a big asset manager described trading in Russian sovereign dollar bonds as “by appointment only”.“This is a completely dislocated market,” said Kaan Nazli, an emerging markets portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman.
146  Uefa is exploring how to end its longstanding partnership with Gazprom, after stripping St Petersburg of this year’s Champions League final, as the football administrator moved to distance itself from Russia following Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.European football’s governing body, which has come under scrutiny for its close ties to the Russian state energy company, is seeking to end the association and is taking legal advice on the termination of the contract, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.Terminating the contract was not voted on at Friday’s emergency meeting convened by Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin, although Uefa intends to hold future meetings to discuss the partnership. The Gazprom logo would no longer feature when Champions League matches resume next month, the person said.Gazprom’s partnership with Uefa, which began in 2012, was renewed last year and runs until 2024. The deal was worth about €40mn a season to Uefa from 2018-21, according to an estimate by SportBusiness Sponsorship, a data research group.Gazprom declined to comment.As the repercussions of the invasion rippled through the sporting world, Uefa said on Friday it would shift the Champions League final, the most prestigious club game in Europe, from St Petersburg to Paris, following an intervention by French president Emmanuel Macron.It confirmed that the Stade de France in Paris would now host the May 28 event following the “grave escalation of the security situation in Europe”.The governing body had come under intense pressure from politicians and fans to switch the final from the Krestovsky Stadium, known as the Gazprom Arena. Uefa also thanked Macron for “his personal support and commitment” to have the match moved to Paris “at a time of unparalleled crisis”.Nadine Dorries, UK culture secretary, welcomed Uefa’s decision and said “Russia must not be allowed to exploit sporting and cultural events on the world stage to legitimise its unprovoked, premeditated and needless attack against a sovereign democratic state”.Stade de France hosted the final of the 1998 Fifa World Cup and the Champions League finals in 2000 and 2006. The 80,000-capacity venue is also set to host events at the 2023 Rugby World Cup and 2024 Olympic Games.Uefa’s executive committee also decided that Russian and Ukrainian football teams would play matches at neutral venues until further notice.Russia was due to host Poland in a World Cup 2022 qualifying play-off match next month, although it is unclear where that game will now take place.Also on Friday, Manchester United cancelled its partnership with Aeroflot, the Russian airline. The sponsorship deal was worth roughly £8mn a year, according to a person close to the club. Aeroflot, formerly the club’s official carrier, was this week banned from UK airspace.“In light of events in Ukraine, we have withdrawn Aeroflot’s sponsorship rights,” Man United said. “We share the concerns of our fans around the world and extend our sympathies to those affected.”German football club FC Schalke 04 said on Thursday it would remove the Gazprom logo from its shirts.Formula One, the car racing series owned by US group Liberty Media, on Friday cancelled the upcoming race in Russia, saying it was “impossible to hold the Russian Grand Prix in the current circumstances”. The decision came after a meeting with the FIA governing body and the 10 teams that compete in the sport.The Russian grand prix, which is set to relocate from Sochi to a track 54km from St Petersburg in 2023, has been a fixture of the calendar since 2014.F1’s ties to Russia go back to before Liberty Media acquired the series in an $8bn deal in 2017. Bernie Ecclestone, the former F1 supremo, signed the deal to bring F1 to Russia.Additional reporting by Nastassia Astrasheuskaya in Moscow
147  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
148  While its Cycladic neighbours Santorini and Mykonos have long been major tourist attractions, the little island of Serifos has remained relatively under the radar, a place of barren mountains, remote chapels and a handful of scattered farming hamlets. Adding to the sense of sleepy abandonment are the relics from the island’s iron ore mining industry — trucks, railway tracks and bits of pit-head machinery that lie rusting in the sunshine on the hillsides. The last mine closed in 1963.Recent years, however, have brought a new energy to the island as Athenian visitors have set about converting former miners and fishermen’s dwellings into stylish, architecturally designed retreats. The latest of these pushes the island’s austere yet luxurious aesthetic to new extremes.Created by Athens-based practice Mold Architects, NCaved is a villa for up to 10 that has been sunk into the hillside a few steps from the sea. As well as making the most of the views, the wedge-shaped design was intended to protect the various terraces, courtyards and swimming pool from the strong northerly winds. After being completed at the end of 2020, the house is now available to rent for the first time.The architects describe their creation as a “three-dimensional ‘chessboard’ of solids and voids”. The terraces and floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors bring light to the subterranean rooms, and the layout means the bedrooms are separated from each other, making it ideal for groups who want privacy as well as areas in which to socialise.Inside, the rough stone walls contrast with polished concrete floors, mirrored surfaces and slatted pale-wood joinery. There are surprisingly high ceilings, and pergolas that throw dappled shade over the terraces. A film of the property created by the architects looks more like an art-house thriller than a promotional video for a holiday home.Rates have not been made public but, according to Five Star Greece (the rental agency that will handle bookings), are expected to start from around €20,000 per week.
149  Vladimir Putin’s declaration of war on Ukraine has revived calls to kick Russia out of Swift. The measure is seen as among the most severe that the US, EU and UK could take.Denying Russian banks access to Swift is far from a given. It would, for instance, undermine Europe’s capacity to pay for Russian oil and gas, perhaps raising energy prices in the process. Imposing a ban would also require strong consensus. At present, it’s only the UK that really wants it and some EU members remain set against it.As we on FT Alphaville are not geopolitical experts, we really can’t tell you what the final call will be.But we do know a little about the plumbing that lies behind international payments. And given the pace of change seen over the past week, we thought it worth trying to explain now why getting booted out would be so painful to Moscow.Swift, or the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications to give it its full name, went live in 1977.It’s owned by banks and based in Belgium. Each of the 11,000-plus financial firms that’s a member has a Swift terminal to communicate with the other banks in the network, as well as its own Swift code. It’s not actually a payments system, but a messaging platform. However, the relative strength of its security features and the breadth of its usage (financial intermediaries in every country bar North Korea are now members) mean that it enables banks to send trillions of dollars’-worth of money across borders daily. It’s also used for foreign exchange settlement and trade finance.Unsurprisingly then, the threat of banning access often comes up whenever the US or Europe want to show they’re willing to get tough on their enemies. While Swift claims it’s not politicised (and can in theory ignore any demand to ban a state from its network as long as it is not illegal under Belgian law), it has in the past been accused of pandering to Western interests. Notably those of the US.Access to Swift matters primarily because it enables Russian energy companies to get paid for selling their oil or gas globally without too much hassle. To get a better grip on why this is so important to Putin (and Western leaders), it’s worth reading this piece from Bloomberg’s Javier Blas (hat-tip to Adam Tooze):According to JohannesBorgen, Swift’s 291 Russian members represent 1.5 per cent of flows, and are sixth globally in terms of payment messages sent on the platform. He thinks that equates to about $800bn-worth of payments a year. As a reminder, Russian GDP was $1.5tn in 2020 (though, of course, not all of that $800bn will be flowing to Russia).If you want to get a sense of where those hundreds of billions flow to and from, then the latest statistics from the Bank for International Settlements (Q3 2021) are here.In theory, yes. There’s no reason why other messaging services, email, or telephone couldn’t serve as options in the event of a Swift ban. In practice, if you want to send money around the world relatively quickly, reliably, and cheaply, then not really. Ambitions to create a rival payments network have, so far, been useless. This isn’t down to the tech (or even the platform’s standardisation of payment instructions into a convenient lingua franca). Rather it reflects the balance of power in global finance.Here’s a story to illustrate the point, taken from former Swift CEO Gottfried Leibbrandt and Natasha De Teran’s excellent book, The Pay Off.When the Trump Administration reinstated financial sanctions on Iran (sanctions which included cutting off access to Swift for certain Iranian banks), European Commission officials came up with a plan for a vehicle to handle transactions in currencies other than the dollar. The Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges, or INSTEX, was set up to enable European businesses to trade with Iran. It remained unused for a full year after it was launched. It took the pandemic for the first INSTEX transaction to occur, involving the export of medical goods to Iran in March 2020. Naturally, it failed to prevent tensions between Tehran and the West escalating.So what explains banks’ reluctance to bypass Swift, even for transactions that are above board? For Leibbrandt and De Teran, it’s all about the omnipotence of the greenback.About half of all global payments are made in dollars. Along with about 90 per cent of trade finance. When instructions are sent via networks such as Swift, many of those dollar payments need to be made between institutions that do not have accounts with one another. What that means is that a correspondent bank — probably with operations in the US, policed by the American authorities — will act as an intermediary. What the INSTEX example hints at is that, even for transactions that are legal, parties are unwilling to take the risk of alienating the US authorities by processing payments for businesses based in countries that have fallen foul of Washington.What follows from this is that there is plenty the US can do — and is doing — even without a Swift ban. The Treasury has, for instance, already cut off access to processing payments through the US financial system for Sberbank and VTB. Given Sberbank and VTB’s heft, this action alone will make life for many Russian exporters difficult, regardless of whether there is eventually a ban on the payments network.But currently there are loopholes, notably for transactions involving energy products — the vast majority of which are made in dollars. Berlin has voiced fears that stopping Russian oil and gas suppliers from being paid in dollars would trigger a surge in European energy costs. With that in mind, the US did not cut off access to the US financial system for Gazprombank, Russia’s third-largest, which facilitates payments for the energy company of the same name. Joe Biden also indicated that, at present, the sanctions enable energy transactions between Russian suppliers and their customers to still take place under some circumstances.If the conflict escalated, and the US, the UK and EU did push for an outright ban on Swift, then it is difficult to envisage a situation where Russian institutions’ correspondent banking relationships with US institutions would be allowed to remain as they are now. One imagines loopholes would close and more institutions would join VTB and Sberbank on the sanctions list.Without access to Swift, it would become nigh-on impossible for Russian companies to be paid in a timely or reliable way. Without access to correspondent banking services in the US, it would be nigh-on impossible for Russian exporters to be paid at all. This is what’s called the “weaponisation of finance”, where Washington uses the dollar’s dominance to further the aims of US foreign policy.Perhaps. There have long been rumblings of discontent about the degree to which DC has weaponised Swift.The EU’s chagrin over the Trump administration’s Iran sanctions was just one example. Russia also attempted to establish its own rival following the earlier clash over Ukraine in 2014. But meaningful competition is most likely to come from outside European capitals. China has established a rival network, CIPS, too. And while its use has been somewhat limited owing to settlement only being available in yuan, that might change. From payments expert Tord Coucheron:The US may well be reluctant to throw its weight behind an outright ban for fear of handing an advantage to China.But nothing’s toppling the dollar overnight. Even someone as belligerent as Putin. For the foreseeable future, the status quo stands and DC has the option to use its currency to hurt Russia.
150  Ukrainian miner Ferrexpo has warned it will not be able to meet all its commercial contracts, becoming the latest company to swept up in the disruption at the country’s ports following Russia’s invasion.The London-listed group, one of the top producers of small iron ore balls used to make steel, on Friday issued a force majeure notice — a legal step invoked when a contract is broken owing to circumstances beyond a company’s control.Although its mining and processing operations in central Ukraine are still operational, activities at the port of Pivdennyi in the south-west of the country have been suspended. The group, whose shares have plunged since Russia’s invasion, counts steelmakers in Asia and Austria’s Voestalpine as customers.Fears are mounting that some of the world’s biggest agricultural commodities traders, which have operations in Ukraine, will be forced into similar moves following the closure of Ukrainian ports.Ukraine is a leading grain and cooking oil exporter, accounting for 13 per cent of global exports of corn, 8 per cent of wheat and 39 per cent of sunflower oil. Leading grain traders Bunge and Archer Daniels Midland have closed their facilities in the country, while rival Cargill said a vessel was hit by a projectile on Thursday.Ferrexpo produces about 12m tonnes of iron ore pellets per year. About half its output is moved by rail with the rest via Pivdennyi, where it is loaded on to Capesize vessels — the largest type of dry bulk carriers with a capacity of 180,000 tonnes — and shipped to customers.A ship loaded with its pellets leaves Pivdennyi once every seven to 10 days, according to people familiar with the company’s operations.Ben Davis, an analyst at Liberum, said Ferrexpo had enough cash and liquidity to survive for a “very long time” without selling goods. The company, which has 10,000 employees, had a net cash position of $117mn at the end of December.Shares in Ferrexpo, which dropped more than 40 per cent on Thursday, rallied 7.2 per cent to 153p on Friday, taking its market value to just over £900mn.Davis said Thursday’s sharp drop in Ferrexpo stock reflected fears that its assets would be seized by the invading Russian forces. “But for that to happen you have to think that Moscow is willing to bear whatever sanctions that come its way if it starts confiscating assets from western investors.”Ferrexpo’s biggest shareholder is Ukrainian businessman Kostyantin Zhevago, who owns a 50.3 per cent stake. Other big investors include Schroder Investment Management and M&G Investment.With Ukraine’s rail network disrupted, Ferrexpo is now having to store pellets at its mine, close to the city of Horishni Plavni.“They can tough this out for a while,” said Davis. Pellets are more resilient to degradation than other forms of iron ore and can be stored for long periods of time.The closure of ports following the Russian attack has led to a halving of grain exports from Ukraine over the past week, according to estimates by Sea/, a shipping data platform owned by shipbroker Clarksons.Ukraine has sizeable inventories in wheat, corn and sunflower oil awaiting export. “There are significant volumes of wheat, maize and sunflower oil left to ship this season,” said AHDB, which advises UK farmers on agricultural marketsBrazilian miner Vale, which is a leading pellet supplier, said on Friday it was receiving calls from European customers concerned about supply.
151  Russia has banned British Airways and other UK airlines from flying over or landing on its territory, in a move that disrupts flightpaths just as carriers had grown confident the worst of the pandemic was behind them.International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways and Iberia, said on Friday that it expected to put two years and €10bn of losses behind it and return to profitability this year.But as the airline’s management was briefing analysts on its upbeat forecasts, Moscow announced the ban in retaliation for a UK government decision earlier this week to stop Russia’s flagship carrier Aeroflot landing in Britain.As a result of the move by the Kremlin, British Airways suspended flights to Moscow and confirmed it would reroute to avoid Russian airspace, leading to longer flight times and higher fuel costs on flights heading to parts of Asia.Airlines flying from Europe to north East Asia typically use the curvature of the earth to take a route over Russia’s northern regions into countries such as China and Japan.Flight tracking data showed a BA flight between Delhi and London flew west in an hour long detour over the Caspian Sea to avoid Russia on Friday, while two Virgin Atlantic flights from Asia also skirted Russia.Sean Doyle, the chief executive of British Airways, said he only anticipated a “minimal impact on our flying programme” as the airline has not yet rebuilt its schedules to Asia that were disrupted by the pandemic.“We are able to reroute our network.and for the most part carry on as normal,” he said.But in the longer run, the Russian action threatens the profitability of key routes between Europe and Asia.Robert Boyle, a consultant and former head of strategy at IAG, calculated that avoiding Russian airspace on flights from Europe would add 20 per cent extra distance for north Asia destinations and around 10 per cent for cities like Hong Kong.“As well as the additional time and cost involved, it would reduce the competitive advantage that European airlines have of offering direct flights from Asia to Europe, compared to transferring via Istanbul or the Gulf,” he said.Doyle said IAG’s plans for going back into north Asia were “very much on hold”, and highlighted plans to rebuild schedules around the profitable transatlantic routes, where IAG expects to operate 100 per cent of its pre-pandemic schedule by the third-quarter of this year.IAG on Friday announced a full-year operating loss after exceptional items of €2.8bn, an improvement on a loss of €7.5bn in 2020.The losses over the past two years represent some of corporate Britain’s heaviest, but chief executive Luis Gallego said a recovery was in sight and predicted a “robust” summer.IAG said demand for flying, including long-haul and premium leisure, had picked up again this year following a slowdown due to the Omicron coronavirus variant and new travel restrictions.“We are confident that a strong recovery is under way,” Gallego said.IAG flew 36 per cent of its pre-pandemic schedules in 2021, but traffic picked up throughout the year and the group forecast its capacity would reach 85 per cent of 2019 levels by the summer.“This is a positive release in the terrible background of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” analysts at Goodbody said.The intervention by Moscow came as lessors and aircraft manufacturers assess the implications for their operations of western sanctions on Russia. Both the US and the EU on Thursday announced export restrictions against the country, with the European Commission banning sales of aircraft and spare parts. Airbus, which has operations in Russia and counts Aeroflot among its customers, said it was “analysing the impact of the sanctions announced overnight”. It added that it would “comply with all sanctions and applicable laws once they are in force”.With reporting by Sylvia Pfeifer in London
152  China joined India and other countries in ratcheting up evacuation flights and overland crossings out of Ukraine on Friday, as Russian forces began an assault on the capital Kyiv.President Vladimir Putin’s forces have launched attacks on three fronts, storming Ukraine’s northern border with Belarus, across its eastern frontier and in the south from Crimea.Roads out of Kyiv have become gridlocked as people attempt to flee the country and Russian missiles have hit airfields across Ukraine, further complicating efforts to leave.Beijing’s embassy in Ukraine said that emergency flights were being arranged after conditions in the country “deteriorated sharply”.The statement marked a change from a day earlier, when the embassy suggested its nationals should stay at home or display a Chinese flag on vehicles if they had to travel in the country.Thousands of Chinese nationals live in Ukraine. However, no flight schedule was provided and travellers were urged to pack and be ready to leave on short notice.The Chinese decision to evacuate stands in contrast to comments from officials in Beijing who have failed to condemn Russia’s actions and refused to acknowledge the invasion.At least 15,000 Indian nationals are also stuck in Ukraine, according to Indian officials, who said they were working on ways to evacuate their citizens overland.Teams from India’s external affairs ministry are en route to the Zahony land border with Hungary, the Krakowiec crossing with Poland, Vysne Nemecke border with Slovakia and the Suceava crossing to Romania.Foreign minister S Jaishankar said India was co-ordinating with Romania, Hungary and Slovakia to facilitate the exit of Indian nationals.In a phone call with Putin on Thursday night, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stressed that India “attaches the highest priority to their safe exit and return to India”.An Air India flight bound for Kyiv had to turn round on Thursday after the air space over Ukraine was closed.“Our special flights have been affected,” said Partha Satpathy, India’s ambassador to Ukraine, in a video address to nationals stuck in the country. “My advice to all of you is to stay wherever you are.”India’s embassy in Kyiv advised nationals to leave Ukraine four days before Russia invaded.“I want to take this opportunity to assure all Indian citizens.that we will take all possible steps to bring you back safe and sound,” foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said on Thursday.Additional reporting by Maiqi Ding and Emma Zhou in Beijing
153  Good morning. Ethan here; Rob’s back next week.It has been a grim few days. Events have moved faster than our, or at least my, ability to process them. Within recent memory, you could find respectable commentators writing that Russia might be bluffing about invading Ukraine. I have no special insight into power politics or warfare, but clearly that was wrong. Now all that’s left is pondering the consequences. Today, I try to do so.A hot war is under way in Ukraine. Massive retaliatory sanctions are being rolled out and energy prices are soaring. Yet the S&P 500 closed up 1.5 per cent after selling off hard in the morning.By now, ridiculous intraday swings feel like the norm for US stocks. But on Thursday all types of assets swung in value. Oil rose above $105 a barrel but settled below $100 after Joe Biden said US sanctions wouldn’t hit Russian energy groups (yet). Gold traded as high as $1,974 a troy ounce and as low as $1,878. Treasury inflation-protected securities opened and closed at similar levels, but only after a huge lurch:One interpretation is that investors have no clue what’s going to happen. Extreme scenarios are on the table, such as cyber attacks on critical infrastructure or a wide-reaching international conflict.Uncertainty is making accurate pricing difficult, especially in Ukraine and Russia. With investors fearing the worst, Russia’s main stock index plummeted 26 per cent. Credit default swap markets are pricing an 83 per cent probability of Ukraine defaulting on its debt in the next five years. The price of Russian and Ukrainian commodity exports are surging. Their byproducts, like live hogs that in China are often fed on Ukrainian corn, are rising too. The price of oil is jumping, though tight fundamentals are the main cause of expensive energy. Much of this will be painful, especially in poorer countries that must import commodities.The whipsawing in broader stock indices such as the S&P 500, however, are harder to explain. This is partly a side-effect of hedge funds closing out short positions, as the FT’s Eric Platt sniffed out:Couple that explanation with the big picture: that for most investors the invasion’s impact has been limited. Markets are priced for a medium-term disruption in certain sectors, but not yet a broader disaster.You can see this in haven assets, where the flight to safety has looked measured. The dollar and yen have appreciated, but the changes are too small to suggest widespread fear. The US dollar index rose less than a percentage point on Thursday. Yields fell at magnitudes reminiscent of a moderately dovish central bank surprise (ie, 10 or so basis points). Likewise, gold has been rising, but zoom out and the change doesn’t look so precipitous:It’s worth remembering that almost all the economic fundamentals in place last week are in place today. A global rate rising cycle still looms and US growth is still sturdy. On Wednesday, Invesco’s Kristina Hooper told me she thinks central bank tightening is a bigger risk to markets than Ukraine. In the wake of Russia’s invasion on Thursday, I asked if her mind had changed. Here’s Hooper:The war’s effect on central bank action is a question that lingers large. On Thursday, European Central Bank governor Robert Holzmann told Bloomberg that the Ukraine crisis could postpone the end of monetary stimulus. But as frequent Unhedged correspondent Dec Mullarkey of SLC Management pointed out, central banks are probably in a bigger pinch than they’d like to admit:Traders in overnight funding markets seem to agree; the invasion has not moved the consensus guess of how much the Federal Reserve will raise rates. Stronger US growth and Russia’s energy threat to Europe could leave the Fed with a clearer path forward than the ECB, as Strategas’ Don Rissmiller wrote on Thursday:The story that markets are telling is of a medium-term contained disruption. That is bad, but not catastrophic. More ominously, tail risks have multiplied. If the war spreads to other countries, it is dire for markets, let alone the world. In a year’s time, either this war will have changed little about markets, or changed everything.Taiwan is not Ukraine.
154  Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to EU leaders yesterday via videoconference after a brutal day of Russian attacks that claimed the lives of more than one hundred Ukrainians, telling the EU that he didn’t know whether he would be able to speak to them again. He later claimed that “enemy saboteur groups” had entered Kyiv with a plan to assassinate him.In a summit that lasted into the early hours of this morning, leaders approved a second, more far-reaching round of sanctions on Russia and discussed what further restrictive measures they could take in the near future. We will explore the remaining issues and why some countries insisted on doing more. Meanwhile, in Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is towing a fine line between Moscow and Kyiv — supporting Ukraine’s integrity but also refusing to block the passage of Russian ships through the Bosphorus strait that connects the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. And with the Russian offensive still under way, we will explore the impact on civilians who started fleeing their homes to safety — the large majority within Ukraine, but with some refugees moving into neighbouring EU countries.

While some member states including Baltic nations have been arguing in favour of immediately throwing the book at Vladimir Putin, countries including Germany, Italy, Cyprus and Hungary pushed in meetings of diplomats yesterday for some sanctions to be held for a later stage — keeping “something up their sleeves”, as one official put it. In particular, Germany has resisted calls from G7 partners including the UK and Canada for Russian banks to be excluded from Swift. This was partly for fear of undermining the EU’s (and especially Germany’s) ability to pay for Russian energy, according to some people familiar with the discussions. On Swift, even though “many colleagues pleaded for it”, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said after the meeting, “more work needs to be done to assess what happens if Russia is cut off”.The idea of targeting Putin himself or foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has also been withheld, even though there was “almost consensus” they should be blacklisted, Rutte said. “But we have to assess having a connection with these two guys,” for the eventuality that there will be negotiations for a settlement of the crisis.Alongside restrictions on a number of Russian banks, the EU is planning to bar state-owned companies from listing new shares on the bloc’s exchanges; limit access of Russians to some EU financial services; prohibit the sale of certain equipment to the country’s oil refiners; bar sales of aircraft to Russian carriers; and suspend visa-free travel for Russian diplomats.A wide-ranging regime of export controls will also be introduced, tightening rules on dual-use technologies and sales to dozens of military end users, and restricting sales of items that would enhance Russia’s military or technological capacity.Details of the EU proposals seen by the Financial Times exposed the limits to what the union was considering. While the EU expanded the list of Russian banks subject to a ban on refinancing by EU institutions by two, to seven, there were no measures that reached the level of the full blocking on VTB announced by the US. And to the acute discontent of a number of member states, the union’s diplomatic wing has yet to complete adjustments to its sanctions regime to make it easier to target oligarchs and their families, meaning action against big-name businesspeople could be some time coming. For sanctions hawks, the EU’s reluctance to throw everything it has at Putin was hugely disappointing given the brutality of his invasion. “The question is, what are we waiting for on the other sanctions? If we can’t do Swift, can’t we at least not be slow on oligarchs?” said an EU diplomat. But the counterargument is that the union needs to keep some of its financial weaponry in the cupboard for the time being, in the hopes of creating some leverage for future discussions. Dialogue has even at this hour not ceased entirely: last night Emmanuel Macron held a call with Putin to discuss the invasion. Despite the French president’s demands for an end to the violence, the Russian assault continues unabated.Do you think the new set of sanctions is an appropriate response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine? Click here to take the poll. Russia’s multipronged attack yesterday was carried out with two likely initial aims: a move south using troops from the 30,000-strong deployment in Belarus to encircle Kyiv, running simultaneously with a larger pincer movement using troops moving north from Crimea and west from Russia to cut off the bulk of Ukraine’s army, deployed in the east of the country, from the capital. (More here)Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has close ties with both Moscow and Kyiv, had sought to perform a careful balancing act in the weeks prior to yesterday’s invasion, writes Laura Pitel in Ankara.The full-scale Russian assault on Ukraine could put him under pressure to side more decisively with the west. Turkey, which has for years suffered troubled relations with western allies, won praise from Nato allies for supplying armed drones to Kyiv. But as Russian tanks rolled across his country’s border, Ukraine’s ambassador to Ankara asked Turkey to go further: he called for it to shut two critical waterways linking the Black Sea with the Mediterranean to Russian ships.Senior Turkish officials, acutely aware of their nation’s long history of conflict with Russia, have repeatedly suggested in recent weeks that they would resist any attempt to alter the status quo in the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles, which would be seen as a highly hostile act by Russia.While Turkey’s foreign ministry came out strongly against the assault by Russian forces, Erdogan himself was more cautious. The Turkish president said that the invasion was a “heavy blow” to regional security and repeated a call for dialogue.Vladimir Putin has multiple pressure points that he could use on Ankara. Turkey imports about half its natural gas from Gazprom and analysts said the country would be vulnerable to retaliation in the Syrian province of Idlib, where Ankara has supported rebel forces fighting Russian-backed Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.For now, no other voices have joined Kyiv in asking Turkey to dramatically up the ante. Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said yesterday that a meeting of alliance members did not discuss the closure of the Bosphorus. Any change in that stance would put Erdogan in a very difficult bind.The Russian attack started displacing thousands of people yesterday, most of them moving out of dangerous areas but still staying in Ukraine, while a few thousand arrived in neighbouring EU countries, writes Eleni Varvitsioti in Brussels.Approximately 120,000 Ukrainians became internally displaced in a single day, according to the European Commission’s calculations, a staggering number that indicates what will follow in the coming days. There were an increased number of arrivals, many of them young men, on the Ukrainian borders of Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland, according to video footage from several local television stations. Poland expects about 1mn Ukrainians to arrive at its border and has sent a newly devised medical train to treat as many as several thousand wounded in the Russian attacks and ship them to one of 120 available Polish hospitals, Reuters reported. “We have with all the frontline member states now explicit contingency plans to welcome and host immediately those refugees from Ukraine,” said commission chief Ursula von der Leyen. The plan includes delivering food, water, shelter and health services to internally displaced people, while the UN estimated that up to €1bn will be needed to provide humanitarian assistance to up to 24mn people who could be forced to leave their homes. Frontex, the European border and coast guard agency, has also been in crisis mode since yesterday morning. Its standing corps staff is mobilised, while all resources are on alert in case member states need its support to deal with potentially enormous numbers of people fleeing Ukraine.“We hope there will be as little as possible refugees but we are fully prepared for them and they are welcome,” said von der Leyen.

155  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Thursday shook financial markets and the increased geopolitical tensions are set to exacerbate high inflation and supply chain bottlenecks. The direct impacts of lower trade with Russia, economic sanctions levied on Moscow by the US and EU, and financial contagion are likely to be outweighed by the indirect consequences from the effect on business and consumer confidence and commodity markets, economists said.These repercussions could range from relatively limited to extremely serious. If energy prices continued to soar, for example, it could easily tip the global economy into a second recession in three years. Economists said the following issues are the big ones to watch. Russian president Vladimir Putin’s desired endgame is unclear. Analysts are considering several scenarios that range from a change of government in Kyiv to a Moscow-friendly regime to a wholesale attempt to redraw the international boundaries of Europe and beyond. Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, said the first thing to consider was “how bad does the war get?” — which would determine the likely response in financial and energy markets in the days to come. The wider global response will be just as crucial, said other economists. Tim Ash, economist at BlueBay Asset Management, singled out China, which has signalled its willingness to help Russia manage the financial fallout from its military actions. Beijing’s response would be vital in terms of the wider consequences, which could range from the malign — for example, more tension over its own relationship with Taiwan — to more benign diplomatic outcomes. “Either [China] sees it as an opportunity to go into Taiwan, or as an opportunity to improve relations with the US,” he said. Leading global financial markets were sharply down on Thursday but the outcome could have been more extreme, suggesting they were surprised by Putin’s actions but do not yet think the most severe market shocks, akin to a financial crisis, are likely. This leaves open the possibility that they have further to fall, with consequences for corporate and household wealth, consumption and global confidence. Neil Shearing, chief economist at Capital Economics, noted that, while there was a sell-off in equities, bond yields declined and credit spreads have not widened much, suggesting the market reaction was orderly and not indicative yet of expectations of a wider war across Europe.The avoidance of a market meltdown was not global and many emerging economies were hit with much sharper swings. Kevin Daly, portfolio manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, noted steep sell-offs in Ghana, Turkey, Egypt and Pakistan, citing a flight to safety from financially vulnerable countries.Randy Kroszner, deputy dean at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and a former Federal Reserve governor, said recession risks would show up in the difference in yields of investment-grade compared with non-investment-grade debt, which had not widened extensively on Thursday. He added that the yields on sovereign debt of countries geographically close to the crisis would offer a good indicator of whether markets began to fear a wider conflict.Crucial for the global economy will be whether households and businesses become significantly more cautious, spending less and saving more in response to Russia’s actions. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said slower growth was inevitable. “Consumer sentiment everywhere will weaken further.That has to mean slower economic growth than would otherwise have been expected in Europe, the US and most emerging markets,” he added.Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Depending on how long this crisis continues there could be a significant loss of confidence among businesses and consumers.”Economists also warned about the pressures on businesses exposed to supply chains in which Russia plays a crucial but little-known role, such as the production of critical raw materials. The country supplies about 40 per cent of the world’s palladium, a key component of catalytic converters in petrol-powered vehicles as well as electronic devices. Europe is highly dependent on gas from Russia and cannot quickly find alternative supplies if pipelines are cut. With a mild winter coming to an end and storage levels across Europe higher than had been expected by some energy analysts, the issue of gas supplies has become less acute but will return later in the year if the crisis continues.The more immediate concern is the impact of the crisis on the price of oil, gas and other commodities. A sharp rise would add to inflation and hit consumers.“Our modelling suggests that in a worst-case scenario oil prices could rise to $120-140 a barrel,” said Capital Economics’ Shearing. “If sustained through the rest of this year, and we see a corresponding increase in European natural gas prices, that would add about 2 percentage points to advanced economy inflation — more in Europe, less in the US. So that’s an additional squeeze on real incomes.” Pantheon’s Shepherdson said the US would be relatively insulated overall, although the continued rise in prices would hit shale oil and gas producers but hit the pockets of American energy consumers.This may add to pressure on central banks to boost interest rates. Already, the US Federal Reserve last month signalled it would begin raising rates from March to control rampant inflation. Fed chair Jay Powell last month declined to say how many rate rises there would be this year.Krishna Guha, vice-chair of Evercore ISI, said the invasion “complicates the ability of central banks on both sides of the Atlantic to engineer a soft landing from the pandemic inflation surge”, and expected financial markets to scale back their expectations that central banks would raise interest rates.
156  It is also beyond question that the source of this tragedy is Vladimir Putin’s insistence on eliminating Ukraine’s independence — because that independence, representing Ukraine’s intolerable freedom (in the Russian president’s eyes) to choose between Russia and the west, is the ultimate reason why violence has come.As someone who witnessed the dissolution of the old cold-war dividing line while studying abroad in West Berlin in 1989, it is hard to fathom that a latter-day version of it will now return, only further to the east, and with the Baltic states playing the role of West Berlin. I certainly did not expect to see the return of this division in my lifetime.Nor did I have any way of knowing that the person who would recreate it was, back in 1989, not that far away from me in my student flat in divided Berlin, namely a younger Putin as a KGB officer in the East German city of Dresden. Decades later, as president of Russia, Putin became unwilling to tolerate Ukraine’s sovereignty because of that country’s special role in what he views as the greatest catastrophe of the 20th century: the collapse of the Soviet Union.Western leaders knew that creating a berth for the newly independent Ukraine was the key to enduring European peace. Yet they could not devise a policy to accomplish that goalThirty years ago, Kyiv’s decision to secede made the break-up of an already crumbling USSR irreversible. This week, Putin’s decision to send a massive military into Ukraine sealed the demise of the already crumbling post-cold-war peace. These events bookended an era characterised by a belief — now proved false — that Europe would never again witness a major land war.What, precisely, is it about Ukraine that has thrust it into this pivotal role? There are many ways to answer this, such as by diving deeply into questions of Russian and Ukrainian identity and nationality, or by looking back a millennium in time. Answers produced by these methods do, of course, matter.But there is another, lesser-used way to uncover why Ukraine has mattered so much — focusing not on Ukraine itself, but on the way that dispute between the US and Russia over its post-Soviet fate exacerbated tensions between Moscow and Kyiv, leading to today’s conflict.To understand how this fateful conflict evolved, it is necessary to go back to the 1990s. It is apparent from evidence that I, now a history professor, have had declassified (along with other archive materials) that western leaders knew that creating a berth for the newly independent Ukraine was the key to enduring European peace. Yet they could not devise a policy to accomplish that goal.The fight over Ukraine’s fate started even before it had pulled out of the Soviet Union — and, behind closed doors, divided the administration of George HW Bush. As the Soviet Union was crumbling in 1991, US defence secretary Dick Cheney advised his boss that Washington should do everything possible to accelerate that collapse. The US secretary of state, Bush’s old friend and tennis doubles partner James Baker, disagreed vehemently.Baker argued that it was essential to keep the Soviet Union — America’s greatest foe — in one piece, because otherwise its arsenal of 35,000 nuclear weapons would fragment in dangerously unpredictable ways. As Baker warned Bush: “There is no other foreign issue more deserving of your attention.”The Financial Times is making key Ukraine coverage free to read to keep everyone informed as events unfoldTorn between Cheney’s and Baker’s views, the Bush administration became badly split. As its senior figures fought over what to do, Ukrainians forced the matter by holding a referendum on December 1 1991 on whether to become an independent state. The result was lopsided: with 84 per cent turnout, the vote was over 90 per cent in favour of independence. Support for breaking away ranged from 54 per cent in Crimea to over 95 per cent in western districts and in Kyiv. Even in Donetsk, Luhansk and neighbouring eastern districts, the vote in favour was more than 80 per cent.The then US ambassador in Moscow, Robert Strauss, advised Washington that this result was devastating for Russians — “the most revolutionary event of 1991 for Russia may not be the collapse of Communism, but the loss of something Russians of all political stripes think of as part of their own body politic, and near to the heart at that: Ukraine.”Meanwhile, the west was shocked to realise, given the amount of Soviet nuclear arsenal on its territory, that the newly independent country had instantly become the world’s third-largest nuclear power — bigger than Britain or France. Moscow still had command and control over those weapons, but that did not decrease Baker’s sense of panic that physical possession of so many weapons belonged to a state going through a turbulent transformation. Russia was experiencing its own turbulence, but at least it was populated by the devils Washington knew, so in his view Moscow should inherit all of that arsenal.Brent Scowcroft, the US national security adviser, tried to convince Baker that nukes divided among Ukrainians and others unable to launch them might be less threatening to the US than the original Soviet force under centralised control. Baker would not be persuaded. In late 1991 and 1992, he embarked on repeated, urgent diplomatic missions to the crumbling Soviet Union in a fight to ensure that only one nuclear successor state emerged: Russia.Bush’s defeat in 1992’s US presidential election, after only one term, abruptly ended Baker’s efforts. But the sense of urgency survived the presidential transition and took on new complexity as the prospect of extending Nato beyond a reunited Germany — discussed speculatively under Bush — became a reality. These two issues joined in the mind of the man who won the election: Bill Clinton.The new US president wanted to find a way to make Ukraine feel secure enough to give up the nuclear weapons on its territory. If he acceded to the wishes of the countries between Germany and Ukraine to join Nato, however, that might have the opposite effect on Kyiv. As Clinton warned his fellow Nato leaders in January 1994, the “nations of the former Soviet Union.have been almost ignored through this entire debate” about where to enlarge the alliance. “Why should we now draw a new line through Europe just a little further east?” That would only “foreclose the best possible future for Europe”, meaning “a democratic Ukraine, a democratic government in every one of the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union, all committed. to common security”. They should do nothing to “foreclose that possibility”.In light of all these considerations, Clinton decided that rather than draw a new line between Nato and non-Nato Europe so soon after erasing the cold war line, he would instead try to blur any future divisions. On the advice of his defence secretary and his chairman of joint chiefs of staff, William Perry and John Shalikashvili, he approved the creation of a new entity called the Partnership for Peace (PfP), open to central and eastern European nations and post-Soviet states alike.Through PfP, potential Nato members could gain experience in carrying out peacekeeping and other joint military ventures with the west and, over time, acquire the full weight of the Article 5 guarantee — the promise that an attack on one member-state would be considered as an attack against all. Such a widely applicable, incremental approach did not require Washington either to draw a new line through post-cold-war Europe or to leave Ukraine and most other post-Soviet republics to their own devices.The Partnership was not nearly as popular as the idea of becoming Nato members. But, through clenched teeth, and because they understood what Clinton was saying about Ukraine, central and eastern Europeans agreed to support and join it. Russia and Ukraine did the same. PfP thus became something that Nato expansion could not: minimally acceptable to all stakeholders. It was a policy that simultaneously avoided drawing a new line across Europe, allowed Nato to enlarge and provided a berth for Ukraine, all while being tolerable to Russia.But having figured out a workable policy solution, Washington pushed that solution aside — because of Russian President Boris Yeltsin’s self-harming choices, and the way they combined with Clinton’s own shifting priorities. Yeltsin decided to launch a brutal invasion of the breakaway region of Chechnya in late 1994, horrifying central and eastern Europeans, who worried that this revival of Soviet tactics might threaten them. Rampant inflation and the victory of some anti-reform extremists in elections only intensified the sense that Russia’s transition was going off the rails.Meanwhile, bloodshed in the Balkans added urgency to all questions of European security and created new frictions between Washington and Moscow over how to handle the conflict. And the victory of the US Republican party in 1994’s midterm congressional elections, based on a “Contract with America” that called for swifter Nato enlargement, signalled to Clinton that the issue was a vote-getter — particularly in the states that he needed to win if he wanted to win a second term as president in 1996. Last but not least, continual pressure on Ukraine to denuclearise had finally borne fruit. In exchange for assurances of its territorial integrity — codified in the Budapest Memorandum of 1994 — Kyiv agreed either to destroy its nuclear weapons or to relocate them to Russia. It made Kyiv less important to the west.The upshot of all these developments was that Clinton became increasingly willing to draw a new line across Europe after all. Savvy members of the US National Security Council and US Department of State recognised the president’s shifting mood, and emphasised that central and eastern Europe had suffered too many historical wrongs and already waited too long to join the west. They convinced Clinton to switch the mode of Nato enlargement. Instead of incremental accession by a large number of states through PfP, they had the alliance extend the full weight of the Article 5 guarantee to a small number of states. While their motives had merit, their mode of expansion separated the former Soviet bloc states that had managed to secure Article 5 from those that had not, such as Ukraine.Whereas PfP had kept open the options for different ways of adding members, now enlargement became all or nothing. One consequence was that US options for managing post-cold-war contingency — namely, by having a variety of relationships with Nato to offer to both central and eastern European and post-Soviet states — became dramatically more limited just as Vladimir Putin was rising within the ranks in Russia.In 1989, Putin had returned from his KGB outpost in a collapsing East Germany to his hometown in a collapsing Soviet Union. He found employment with Anatoly Sobchak, one of his former professors from Leningrad State University, who was on his way to becoming mayor of a city that would once again be named St Petersburg.Putin became his indispensable aide, managing relations between the elected authorities, the remnants of the KGB and the local crime bosses. He distinguished himself through unwavering loyalty to the mayor. Even after Sobchak was voted out of office in 1996 and came into legal peril due to alleged corruption, Putin protected him, reportedly organising a swift exit for the ex-mayor to France in November 1997 by private jet.Such loyalty impressed Yeltsin’s deputy chief of staff, Alexei Kudrin, who had worked for the mayor as well and knew Putin. Through Kudrin and other contacts, Putin got a foothold in the Yeltsin administration and moved to Moscow — and did not disappoint their expectations that he would shift his unquestioning loyalty to the Russian president.Only one thing works in such circumstances — to go on the offensive. You must hit first, and hit so hard that your opponent will not rise to his feet’The extent of his devotion to his new master became clear when Russia’s chief prosecutor, Yuri Skuratov, started investigating corrupt activities on the part of the Yeltsin family and its close associates. Behind-the-scenes efforts to deter the prosecutor failed and it seemed in early 1999 as if Skuratov might come into possession of valuable evidence. Suddenly, a tape allegedly of Skuratov naked and in bed with two unclothed women — neither of whom was his wife — appeared nationwide on the government television network. The video’s authenticity was confirmed on air personally by Putin.Through these and other displays of loyalty, he swiftly climbed the ladder of power, becoming prime minister in August 1999, acting president upon Yeltsin’s unexpected, immediate resignation in December 1999, and president following the election of March 2000. Once fully in charge, Putin’s personal grievances took on an outsized role. He remembered that when he had called nearby Soviet military forces in 1989 to request armed back-up for defending his KGB outpost, he could not get it. The person who had answered the phone had refused to grant Putin’s request without explicit permission from Moscow — and then added, “Moscow is silent.”That phrase haunted Putin and gave rise to a lasting personal conviction. As he said in the year he became president of Russia, “only one thing works in such circumstances — to go on the offensive. You must hit first, and hit so hard that your opponent will not rise to his feet.” In his view, “we would have avoided a lot of problems if the Soviets had not made such a hasty exit from eastern Europe.”Putin also believed that Soviet republics should not simply have been allowed to declare themselves sovereign, independent states. As he put it in 2014, that separation meant that “millions of people went to bed in one country and awoke in different ones, overnight becoming ethnic minorities”. In a 2017 estimate, the Pew Research Center put the number of ethnic Russians living outside Russia in other former Soviet republics to be 25mn. In Putin’s eyes, this made Russians “the biggest ethnic group in the world to be divided by borders”. Left out of his account was the role of Joseph Stalin’s forced deportations and resettlements in creating that reality.Now war has come and it is clear that back in 1989 and 1990, amid all the celebrating, we missed somethingAs the 30th anniversary of Soviet collapse and Ukrainian independence neared last year, in hindsight it is clear that Putin decided, nominally on behalf of those “ethnic” Russians, to end Ukraine’s capacity for moving closer to the west. He correctly sensed that Kyiv, having failed to gain a berth in the post-cold-war security order, would have few options if Russia were to use force to assert its dominance. He also may have sensed an opportune moment of weakness in the west, with the US distracted by domestic discord, Britain consumed by Brexit and the woes of prime minister Boris Johnson, France facing an election, and Germany lacking former chancellor Angela Merkel — who, having grown up in East Germany and speaking fluent Russian, had far too good an understanding of Putin for his own comfort.Now war has come and it is clear that back in 1989 and 1990, amid all the celebrating, we missed something. For a long time, we rightly trumpeted the ways that dissolution of the line dividing cold war Europe created freer societies and wider life choices for central and eastern European nations and new post-Soviet states. The focus was, justifiably, on those people for whom that line’s erasure represented a triumph. Certainly that is my memory of that happy time.Looking back now, however, it appears that it was all too easy to forget the people who had lost out — above all Putin. It was also easy to forget that Russia, despite all the woes after the Soviet collapse, remained a world-class power, with a sprawling landmass, abundant natural resources, an enormous military and a strategic nuclear arsenal. And it was easy to ignore how seriously Putin was taking the conflict with the west over Ukraine’s future, and how much he wanted to recreate Moscow’s line of control.The outbreak of war in Ukraine means, among many other consequences, that we need to view the cold war’s end through a new lens. Its most lasting consequence, tragically, may not be the optimism that it inspired in the many, but the damage that it did to the one: Vladimir Putin. To assuage his grievance about the loss of Soviet status and above all Ukraine, he has commenced a major land war in Europe — and written the requiem for the post-Soviet peace.© Mary Elise Sarotte 2022Mary Elise Sarotte is a professor at Johns Hopkins University and the author of the new book ‘Not One Inch: America, Russia, and the Making of Post-Cold War Stalemate’, from which parts of this essay have been adaptedEstonian prime minister Kaja Kallas on the Baltic state’s precarious position and why many European nations misread MoscowAs the Kremlin attempts to reassert control over its neighbours, Ukrainian historian Serhii Plokhy uncovers the deep roots of the crisisLetter in response to this article:West’s economic meddling has made Putin possible / From Rebecca Tinsley, Network for Africa, London W11, UK
157  US efforts to inflict economic pain on Russia in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine are hamstrung by the risk of driving a damaging increase in oil prices.The US is the world’s largest producer of crude oil and natural gas, but for oil, in particular, prices are set on the global market. Early on Thursday, Brent crude topped $105 a barrel as Russian forces invaded Ukraine.When US president Joe Biden announced a number of new sanctions on Moscow hours later, he explicitly spared Russia’s energy trade. Oil prices quickly shed earlier gains.“I will do everything in my power to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump. This is critical to me,” Biden said.The comments spotlight one of the most vexing problems facing the Biden administration and European leaders as they rely on sanctions to deal with Russian president Vladimir Putin: can they put sufficient pressure on Moscow without strangling oil and gas, the linchpin of the country’s economy?Sanctions announced on Thursday by the US and Europe hit some of Russia’s largest banks and wealthy Russian individuals, and also sought to cut off western exports of advanced technologies.But for now, they are not directly aimed at Russia’s sales of oil and gas, which accounted for about half of the country’s export earnings last year and have been buoyed by the recent commodity price rally. Russia is the world’s third-largest crude oil producer and the second-largest gas producer.The US on Wednesday imposed sanctions on the company that owns the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline between Russia and Germany, but the project is not yet operational.US officials have been careful to avoid stoking the oil rally as domestic petrol prices rise above $3.50 a gallon to seven-year highs. The surge in prices at the pump has been a big driver of inflation in the US, which was running at 7.5 per cent in January.“We think we can impose significant harm on the Russian economy without disrupting energy markets and without hitting energy transaction flow,” a senior administration official said at a briefing earlier this week. “There is no need for increased panic in the market.”High prices and depleted fuel inventories around the world offer little room to manoeuvre, analysts said.Oil prices could rise to $130 a barrel or higher if Russian supply is disrupted by the Ukraine war, predicted Louise Dickson, an analyst at Rystad Energy, a consultancy.Jeff Currie, head of commodities at Goldman Sachs, said in a research note on Thursday that just the “uncertainty around potential sanctions” was creating “a potential supply shock”. Currie said the bank forecast “a clear risk” of crude prices rising to $125 a barrel even without direct oil sanctions.The fog of economic war could spook some banks and traders from doing business with Russian companies despite White House efforts to leave oil and gas flows untouched, Kevin Book, an analyst at ClearView Energy Partners, warned in a note on Thursday.Russia’s main international crude grade, known as Urals, traded at a record discount to Brent crude on Thursday, according to data from S&P Global Platts — a sign that some buyers were shunning Russian oil given the uncertainty around sanctions and transacting with the country’s companies.“Even narrowly constructed sanctions could have unintended consequences for energy prices,” said Book.The Biden administration has faced intense political pressure over fuel costs. A Reuters poll this week showed that although there was broad support for imposing economic sanctions on Russia, only about half of Americans supported measures that would result in higher petrol prices.Biden said on Thursday that he was working with other big oil-consuming countries to potentially release crude from emergency stockpiles around the world, in what would be the second such move since November.The president has also pressed domestic companies to accelerate oil production, even as he pursues an ambitious climate agenda.But the largest US shale oil producers in recent weeks have promised investors they would keep output growth in check and funnel any influx of cash from higher prices to dividends and share buybacks.Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, the largest producer in the Permian shale basin in Texas and New Mexico, told analysts last week that even “at $100 oil, $150 oil, we’re not going to change our growth rate. We think it’s important to return cash back to the shareholders.”Although Biden said he wanted to keep fuel prices from rising, he argued that imposing economic pain on Russia was necessary. “This aggression cannot go unanswered. If it did, the consequences for America would be much worse. America stands up to bullies. We stand up for freedom,” he said in his remarks on Thursday.Future energy sanctions could not be ruled out if fighting in Ukraine continues to escalate, said Jonathan Elkind, a senior researcher at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy and a former energy official in the administration of US president Barack Obama.“While no administration likes to be leading at a time of high energy prices. the circumstances that have unfolded in Europe really fundamentally alters the calculus,” he said. “We’re in ‘Who the heck knows?’ zone at this point.”
158  US president Joe Biden and UK prime minister Boris Johnson launched tough new financial sanctions against Russia as if unleashing military-grade retaliation. But there was nothing in either package that Vladimir Putin cannot have already discounted as an acceptable price for invading Ukraine.Indeed, the failure of the US and UK to persuade the EU to push Russia out of the Swift payments alliance exposed a failure of the west’s own common purpose.Chancellor Olaf Scholz was the main sticking point. He evidently fears that if German utilities cannot pay Gazprom using Swift, the Russian energy giant would turn off the taps. Thanks to a series of energy policy errors by German politicians, half of Germany’s homes depend on Russian gas for heating.Scholz’s reticence sets the stage for a three-way tussle via the international payments industry.Swift-obsessed politicians such as Johnson apparently believe two fallacies. First, that the removal of Iran from Swift in 2012 was solely responsible for economic woes that earlier sanctions also triggered. Second, that Swift is an end-to-end payments machine.In reality, Swift is only a messaging system, albeit one embodying the mutual trust and common standards of its 11,500 users. Transactions are possible without it. They are just a lot clumsier.As befits its communitarian character, Swift is a Belgian co-operative. Neither Biden nor Johnson has the power to directly exclude Russia. But their financial sanctions could, in time, achieve that end via the chilling effect of US state disapproval.Thanks to the value of its markets and the extraterritorial reach of its prosecutors and regulators, the US exerts huge sway over the world’s banks. This means a US prohibition on dealing with Russian lenders with $1tn in assets will be widely observed beyond US borders. The worthy targets, following feeble US and UK sanctions on tiddlers earlier this week, now include Sberbank. This is Russia’s largest lender, albeit one largely focused on domestic retail business.The US is also banning several Russian banks, directly or indirectly, from clearing dollar trades on Wall Street. Johnson has promised to chip in with a prohibition on Russian transactions in sterling via the City of London.Even bank risk officers, hardly famous for prudent forethought, will realise that dealing in dollars for Russians in London is now unwise. This matters because approximately 40 per cent of the value of the world’s foreign exchange transactions, about $2.7tn daily, go through the Square Mile, according to data from the Bank for International Settlements and the Bank of England. The bulk of these feature the dollar on at least one side of the deal.I am told Russians are already transacting heavily in offshore dollars in places such as Latvia, Cyprus and Israel. “We have been KYCed to death in London,” complains one, referring to Know Your Customer regulations targeted at money launderers. The shallower the market in which you transact, the greater the cost.Whether Russia will be able to go on using Swift may depend on how much the idea scares big international banks, which also use the network and which value their relationship with US regulators. They played a role alongside the EU in throwing Iranian banks off Swift in 2012. However, big continental banks did not face countervailing pressure back then from their own national politicians to keep the Islamic Republic in Swift’s inclusive club.German, Austrian and Italian lawmakers will be taking an uncharacteristic interest in the internal politics of Swift from now on.Whatever the outcome, Russia is now a payments pariah. In order to go on sucking in more than $200bn in energy export earnings yearly, it will do what it has always done: create workarounds. The development of these alternatives, perhaps including an expansion of the Mir electronic payments system, will represent a further backward step for open markets and globalisation.If Putin is still in power then, he would doubtless be delighted.
159  One thing to start: Morgan Stanley has disclosed that the US Securities and Exchange Commission has been examining the bank’s block trading business since 2019 and the Department of Justice recently joined with its own investigation.As Vladimir Putin wages war in Ukraine, global markets are in turmoil — supply chains are rupturing, Russia’s currency and stock market are tumbling, and oil prices are on a volatile ride.The gaze has also turned inward for the world’s most powerful corporations, financial institutions and professional services firms as they grapple with their own ties to Russia amid an onslaught of global sanctions.Some of the west’s largest energy groups have found themselves inextricably intertwined with the crisis. One example is the UK oil major BP, which holds a near-20 per cent stake in Russian oil company Rosneft and whose chief Bernard Looney and his predecessor Bob Dudley sit on Rosneft’s board.Last year, the stake generated profits for BP of more than $2.4bn, from which it collected a dividend of $640mn. “Let’s not worry about things until they happen and who knows what’s going to happen,” Looney told investors several weeks ago regarding conflict in Ukraine. Time to worry, Bernard.That said, Rosneft has been under US and EU sanctions since 2014 — when Russia annexed Crimea — measures that haven’t propelled Looney or Dudley to cut links.The conflict has rippled through the European banking sector, dragging down shares in Italy’s UniCredit and France’s Société Générale, which both have consumer banking operations in Russia.Professional services firms have been hit, too. Management consultancies McKinsey & Company and Boston Consulting Group each have about 400 people working in Moscow.The UK’s magic circle law firms also have about 150 lawyers in Russia, while international law firms including CMS, Dentons and Baker McKenzie have shuttered their Ukraine offices and are working to transport staff to EU offices. Big Four accounting firm PwC advised its 750 staff in Ukraine to stay home on Thursday.Joe Biden’s administration is continuing to increase the pressure on Russia’s economy, severing ties between the US financial system and the country’s largest lenders Sberbank and VTB, along with three other midsize Russian institutions. Together, the sanctioned banks oversee about $1tn in assets.However, Biden’s administration refrained from cutting off Gazprombank, Russia’s third-largest lender. The state-controlled bank acts as the main facilitator of foreign payments for oil and gas, and if closed off from US dollars could mean severe consequences for Europe — which depends on Russia for 40 per cent of its natural gas supply.The story is moving fast as world leaders debate whether to eject Russia from the Swift international payments system, European football’s governing body prepares to relocate the Champions League final from St Petersburg, and global banks get ready to navigate a maze of new sanctions.Keep tabs on the corporate fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine here.The few investors excited by Germany’s largest-ever spin-off — the separation of Siemens Energy from its parent company in the autumn of 2020 — were interested not in the legacy fossil fuels business itself. They were after its majority stake in turbine maker Siemens Gamesa, a world leader in offshore wind.An assessment of the company’s market cap after its lacklustre stock market debut showed that shareholders valued Siemens Energy’s gas and power contracts, responsible for two-thirds of its revenues, at minus €2bn.So it has come as a shock to investors, and indeed to Siemens Energy’s management, that the supposedly future-proof Gamesa has blown an €8bn hole in its balance sheet. That spells trouble for both the spun-off company and its largest shareholder, Siemens.Some of the problems at Gamesa were unique, such as a failure to predict snow in Norway. But the bigger concern for Siemens Energy is that soaring raw materials prices are threatening to blow the entire wind energy industry off course.At a fiery annual general meeting on Thursday, Siemens Energy boss Christian Bruch insisted that although it would take time to turn round Gamesa, “the wind market is intact”. But privately, the warning from Siemens Energy insiders is stark. “There is no profit pool today,” one person told the FT’s Joe Miller.“If the market [remains] like this we will have no western company going into [wind energy]. The Chinese will eventually come through with their Belt and Road Initiative, and the next thing they will do is export onshore wind [turbines], at no matter what price,” they added.It’s a wake-up call for green-minded investors and, given the indefinite suspension of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline on Tuesday, a timely one too.Last year, HSBC relocated four of its top executives from London to Hong Kong. The moves weren’t coincidental for a bank that earned more than half of its group profits in 2020 from the territory, where it was founded by British merchants in 1865.The geopolitical tightrope HSBC had been walking between the west and China has been worn thinner by growing geopolitical tensions over Hong Kong. However, its chief executive Noel Quinn was determined not to “flip-flop” on the lender’s China strategy.HSBC may have already doubled down on Hong Kong, but others are reconsidering their operations in the territory.An exodus of top banking executives have poured out of Asia’s once-glittering financial hub as its “zero-Covid” pursuit has made doing business extremely tricky. The territory has banned travel from nine countries including the US and UK, and requires quarantine periods of up to 21 days for international arrivals.The latest to skip town is Bank of America’s Asia-Pacific co-head of global capital markets Craig Coben, who will return home to London and retire, a source told the FT. The US lender was identified last month as the first of its Wall Street peers to formally review whether to relocate jobs out of Hong Kong in favour of up-and-coming Singapore.Dual-listed Prudential, which recently announced plans to relocate its next chief executive to Hong Kong as part of a strategic shift towards Asia may now walk that decision back given the travel restrictions. JPMorgan Chase bankers have also begun to file out, per Bloomberg.HSBC had a promising fourth quarter, as pre-tax profits nearly doubled to $2.7bn after the bank sold its retail business and focused on wealth management. But it could soon see the business’s affluent client base begin to disintegrate, Lex cautions, as more top-tier financiers pack their bags.Bollywood or bust Netflix’s bold ambition to amass 100mn subscribers in India has fallen flat.

160  The writer is chief executive of Deutsche Börse“Relance, puissance, appartenance” (recovery, strength, belonging) is the motto of France’s presidency of the European Council. It evokes EU sovereignty, the future of our society, values and community and the future of the bloc as a thriving global business destination.With this, one familiar project has returned to the top of the agenda — capital markets union. Although we have been discussing it for years, little progress has been made — whether due to a lack of will or ability, I am not sure. But if we are serious about CMU, we have urgently to change our strategy.With or without CMU, Europe’s capital markets are vital to its future. But despite years of effort to build them up, the EU is falling behind. Last year there were approximately 2,700 initial public offerings globally, yet less than 12 per cent of those were in the EU, while more than 60 per cent were in the US and Asia.The number of listed companies in Europe is also declining, while the EU’s capital markets remain highly fragmented. Moreover, with the UK’s departure from the EU, Europe has lost an important voice in their favour.With the City of London launching regular consultations on the future of its capital markets, the EU must realise that its priorities — notably digitisation and the “green transition” — cannot be achieved without better and deeper capital markets. The investment required is too great to be borne by banks alone. Individual countries are equally overburdened.I welcome, therefore, the stated aim of Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, who has said that, to fund the green transition, for every publicly invested euro, we must secure at least €3 of private investment. The global success of the future EU economic model can only be ensured if we take this formula seriously.But if Le Maire’s ambition is to be realised, a cultural shift is required. We must stop demonising the capital markets, an attitude all too prevalent in certain quarters in Europe — and entirely unlike the one that prevails in the UK and US.While this is in part a lingering effect of the 2008 financial crisis, its roots go much deeper. So it is imperative to attract wider society to the capital markets. The European Commission’s push for a retail financial strategy is a useful step in this direction, as it requires increased investment in economic and financial education. We need to empower our citizens to invest safely and sensibly and provide them with a range of attractive products and incentives to do so.A central part of this is a commitment to transparency and integrity. We need to stop fooling ourselves: we are a long way from having a transparent capital market in the EU. Transparency across EU equity markets is now significantly lower than before the introduction of the Mifid regulations — only around 35-50 per cent of the trading volume is executed on transparent trading venues. Today, more than 10 years after the financial crisis, 92 per cent of EU derivatives trading is over the counter. And we have created an EU bond markets regime where a mere 3 per cent of bond instruments are considered transparent.We have a regulatory framework that not only continues to tolerate conflicts of interest and opacity, but actively encourages them.Effective EU capital markets also need strong major exchanges capable of competing globally, especially with their US counterparts. Europe will never be properly “sovereign” without them. Anything else would be to gamble with the economic future of our continent.Taking action now is critical. The historic transformation of global capital markets through environmental, social and governance investing and digitisation creates a unique opportunity. Europe is a world leader in the creation of an ESG framework and we can exploit this leadership to shape future-oriented and competitive capital markets.EU exchanges and market infrastructure operators are the backbone of CMU and our future sovereignty. But our exchanges need scale to live up to this responsibility and to equip themselves to stand up to global competition. We need policies and a regulatory framework that acknowledge this reality and aid our evolution, rather than hamper it.For us to succeed in this endeavour, the confidence of Europeans in the capital market must be strengthened. This, in turn, requires us to guarantee transparency, integrity and stability — which we can only do if our efforts are based on a strong EU-wide financial market infrastructure.
161  After air and missile strikes, Russian troops launched attacks from Ukraine’s northern border with Belarus, across its eastern frontier and in the south from Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula that Moscow invaded and annexed in 2014.Columns of tanks and armoured vehicles rolled into the country from all three fronts, while fighter jets, airborne troops and dozens of helicopters attacked a critical airport outside of Kyiv. Senior western officials warned that Russia was assembling an “overwhelming force” to take the capital, potentially within days.Two large explosions were heard in central Kyiv in the early hours of Friday morning, a Financial Times reporter witnessed, as the capital came increasingly under attack by Russian forces. Ukraine’s land forces said Russia fired at peaceful areas of Kyiv but the strike was intercepted.Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said that “enemy saboteur groups” had entered Kyiv and that Russia planned to assassinate him.“According to our information, the enemy has identified me as the number-one target. My family is the number-two target. They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,” he said.Shocked by the ferocity of Russia’s assault, world leaders addressed their nations to condemn what they cast as the most momentous challenge to the postwar order in Europe for 80 years. “[Putin] has much larger ambitions than Ukraine,” said Joe Biden, US president. “He wants to, in fact, re-establish the former Soviet Union. That’s what this is about.”Biden said the US and its allies would impose new sanctions in response to Russia’s aggression. “Putin chose this war and now he and his country will bear the consequences.”Roads out of Kyiv were gridlocked with civilians fleeing the capital, while city authorities ordered residents to seek refuge in basements and bomb shelters. Zelensky called on “everyone with battle experience” to take up arms and resist forces that had invaded “just as fascist Germany did”. He later ordered a full mobilisation of the military.The Ukrainian president said 137 Ukrainians were killed in Thursday’s fighting. Russian forces lost more than 30 tanks, up to 130 armoured vehicles, seven planes and six helicopters, according to the commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, Valeriy Zaluzhny. He estimated that between 30,000 and 60,000 Russian troops were in Ukrainian territory. Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence said that as of 3am on Friday, its forces had killed roughly 800 “enemy” personnel since the Russian offensive started. Putin and Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, discussed the invasion in a telephone call, the Kremlin said, the Russian president’s first conversation with a western leader since he recognised separatist states in eastern Ukraine and launched a full assault on the country.The leaders had a “serious and frank exchange of views about the Ukraine situation”, the Kremlin said in a readout. “Vladimir Putin gave extensive explanations of the causes and circumstances of why a decision was taken to launch a special military operation. It was decided to remain in contact.”A French official said Macron called Putin just before an EU summit in Brussels to demand “the immediate halt of Russian military operations and reminded him that Russia was exposing itself to massive sanctions”.In a televised address, Zelensky, who said he remained in Kyiv, thanked western leaders for their support but questioned their willingness to go further. “Who is ready to fight with us? Honestly, I don’t see anyone.I’m asking them, are you with us?”Alarm over the conflict ripped through international markets, with the price of European natural gas contracts jumping as much as 70 per cent to €142 per megawatt hour. Russia is an important producer of raw materials, with Europe relying on the country for about a quarter of its oil and more than a third of its gas.Brent crude prices rose to more than $105 a barrel, the first time the international oil benchmark has crossed the $100 threshold since 2014. The price dropped back to about $99 after the Biden administration announced a raft of sanctions that focused on Russia’s financial sector, rather than its energy industry, which is an important supplier to many western countries.But in Asia on Friday morning, oil prices climbed back above $100, with Brent crude up 2.6 per cent to $101.61 a barrel.The pattern of Russian incursions suggested its forces aimed to advance south towards Kyiv while simultaneously encircling Ukraine’s forces in the east by cutting through the country from the Russian border to the Black Sea. Ukrainian authorities reported scores of casualties in fierce fighting across the country. One senior US defence official said the initial campaign was “clearly designed to take key population centres”, with the intention of ultimately “decapitating the government” in Kyiv. Russian forces pushed for control over territory around the regions of Chernihiv in the north, Kherson in the south and the major north-eastern city of Kharkiv, which saw some of the heaviest fighting on the first day of clashes. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato secretary-general, condemned Russia for shattering the peace in Europe with a “brutal act of war”. In an emergency meeting, the US-led military alliance decided to deploy additional land, air and sea forces to bolster its eastern flank with Russia. A US defence official said the Pentagon would send 7,000 more troops to Germany. The purpose of the deployment was to “reassure Nato allies, deter Russian aggression and be prepared to support a range of requirements in the region”.In an address on state television on Thursday morning, Putin said that Moscow would “de-Nazify” Ukraine and “defend” victims of “genocide”, despite there being no evidence of such crimes.Europe braced for a humanitarian crisis in the aftermath of the invasion. Slovakia said that its border with Ukraine was open for “all persons fleeing this war”. The US has warned that as many as 5mn Ukrainians could be displaced.The Russian assault began with missiles, launched from land and sea, hitting about a dozen airfields across the country, including Kyiv’s airport Boryspil and facilities in the Black Sea port city of Odesa. US defence officials estimated that 100 missiles were fired in the initial assault.By late morning, dozens of Russian helicopters had begun attacking Hostomel airport in a suburb north of Kyiv.Ukraine’s ambassador to Japan, Sergiy Korsunsky, described in a press conference in Tokyo on Friday an early encounter at a Black Sea outpost known as Serpent Island, or zmiinyi in Russian, that he said was a “symbol of resistance”.The envoy played a recording of a radio conversation between Russian naval vessels and the lightly armed Ukrainian border guards stationed on the island. Korsunsky said the Russian vessels had twice demanded the Ukrainians lay down their weapons and surrender or be destroyed.“The answer was ‘go fuck yourself’,” said Korsunski, adding that the Russians then obliterated the structures on the island, killing the 13 guards stationed there.Brussels will present “massive and targeted” measures to EU leaders for their approval at an extraordinary summit later on Thursday, said Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president.Russia claims, based on little or no evidence, that Ukraine is attacking the separatist-held territories in the Donbas, where more than 14,000 people have died in a conflict that broke out after the annexation of Crimea.Nato will hold an emergency summit of its members’ 30 leaders on Friday to discuss what the alliance’s head described as Russia’s “deliberate, cold-blooded and long-planned invasion” of Ukraine.You are seeing a snapshot of an interactive graphic.

162  EU leaders backed a far-reaching package of sanctions targeting Russia on Thursday night following President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, as the bloc faces the biggest security threat in Europe since the second world war.The proposals would freeze some transactions with a wide range of Russian banks, bar a number of state-owned companies from launching new listings on stock exchanges in the bloc and stop Russian nationals from making big deposits in EU banks.The measures would also ban sales of aircraft and jet parts to Russia, block the sale of equipment needed to upgrade oil refineries and suspend visa-free travel for Russian diplomatic passport holders.The bloc is discussing further measures as it seeks to ratchet up the pressure on Putin after Russian forces moved into Ukraine.“We will hold the Kremlin accountable. The package of massive and targeted sanctions European leaders approved tonight clearly demonstrates that,” said Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, after the meeting. “It will have maximum impact on the Russian economy and on the political elite.”Diplomats will work through detailed legislation with the aim of getting the package enshrined in law as soon as Friday. The Russian foreign ministry has pledged to respond “harshly” to EU sanctions.Von der Leyen said the measures would be comprised of five “pillars” targeting the financial sector — with 70 per cent of Russia’s banking market affected — as well as energy, transport and visa policy. A set of export controls would also hit the country’s high-tech sector, undermining its ability to build a “prosperous future”, she added.According to plans seen by the Financial Times, the measures would extend the list of Russian banks blocked from EU financing to Alfa-Bank and Bank Otkritie, two private lenders, on top of five state-owned institutions. Lending and the purchase of securities would be prohibited in several state-owned Russian enterprises, including companies in the aerospace and defence sector, shipping and shipbuilding.Russians would not be able to make any new deposits of more than €100,000 in EU banks.The measures also contained a wide-ranging regime of export controls on goods that can be used by the military as well as an assortment of advanced technology items including electronics, sensors, telecommunications, marine applications and lasers.The EU is working on further measures to target individual oligarchs, which will require legal changes that would allow it to act against a broader range of people.Emmanuel Macron, president of France, who held a heated conversation with Putin on Thursday, said his government would soon introduce its own measures on individuals and assets. The EU package was an initial response that would inflict a “severe cost” on Russia, he added, warning that the Russian president wanted to bring Europe back to an era of “empire and confrontation”.The EU has also demanded a round of sanctions against Belarus, which permitted Russian troops to operate from its territory, amid complaints from Baltic states that the existing regime contained too many loopholes.Mark Rutte, prime minister of the Netherlands, said the sanctions were the toughest he had witnessed in more than a decade in office. “This is already a huge package — a maximalist package [the likes of which] I haven’t seen since I’ve been part of sanctions discussions,” he told reporters.The EU’s measures, which have been in development for months in conjunction with the US, UK, Canada and other allies, did not directly target Putin or Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, diplomats said.Nor did they cut Russian banks from the Swift international payments system, although some member states are pushing for this to be discussed as part of further penalties. “You have to keep something up your sleeve,” said one official.EU leaders also considered the bloc’s wider response to the attack, including the evolving humanitarian and refugee crisis on its borders. Romania has reported that thousands of people have lined up at the country’s checkpoints with Ukraine. Poland and Hungary also reported an increase in arrivals.
163  Stocks on Wall Street shifted violently on Thursday, with the Nasdaq Composite registering its biggest intraday swing since the throes of the pandemic in March 2020, after Russian president Vladimir Putin launched a military invasion of Ukraine.The benchmark S&P 500 stock index closed 1.5 per cent higher, rebounding from a loss of as much as 2.6 per cent, in a sign that hedge funds were getting out of many popular positions and unwinding bets that stocks would fall, traders said.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index had rallied 3.3 per cent by the closing bell, reversing a 3.4 per cent loss earlier in the day.Hedge funds were closing out short trades, bets that a stock or exchange traded fund would decline in value, as they sought to reduce their exposure given the market volatility, the head of one of the largest trading desks on Wall Street said.To cover those short positions, funds bought the underlying stocks and ETFs they had bet against, helping to buoy the entire market, traders said. Several pointed to the advance in prices of heavily shorted stocks, including Ark Invest’s flagship Innovation ETF, as a sign of the move by hedge funds.The rebound in the US stood in contrast to a stinging sell-off in European and Russian stocks, as well as a shift into low-risk government debt, following Russia’s invasion in the early hours of Thursday morning. The regional Stoxx 600 share index closed down 3.3 per cent, in a technical correction — defined as a 10 per cent decline from a recent peak — with heavy falls across bourses in Germany, France, Italy and the UK.The escalation of the conflict in Ukraine is dominating the global market narrative because of the potential for Russia’s energy and resources being cut out of global supply chains, exacerbating already high inflation and prompting central banks to respond with rapid interest rate rises.“A situation which seriously chokes off energy supplies from Russia will affect the world as a negative supply shock,” said Sunil Krishnan, head of multi-asset funds at Aviva Investors.Ahead of a meeting by EU leaders on Thursday to decide on further sanctions against Russia, Brent crude oil rose as much as 9.2 per cent to $105.79, crossing the $100 threshold for the first time since 2014.Brent pared most of those gains to settle up 2.3 per cent at $99.08 after US President Joe Biden laid out fresh sanctions against Russia that spared energy exports.“A big inflation impact in the US and Europe means central banks could raise interest rates further than anticipated, which brings a risk of economic stagflation,” said Trevor Greetham, head of multi-asset at Royal London Asset Management.The US Federal Reserve is expected to embark on a string of rate rises starting next month — having pinned borrowing costs close to zero since March 2020 — in response to consumer price inflation hitting a 40-year high. Traders on Thursday, however, bet that the uncertainty and market volatility would encourage the central bank to be slightly less aggressive in the near term, with the likelihood of a 0.5 percentage point increase in March no longer priced into markets.Russia’s benchmark Moex index plummeted as much as 45 per cent, before paring back to a 26 per cent loss.The rouble weakened to almost 90 per dollar, a record low against the US currency, and later traded at Rbs85.1.In government debt markets, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note fell 0.03 percentage points to 1.96 per cent as the benchmark government debt instrument rose in price. German Bunds rallied, with the yield on the 10-year security, which sets borrowing costs across the eurozone, 0.07 percentage points lower at 0.15 per cent.Traders turned to derivatives markets as the market shifted, with more than 25mn US equity put option contracts changing hands on Thursday, among the 10 busiest days of put trading. Put contracts can pay-off if a security falls in price.The dollar index rose 0.9 per cent as market stress drove up demand for the reserve currency. The euro fell 0.9 per cent against the dollar to $1.12.In Asia, Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng index fell more than 3 per cent.Additional reporting by Robert Smith in London and Leo Lewis in Tokyo
164  US president Joe Biden imposed a raft of economic sanctions on Russian banks and oligarchs on Thursday as he promised to make Vladimir Putin pay dearly for invading Ukraine.But even with Russian troops bearing down on Kyiv, the package was missing the one punishment that many analysts regard as the most severe: ejecting Russia from the Swift international payments system.“The sanctions.on all their banks have equal consequences, maybe more consequences than Swift,” Biden said, defending the package. “It is always an option, but right now that’s not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take.”Western leaders are split on whether Russia should be removed from Swift, a move that would deliver a heavy blow to the country’s banks and its ability to trade beyond its borders.In a G7 call on Thursday, British prime minister Boris Johnson pushed “very hard” to remove Russia, according to officials, but he later admitted to MPs that it was “vital that we have unity” on the issue among western allies.Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau also backed removing Russia from Swift, according to a G7 official. One senior US official said Biden did not make any comment on the issue during the G7 meeting.But earlier on Thursday German chancellor Olaf Scholz warned that his country had reservations about such a move and so did the EU, according to officials close to sanctions negotiations. A German official declined to comment, saying only that “all options are still on the table”.Another G7 official said some members were reluctant because it would make it impossible to pay for Russian energy, which could indirectly cause rises in international energy prices. That is an acute concern in Washington, where Biden has said he does not want sanctions to raise petrol prices and hurt consumers.Some G7 members also fear that removing Russia from Swift would accelerate efforts by it and China to create rival payment systems that did not use the US dollar.As he announced the latest US sanctions on Thursday, Biden insisted they would still have a detrimental impact on the Russian economy.Those measures target a range of individuals and entities, including two banks, Sberbank and VTB. The Biden administration also imposed export control restrictions that will hurt the ability of Russian companies in the defence, aerospace and maritime sectors to obtain American technology.Biden also threatened that he would consider imposing sanctions on Putin, and that the Swift option remained on the table.“Putin’s aggression against Ukraine will end up costing Russia dearly, economically and strategically. We will make sure that Putin will be a pariah on the international stage,” he said.But Ukraine had been pushing for even stronger action. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s minister of foreign affairs, posted on Twitter: “Everyone who now doubts whether Russia should be banned from Swift has to understand that the blood of innocent Ukrainian men, women and children will be on their hands too.”Swift, a Belgian co-operative, is used by more than 11,000 banks and financial institutions worldwide and handles 42mn messages a day, facilitating trillions of dollars worth of transactions. Russia accounted for 1.5 per cent of transactions in 2020.“Swift is a neutral global co-operative set up and operated for the collective benefit of its community of more than 11,000 institutions in 200 countries,” the group said in a statement. “Any decision to impose sanctions on countries or individual entities rests solely with the competent government bodies and applicable legislators.”Being cut off from Swift would not prevent Russian banks from carrying out cross-border transactions, but doing so would become more costly and arduous. Foreign dealings would rely on the use of less-efficient communication tools, such as email and telex.It would also stymie Russia’s ability to recoup international profits from its oil and gas exports, which account for more than 40 per cent of its revenue.Johnson has faced criticism in the UK for imposing what critics called “peashooter” sanctions. He is now trying to push western colleagues to deploy very tough reprisals, which one G7 official said was an easy position to take because he knew that there was not enough support.Johnson’s spokesperson said Britain would “work with allies to shut off access to the Swift payment system”.Swift has long been considered as an option within the EU’s sanctions package, but it was not seen as a likely part of any early round of measures, and was instead held in reserve for extra deterrence. But the scale of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted a debate about whether to accelerate its use. While Baltic countries and Poland are among those advocating a hawkish line on Swift, other member states are warier.Milos Zeman, president of the Czech Republic, on Thursday said he wanted to impose harder EU sanctions on Russia, including ejecting its banks from Swift, arguing it was important to isolate Putin.
165  Joe Biden has significantly ratcheted up pressure on Russia’s economy by cutting off the country’s biggest bank, Sberbank, from the US financial system.Sberbank accounts for close to a third of Russia’s banking sector. The lender and four other financial institutions that the US targeted on Thursday oversee about $1tn in assets in total.“The sanctions we imposed exceed anything that’s ever been done,” the US president said on Thursday. “The sanctions we imposed have generated two-thirds of the world joining us. They are profound sanctions.”The sanctions, imposed in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, restrict Sberbank’s access to US dollar transactions. The US also froze assets at four other Russian banks including its second-biggest lender, VTB, as well as three midsize players, Bank Otkritie, Sovcombank OJSC and Novikombank.“What we’re doing is we’re trying to hit the Russian economy where we think it will hurt the most, and where we will limit the impact on the United States and our partners, but we also have the ability to escalate these steps against these institutions going forward,” said a senior US administration official.But the US stopped short of imposing such harsh restrictions on Gazprombank, Russia’s third-largest bank. The state-controlled lender is the main conduit for foreign payments for oil and gas.Cutting off Gazprombank from dealing in US dollars would have had significant repercussions for Europe, which relies on Russia for 40 per cent of its natural gas supply and 26 per cent of oil.Although Russian banks remained on the Swift payments system, Biden said there was still the option of cutting them from the global initiative that lies at the centre of international trade and facilitates trillions of dollars worth of transactions a day.World leaders are divided over whether to cut Russia from Swift, which would deliver a heavy blow to its banks and its ability to trade beyond its borders.Boris Johnson, UK prime minister, has pushed “very hard” for such a move, although he has faced resistance from Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, according to officials in both governments.“These sanctions will have a significant impact on Russia’s overall economy, and average Russians will feel the cost,” said Clay Lowery, executive vice-president at the Institute of International Finance.“These sanctions target Russia’s domestic financial system, causing bank runs and forcing Russia’s central bank to continue hiking rates. As a result, we are likely to see negative growth in an economy that has already been hindered by increasing isolationism,” he added.Earlier on Thursday, Johnson added VTB to Britain’s sanctions list but stopped short of including Sberbank. VTB accounts for 16.4 per cent of Russia’s banking assets, compared with Sberbank’s 32.6 per cent.“Sanctioning other retail banks like VTB and Sberbank will cause significant havoc but ordinary Russian citizens will also pay the price,” said Paul Feldberg, a partner in the investigations, compliance and defence group at law firm Jenner & Block.One in two Russians has an account at Sberbank. Cutting the bank’s access to dollar transactions will have a severe impact on the Russian economy’s ability to do business outside its borders.More than half of Russian exports are denominated in US dollars, down from 80 per cent at the end of 2013. That is equivalent to $300bn, or 19 per cent of gross domestic product, according to Fitch.Sberbank’s share price dropped more than 50 per cent on Thursday as the market expected Russia’s economy to suffer following its invasion of Ukraine and for the west to consider sanctions against its biggest banks.Sberbank said on Thursday night that its systems and offices were working as normal and that clients’ funds were wholly available to them.“Sberbank is closely studying new working conditions amid the sanctions related to correspondent accounts. The adopted restrictions do not affect the safety and availability of client funds,” it said. “Sberbank has all necessary resources, managerial experience and expertise for operating in the current environment.”Additional reporting by Aime Williams in Washington
166  Fears that a war could disrupt global energy supplies briefly sent Brent crude up as much as 9 per cent to $105.79 a barrel, although it later gave up much of that advance. Futures linked to TTF, Europe’s wholesale gas price, surged as much as 69 per cent to €142 per megawatt hour before the gains were trimmed to 40 per cent. The European gas price has risen from €16 a year ago.Russia is an important producer of raw materials, with Europe relying on the country for about a quarter of its oil and more than a third of its gas. It is also the world’s biggest supplier of wheat.Brent settled 2.3 per cent higher at $99.08 a barrel, after US President Joe Biden announced a flurry of sanctions that focused on Russia’s financial sector, rather than its energy industry.Amrita Sen of Energy Aspects, a consultancy, said “the fear of supply disruptions had gone away” after Biden decided not to impose energy related sanctions on Russia.“The west can’t afford energy sanctions given where oil and gas prices are,” she said.Analysts at S&P Global Platts said the effect of “physical disruption” to Russian gas flowing to Europe via Ukraine would be “extreme”, and possibly similar to the price jump in December when European wholesale gas prices rose above €180 MWh in response to cold weather and problems at French nuclear power plants. “Any disruption to Ukrainian transit flows would immediately tighten gas supply to Europe and drive spot prices higher,” they said.Opec, the oil producers’ cartel, is already struggling to meet its output targets as demand for crude rebounds following the easing of lockdown restrictions. This has pushed up prices, with analysts warning there is limited capacity to increase supplies if flows from Russia are affected by sanctions. The same is true in gas markets, where no single country can replace the kind of volume that Russia can supply.Russia’s state-owned gas producer Gazprom said on Thursday that exports through Ukraine to Europe were continuing. Gas in storage across the continent is already at a five-year low.“Oil and natural gas prices have become the crisis’ fear barometer,” said Norbert Rücker of Julius Baer. “Any disruption of flows between Russia and Europe, due to damage or sanctions, would drastically add to the already present supply scarcity.”Other commodity markets were also whipsawed by the Russian onslaught on Ukraine. Wheat futures in Chicago rose almost 6 per cent to $9.26 a bushel, the highest level since July 2012. Russia and Ukraine are leading exporters of the grain, producing 14 per cent of global wheat and accounting for just under 30 per cent of all wheat exports. The two countries are also large exporters of corn and sunflower oil.Fears rose over supply flows after news that Russia had blocked off the Azov, an inland sea connected to the Black Sea. Both Ukraine and Russia have loading ports, and the ban on commercial vessels from the Azov to the Black Sea would likely wreak havoc on grain and steel markets.“This is a really serious situation for agricultural markets,” said Dave Whitcomb at commodity specialist Peak Trading Research. “There are fundamental concerns around whether grains will flow out of the Black Sea states, and both wheat and corn markets are just on fire.” Metals prices also climbed on Thursday, with aluminium, used in everything from beer cans to cars, rising more than 3.5 per cent to a record high of $3,449 a tonne. Russia is a big producer of aluminium as well as copper, nickel, platinum and palladium. In 2018, the aluminium market was plunged into turmoil after the US slapped sanctions on Rusal and other companies linked to oligarch Oleg Deripaska. “Russia is a significant producer of commodities so overnight developments in eastern Europe could have material implications for global supply chains,” said Dominic O’Kane, analyst at JPMorgan. Elsewhere, the price of gold fluctuated. The precious metal gave up an advance of as much as 3.4 per cent. It fell 0.8 per cent to $1,893 a troy ounce late in the trading day in New York.The brief rise in gold offered little support to Polymetal. About 38 per cent was sliced off the market value of the Russian miner, which is a FTSE 100 constituent, as investors dumped the stock on concern about potential sanctions.“Polymetal believes that targeted sanctions on the company remain unlikely,” the group said in a statement. Another big loser was Evraz, the steelmaker controlled by Roman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea football club, and Alexander Abramov. Its shares fell roughly 30 per cent.

167  While Ukraine defends itself against a Russian invasion on the ground, a battle to protect the truth is raging online.The open-source intelligence community is on alert for fake news promoted by Russia, analysing videos that are being used to make Ukraine look the aggressor and persuade the Russian public the cause is just.The community suffered a setback hours before the full-scale invasion, with Twitter mistakenly suspending the accounts of open-source intelligence reporters. Twitter said a dozen had been flagged as containing manipulated or misleading media, but added it was “expeditiously reviewing these actions” and had reinstated many of the affected accounts.Bellingcat, the collective of open source and social media researchers, investigators and citizen journalists, is acting as a clearing house for videos and disinformation found by the community, putting its own stamp of approval on accurate sourcing and compiling a database of dubious footage from the front lines.Eliot Higgins, executive director of the Netherlands-based organisation, said on Thursday that the community was much better prepared compared to the annexation of Crimea in 2014, while Russian misinformation attempts remained unsophisticated.Just looking at the metadata in files can show how footage has been doctored, wrong dates have been claimed and locations altered, he told a US Foreign Press Association webinar. The metadata means fake videos come with “a blueprint for how they had made the fake”.Simple observation can also expose fake news. For example, this video blogger has been fooled that a Ukrainian IED attack has killed three civilians in a car. Researchers noted the scene had been staged, with bullet holes visible rather than ones caused by shrapnel, and the corpses showing signs of being previously autopsied, meaning they had probably been supplied by a local mortuary.Higgins said increased access to satellite imagery, combined with geolocation data, meant it was taking less time to debunk fake footage, the truth being discovered in as little as an hour now.Another organisation trying to expose what’s real is Dozhd. Check out Danny Leigh’s review of F@ck This Job, a documentary on the independent Russian TV channel that has consistently given a voice to Ukrainians.1. Alibaba sales growth slows Alibaba has reported its slowest quarterly sales growth since its 2014 public listing, as the Chinese ecommerce giant was hit by rising competition and Beijing’s regulatory crackdown on tech groups. Revenues grew only 10 per cent to Rmb243bn ($38bn) in the fourth quarter. It had never previously reported year-on-year quarterly revenue growth below 20 per cent.2. Netflix struggles in India Instead of its target of 100mn subscribers in India, Netflix is estimated to have only around 5mn and trails Amazon and Disney. Our analysis says the streaming service has been slow to address various India-specific issues, from pricing and distribution, to the importance of commissioning more shows in regional languages such as Tamil.3. DAZN reports big Covid losses DAZN, the sports streaming group backed by billionaire investor Leonard Blavatnik, racked up pre-tax losses of $1.3bn in the first year of the pandemic as coronavirus disrupted the sporting calendar. The group said it had suffered as customers ditched subscriptions when sports suspended play as the pandemic took hold.4. EU telco chiefs call for consolidation Two of Europe’s biggest telecoms groups, Deutsche Telekom and Spain’s Telefónica, posted stronger than anticipated revenues and profits driven by growth in their international businesses, as their chief executives called for more consolidation in Europe. José María Alvarez-Pallete López, Telefónica’s chief, said the number of telecoms companies in the region needed to be reduced because providers were struggling to cover the cost of heavy infrastructure investments.5. EU-US data wrangle tests digital sovereignty The Data Act unveiled by the European Commission this week still has a long way to go to become law, writes Richard Waters, but it could make life harder for US tech companies, even if they store and process all the data of their European customers in Europe. More immediately, a drumbeat of interventions by Europe’s national regulators, made under GDPR’s privacy rules, has threatened to slow transatlantic data transfers.In 2020, Google acquired Neverware, whose CloudReady operating system breathed new life into old computers.

It says it will revive ageing devices with a modern and fast operating system. Ars Technica tried it out successfully on a couple of old laptops.
168  Boris Johnson has outlined what he claimed was “the largest and most severe package of economic sanctions that Russia has ever seen” in response to Vladimir Putin’s full-scale military invasion of Ukraine.In a statement to MPs in the House of Commons, the UK prime minister described Russia’s president as a “bloodstained aggressor who believes in imperial conquest”.Russia’s biggest banks will be hit, Russian citizens will face limits on the deposits they can hold in UK bank accounts, high-tech exports to Russia will be curbed and Aeroflot will be banned from UK airspace.“These trade sanctions will constrain Russia’s military, industrial and technological capabilities for years to come,” he said. Belarus, which has supported the invasion, will be hit by the same measures.Johnson announced the package, which is part of a synchronised set of reprisals by the west over the invasion of Ukraine, shortly after talks with G7 leaders.“Overall, we’ll be imposing asset freezes on more than 100 new entities and individuals, on top of the hundreds we’ve already announced,” he said, as he laid out the 10-point sanctions plan.The measures include an asset freeze on all major Russian banks, with immediate action against Kremlin-controlled VTB, Russia’s second-biggest lender, which accounts for 16.4 per cent of the country’s bank assets. It has limited operations in the UK through its investment banking arm, VTB Capital.In a statement, VTB Capital said it was “taking all necessary measures to resolve the situation with each of our clients” and was “determined to continue co-operation with clients and partners in accordance with the law”.Legislation will be introduced on Tuesday to prohibit Russian companies from raising finance on UK markets and to stop Russia issuing sovereign debt on the London market.More than 100 individuals, entities and subsidiaries will also face asset freezes, including companies that Johnson said “support Putin’s war machine”. Five other oligarchs with close links to the Russian president will be targeted.There will be an immediate suspension of export licences for “dual use” items destined for Russia, including high-tech components used in sectors such as aerospace and the oil industry. Rostec, Russia’s biggest defence company, is also being targeted.Legislation to limit the amount of money that any Russian citizen can deposit in UK bank accounts will also be passed, although the maximum amount has not yet been agreed.Johnson said Britain was working with other western allies over shutting Russia out of the Swift bank payments mechanism, although a number of countries, including Germany, have reservations about the measure.The package goes far beyond the sanctions announced by Johnson earlier this week, which were widely criticised as too weak.Johnson said he would also bring forward in the next few weeks the long-awaited Economic Crime bill, which aims to crack down on “unexplained wealth” in the UK.The new package of sanctions was welcomed by Sir Keir Starmer, Labour opposition leader, who had been demanding tougher action against Moscow.Johnson told MPs the new powers would “enable us to ban Russian state and private companies from raising funds in the UK, banning dealing with their securities and making loans to them”.Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, on Thursday evening asked the country’s western backers to enforce a “no-fly” zone over his country. A Downing Street spokesman, asked if the UK would back that proposal, confirmed that “we are looking at all options in that space”.Meanwhile, 11 leftwing Labour MPs have been instructed to take their names off a Stop the War campaign letter in which they criticised Britain and Nato for provoking Putin ahead of the attack on Ukraine.Most of the MPs signalled they would obey the edict from the Labour leadership.

169  The former prime ministers of Italy and Finland and the ex-chancellor of Austria resigned from the boards of Russian companies on Thursday following Vladimir Putin’s full military invasion of Ukraine.Matteo Renzi, the former prime minister of Italy and a senator for the centrist Italia Viva party, walked away from Delimobil, Russia’s largest car-sharing service, founded by Italian businessman Vincenzo Trani, in response to Russia’s military action.Renzi told the Financial Times he emailed Delimobil’s board of directors on Thursday morning to communicate his resignation with immediate effect.Esko Aho, the former prime minister of Finland, quit the board of Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank, where he served for six years as an independent director and member of the supervisory board. Aho said it was his personal choice that had nothing to do with the bank.“It’s my personal decision, my personal conclusion,” he said. “I saw the challenges in my role because of the sanctions, it’s obvious that it will be difficult to be an active participant in this operation.”Sberbank declined to comment on his decision.Christian Kern, Austria’s former chancellor, said he had resigned from the board of Russian Railways (RZD) on Thursday morning with immediate effect.“RZD had now actually become part of Russian war logistics,” Kern told the Austrian newspaper Der Standard, adding: “I deeply regret this.My thoughts are with the victims of this senseless aggression.”Ernesto Ferlenghi, the chief of Eni in Russia, on Thursday resigned from his role as a board member of Federal Grid, the operator and manager of Russia’s unified electricity transmission grid system, a spokesperson for the Italian oil company told the FT.The resignations underline the pressure on members of the western business and political elite who sit on corporate boards of Russian groups, as President Vladimir Putin launched what could be the biggest military operation in Europe since the second world war.Other former European politicians and public officials with ties to Russian corporate boards include Germany’s former chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who sits on the board of Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft and has been nominated to join the board of Gazprom, the Russian gas supplier.Schröder said on LinkedIn that the war must be ended as soon as possible. “That’s the responsibility of the Russian government,” he said.The former German chancellor said there had been “many mistakes” made in the relationship between Russia and the west “on both sides” but, he added, “even Russian security interests do not justify the use of military means”.He said sanctions were necessary, but “the remaining political, economic and civil society connections that exist between Europe and Russia” should not be broken. “Despite the dramatic situation we have today, these connections are the basis for the hope we all have: that a dialogue about peace and security on our continent will once again be possible,” he said.François Fillon, France’s former prime minister, sits on the board of petrochemicals group Sibur and state oil group Zarubezhneft. Fillon said in a statement on Thursday that he condemned the use of force in Ukraine, but added that he had also warned for years that the west was not taking Russian concerns over Nato’s expansion seriously enough.“This attitude has led us today to a dangerous confrontation that could have been avoided,” Fillon said. He praised recent French diplomatic efforts on Russia and said they should continue.Karin Kneissl, a former Austrian foreign minister, sits on the board of Rosneft.Trani, the founder of Delimobil, is also the head of the Italy-Russia chamber of commerce, the group that promoted a meeting between Putin and top Italian business leaders last month. The car-sharing company was set to go public at the end of last year but the listing was postponed because of the rising geopolitical tensions.Western executives, including BP chief executive Bernard Looney and Nord Stream 2 chief Matthias Warnig also sit on Russian corporate boards.Looney is a director of Rosneft, as is Bob Dudley, the former chief executive of BP.Warnig is the chair of the board of Transneft, the gas pipeline operator, and is a member of the supervisory board of VTB Bank.Lord Barker of Battle, a climate minister under former UK prime minister David Cameron, runs Rusal’s parent company En+.Additional reporting from Neil Hume and Tom Wilson in London, Richard Milne in Oslo, Erika Solomon and Guy Chazan in Berlin, and Sarah White in Paris
170  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine risks disrupting the export of critical commodities and rupturing supply chains, experts have warned, as multinational companies with operations in the region brace themselves for the fallout.An interruption of Russian exports would hit a wide range of industries, from fertiliser makers to food, automotive and aircraft manufacturers.Although Russia is best known as a big exporter of oil and gas, along with Ukraine, it is also a leading supplier of grains to the world. The two countries account for just under a third of the world’s wheat exports.The country is also an important source of metals used in manufacturing such as nickel, titanium, palladium and aluminium. Titanium is needed by aircraft and aero-engine manufacturers such as Boeing, Airbus and Rolls-Royce, while palladium is used in catalytic converters, electrodes and electronics.Michael Every, global strategist at Rabobank, said a combination of a prolonged conflict and tough sanctions could deliver the “same kind of shock as we had during Covid, when we rapidly found out that this elegant, concentrated, just in time structure we had built up is flawed”.The Financial Times contacted a range of companies dependent on supplies from Russia or with operations in the country. They all said they were monitoring the situation and prioritising the safety of employees. Several said they were protected from disruption in the short term, in part due to localised operations or higher stock levels of crucial materials.The energy industry was bracing itself for disruption after European gas futures jumped 50 per cent to €126 per megawatt hour, while oil climbed as much as 8 per cent, hitting the highest level since 2014.There is no evidence yet of disruption to supply, but with limited spare capacity to replace Russian oil or gas if flows falter, either due to sanctions or the conflict, prices are expected to climb.BP and TotalEnergies are the European oil producers with the highest exposure to Russia, according to investment bank Jefferies. BP owns almost 20 per cent of Rosneft, one of Russia’s largest oil producers. Last year, the stake generated profits of more than $2.4bn for BP from which it collected a dividend of $640mn.Russia is the world’s third-largest oil producer, pumping approximately 10mn barrels per day of crude. Trafigura, one of the world’s biggest commodity traders, said Russian crude was already trading at a discount in a sign that buyers had started to avoid Russian cargoes.Giacomo Romeo, an analyst at Jefferies, said one potential scenario was that Ukrainian pipelines would be damaged or Russia would halt the flow of gas through the country, which represented about 8 per cent of total exports to Europe last year. The soaring gas price is set to raise energy costs further for industrial consumers across Europe, which depends on Russia for roughly 40 per cent of its supply.Russia is also an important source of raw materials used in manufacturing, a sector where companies are braced for a rise in costs and potential interruption of supplies. Excluding China, Russia accounts for 14 per cent of the world’s aluminium production. Aluminium is used in everything from drinks cans to cars.Russia is a big producer of platinum and palladium, two precious metals that are used to remove toxic emissions from vehicle exhaust fumes.The financial strain inflicted by high gas prices, which jumped 30 per cent on Thursday, has already forced several big metal producers to curb output and mothball smelters.“The risk of a disruption in Russian platinum group supply is immense, with the country accounting for 12 per cent of global platinum mine supply and 40 per cent of global palladium supply,” said Natasha Kaneva, an analyst at JPMorgan.Ukraine-based Ferrexpo is the world’s third-largest exporter of high-grade iron ore pellets. The London-listed company said its mining and processing facilities, which are located in central Ukraine, were operating as normal although the government had suspended rail transportation. The group’s shares plunged 42.5 per cent on Thursday, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 250.Russia and Ukraine are key sources of chemical gases C4F6 and neon that are vital to semiconductor production. Chip manufacturers could be among the most badly affected if supplies from Ukraine are severely hampered for an extended period. Ukraine is one of the largest supplies of a number of noble gases used in chip making, particularly the neon used in lasers that etch features on to chips.A handful of Ukrainian companies process neon, which is a byproduct of steel production in Russia. Richard Betzendahl, an independent consultant specialising in rare gases, said Ukraine produces a quarter of the world’s neon, the prices of which have tripled in the past six months after Chinese steel mills that produce the gas as a byproduct shut down for the Winter Olympics. Undersupply of xenon and krypton, also critical to semiconductor manufacturing, would deepen, he added.“It definitely is going to cause problems for semiconductor companies,” he said.Some of the largest chipmakers claimed their global supply chains were designed to withstand the sort of disruption that could come from an extended armed conflict.Micron, one of the largest memory chipmakers, said its neon was “primarily sourced and originates from various suppliers” in other countries. It also said it was working with suppliers under long-term contracts to make sure it did not face shortages, and that it had “appropriate inventories” to keep operating.Intel, the largest US chipmaker, also pointed to its “diverse, global supply chain”, adding: “We do not expect any impact to our supply chain.”However, neither company would say what proportion of their neon supplies still come from Ukraine, or how long they could continue their normal manufacturing operations if supplies were disrupted.Western banks have been in retreat from Russia since the Kremlin’s invasion of Crimea in 2014. However, shares in the European lenders that have remained were hit hard on Thursday.Raiffeisen, the Austrian lender that generates more than a third of its profits in Russia, suffered a 20 per cent fall in its stock, while Italy’s UniCredit and France’s Société Générale each fell more than 11 per cent.SocGen’s Moscow-based subsidiary, Rosbank, has 550 branches and 3.1mn customers, while UniCredit operates 103 branches and 2mn customers in the country. Last month UniCredit ditched a plan that could have seen it acquire Otkritie Bank, a Russian state-controlled lender.Russia accounted for 6 per cent of UniCredit’s profits last year and 4 per cent of SocGen’s, according to JPMorgan. Raiffeisen, SocGen and UniCredit are Russia’s ninth, 10th and 11th biggest banks in Russia by assets respectively.The three banks each said they were closely watching developments, but insisted their Russian businesses were sufficiently capitalised to deal with mass customer withdrawals and that they were continuing to operate in a “fully compliant manner”.“Russia has gone through waves of sanctions and we have always adjusted our way of operating,” said UniCredit.SocGen said: “Rosbank is a Russian bank with mainly local activities and we are confident in our ability to ensure the activity for our clients and to adapt where necessary.”Law firms and consultancies with offices in Russia were drawing up contingency plans on Thursday for possible retaliation by Moscow to western sanctions.Consultancies McKinsey & Company and Boston Consulting Group each have 400 people working in Moscow while the UK-headquartered magic circle law firms have about 150 lawyers in Russia in total.Leaders at one large consulting firm were preparing for potential counter-sanctions by Russia against western companies, including a possible ban on them doing work in the country, said a person briefed on the matter. Another possibility was that staff or offices of these companies could become the targets of protests or civil disobedience in Russia, the person added.Large international law firms with a base in Ukraine, including CMS, Dentons and Baker McKenzie, temporarily closed their Ukraine offices on Thursday morning and have been helping relocate staff to EU bases. Baker McKenzie, which claims on its website to have been the first global law firm to open in Ukraine, has 100 staff based in the region followed by CMS, which has 67 employees based in Kyiv.Dentons has said it was relocating lawyers from Ukraine to other offices if requested.Accounting and consulting firm PwC, which has three offices in Ukraine, said it was trying to keep its operations running “as normally as possible” but had advised its 750 staff in the country to stay at home on Thursday. Fellow accountant KPMG, which has 4,000 staff in Russia and 600 in Ukraine, said it “remains committed to maintaining its local presence”.“It’s absolutely unprecedented chaos behind the scenes getting people out,” said a person at another consulting firm.Ukraine is home to factories that make car parts, leaving it connected to the supply chains for both the Russian and the broader European auto industry.Mainstream international suppliers including Bosch and Aptiv have plants in the west of the country, along the border with Poland, which is a major automotive parts hub. The Bosch plant refurbishes components for the spare parts market, and does not supply car plants directly, a spokesman said on Thursday.Many of the other factories specialise in electrical cables, which rely on cheap labour and are owned by companies that have similar operations in north Africa, according to Ian Henry, an automotive production specialist at AutoAnalysis.“It is difficult to say currently how soon Ukraine will become the defining manufacturing issue rather than just another headache,” said Henry.Palladium supply, which is used in catalytic converters and semiconductors, as well as nickel for batteries, is a concern. And the rising price of nickel, which is also sourced from Indonesia and the Philippines, had already led carmakers to look at alternative materials for their electric car batteries, according to Dominic Tribe, a supply chain specialist at the consultancy Vendigital.Several carmakers also have factories in Russia itself, including Renault, Stellantis, Toyota, Kia and Nissan. Renault, which owns the country’s largest carmaker Avtovaz, has the most exposure. Its Russian subsidiary has two factories, and Renault has its own plant in Moscow. The French carmaker accounts for just under a third of the vehicles sold in the country.Luca de Meo, chief executive, told the FT last week that the company was drawing up contingency plans to keep parts flowing to the sites in the event of sanctions or disruption. Between 10 and 20 per cent of parts that go to Avtovaz plants are imported, while for Renault’s Moscow facility the figure is between 30 and 40 per cent.Some of Renault’s Russia-based suppliers include France’s Valeo, which has a factory east of Moscow that makes some transmission systems and other parts. Valeo on Thursday said it was monitoring the situation.Stellantis is the only car company with a base in Russia that exports a significant volume of vehicles to Europe. The Jeep and Fiat owner had planned to begin producing vans for export at Kaluga, about 120 miles south of Moscow, to meet growing demand.Earlier this week Carlos Tavares, chief executive of Stellantis, said the group could divert work back to Europe if it faces export bans or is unable to get parts for the factories. “If we cannot supply the plants.we have either to transfer that production to other plants or just limit ourselves and increase the price,” he said.Western grain traders, food companies and some brewers have operations in Ukraine, a leading producer of grains and sunflower oil. Several suspended operations when Russian troops invaded Ukraine.Mondelez, the maker of Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies, said it was suspending operations at its two Ukrainian factories in Trostyanets and Vyshhorod, which make a range of products including local brands such as Jubilee biscuits and Korona chocolate.Carlsberg, the world’s third-largest brewer and maker of Kronenbourg 1664, said work at all three of its breweries in Ukraine had halted. “We have suspended the work at our breweries in Zaporizhzhya and Kyiv and have asked our employees to remain at home and follow the instructions from the authorities. Our third brewery in Lviv is temporarily closed due to disruption in the supply of natural gas,” the Danish group said.Cargill, the US agricultural trading group that owns the majority of a grain terminal near Odesa on the Black Sea, said: “We are working to determine if there are disruptions or impacts to our operations in the region. We do have contingency plans in place because there is still a great deal of uncertainty.”The US company had to abandon its sunflower crushing plant in Donetsk in 2014 after armed people took it over.Nestlé, the world’s largest food company, has sent home its almost 5,800 staff in Ukraine. The Swiss group said it had “temporarily closed” its three factories and service centre in Ukraine, recommending that employees stay at home and follow guidance from authorities.It said that as of Thursday afternoon “all our colleagues are safe and we remain in constant contact with them”.Reporting by Emiko Terazono, Sarah White, Peter Campbell, Michael O’Dwyer, Kate Beioley, Neil Hume, Tom Wilson, Harry Dempsey, Judith Evans, Richard Waters and Sylvia Pfeifer
171  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
172  The writer is a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic StudiesRussian troops have launched what appears to be a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with thousands of ground troops rapidly advancing in armoured columns along various axes. This was preceded by intense air and cruise missile strikes and the landing of airborne troops behind Ukrainian lines. The scale of military operations suggests president Vladimir Putin intends to occupy large sections of Ukraine, east of the Dnipro river, at least in the short-term.Russian disinformation campaigns, combined with the proverbial fog of war, mean analysts have relatively little certainty about what is happening on the ground. Even so, the campaign is closely following Russian military doctrine for a multipronged ground assault supported by air and maritime forces, as well as operations in cyber space and attacks on everything from wireless communications to radar systems.While the term hybrid warfare has become almost synonymous with the Russian strategy among many European policymakers, what we are seeing now in Ukraine is the return of a much more menacing, bloodier mode of warfare in Europe: a conventional war of rapid manoeuvre.What should we expect? First, Russia’s strategy will be to conduct air and missile strikes against high priority Ukrainian targets, including military headquarters, radar stations, air defences, airfields, logistical centres and transit routes to prevent reinforcements reaching the frontline. Ukraine’s recently acquired Bayraktar Turkish TB2 drones — which were touted as game-changers in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict — stand little chance against Russia’s sophisticated air defence systems in the long run.Second, Russian airborne forces (VDV), an elite high-readiness rapid reaction force, would be helicoptered into positions behind Ukrainian lines. There they would occupy tactically-important terrain, including intersections and bridges, and erect blocking positions to prevent Ukrainian forces from reinforcing each other. Notably, these troops are also capable of landing combat vehicles and artillery behind the front lines. To date, there have been conflicting reports about VDV drops in Ukraine. Third, battalion tactical groups — a formation of 700 to 900 personnel in armoured fighting vehicles supported by artillery, air defence, and electronic warfare units — would attempt to advance rapidly into Ukraine and overwhelm local forces, battering their resistance with massive artillery strikes. Russian troops are likely to avoid widespread combat in cities given that such operations are manpower-intensive, long-lasting, and bloody. However, they will certainly probe Kyiv’s defences. Without significant resistance, the entry of the Russian forces into Ukraine’s capital could resemble the 2003 US invasion of Baghdad: swift and with little effort. As other analysts have pointed out, Russia has only a limited arsenal of precision-guided munitions. Should cities indeed become major sites for fighting, Moscow could use less-precise weapons to bomb these urban centres. Ukrainian armed forces are at a major disadvantage given the vast stretch of terrain they need to defend. A lot will depend on how they survive the initial Russian onslaught, and on the strength of their morale. They will have to retreat in an orderly manner, re-establish a new front, and mass their formations for necessary counter-attacks. Should the Ukrainian forces mount a serious resistance, there could be a prolonged military struggle, with retreats to a few strongholds in the west of the country. But the options look grim. The Russian armed forces are not without their weaknesses, including a lack of training and outdated equipment among some units. Combined arms manoeuvres — the integration of different weapons systems — are among the most complex military operations, and Russia has limited experience of conducting them on such a large scale. This could point toward a longer war of attrition than Putin anticipates.But the 2008 war in Georgia, where local troops sometimes proved tactically superior, was a wake-up call in this regard, prompting an overhaul of the Russian armed forces. As a result, the Russians are militarily stronger now than they have been at any point since the end of the cold war.This is an important wake-up call for those who predicted that future warfare would be dominated by disinformation campaigns, offensive cyber operations, and little green men. In crises such as this one, there is no substitute for strong conventional military capabilities.
173  How far is the EU prepared to go to assert its digital sovereignty?The answer to that question will have profound implications for the structure of the tech industry, as well as the cross-border data flows that increasingly underpin global economic activity.In its purest form, digital sovereignty means keeping all European data in Europe, under the control of European regulation, and subject to storage and processing by European IT companies. All those conditions may not be met in all cases, but it is an aspiration that is starting to have a significant impact on EU digital policy.Anyone who doubts the resolve need look no further than the draft Data Act unveiled in Brussels this week. The bloc’s last major piece of data legislation, the General Data Protection Regulation, set a tough new standard for protecting personal data. The Data Act takes a swing instead at non-personal information — the streams of data thrown off by things like modern production lines, transport fleets and “smart” homes.The proposed law seeks to give customers more control over how they can use this data. The owner of a “smart” washing machine, for instance, would be free to choose how the information it throws off is used, letting them pick a different company to monitor and repair the device than the one they bought it from.It is a vision of a more open internal European market for data — but one at risk of being hermetically sealed from the rest of the world.The act’s requirements for companies to protect data from foreign government surveillance could make life harder for US tech companies, even if they store and process all the data of their European customers in Europe. The requirements are partly a response to the US Cloud Act, which made it easier for the American authorities to reach across borders to demand data held by American companies abroad.Concerns like this are already having a practical impact. Microsoft faced a backlash in France after it was awarded a contract to act as the cloud provider for a new government health data repository, to be managed inside France. A French court upheld the US company’s right to do the work, but a decision was later made to shift the work to a European service provider anyway.Another question is whether deliberate barriers will be thrown up to hamper the leading US tech companies. In its early form, the Data Act would limit the extent to which “gatekeepers” — the term used in the EU’s Digital Services Act to denote these companies — can benefit from the new data-portability freedoms that are being proposed for other companies.To American eyes, proposals like this have always looked like industrial policy designed to help Europe support its own tech industry.At least when it comes to battles over personal data, there is a stronger case for controls. It is understandable for European governments to want to protect their citizens from the prying eyes of US authorities — particularly after the Snowden revelations of widespread digital surveillance. There is less reason, though, to throw up geographic fences around industrial data.The promoters of the initiative have made little secret of their goals. Speaking to the FT last month, Thierry Breton — the EU’s digital economy commission, and a former chief executive of French IT company Atos — said the aim was “to prepare ourselves so the data will be used for Europeans, by Europeans and with our values”.The Data Act still has a long way to go to become law. But more immediately, a drumbeat of interventions by Europe’s national regulators, made under GDPR’s privacy rules, has threatened to slow Transatlantic data transfers.Earlier this month, the French data regulator ruled that Google Analytics could no longer send data about EU users to the US, echoing an earlier Dutch decision.And in the biggest and most significant case of its kind, Ireland’s data registrar said this week it had completed a draft order to bar social networking giant Meta from sending the data of its EU users across the Atlantic. That looming threat has already led the company to warn in its regulatory filings that as things stand, it is “likely” to have to shut down Facebook and Instagram services in Europe.US and European negotiators are working on a compromise that would forestall such threats, with an agreement expected by the middle of the year. But previous compromises like this were struck down by European courts, and a legal challenge from privacy campaigners to any new deal seems inevitable.
174  Barely three hours before Russian and Belarusian troops bombed and invaded Ukraine, its President Volodymyr Zelensky appealed directly to Russians in their — and his — native tongue.“What are you fighting for?” he asked in an online address posted just before 2am, shortly after Russian president Vladimir Putin laid out his justifications for attacking Ukraine. “And with whom?”He urged the citizens of a country that “gave more than 8m lives for victory over Nazism” in the second world war to stop Russia’s impending military assault.Before midday, with the invasion well under way, the Ukrainian president, with dark circles under his eyes, had assumed a blunter and angrier tone.The more uncompromising stance was welcomed by many Ukrainians keen to confront Russian aggression. However, it was also indicative of the pressures building on Zelensky as the nation he leads comes under siege.In his evening address to the nation where he gave updates on Ukraine’s response to Russian attacks, Zelensky called for a robust response from western allies.“If you my dear world leaders.leaders of the free world, don’t help us today, if you do not strongly help Ukraine, then tomorrow war will knock on your doors,” he said.Earlier, Zelensky announced that Ukraine had severed diplomatic relations with its neighbour. He also compared Russia to Nazi Germany, an inflammatory comparison that has been hurled by both countries against each other since the beginning in 2014 of their conflict, which escalated into a full-blown war on Thursday.“Russia vilely attacked our state early this morning, just as Nazi Germany did during world war two,” the Ukrainian leader said. “Our countries stand on different sides of world history. Russia stands on the path of evil.”Zelensky urged all Russians “who have not yet lost their conscience” to take to the streets to protest against the war. He also called on Ukrainians to donate blood and spread the word “about how our military is fighting”.The president’s combative words carried more than a bit of bluster and bravado, given that the leader was already dependent on support from the outside world, and is now — along with his country — a direct target for Russian forces.They came during a day in which Russia’s armed forces shelled airports and military installations in Kyiv and across Ukraine, fighter jets boomed through the sky over the capital, and Russian military convoys moved into Ukraine’s north and east, and from Russian-occupied Crimea in the south.The invasion followed a week in which Putin announced he was recognising and deploying troops to Ukraine’s two separatist-controlled eastern regions, Donetsk and Luhansk, and made a vitriolic speech that most Ukrainians felt questioned their country’s very right to exist.Yet Zelensky, a former TV comedian who some of his countrymen once dismissed as a political lightweight, has transformed visibly before Ukrainians’ eyes in less than a week into a convincing commander-in-chief, amid the rising military threat from Russia and a hardening public mood.After months of urging calm, he gave a speech at last week’s Munich Security Conference that attacked Moscow as well as the west’s failure to rally behind Ukraine and was welcomed by his countrymen.“Has the world forgotten its mistakes of the 20th century?” he asked in tones alternatively pleading and chiding. “What do attempts at appeasement lead to?” And he compared asking the question “Why die for Danzig” — where the second world war started (now the Polish city of Gdansk) — with western prevarication over Ukraine in the face of what he described as the world’s biggest security crisis since the cold war.The strong words in the Munich address were warmly received in Ukraine, where people are rallying behind their troops and leaders.“I am proud of our government,” said Kostyantyn Batozsky, a political analyst from Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region now based in Kyiv. “They are coping well, and all Ukrainians are supporting a government that does their job right.”On Thursday Zelensky promised to keep Ukrainians informed every hour, and invited journalists to his office in central Kyiv for briefings, although many empty seats were visible at the one just before noon on Thursday.Some reporters privately voiced concern about attending them for fear that the Ukrainian president could be a target of a Russian military strike or assassination attempt. Mykhail Podolyak, one of Zelensky’s advisers, warned journalists of a possible paratrooper assault. “One of [Russia’s] aims is to oust the leadership of the country,” he said.With Russian troops now inside Ukraine, the fear was not a far-fetched one. People in Kyiv, after going about their business with noteworthy sangfroid in the run-up to war, were on Thursday stocking up on water, groceries, petrol and other provisions in preparation for a possible siege. Thousands decided to flee the capital in their cars or on trains.Zelensky told Ukrainians his government stood ready to give weapons to anyone who wanted to defend the country. “Be ready to support Ukraine in the squares of our cities,” he said.Additional reporting by Roman Olearchyk
175  Business leaders have warned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will heighten inflation and hit supply chains just as the global economy emerges from the disruption caused by the pandemic.“Market volatility will increase, energy prices will increase, which will fuel inflation,” Axa’s chief executive Thomas Buberl told the Financial Times on Thursday.The conflict was a “symbol of how the world has changed”, and insurers needed to adapt to the new situation, he added.The deputy chief executive of Accor, Europe’s largest hotel chain, said war could knock travel confidence again just as the sector recovers from the unprecedented impact of the pandemic.While stressing that the company has just over 60 hotels in Russia and Ukraine, Jean-Jacques Morin said: “The more difficult question is, what’s the effect on destabilising the world by creating security risks and people being afraid? We don’t know, we need to have time.”Accor said on Thursday that it returned to profitability in 2021 but revenue per available room, the industry’s key metric, was 46 per cent down on 2019 levels.Morin, who is also chief financial officer at Accor, added: “When you had Covid [the markets] lost 20 per cent in one day. I don’t think you have that reaction today,” he said. “It will be a very different story if the Americans send troops, if Europeans send troops.”Warren East, speaking after announcing he would step down as chief executive of Rolls-Royce, warned that the unfolding conflict in Ukraine was producing “more uncertainty, which is fundamentally a bad thing”. The FTSE 100 aero-engine group had a “pretty small exposure” to Ukraine and Russia, with the latter making up less than 2 per cent of its total revenues, said East.Rolls-Royce, along with other aerospace companies including Airbus and Boeing, sources some of its titanium from Russia. East said the group bought about “20 per cent” of supplies from the country but stressed that it had been “prudently building stocks” over the past few months.Shares in Rolls-Royce were down 16 per cent by Thursday afternoon, while Accor and Axa were down 6 per cent, amid a broader sell-off.Axa, one of Europe’s largest insurers, sold its Ukraine operations in 2018 and has a minority stake in Russian insurer, Reso Garantia, which Buberl said was not material to group performance. The group said it had less than €200mn in insurance exposure to Russia.“An insurer looks at things in the long term,” said Buberl, speaking after the publication of its full-year results, which showed a bounceback from Covid-related losses.“I still believe that the Russian market remains an interesting one and so we are committed, with our joint venture partners there, to continue and even go through that difficult phase.”Buberl said he expected western companies exposed to Russia and Ukraine to move quickly to realign disrupted supply chains, mirroring their experience during the pandemic.“It will be difficult for them to deal with, but it’s often a matter of weeks and months until these companies adapt.”
176  The sound of explosions rang out over Kyiv at dawn on Thursday, as the Ukrainian capital woke to the start of a large-scale invasion by Russia that began with missile strikes against military targets and airports across the country.Lines of cars jammed the main roads out of the capital as residents fled, leaving the city centre deserted at what on a normal day would have been rush hour. People with suitcases crowded into metro trains, tried to buy medical supplies at pharmacies and lined up at ATMs to withdraw cash.People, some with children, camped out in the metro’s underground areas, huddling on the floor and checking the fast-moving news on their phones, which showed Russia bombing a string of targets across Ukraine and intense fighting in the country’s east.“We don’t have anywhere to go,” said Anastasia Tarasiuk, 22, who had set up camp on a yoga mat at Lukianivska metro station with her partner Oleskiy Yuhemenko, 24. The young couple had brought a backpack, a portable gas stove and a five-litre bottle of water.“We live in a rented apartment in Kyiv, and we don’t know where we could even go because there is shooting everywhere, in the east as well as in the west,” Tarasiuk said. “We are hoping the shooting will end within five or six hours.”They had been woken by a phone call from relatives telling them to head to shelters. Their emergency bags had already been packed the night before. “We think the subway is the most logical place to stay now,” Yuhemenko said.At about 6.48am local time Russian tanks crossed into Ukraine from Belarus, where they have been stationed for several weeks. Later in the day, reports confirmed by Ukrainian officials showed the Russian military had pushed even closer to Kyiv, with battles under way in Hostomel, an airport in a northern suburb of the capital.“This is our land, this is Ukraine,” said Irina, queueing to withdraw money at Kyiv’s central Teatralna metro station, as people with suitcases lined up behind her. Several ATMs had already capped withdrawals.“It is a disgrace; that man should be destroyed for what he is doing. he should be crushed,” Irina said, referring to Russian president Vladimir Putin.The shelling heard in Kyiv at dawn did not continue throughout the day, and Russia’s ministry of defence claimed its strikes had rapidly knocked out Ukraine’s air defences.Kyiv’s mayor Vitali Klitschko addressed the capital’s residents on social media, asking them to stay home and head to a bomb shelter when needed. Kyiv has prepared about 5,000 locations as shelters across the city, marked out on a Google map.“Ukraine is under attack by an aggressor. The roar of shells can be heard in Kyiv,” Klitschko said. “The worst enemy right now is panic.”President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian forces were trying to seize the site of the disused nuclear power plant at Chernobyl, about 100km north of Kyiv.Sirens sounded in Kyiv on Thursday evening. The streets were deserted as residents crowded into basements, bomb shelters and the city’s deep subway system after authorities warned of imminent air strikes. Reports indicated that Russian troops were moving closer to the country’s capital Kyiv despite resistance.Boris Misharyn, a 30-year-old Kyiv resident who runs a small IT company, said he was trying to maintain calm among his friends.“We’re all frightened now, we don’t know what to expect from Putin,” he said. “Right now, I can sense mass panic in Kyiv, everyone is trying to get out of the city.”He added: “We’re speaking with friends in messenger chats. We’re prepared to lose phone signal so we’re downloading apps that work without mobile internet, exchanging phone numbers and addresses.”Over the course of the day, many Ukrainians, mostly young men arrived at the borders of Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland, according to video footage from several local television stations.But Misharyn said he would be staying in Kyiv, in the hope that political negotiation would put an end to the conflict before it reached the city. If not, he too would head to western Ukraine.“What I don’t understand,” Misharyn said, “is what the Russian people are fighting for. Why are they staying silent?”Revealing Ukraine’s domestic political divisions, another resident said she felt there was blame on both sides of the conflict, east and west. Regardless, Ukraine was the victim, she said.“Putin is fighting with America, and we end up the battleground. Us, the Donbas, Ukraine. We’re the battleground,” said Oksana, standing in an underpass waiting for money. She declined to give her second name.
177  Global food prices are set to soar still further after Russia’s attack on Ukraine threatened supply chains, pushing up commodities markets that had already hit multiyear highs.Russia and Ukraine together account for a third of the world’s wheat exports, a fifth of its corn trade and almost 80 per cent of sunflower oil production, according to the US Department of Agriculture.The attack has led to a ban on all commercial vessels in the inland sea of Azov — which connects to the Black Sea — and the closure of Ukrainian ports. Some 90 per cent of Ukrainian grain exports are transported by sea and the disruption is expected to wreak havoc on food supply flows, said analysts.Wheat prices have risen by more than a fifth since the start of the year to near 10-year highs, while corn prices have risen 15 per cent.The disruption to supplies and the scramble to find alternative sources of grain will hit supply chains already struggling with high demand and rising prices because of poor harvests in key exporting countries such as Canada. “The food price inflation risk stemming from this conflict appears acute,” said Helima Croft, analyst at RBC.Clive Black, analyst at UK brokers Shore Capital, said: “The current events in Ukraine absolutely lead us to be thinking about the supply chain and inflation outlook with growing concern.”With Ukraine and Russian inventories of wheat and other grains still waiting to be shipped, analysts said prices would rise further. If a substantial share of the Russian and Ukrainian grain fails to be shipped, wheat prices could rise to levels not seen since the crisis in 2007-08 when soaring grain prices triggered riots in some countries, according to Andrey Sizov at Moscow grains research firm Sovecon.Ukraine is known as the “breadbasket of Europe” and many countries in the Middle East and north Africa are also heavily reliant on it for wheat supplies. Any disruption in supply would have a severe impact on food security in a number of countries, according to US think-tank Center for Strategic and International Studies.Lebanon imports 50 per cent of its total wheat consumption from Ukraine, followed by Libya at 43 per cent, Yemen at 22 per cent, and Bangladesh at 21 per cent. “For the 14 countries where Ukrainian wheat is an essential import, almost half already suffer from severe food insecurity,” said Caitlin Welsh, the director of global food security at CSIS.Other countries reliant on Ukraine and Russia for grain supplies include Egypt, the world’s largest wheat importer, where the two countries accounted for 86 per cent of its wheat imports by value in 2020, and Turkey, where 75 per cent of its overseas purchases of wheat came from Ukraine and Russia. Egypt had wheat inventories until November and had also been diversifying its sources, according to the country’s supply ministry.For China, about a third of its corn imports come from Ukraine and are used to feed the world’s largest hog herd. “People have corn cargoes booked out of Ukraine,” said Darin Friedrichs co-founder of agricultural research group Sitonia Consulting in Shanghai. Any disruption to those shipments would force Chinese hog producers to scramble for alternative sources including US farms.The food industry, especially in Europe and the UK, will also be hit by rising energy prices.The further rise in prices for natural gas, the main ingredient of fertiliser, will affect food prices if farmers cannot afford the increase in costs, and could hit crop quality and production if they cut use. Yara, a Norwegian fertiliser company, said in its latest results announcement that high gas prices were a challenge for the industry in Europe, adding to “global food security concerns in a situation with already tight supply across the main nutrients”.Additional reporting by Heba Saleh in Cairo and Harry Dempsey in London
178  Uefa has come under increasing pressure to move the final of its flagship competition to a different country, while the governing body’s commercial ties to Russian state energy company Gazprom have also come under scrutiny.“Following the evolution of the situation between Russia and Ukraine in the last 24 hours, Aleksander Ceferin, the Uefa president, has arranged an extraordinary meeting of the organisation’s executive committee,” the governing body said in a statement. “We are dealing with this situation with the utmost seriousness and urgency,” Uefa said. “Decisions will be taken by the Uefa Executive Committee and announced tomorrow.”It added that it “shares the international community’s significant concern for the security situation developing in Europe and strongly condemns the ongoing Russian military invasion in Ukraine”.While no formal decision has been made, a person with knowledge of the matter said it would be a surprise if the organisation did not move the match. As well as arranging high-profile matches in Russia, Uefa has a longstanding partnership with Gazprom that goes back to 2012. The energy company sponsors the Krestovsky Stadium, which is known as the Gazprom Arena.Uefa’s sponsorship with Gazprom was worth roughly €40mn a season from 2018-21, according to estimates by SportBusiness Sponsorship, the data and research group. The deal was then renewed until 2024.The announcement of Friday’s meeting came amid growing international pressure on Uefa to strip Russia of the right to host the final. Earlier this week, UK prime minister Boris Johnson said there was “no chance of holding football tournaments in a Russia that invades sovereign countries”.“I welcome the news that Uefa plan to announce the Champions League final to be moved from Russia. It is a great shame it has taken this amount of time to make the right decision,” said Julian Knight, a British MP, who chairs the country’s influential Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee.On Thursday, Football Supporters Europe, which has members in more than 50 Uefa nations, said: “Given the events unfolding, we expect an imminent announcement from Uefa on the relocation of the Champions League final from Saint-Petersburg.”Chris Bryant, an MP from the UK’s opposition Labour party who sits on the foreign affairs select committee in the House of Commons, on Wednesday told the Financial Times that Uefa should part ways with Gazprom.The Krestovsky Stadium hosted matches at the 2018 Fifa World Cup and at Uefa’s Euro 2020, showcasing Russia on the world stage at two high-profile international football tournaments.Uefa declined to confirm whether or not the executive committee would discuss terminating its partnership with Gazprom.German football club FC Schalke 04 on Thursday said it had decided to remove the Gazprom logo from its shirts.Mit Blick auf die Ereignisse, Entwicklung und Zuspitzung der vergangenen Tage: #S04 nimmt GAZPROM-Schriftzug von Trikots.
179  Missile strikes against air defences and critical military infrastructure, a rocket bombardment against major troop locations followed by a three-pronged land attack: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began just as western military intelligence had predicted.Within hours of President Vladimir Putin’s vow to “de-Nazify” Ukraine with a full invasion of the country, Russian tanks and troops were rolling across the border in what threatens to be the largest conflict in Europe since the second world war.Ukraine’s first-line defences were pounded by a precision missile barrage, part of an assault that western officials fear will devastate eastern Ukraine and seize Kyiv in a matter of days.“The Russians have such supremacy that it’s effectively a bulldozer that can, given time, go anywhere. The capability is such that they can take territory almost as quick as they like,” said a senior western intelligence official. “The key variable factor is how much the Ukrainians can put up a fight and give Putin a bloody nose.”Twelve hours into the invasion, Russian paratroopers and attack helicopters were within 25km of the centre of Kyiv, fighting for control of an airport in the city’s north-west suburbs, as citizens of the capital were ordered into air-raid shelters.The speed with which the assault was done raised the possibility that the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky could fall sooner than Ukraine’s allies had initially thought, though western defence officials said urban warfare would likely pose a different test of Russia’s forces.“They’re making a move on Kyiv. But what they’re going to do in Kyiv is hard to say,” said a senior US defence official. “It’s our assessment that they have every intention of decapitating the government and installing their own method of governance.”The rapid assault began at 5am on Thursday with more than 100 long-range, precision missile strikes fired by ground launchers and from ships in the Black Sea. Kh-31P missiles that target enemy radar and communication infrastructure were used extensively.About 75 bombers also attacked Ukraine’s air defence systems, command and control infrastructure, air bases and large troop concentrations.That paved the way for a land assault along three axes, with two likely initial aims: a move south using troops from the 30,000-strong deployment in Belarus to encircle Kyiv, running simultaneously with a larger pincer movement using troops moving north from Crimea and west from Russia to cut off the bulk of Ukraine’s army deployed in the east of the country from the capital.Fighting was harder in the north-east, with Russian troops struggling to take Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv.Western capitals believe that Putin “wants to suffocate rather than flatten Kyiv”, said the senior intelligence official, but there were huge concerns over how high the death toll could be, given the Russian president’s stated aim to “demilitarise” a country with a standing army of 215,000 troops.“So far, the Kremlin has focused on taking out civil infrastructure key to maintaining Ukrainian fighting functions. It may now expand to taking out human infrastructure in order to weaken Ukrainian resistance,” said Samuel Cranny-Evans, analyst at the Royal United Services Institute in London.That brutal assessment refers to western intelligence briefings which have warned that Russia has a “kill list” of Ukrainians to be attacked or detained on invasion.“The key thing is what is Russia’s end goal? The actions will fit that,” said Cranny-Evans. “If they only go where Ukrainian forces are, that speaks to Putin’s repeated statements of demilitarising Ukraine. Regime change would follow. If Russian troops go into the cities, where there are likely no Ukrainian forces, that suggests a different goal.”The critical question that could determine the fate of the war is whether Ukraine’s forces organise a strategic retreat to avoid encirclement or find a fallback line from which they can successfully resist or delay the Russian advance westward, said Michael Kofman, senior research scientist at CNA, a US-based think-tank.“Quantitatively and qualitatively, Russia has considerable supremacy here. Ukrainians are facing a grim situation,” Kofman said. “We should not be surprised by early Russian ground advances, as the question is when will Ukrainian forces choose to hold the line.”A secondary objective will be to secure Ukraine’s coastline with an assault on Odesa, analysts say, leveraging Russia’s large naval deployments.Russia shut down access to the Sea of Azov, the part of the Black Sea between Crimea and eastern Ukraine, and western officials said it was likely to be impossible for Turkey to agree to a plea from Kyiv to close off the Bosphorus to possible Russian naval reinforcements or resupplies.There has so far been no evidence that the Russian assault has been accompanied by crippling cyber attacks targeting Ukraine’s power supply and communications networks, as western capitals had anticipated.Intelligence shared among Nato allies suggests that in the medium-term Putin could require about 600,000 troops in Ukraine to tackle both a strong initial defence from the Ukrainian armed forces and suppress a guerrilla war from resistance fighters after the state is captured.“I suspect this will be a stop-go operation: two to four days of advance, pause and recoup to assess the situation — militarily, politically,” said Mathieu Boulègue, research fellow at Chatham House’s Eurasia programme. “Next steps depend on acceptable casualty rates for the military — but that is an internal Russian decision.”“It looks like a maximalist approach, but could be a deception strategy to merely take the Donbas,” he continued, referring to the eastern region of Ukraine occupied by Russia-backed separatists.“[The] important question is: what is the end game, the war termination strategy, what will the map of Ukraine look like at the end of it all?”
180  Joseph Stalin purportedly said that quantity had a quality all of its own. He cared more about tanks than food. Both are in the balance as Russia invades Ukraine.The country, “the breadbasket of Russia” in Soviet times, plays an important role in global food supplies. War now threatens production. You cannot plough, plant and harvest a field with tanks stationed on it. Prices for wheat and corn soared to decade highs on Thursday.The wheat-producing Black Sea region matters a lot. Prices will continue to spiral higher as the conflict persists. Consumers in some of the world’s most vulnerable countries will feel the consequences most severely.Food prices have already returned to the record levels last experienced in 2011. Rising input costs like fertilisers and fuel contributes greatly according to the FAO. Broad measures of corn and wheat prices are both 20 per cent higher than they were at the beginning of this year. Prices for Paris wheat, a high quality milling grain used in flour and a proxy for much of that produced in Ukraine and Russia, have risen almost 30 per cent in the past two weeks, according to Saxo Group.No surprise given Ukraine accounted for 9 per cent of world wheat exports and 15 per cent of corn exports in 2020. Russia produced 19 per cent of world wheat exports that year.Developing nations depend on both. Their biggest customer is Egypt which takes about a fifth of each country’s wheat shipments. Turkey and Bangladesh are big purchasers too while China receives over a quarter of Ukraine’s corn exports.But wheat stocks are skimpy. Russia has regularly imposed export restrictions on wheat to stabilise domestic prices. New taxes and quotas already went into place this year. That was in response to an international supply deficit from prior to the pandemic. Global stocks mostly held by China have been declining since 2019 and will fall further.With food supplies already tight, the conflict will put added pressure on other big exporters like the US and EU. Quantity will not be a quality of global food supplies in 2022.
181  The grim spectacle of Russian tanks rolling into Ukraine has shattered the dream Europe dared to nurture for three decades, that war on this scale would never again be witnessed on the continent. Naked and unprovoked aggression against its neighbour by a country with one of the world’s largest armies recalls the bleakest moments of the 20th century. The overturning of attempts since 1945 to make respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity a founding principle of international relations will have a grave human cost, and repercussions far beyond Europe. The chapter of history opened by the fall of the Berlin Wall, bringing hopes that states could choose their destinies inside a “common European home”, has been closed. A new, darker, chapter has begun.Putin’s aggression, to be clear, is founded on twin untruths. One is that this is a war of liberation, of “denazification” of Ukraine. For eight years, the Kremlin’s propaganda machine has peddled the lie that the overthrow of president Viktor Yanukovych was a “western-backed, neo-Nazi coup”. There were far-right groups among the broad array of protesters against Yanukovych’s pro-Russian kleptocracy. But they have never been among the post-uprising leaders. Ukrainian democracy is far from perfect, but — unlike Russia’s — it is real. The first freely-elected president since 2014 was a tycoon who made much of his money in the confectionery business. The second, Volodymyr Zelensky, is a Jewish former actor-comedian whose first language is Russian.The second falsehood is that this conflict was provoked by the west and Nato. In the nearly 14 years since the north Atlantic alliance declared Ukraine and Georgia would one day become members, Kyiv has never been put on a path to joining. The necessary unanimity to admit it never existed, and was unlikely to do so anytime soon. The wisdom of Nato’s post-cold war enlargement to the east will be debated in years to come. But, contrary to Kremlin claims, guarantees were not given that this would not happen. Nor was enlargement something the alliance sought or imposed. It responded to requests from countries which, having spent decades under Soviet domination, wanted to ensure this could not happen again. They will see the invasion of Ukraine as vindicating their fears.The fact that Kyiv is not a Nato member means the west has no obligation to intervene militarily in its defence. The US and European allies have ruled out doing so for fear of triggering the terrifying confrontation of nuclear-armed rivals that the world has striven to avoid for seven decades. Putin has openly threatened “consequences you have never experienced before in your history” against any nations that interfere in his invasion. But western powers have a moral obligation to provide all possible help short of direct military involvement to Ukraine, a country which they have encouraged to integrate more closely with their institutions.Military aid to help Ukrainians defend themselves against Moscow’s advance should be stepped up. Russia’s president claims — though he has lied throughout this crisis — not to plan an occupation. It would be an immense tragedy for Ukraine to be dragged into a prolonged and bloody insurgency. Yet the greater the early cost of Putin’s onslaught, the greater the chance that he limits his objectives — or meets resistance at home from Russians, who have strong family and cultural ties with Ukraine.Western countries need to rediscover the will to contain Moscow that they displayed through the cold war. They should be prepared to use their principal weapon, of economic and financial sanctions, to maximum effect. This is no longer a question of deterring Russia’s president, but of imposing the highest cost for his actions, and squeezing his ability to finance his foolish adventurism. This, too, will involve considerable dangers — of blowback effects, and of Kremlin retaliation, including through threatened “asymmetric” means such as cyber attacks. Accidental or deliberate interruptions to Russian natural gas supplies could send prices to levels that dwarf the highs of recent months, and lead to shortages in Europe. Oil and gas prices are already soaring. Assumptions about economic growth and recovery after the coronavirus pandemic could be overturned.If they are to defend their freedoms and values by non-military means, democratic allies must be prepared to bear economic hardship — and they should be explaining this to their populations. Countries west of Ukraine must also be ready to open their arms to a potential wave of refugees that could far surpass that from Syria and the Middle East in 2015.Those nations that might be tempted to side with Russia and help it to withstand international sanctions should think hard. China’s president Xi Jinping has backed Moscow’s opposition to further Nato enlargement. Its foreign minister, though, has called on all parties to show restraint, and resolve the Ukraine crisis through dialogue. Russia’s assault on a country with which China has economic ties defies Beijing’s espoused principle of respect for territorial integrity. True, China has its own ambitions towards Taiwan — which it considers part of its territory. But a global free-for-all in which borders are no longer respected is not necessarily in Beijing’s interests any more than those of its global counterparts.As in the long years of the cold war, it is vital for democracies to continue their engagement with Russian society and — as far as they can penetrate the fog of Kremlin misinformation — make clear their quarrel is with the country’s leadership, not its people. Russians have been lied to by politicians and state media, but may become increasingly uncomfortable with a war against a “brother” nation. The country’s elites have submitted to Putin as ultimate arbiter for 20 years because he seemed the best guarantor of stability and their own wealth. He has now launched a reckless war to topple the government of a neighbour. It is not impossible that it will ultimately destabilise his own.Letter in response to this article:Resorting to war ridicules the basic rules of the UN charter / From Tarcisio Gazzini, Professor of International Law, University of Padua, Italy
182  Airlines cancelled and rerouted flights to steer clear of Ukraine and the surrounding region on Thursday as urgent warnings from safety regulators left a growing swath of airspace in eastern Europe off limits.The outbreak of war and a spike in the price of oil to more than $100 per barrel sent shares in major European airlines tumbling and opened up new problems for an industry still recovering from the pandemic.Ukraine’s air traffic agency declared the country’s airspace closed “due to the high risk of aviation safety for civilian aviation”, while the EU Aviation Safety Agency warned of the danger of flying in Russia and Belarus within 100 nautical miles of the Ukrainian border.Airlines were also warned to “exercise caution” when flying over parts of airspace operated by Moscow and Rostov air traffic control in Russia “due to heightened military activity, which may include launches of mid-range missiles penetrating into controlled airspace”.Airspace over Moldova and parts of Belarus were also closed by the respective national governments on Thursday, Reuters reported.Industry bosses held a crisis call with EU member states in the morning to discuss the Russian invasion, according to a person with knowledge of the discussion.They were told that based on air traffic data from February 11, 610 aircraft per day could be hit by the airspace restrictions. The figure excludes direct flights to and from Ukraine.There was no discussion on the call of the impact that closing all of Russian airspace would have, indicating that the industry still considers it highly unlikely. Ukraine’s president has called on western leaders to “close” Russian airspace as part of a package of retaliatory measures.Airlines stocks experienced some of the biggest falls in the markets with Hungarian based Wizz Air’s shares tumbling 13.5 per cent, while British Airways owner IAG and easyJet slipped more than 8 per cent.Russian carrier Aeroflot fell 25 per cent, matching a broader collapse in Moscow equities.London listed Wizz and Irish low-cost rival Ryanair, two of the last major airlines still flying to Ukraine, both cancelled flights. Of the major European airlines Wizz is the most exposed to Ukraine, with 8 per cent of its July 2022 schedules planned to operate to or from a Ukrainian airport, according to calculations by analysts at Bernstein.Wizz, which has aircraft parked on the ground in Kyiv, was preparing to evacuate all its Ukrainian based employees and their families, and its aircraft “at the earliest opportunity”, an executive said.The airspace closures could have “huge implications” for carriers flying east out of Europe, said Andrew Charlton, managing director of consultancy Aviation Advocacy.“Diversion over Russia is possible but expensive, and it might be shut down at any time for political or safety reasons,” he said.One of the last civilian flights to enter Ukrainian airspace, an Israeli El Al flight between Tel Aviv and Toronto, turned around shortly after beginning to overfly Ukrainian territory in the early hours of Thursday morning, according to data from flight tracking website Flightradar24. The flight continued on a modified route over Europe.Many major international airlines including Lufthansa and KLM had already unilaterally cancelled flights in the weeks leading up to the military action, meaning there was relatively limited operational disruption to European carriers on Thursday morning.Airlines had also long avoided parts of eastern Ukraine following the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in 2014. Elsewhere, some 200 flights were cancelled or delayed in Moscow airports, particularly to southern Russian cities, according to news agency Ria Novosti.Rosaviatsiya, the Russian aviation agency, ordered flights to 11 southern airports in Russia to stop until at least March 2.
183  The three Baltic states have called for Nato to reinforce its presence on their territories as the alliance for the first time activated its rapid response force of thousands of troops to bolster its eastern flank.Lithuania on Thursday announced a state of emergency in response to Russia’s assault of Ukraine that began in the early hours, while Latvia and Estonia convened urgent national security talks.The Russian attack was launched not only from occupied eastern Ukraine but also Belarus, which neighbours Lithuania and Latvia, and where Russian president Vladimir Putin had stationed 30,000 troops. Putin spoke with Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko before the assault, according to Minsk.The Baltic states, which were illegally annexed by Moscow after the second world war, are the only former Soviet nations that have joined the EU and Nato — something Russia has long viewed as a provocation.A particular concern is Russia’s ability to cut the Baltic states off from the rest of Europe via the narrow Poland-Lithuania border stretch between Belarus and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The 65km Suwalki gap is viewed as one of Nato’s most vulnerable points.The Baltic states also rely on other Nato members to defend their air space on a rotation basis.The three states and Poland on Thursday called for immediate consultations at Nato under the so-called Article 4, which allies can invoke whenever “the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened”.Putin this week suggested that all nations that declared independence from the Soviet Union were “ticking time bombs” infected with the “virus of nationalist ambitions”, suggesting his territorial ambitions extended beyond Ukraine.Nato allies have over the past few months sought to reassure the Baltics, as alarm grew over the build-up of Russian forces on Ukraine’s borders. The UK, Germany, Norway and Denmark sent additional troops to reinforce the multinational battle groups of about 1,000 each in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — although the Baltics would like more.The US, which has a battalion on rotation in Lithuania, sent reinforcements to its base in Poland.Ingrida Simonyte, Lithuania’s prime minister, said before the invasion that an assault on Ukraine would be a “complete game changer” for Europe that would require a need “to rethink the whole security situation if these Russian troops and weapons are here to stay”.Nato said on Thursday it was deploying “additional defensive land and air forces to the eastern part of the alliance” to protect its allies in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Our measures are and remain preventive, proportionate and non-escalatory,” it said after convening an emergency meeting.Nato has also agreed to activate for the first time its Response Force, a roughly 40,000-strong multinational group, of which up to 5,000 troops are ready to deploy immediately.“In the coming days and weeks there will be even more [troops] . in the eastern part of the alliance,” said Jens Stoltenberg, Nato secretary-general, without providing figures or detailed locations for the new deployments.Estonia said before the Nato emergency meeting that it would present its views about how to strengthen the alliance’s deterrence and defence stance in the Baltic region. A gathering of Nato leaders has been scheduled for Friday.The Baltic countries have for weeks been pushing for tough sanctions on Russia. Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania’s foreign minister, on Thursday retweeted a call by his Ukrainian counterpart for “devastating sanctions” on Russia including cutting off the country’s banks from the Swift banking communications network.The option of severing Russian banks from Swift is on the table for discussion among EU capitals on Thursday, even though diplomats said it was not initially expected to be in the current round of sanctions.Lithuania also joined with Poland in a joint statement with Ukraine this week proposing candidate status for Ukraine in the EU.Jonathan Eyal, associate director with the Royal United Services Institute, said that “what is happening before our eyes is what eastern and Baltic states have been warning for 20 years, only to be dismissed as unnecessarily alarmist and obsessed with Russia”.The Baltic states “have succeeded in improving their defence arrangements substantially, but they are basically non-defensible without a permanent presence of western forces”.He said that once Putin finished what he started in Ukraine, “his attention will turn to countries in Nato facing him”.He said Nato should look to permanently reinforce its eastern flank from the Black Sea to the Baltics, particularly given Belarus’s de facto integration in Russia’s military machine.“The Russian attack on Ukraine through Belarus is [a] huge warning for the Baltics,” said Eyal.
184  The writer is a former FT Moscow bureau chiefNot long after the Maidan Revolution that overthrew Ukraine’s president Viktor Yanukovych in 2014, I had a haunting conversation with a Russian commentator in Moscow. Echoing the standard Kremlin line, he said it was a tragedy that Russia had “lost” Ukraine. But, he added privately, it might have been even worse had Russia “won”.His argument was that if Moscow had succeeded in propping up a puppet regime in Kyiv then Russia might then have been dragged into a civil war, battling an insurgency in western Ukraine and facing sanctions from abroad. Russia would have been drained of blood, treasure and international respectability for years to come. Just as Moscow’s invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 had led to the unravelling of the Soviet Union, so an intervention in Ukraine may have jeopardised President Vladimir Putin’s regime. Given the invasion of Ukraine launched on Thursday morning, that scenario has moved closer to reality.But what fallout might Russia’s invasion have on the rest of the world?Moscow’s assault has already triggered a spike in energy prices. It may lead to threats against Nato countries bordering Russia and Belarus. But one of the most chilling fears is that a regional conflict could escalate into an invisible global confrontation in cyber space. Arguably, cyber warfare started years ago and has now become a permanent condition of the modern world as rival powers look to spy on each other, steal secrets, degrade infrastructure and spread disinformation. The only open question is how intense it might become.In her book This Is How They Tell Me The World Ends, Nicole Perlroth described how Ukraine became ground zero in this new era of cyber warfare as Russian hackers consistently tried to undermine the country. Since 2014, Ukraine’s government agencies, central electoral commission, power grids, banks and airports have all experienced sporadic attacks.Last month, hackers defaced 70 Ukrainian websites leaving behind the message: “Be afraid and expect the worst.” Just before the invasion, several Ukrainian ministries and state banks were targeted. And many western organisations are indirectly exposed: according to Ukraine’s foreign ministry, more than 100 of the Fortune 500 companies use Ukrainian IT services.For years, Russia has been the world’s most active nation state hacker and has developed formidable cyber capabilities. Microsoft’s Digital Defense Report, published last October, attributed 58 per cent of all known nation state cyber attacks to Russia over the previous year. The top three target countries were the US, Ukraine and the UK. Some commentators have argued that it is only a matter of time before the west experiences a “cyber Pearl Harbor”.Speaking before Thursday’s assault, western security experts considered it unlikely that Putin would launch a massive cyber attack against a Nato country: it would only invite a damaging response. “The catastrophisation of the problem is not particularly helpful,” said Sir Alex Younger, the former head of Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service, at an FT Forums event on Wednesday. “Cyber attacks can be devastating things but they don’t compare to surface-to-surface missiles landing on suburbs of Kyiv.” Focusing on extreme cyber scenarios also risked distracting from the chronic damage caused by the theft of intellectual property, the erosion of strategic advantage and criminal threats that could best be addressed by determined leadership and standard cyber security hygiene.The greatest cyber spillover from the Ukraine crisis might come from accidental contamination or the escalation of criminal attacks originating from Russia, said Ciaran Martin, the former chief executive of Britain’s National Cyber Security Centre. He cited the experience of the NotPetya malware attack, unleashed against Ukraine in 2017, that caused an estimated $10bn of economic damage. Several big companies, including Maersk, FedEx and Merck, were badly hit. But so was Rosneft, the giant Russian oil company, highlighting how such attacks are indiscriminate and difficult to control.The fact that Putin has invaded Ukraine emphasises the limitations of cyber weapons. Ultimately, the Russian leader has resorted to overwhelming military force to achieve his objectives in Ukraine. It makes little sense for him to provoke a broader conflict with the west by launching cyber attacks. But then war has a way of scrambling logic. As Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky has said: “in the 21st century there are no more foreign wars”.
185  Russia’s stock market dropped at a record-breaking pace and the rouble plunged after Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of neighbouring Ukraine.The Moex index briefly fell 45 per cent before recovering to close the main session 33 per cent lower, while the rouble tumbled to a record low against the dollar on Thursday after President Vladimir Putin launched what he called a “special military operation” to demilitarise and “de-Nazify” Ukraine.Shares in oil and gas majors plummeted, with Gazprom down 37 per cent and Lukoil and Novatek declining 34 per cent and 20 per cent respectively, leaving the Moex down 46 per cent since the start of the year. The scale of the shock to markets suggests that investors had expected Putin to back down.“You have the panic button being hit right now, I don’t think the market was pricing in the risk of a proper military conflict,” said Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at Barclays. “For the time being, it’s hard to see what could be a trigger for the market to stabilise.”The invasion also triggered a drop in London-based Russian stocks traded as global depositary receipts — a type of bank certificate that securitises the ownership of shares.Sberbank, the most actively traded Russian stock on the London Stock Exchange, plummeted 72 per cent. Gazprom closed 28 per cent lower, while Lukoil was down more than two-fifths.“At this point in time, people are saying ‘get me out and get me out at any price’,” said Luis Saenz, head of international distribution at Sinara, a Russian investment company. “The vast majority of people are expecting the next round of sanctions to be impactful on their ability to invest in Russian stocks.”The Moscow exchange had earlier halted operations after the rouble fell to almost 90 to the dollar following reports of explosions in several Ukrainian cities. The Russian currency picked up slightly after the central bank said it would step in to stabilise the market.Russian bond prices tumbled in strained trading conditions as markets reopened after Wednesday’s public holiday and markets reacted to fresh sanctions preventing US and EU investors from trading any new Russian debt issued from the start of March onwards.Dealers were pricing Russian 10-year bonds with yields as high as 15 per cent — up from less than 11 per cent on Tuesday — but huge gaps between buying and selling prices meant little actual trading was being done, investors said.“Brokers are basically saying if you want to buy then we can give you a price, but if you’re selling, forget it,” said an analyst at a big asset manager. “The fear is Iranian-style sanctions where even if the Russians want to pay you back, there’s no way of getting the money to you.”Some fund managers think this week’s new restrictions on Russian bonds could be a prelude to stricter curbs that ban them from buying or selling Russia’s existing debt. The cost of insuring Russian debt against default soared, with five-year credit default swaps trading at a spread of 906 basis points from about 120bp at the start of this year.The spread is now well above the levels struck after Russia seized Crimea in 2014. In a sign of deepening concern, some dealers have switched to a type of pricing often used in distressed credits.Now that Russia has attacked Ukraine “the sanctions hit is going to be significant unlike the soft sanctions imposed on Tuesday and Wednesday”, said Charlie Robertson, chief economist at Renaissance Capital, referring to measures announced by the US, EU and UK earlier this week.Ukrainian bonds also extended their recent declines, with the price of a bond maturing in 2032 falling to 36 cents on the dollar, according to Refinitiv, a highly distressed level. Investors said some brokers were quoting much lower prices for Ukrainian debt. A “full-blown war” would likely cause Ukraine to default on its debt, Robertson said.
186  President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Russia’s western neighbour could well slam the brakes on the post-pandemic economic recovery. A surge in the oil price to more than $100 a barrel signals supply shock fears. Higher energy prices will squeeze household incomes and stoke inflation, accentuating central banks’ dilemma over interest rates.News of the invasion pushed prices up 8 per cent on Thursday. Russia is Europe’s most important supplier of natural gas and the world’s third-largest oil producer, producing 10mn barrels daily.Commodity traders had already responded to the rising tensions of recent weeks. Other than European natural gas futures, Brent has been the fastest rising commodity this year, up 35 per cent to more than $105. Worse, oil has quintupled in just two years. That is much faster than anything economies have experienced in more than 30 years, including the two Gulf wars.All that will translate into pocketbook pain for households in the US, globally the largest consumer. The impact of surging oil prices is swiftly passed on to US consumers, as — relative to Europe and Japan — it is lightly taxed at the pump. Already the cost of filling up is approaching 2014 levels, at more than $3 a gallon on average. High prices then caused gasoline demand to falter.Another flashing amber light comes from the metric of oil consumption as a proportion of GDP. Since the Opec oil shocks of the 1970s, any increase in this percentage to much over 4 per cent has signalled problems ahead. Assume that economic growth this year tapers down to low single digits and at today’s Brent price that figure will be roughly there.It is possible that oil supply could surprise. US shale drillers could potentially increase output by 2mn barrels a day or more by 2024, according to Rystad Energy. Saudi Arabia could pump more. Iran’s return to the oil markets is also a possibility, say traders.But the options are limited, given the investment squeeze by big producers in recent years. Europe’s dependence upon Russia’s natural gas is a serious worry. The fossil fuel provides a fifth of the EU’s energy needs, most of that from Russia. Europe is thus at the front line, in more ways than one. Putin’s invasion threatens Europe’s economies.
187  The writer is founder and head of R.Politik, a political analysis firmRussian president Vladimir Putin on Thursday began a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine. Ultimately, Russian troops are likely to end up fighting their way to Kyiv. Remember this day: it is a day when the Putin regime made a dramatic change of course, a day when a new, more offensive Russia came into being.These events have little in common with the 2008 war in Georgia or Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. In those cases, Russian military deployments were largely reactive: the agenda was shaped by external events and Moscow simply responded, often acting in an off-the-cuff fashion. Now, however, the manner of the country’s behaviour, its decision-making processes and its actions have a very different quality.Putin’s transformation into a messiah-like figure wedded to a cult of the state has been illuminated in recent days. He is nurturing a new Leviathan set in a grim bedrock of revanchist conservatism. Armed with a belief in his historical destiny, Putin is acting more strongly and boldly. He is crossing red lines, sacrificing achievements like the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and exposing the economy to draconian western sanctions. Serving the “sacred state” reduces his personal culpability and frees him to act without restraint. But it also makes it much more challenging for others to deal with him. We are witnessing Putin’s increasing isolation, arrogance and disregard for decency.While the regime remains strong, there is little chance of significant opposition protests. The latest polls show that Russia’s propaganda machine remains highly effective: a large majority of Russians blame the west and Kyiv for escalation in the Donbas. Even if a minority opposes Putin’s recent moves, few will voice that opposition in public.Unlike the outpouring of national pride after the seizure of Crimea, Russians today are exhausted by geopolitical tension, angry about a focus on foreign affairs and fearful of world war. There is a sense of fatality and doom. A major conflict in Ukraine will only strengthen Moscow’s current political trajectory: more repression, indiscriminate persecution of anyone expressing ideas that “threaten” traditional values or patriotic spiritual bonds, and a rolling political purge.Military conflict with Ukraine will also have a serious impact on the ruling elite. Consider the nervousness of those who spoke at the National Security Council meeting on Monday that approved recognition of the separatist statelets in eastern Ukraine. Demiurges of Putin’s Russia — spy chiefs Alexander Bortnikov and Sergei Naryshkin, and Putin’s point-man on Ukraine, Dmitry Kozak — looked hesitant, even helpless. An elite that is humiliated, or sidelined from strategic decision-making, will make the state less effective. But even if Putin retains the support of his inner circle, the respect of bureaucrats, businesspeople, investors, scientists and artists will dissipate as international isolation and economic pain harm the interests of those who want to live in a Russia that does not throw everything away for the cause of historical revisionism.The invasion will have significant ramifications for Russian society. The regime is becoming less interested in its ordinary people. The whole system is switching from the “power of authority”, based on popular legitimacy, to the “authority of power” — reliance on repression rather than constructive strategy. Putin will have to stay in power for as long as physically possible, and he will have to rely more and more on security officials, who are the most hawkish and conservative part of the elite.As time passes, public discontent and anger will gradually accumulate. By dismantling mechanisms for society to blow off steam and tightening political conditions, Putin is planting a bomb under the Russian state. Inevitably, it will explode with great violence, causing massive destruction when the regime begins to fall apart.Letter in response to this article:Make Russia feel like a walled-off USSR / From Patrick Uden, London NW1, UK
188  Wintershall Dea, one of the main European investors in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, said it expected to be compensated for the €730mn it has invested in the project if the fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine prevented it from becoming operational.The German group, which is Europe’s largest private energy exploration and production company, is one of five companies to have lent money to Russia’s Gazprom for the project, alongside Shell, Germany’s Uniper, France’s Engie and Austria’s OMV.After years of supporting it, the German government announced on Tuesday that it would suspend the approval of Nord Stream 2, in retaliation for Russia’s actions.US president Joe Biden said on Wednesday that his administration would also impose sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG, the wholly owned Gazprom subsidiary building the pipeline.In its annual report published on Thursday, Wintershall Dea said that “even if there might be a delay in commissioning due to the not yet completed certification process, we expect that the contractual obligations towards the financial investors will be fulfilled”.It added: “Should the commissioning of Nord Stream 2 be prevented by political intervention, we assume that the project company will be able to enforce compensation claims. Currently, Wintershall Dea sees no reasonable scenario in which there will be political intervention without compensation.”The company refused to take questions from analysts in a planned annual results conference on Thursday, and said it would issue further statements once there was “greater clarity” on the situation with Russia and Ukraine, which it was “observing with great concern and dismay”.On Wednesday, Uniper said it would not seek direct compensation for its investment, which is of a similar size to Wintershall Dea’s.“I would believe that if anyone would consider legal actions against German government or the EU Commission, it would be Nord Stream 2, the legal entity,” Uniper’s chief executive Klaus-Dieter Maubach told reporters.“I don’t have any reason to believe that they are considering [any] such kind of action,” he added.Engie did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while Shell declined to comment. OMV said it could not comment on compensation, but had a crisis team in place “that continuously analyses and evaluates the situation so that appropriate measures can be taken if necessary”.In a call on Thursday, Wintershall Dea’s chief financial officer Paul Smith said that “whilst we can fully expect a great deal of volatility going forward, the fundamentals remain robust for double-digit gas prices in the near to medium term”. He cited the political situation as one of the drivers of high prices.Wintershall Dea is majority owned by German chemicals group BASF, and has been working with Russian gas for more than 30 years. It has three joint ventures with Gazprom in the country, including in Western Siberia. Its minority shareholder is Letter One, which is controlled by Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman.Chief executive Mario Mehren said last week that he would join a scheduled meeting between Russian president Vladimir Putin and German business leaders in March.In a statement provided following a cancelled press conference on Thursday, Mehren described Russia’s actions as a “hard blow”. He added: “The latest military escalation also shakes the economic co-operation between Russia and Europe that has been built up over decades and will have far-reaching consequences. To what extent cannot yet be foreseen.”
189  Russia has decided to embark on a full scale invasion of Ukraine. So, in the shadow of the one of the worst days for European democracy since the Second World War, forgive the sombre tone.Markets, as you might imagine, are lurching.Here’s the Russian stock index — the Moex — down 29 per cent after falling as much as 50 per cent in early trading. Via the FT:The ruble, also, is sinking — touching 84 to the dollar compared with 75 at 2021’s start.The European and American indices are not fairing much better. Across the pond, S&P 500 futures are down 2 per cent while the Nasdaq is off 2.5 per cent. The FTSE 100, despite its broad exposure to spiking energy prices (oil has ticked past $100 per barrel), is off 2.9 per cent while the Dax is down 4.5 per cent. There’s little escape. Even crypto is selling off, with Bitcoin down almost 10 per cent to $35,000. Gold, as a safe haven asset, is up 3.2 per cent to $1,975, its highest level since August 2020.Given Europe’s reliance on Russian energy, the sharp escalation in tensions over Ukraine is expected to have an immediate impact on energy prices. Oil soared past $100 per barrel earlier today, while inflation — already high on the back of the earlier spike in energy costs — is expected to rise further in the coming months.Looking beyond the immediate humanitarian impact, the effect on the UK economy will depend on what happens next and how long commodity prices remain elevated for.“Inflation in the UK will now probably rise beyond the 7.5 per cent peak we had expected in April and will remain higher for longer. A good general guideline is that a $10 increase in a barrel of oil increases inflation over the next year by about 0.15 [percentage points],” said Thomas Pugh, economist at consultants RSM UK. “The direct effects on inflation will also likely extend to food prices. Between them, Russia and Ukraine export a quarter of the world’s wheat, and Ukraine is a major corn exporter. This would put further upward pressure on food prices, which were already rising by 4 per cent y/y in December. All this will exacerbate the cost of living crisis and depress GDP growth.”The historical stock market reaction to war, however, is weaker than you might think. Costas Milas, professor at the University of Liverpool sent us the following chart based on a geopolitical risk index compiled by Dario Caldara and Matteo Iacoviello at the Federal Reserve Board:According to the blurb on the economists’ website, the index “reflects automated text-search results of the electronic archives of 10 newspapers: Chicago Tribune, the Daily Telegraph, Financial Times, The Globe and Mail, The Guardian, the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post”.The question now is, with the world more interconnected than it has ever been — from capital to trade to immigration flows — will that weak correlation hold? We’re about to find out.Update: In response to some of our readers’ comments, Professor Milas has provided a chart going back to 1900. It is based on text searches of articles in three newspapers (not ten like the earlier version). The historical S&P data is based on work by Robert Shiller. For this extended period, it turns out the relationship between stock market and geopolitical tensions is even less pronounced than it has been over the past 35 years.
190  We are creeping towards spring, gaining nearly four minutes of extra daylight each day. The daffodils are breaking through with the promise of cheer to come. But the average maximum temperature for the UK this month, 7C, is pretty much the same as it was in December.You might be forgiven for casting an envious eye towards Europe and thinking of a second home in the sun. You may even fancy a co-ownership model that gives you a stake in several homes across Europe — Nice is nice at 11C in February, with Rhodes at 15C, Lisbon at 16C and Seville at a balmy 17C.Quite a few of my clients have second homes across the Channel. Often they were bought as a retirement extravagance. With the prospect of no longer working and the kids having left home, they dreamt of being free to take flight for several months.Many still love their escape homes. But the experience of others is worth sharing for those browsing online, entranced by alluring pictures of terracotta Tuscan tiles, swimming pools and olive trees. The idea is great. But making it a reality can be more of a challenge.Even before Brexit, buying a second home in Europe was something you did under advice and with care. Tax rules vary from country to country and in some can be brutal. In Switzerland, for instance, if you buy a second home you may be liable to tax based on the hypothetical annual rental value, even if you do not rent it out.Now the UK is no longer part of the EU, there are new issues to contend with. I have a client whose husband has dementia. Change triggers confusion and stress for him. Historically, the couple have spent six months every year in their holiday home in Spain, but now UK visitors to any of the Schengen area countries — covering most of Europe — are subject to the 90/180-day rule. This means they cannot stay for more than 90 days in any 180-day period.There are ways around this. In Spain you can apply for a Golden Visa — a residence visa issued to non-EU nationals who make a significant investment in the Spanish economy.To be eligible you must purchase property (one or more) worth a total of €500,000, make an investment in Spanish public debt of at least €2mn, buy shares in a company or make a deposit in a Spanish bank of at least €1mn. The visa covers your spouse, children under 18 and dependent elderly parents.The residence permit can be renewed indefinitely, as long as you maintain your investment. And if you plan to live in Spain you can apply for permanent residence after five years of continuous residency — spending at least six months of each year there. After 10 years you can get Spanish citizenship.Portugal has a similar scheme, though the numbers differ and there are restrictions on where you can buy a property if you are applying for a Golden Visa. Forget a lovely coastal villa. You may find yourself constrained by the regulations to buying in designated interior and sparsely populated areas — living on your own in the middle of nowhere or in areas of poverty.Back in Spain, meanwhile, the simplest way my clients have found to get round the 90/180-day rule is to go through a bank, depositing €1mn. Not ideal in a time of increasing inflation and with currency exposure in addition — but for them better than moving to a more costly property and enduring all the change that entails.Other clients have decided to dispose of their properties. But this can present issues, too.Agents’ fees can be chunky. In France they are typically 5 to 10 per cent, which is negotiable. So haggle, as the seller may find themselves responsible for all of that.You will have to provide several technical reports to potential buyers and are legally obliged to tell them about anything that may affect their decision to buy — like the dodgy roof and the rotting floor joists. There may be capital gains tax, too.Be aware that if someone offers the full asking price you are legally obliged to accept it. If you do not, the agent can sue for breach of contract. This can lead to unexpected pressure.The rules around inheritance can also be an issue in some countries, so it is important to check the requirements for a local will.This brings me to the issue of timeshare schemes. I have many clients who would like to dispose of theirs. Usually these go back 30 or 40 years, when they were very popular and heavily marketed. I have a raft of clients who inherited these but cannot sell them because there is little or no market for them.Others are affected on the other side of the equation. Because of the way timeshare schemes work, the costs of maintenance, administration and ownership are shared across the owners. If some owners stop paying their annual charge — going into default — this builds an increasing debt against the property.Timeshare owners can work together to make a disposal, but this is an added challenge on top of the complexity and costs of selling abroad anyway — which are not inconsiderable, thanks to agents’ fees, legal fees and tax. Where the original owners have lost capacity there can also the complication of having UK powers of attorney recognised in a different jurisdiction.The lesson is to think very carefully before buying a second home or falling for some of the modern variants of timeshare. Look at the rules around selling when you are buying and consider what happens on your death — remember the rules and tax position may change and will need monitoring.But if you think ahead and buy smartly, a second home abroad can be a sunny solace to get you through the winter blues.Charles Calkin is a financial planner at wealth manager James Hambro & Partners
191  As Vladimir Putin began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, western powers were gathering to put together a round of sanctions aimed at inflicting real pain on the Russian economy.The sanctions already put in place over the past week took aim at smaller banks, a handful of oligarchs, the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and the trading of Russia’s sovereign debt. But experts say that to really squeeze Putin, the west needs to take aim at the country’s biggest banks.“To name just a few oligarchs and a handful of tier two and three banks — if you are Russia, you will really feel like you have gotten away with something,” said Jason Hungerford, a partner specialising in sanctions at law firm Mayer Brown.Now world leaders are preparing to go further. US president Joe Biden said he would meet his G7 counterparts on Thursday to co-ordinate “severe” sanctions.Elina Ribakova, deputy chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, said the banks already on the US and European sanctions lists were too isolated from the global economy to have any meaningful impact.If the US were to target Russia’s largest state banks such as Sberbank, VTB and Gazprombank, however, “you could have very important systemic effects on Russia”, she said.The lenders already targeted account for about 5 per cent of Russia’s total bank assets, compared with 32.6 per cent for Sberbank, 16.4 per cent for VTB and 7 per cent for Gazprombank, according to data provided to Russia’s central bank.“You have the risk of bank runs, you have the risk of tightening financial conditions, and you could have low, if not negative, growth this quarter,” Ribakova said. “These banks facilitate the transactions with Russia for global trade, so foreign partners will have to find new banks that they can work with.”Expanded banking sanctions would also likely have a chilling effect, whereby most foreign institutions would over-comply and not transact with Russia at all without explicit permission from western authorities, Ribakova added.Sanctions against Sberbank, which controls a third of Russia’s retail deposits and where one in two Russians have an account, would be particularly painful because of its role in paying salaries and pensions, according to Maria Shagina, a visiting senior research fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs.State-controlled Gazprombank is the main conduit for foreign payments for oil and gas, and imposing sanctions on it would be potentially risky for Russia, she said. “The collateral damage is something everyone is afraid of,” she added.Shares in Sberbank, which is majority-owned by the government, fell 46 per cent over the past six months as tensions in Ukraine ramped up, though investors were relieved after the bank was not included on the US or UK sanctions lists. However, following Thursday morning’s invasion, its shares plummeted more than 50 per cent.European banks with a big presence in Russia were also hit hard. Shares in Raiffeisen, the Austrian lender that generates more than a third of its profits from Russia, fell 16.8 per cent in early trading, while Italy’s UniCredit and France’s Société Générale, which have large operations in the country were also hit harder than the border banking sector.By mid-morning, UniCredit shares fell 8.8 per cent and SocGen had dropped 8.3 per cent compared with a 6 per cent fall for the Stoxx Europe 600 Bank index.Sberbank said in a statement that it “has all necessary resources, managerial experience and expertise for operating in the current environment”. The Black Sea Bank for Development and Reconstruction, which was subject to sanctions by the UK, said “we have been under US sanctions since 2017 without them impacting how the bank operates.and the new UK sanctions will have no impact on the bank”.Gazprombank and VTB did not respond to requests for comment.The western allies had kept their most potent financial sanctions in reserve in expectation of brinkmanship with Putin. Alongside hitting Russia’s biggest banks, other tools they could use include cutting the country off from the global Swift payments system and blocking access to US dollar clearing.Removing Russia from Swift, the international payments network that allows banks to exchange information about transactions, would be a heavy blow to its biggest banks and the country’s ability to trade outside its borders.It would also stymie Russia’s ability to recoup international profits from its oil and gas exports, which account for more than 40 per cent of its revenue.Swift, a Belgian co-operative, is used by more than 11,000 banks and financial institutions worldwide and handles 42mn messages a day, facilitating trillions of dollars worth of transactions. Russia itself accounted for 1.5 per cent of transactions in 2020.Being cut off from Swift would not prevent Russian banks from carrying out cross-border transactions, but doing so would become more costly and arduous. Foreign dealings would rely on the use of less efficient communication tools, such as email and telex.The impact would also be damaging for Europe, which relies on Russia for more than 40 per cent of its natural gas supply and 26 per cent of oil.“There will be a huge fallout for European banks,” said a senior executive at a foreign lender with a large Russian presence. “We are not talking about Iran or North Korea; Russia is much more integrated into the flow of goods globally.”The person added: “You can open Pandora’s box, but be aware of what comes out. You would create a big mess in Russia, but also for cross-border payment services. How would Europe pay their gas bill without Swift?”US politicians called for the move following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 but faced resistance from European countries that felt it was too severe. The US, however, successfully lobbied to kick Iran off Swift in 2012 and again 2018 after the country was reinstated in 2016.Russia has attempted to limit the threat of losing access to Swift by developing its own system, though it has attracted few banks outside its borders and is used for just 20 per cent of domestic payments.Bill Browder, the high-profile Kremlin critic and sanctions campaigner who advises governments on their negotiations with Putin, said removing Russia from Swift should be a last resort. “They should sanction 50 Putin oligarchs in short order,” he said.However, taking such action would also require support from the EU, which has so far been squeamish about pulling the trigger on such an explosive weapon.The US would be able to act unilaterally by blocking Russian companies from converting roubles to hard currency through its control of the dollar clearing system, overseen by the Federal Reserve.Doing so would cut off Russian companies from the US banking system and hamper even the most straightforward transactions internationally.More than half of Russian exports are denominated in US dollars — down from 80 per cent at the end of 2013 — which is equivalent to $300bn or 19 per cent of GDP, according to Fitch. An additional 29 per cent of exports are denominated in euros.Russia and its banks have prepared for the potential hit from sanctions by boosting their dollar reserves and liquidity levels. The banks have $11bn of cash on hand and an additional $73bn in short-term deposits with other banks to respond to an increase in withdrawals, according to Fitch.The US has used this tool effectively when implementing sanctions against Iran and Sudan, though Russia’s wider reach in the global financial markets would mean that employing it this time would have big consequences for foreign counterparties and banks.“The ability for Russians to trade, pay for goods with roubles with the west or to raise funds on the capital markets could be severely impacted if any of these measures were taken,” said Paul Feldberg, a partner specialising in sanctions at law firm Jenner & Block.“There would be a profound effect on the Russian economy — but whether or not Putin cares is another question.”Additional reporting by Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli in Milan and Stephen Morris in London
192  During wars there are always havens of bliss. In Evelyn Waugh’s semi-autobiographical novel Officers and Gentlemen, British troops on their way to fight in Egypt land in Cape Town in 1941 for a stopover in paradise: baths, wine, sun and women to dance with. They enjoy “the spoils of farms and gardens, baskets of oranges and biblical bunches of grapes”.Today that haven is western Europe. Here in Madrid, where I’m spending some time, spring has come, the pandemic is waning and the lakeside restaurants in the Casa de Campo park are packed. In 1936 the Casa de Campo was a body-strewn battlefield in Spain’s civil war; the odd bunker still remains. Now phones ping with reports from Ukraine. How should we wine-drinking western Europeans process events on the other side of our continent? What can we do for Ukrainians?Blood used to be spilled almost equally on both sides of Europe. But then Germany stopped invading, while Russia continued. (Europe’s other military giants, Britain and France, generally did their worst damage in distant colonies.) Since 1945, western Europe has enjoyed a holiday from history. That has bred an unearned sense of moral superiority vis-à-vis unluckier people. Refugees from faraway wars are seen as incarnating the chaos they are fleeing.As we await a potential Ukrainian influx, I remember an Iraqi Kurd I met in “The Jungle” refugee camp near Calais in 2015. He had walked a thousand miles to get there. When a diabetic friend died while crossing Bulgaria, their exhausted group couldn’t move the man’s body, and a Bulgarian policeman told them, “It’s not my fucking problem.” I asked the Kurd if he’d encountered any kindness in Europe. He blew out smoke and reflected. “No. In Germany I was asking people in English, ‘What time is the train?’ They didn’t help me. ‘Humanity’ is just a name.” Look around The Jungle, he said. Europeans couldn’t provide even one clean toilet.Remarkably, some people in our safe haven are now rooting for Putin. Over a fifth of western Europeans trust him to do the right thing in international affairs, reported Pew Research last year — not bad given the generally dismal approval ratings of modern politicians. Putin’s apologists explain that the poor fellow had to attack Ukraine because Nato expanded into eastern Europe. Some blame the US for this conflict, possibly because they remain understandably irate about past American wars.Perhaps Nato shouldn’t have expanded. But pro-Putin arguments would be more credible if there were the remotest prospect of Ukraine joining Nato, or if any western democracy had attacked Russia in a century. Putin’s angry speech on Monday made clear his basic war aim: he believes Ukraine belongs in the Russian empire.What’s true is that Ukraine and Russia are hopelessly intertwined. When I was doing research in the former USSR 30 years ago, my landlady in Moscow was the daughter of a Red Army officer who had invaded Germany. In this officer’s regiment there had been a Ukrainian, and when I went to Kyiv, the Red Army network fixed me up in the Ukrainian’s daughter’s apartment. This week I emailed another Ukrainian acquaintance, an anti-Putinist from Kharkiv, to ask if she was safe. Very safe, she replied; she now lives in Moscow.But history is full of wars between neighbours, and many Ukrainians may head west, as refugees or economic migrants. (The country has already shrunk from about 51mn inhabitants in 1992 to 43mn now. In that period, Spain’s population has jumped from 39mn to 47mn, partly thanks to immigration, as Europe rebalances towards its lucky side.)Like many people who flee here, Ukrainians will marvel at our untouched innocence. An Angolan immigrant to France once told me: Europeans are babies. When they’re unemployed, the state gives them money. In Angola, he said, many unemployed people die. Western Europeans take out 30-year mortgages, and plan their pensions, because they have learnt that life is predictable. Some of them can imagine no greater outrage than a refugee drawing state support from their taxes.I suspect western Europeans will be relatively welcoming to white Christian Ukrainians. After Germany invaded white Christian Belgium in 1914, Britain took in 250,000 Belgians, the largest single influx ever into the country, while the little Netherlands briefly hosted a million Belgian refugees. Many Hungarians in 1956 and Czechs in 1968 also found western havens. Some melted into native populations within a generation.I hope we’ll be kind to Ukrainians. I hope we’ll crack down on lawyers, public relations firms, private schools, estate agents and political parties — not only in London — who live off the Putinist elite’s plunder. I also hope we’ll keep drinking wine by lakesides. That may be the zenith of the whole human enterprise. Everyday European life is what most Ukrainians long for.
193  There is war in Europe today, shattering the illusions of anyone who doubted that Russian president Vladimir Putin was planning to take control of Ukraine by force. But the fog of war has long been spreading out thickly from Moscow. We should do our best to pierce it, so as to arm ourselves with knowledge about what is happening.One particular notion has caught on thanks to the Kremlin’s information campaigns. This is that it is Nato expansion, and the prospects of Ukraine’s membership of the western alliance, that is at the root of Putin’s aggression. There is no doubt that Russia’s autocrat has always resented one former Moscow satellite after another joining Nato, and does not want to allow Ukrainians to choose the same route. But letting Putin define the conflict in these terms obscures how Ukrainians have also been turning westwards along non-military dimensions.We should talk as much about this as about Nato. As Sam Greene, a politics professor at King’s College London, put it in an excellent Twitter thread earlier this month: “The inconvenient truth of the present crisis is that behind all the rhetoric about NATO, Moscow’s beef is fundamentally with the EU.It’s worth remembering that Russia’s 2014 invasion of Ukraine was sparked by a trade treaty, not by a near- or even midterm threat of NATO expansion.”Ukraine chose in 2014 that it wanted to integrate economically with the EU. With that came a choice about an entire set of ways of running society, because the EU tends to demand partners to adopt its values, standards and rules to access its markets (the balance of power changes once a country becomes a member state, as Hungary and Poland show). In what was becoming a global stand-off between western liberal democratic market economies and illiberal autocratic state-managed capitalism, Ukrainians have clearly opted for the former.Since Putin is now using violence to try to undo this choice, it behoves us to recognise how consequential Ukraine’s European turn had already been on the ground. The practical effects of Kyiv looking west — most concretely in signing an association agreement with the EU — had already brought significant change, despite the continuing challenges of corruption, ill governance and underdevelopment. (Ukrainian and Polish gross domestic products per person were the same in 1989; today Poland’s is three times bigger. See the chart below.)Above all, the shift in trade patterns has been significant. The Institute of International Finance has calculated that in 2013, the shares of Ukrainian exports to the EU and Russia both stood at about 25 per cent of the total; by 2019 the EU share was nearing 50 per cent, while less than 10 per cent were destined for Russia.Trade has shifted on the import side too. After 2014, Ukraine has weaned itself completely off Russian natural gas for its own needs. Instead, it procures all its gas imports from “European competitive markets”, according to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. While Kyiv earns a lot of money in transit fees for Russian gas going to EU customers — that is what Nord Stream 2 threatened — that is about cash, which can be replaced, and not about energy security. Both, of course, are threatened by Putin’s invasion.Then there are people. Granting Ukrainians visa-free travel to the EU in 2017 “changed the existential direction of Ukraine towards the west”, as one Ukrainian friend once expressed to me. And many do more than just visit. In 2019, 750,000 residence permits were issued to Ukrainians by EU countries.This economic integration paid economic dividends. Until the Covid-19 pandemic, overall growth chugged along nicely. A recent IMF report shows that real wages had almost doubled since 2016. But, of course, the most important effect is Ukrainians’ strengthening psychological and political affiliation with the west — which Kremlin’s aggressions have only served to reinforce.This choice of a European path in 2014 is central to today’s attack. It is what toppled Putin’s man in Kyiv, Viktor Yanukovych. It was immediately followed by the Russian invasion of Crimea and support for the Luhansk and Donetsk rebellions. Putin’s public rejection of Ukrainian sovereignty on Monday came on the eighth anniversary of Yanukovych’s removal from power.Why should Putin care about Ukraine’s non-military political choices? The logic is easy enough to explain. It is impossible to have economic integration with both the EU and Russia; a country has to choose. But choosing the EU also means — at least in principle and in due time — rejecting the corrupt and autocratic governance that characterises Russia and that it would serve Putin for Ukraine to retain.German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock put it with perfect clarity this morning: “This war is intended to destroy one thing — Ukrainians’ hope that after decades of unfreedom they have a right to democracy, a right to peace and to a better future without oppression.”Let there be no doubt that Putin’s war is a punishment for Ukraine’s desire to be a European country living by the values the EU was built to protect. That is what we must defend.
194  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
195  The phoney war is over. The real war has begun. For several weeks, the US and British governments have believed that Vladimir Putin was intent on a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. That is now happening.The precise targets of the Russian military are still emerging. But it is already clear that this is not a limited attack, confined to the disputed regions of eastern Ukraine. Explosions have been heard in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. And there are reports of Russian troops crossing the border from Belarus — which is the shortest and most direct route to Kyiv.Western security services, which have accurately predicted the course of events up until now, believe that Putin intends to overthrow the Ukrainian government and install a puppet regime in its place. This “decapitation” strategy will take in not only the central government, but also regional and local governments. Lists have been drawn up of Ukrainian officials who will be arrested or killed.The military tactics that Russia uses are likely to be extremely brutal — “the kind of thing we saw in Syria and Chechnya”, according to one US official. The deployment of Russian artillery and its air force would mean heavy military and civilian casualties on the Ukrainian side. Some western sources have spoken of 50,000 deaths within a week.The Ukrainian military is determined to fight back. But it is likely to find itself heavily outgunned. The Russian goal may be to surround Kyiv and force the collapse or resignation of the Ukrainian government, led by Volodymyr Zelensky.The Russians will not want to get involved in urban warfare, if they can avoid it. They are also determined to keep the west out of this conflict. In his speech, announcing the invasion, Putin warned outsiders tempted to interfere that there would be “consequences you have never encountered in your history” — a thinly veiled reference to nuclear war.For now, the western reaction will be confined to economic sanctions. Fearing that this moment was fast approaching, US and European diplomats have been working on a co-ordinated sanctions package for some weeks. That will be rolled out over the coming days.Russia will now be hit with financial, individual and technological sanctions. Russian banks will be cut off from finance. Powerful Russian individuals will find themselves unable to travel to the west and will have their assets in western banks frozen. Russia will be cut off from advanced technology — such as semiconductors and aircraft parts.The effects on the Russian economy are likely to be profound. But that is unlikely to divert Putin from his chosen course. The Russian leader himself is not going to go hungry. Instead, he is likely to use the war he has unleashed as an excuse to wipe out the last vestiges of political freedom in Russia. The country will now tilt into full-scale dictatorship, which will make it easier to stamp out any dissent from Russians dismayed by the course that Putin has chosen.An economic rupture between Russia and the west will also have serious economic consequences for Europe and the US. Even before this conflict broke out, energy prices were soaring. If Russia cuts off gas supplies to Europe, then consumers and industry will suffer badly. The direct effects will be felt most heavily in those countries that are most dependent on Russian gas — in particular Germany and Italy. But the whole of the western world could be tipped into recession and inflation. And western political leaders are much more vulnerable to public opinion than Putin.Although Nato has made it clear that it intends to stay out of the war in Ukraine, there is a risk that the conflict could expand. One scenario that western leaders are concerned about is that the Russian air force may chase the Ukrainians into Polish airspace. That could lead to direct clashes between the Russians and Poland, a Nato member. Russian air strikes could also kill Americans or Europeans still resident in Ukraine, increasing pressure on their governments to respond.Western governments are also actively debating how to help a Ukrainian insurgency — if and when it emerges — to fight a Russian occupation. Supporters of this plan of action believe that it will be both a moral duty and a strategic imperative to allow Ukrainians to continue the fight. Others worry that supporting an insurgency could turn Ukraine into a new Syria on the borders of Europe.These debates will take on an increasing urgency in the coming weeks. But, for now, Putin has the initiative.Letter in response to this article:The lessons to take from the Cuban missile crisis / From Guill Gil, London N1, UK
196  For the second time this week, Vladimir Putin addressed Russians from a wood-panelled room in the Kremlin as he laid out his justifications for the start of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine — possibly the largest military attack in Europe since the second world war and one that he had likely long planned.The Russian president slouched behind his desk wearing the same suit and tie as in an earlier address, broadcast on Monday. He brimmed with resentment at Ukraine’s right to exist in its current form and made clear that he was prepared to go ahead with the invasion at all costs.“Whoever tries to stand in our way or create threats for our country and people should know Russia’s response will be immediate and lead you to consequences you have never encountered in your history,” Putin said.US intelligence had repeatedly warned Russia was planning a series of “false flag” attacks to create a pretext for war by accusing Ukraine of attacking two separatist territories in the eastern Donbas region, whose independence Moscow recognised earlier this week.But even though the separatists asked Russia to help them repel “Ukrainian aggression”, recent events on the frontline were only an afterthought in Putin’s speech. His grievances with Ukraine and the west, he made clear, run far deeper.Putin accused the west of turning Ukraine into a “hostile anti-Russia on our own historical territories” for the US to use as a platform to attack Russia. He cited the right to self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN charter.He then vowed “to defend people who have been victims” of “the Kyiv regime” and “demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine”.The calls amounted to a vow of regime change. Russia claims that Ukraine is under the thumb of radicals inspired by nationalists who fought the Soviet Union alongside the Nazis in the second world war.Putin stressed that Russia’s goals went far beyond the Donbas — a point emphasised by air strikes that began across Ukraine immediately after his speech. He said Russia would “hand over everyone who committed bloody crimes against civilians, including Russian citizens, to court” — implying that he believed he would soon be able to do so.Though Putin denied Russia planned to occupy Ukraine, he made it clear he was intent on redrawing its borders. “Let me remind you that when the USSR was created after the second world war, people who lived in certain territories included in modern Ukraine.no one ever asked them how they themselves wanted to build their life,” he said.He also referred to the UN’s right to self-determination — a possible indication that Russia plans to create more Moscow-backed rump states in Ukraine’s south-east.And Putin appeared fully bent on regime change in Kyiv. “All responsibility for possible bloodshed will be completely and totally on the conscience of the regime ruling on Ukrainian territory,” he said.Putin’s speech was far removed from the impassioned address made a few hours earlier by Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president.Clearly on the verge of tears as he switched into his native Russian to address Russians directly, Zelensky told them: “Ukraine on your TV news and the real Ukraine are two totally different countries. Ours is real.”Zelensky, who is Jewish, rubbished Putin’s claims that Ukraine is run by Nazis. “How can a people who gave more than 8mn lives for victory over Nazism support Nazism? How can I be a Nazi? Tell that to my grandfather, who spent the whole war in the Soviet infantry, then died a colonel in independent Ukraine,” he said.Recalling people he knew and places he had been in the Donbas, Zelensky asked Russians: “I’m speaking Russian, but nobody in Russia understands what these places, streets, and events are. This is our land and our history. What are you fighting for? And with whom?”He vowed Ukraine would never surrender its independence. “We will defend ourselves. When you attack, you will see our faces, not our backs,” Zelensky said.But in the end, he added, the only people who could stop the war were Russians themselves.“I know that Russian TV will not show my speech. But citizens of Russia need to see it. They need to see the truth. The truth is you need to stop before it’s too late,” Zelensky said.He ended by quoting a famous Soviet-era antiwar song. “Do the Russians want war? I’d love to answer that question. But the answer only depends on you — citizens of Russia.”Letter in response to this article:Echoes of the puppet state of wartime Manchuria / From Ken Nannichi, Kawasaki, Japan
197  Western leaders issued a volley of condemnation and vowed reprisals against Vladimir Putin after the Russian president began a military invasion of Ukraine that many fear will be Europe’s worst conflict since the second world war.Putin on Thursday launched a barrage of missile strikes and sent troops and tanks into Ukraine, while warning that any attempt by other countries to get involved would “lead you to consequences that you have never encountered in your history”.G7 leaders are to hold a virtual summit on Thursday morning and Nato called an emergency meeting of its top decision-making body ahead of an emergency summit of EU leaders in the evening to decide further retaliatory measures.“President Putin: In the name of humanity bring your troops back to Russia. In the name of humanity do not allow to start in Europe what could be the worst war since the beginning of the century,” said António Guterres, UN secretary-general.Joe Biden said the “prayers of the entire world are with the people of Ukraine” as the US president accused Putin of launching a “premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering”.“Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable,” he said shortly after Putin used a speech on Russian television to announce the invasion.“This is a grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security,” said Jens Stoltenberg, Nato secretary-general. “I call on Russia to cease its military action immediately.Nato will do all it takes to protect and defend all allies.”Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, said: “In these dark hours, our thoughts are with Ukraine and the innocent women, men and children as they face this unprovoked attack and fear for their lives.” She added: “We will hold the Kremlin accountable.”Boris Johnson, UK prime minister, said he was “appalled.Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction”, while Mario Draghi, Italy’s prime minister, called the invasion “unjustified and unjustifiable”.Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, said: “This is a terrible day for Ukraine and a dark day for Europe. The Russian attack on Ukraine is a flagrant breach of international law. Germany condemns this reckless act of President Putin in the strongest terms.”But Zhang Jun, China’s envoy to the UN, said the “door to a peaceful solution” was not yet fully shut and called for all countries involved to exercise restraint.“We hope that all parties concerned will stay cool-headed and rational, and commit themselves to enhancing dialogue and consultation to resolve relevant issues through negotiations,” Zhang said.The invasion came just a day after the west imposed new sanctions on Russia.On Thursday, Australia widened the list of people and institutions that will be subject to economic penalties in response to what it described as a “brutal” and “deplorable” invasion.“We must ensure that there is a cost for this violent and egregious behaviour,” Scott Morrison, Australia’s prime minister, said of the sanctions, adding that 25 individuals including politicians, military officers and mercenaries linked to the invasion would be added to the sanctions list. “There must always be a cost for such reprehensible violence,” he said.In Tokyo, Fumio Kishida, prime minister, signalled that Japan might also pile more sanctions on Russia. “If the situation deteriorates further, we must immediately consider further measures in co-operation with international society,” he said.Imran Khan, Pakistan’s prime minister, is in Moscow and was expected to meet Putin on Thursday despite domestic concern that his trip risked further alienating the US, a decades-long cold war ally with whom relations have deteriorated over the latter’s relationship with the Taliban.Additional reporting by Guy Chazan in Berlin, Amy Kazmin in Rome, Aime Williams in Washington, William Langley in Hong Kong, Benjamin Parkin in Mumbai, Nic Fildes in Sydney and Antoni Slodkowski in Tokyo
198  Hello on this dark morning, after Russia’s Vladimir Putin just ordered a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine and demanded Kyiv’s surrender, launching what could be the largest conflict in Europe since the second world war.The US, the UK, the EU and Nato condemned the move and vowed to hold the Kremlin accountable. US President Joe Biden spoke to Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky and tweeted that “allies and partners will be imposing severe sanctions on Russia”, with a G7 meeting scheduled for later in the day. Nato allies would also meet today, said secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg, “to address the consequences of Russia’s aggressive actions” and “do all it takes to protect and defend all allies”.Later this evening, EU leaders will meet in person in Brussels, with a far-reaching round of sanctions likely after the bloc adopted a first round in record time yesterday. The European Council is also likely to signal further aid to Ukraine, with many capitals having already pledged assistance bilaterally.One example is Italy, for a long time on the fence given the economic hurt a sanctions war with Moscow will incur, which yesterday said it would send financial and non-lethal aid to Ukraine.We’ll also explore how Hungary — notoriously sceptical of sanctions and favourable to the Kremlin — has also fallen in line with its EU allies and what it is doing to prepare for the full-blown war in neighbouring Ukraine.The EU is reconvening today to discuss its response to Putin’s decision to launch a full-blown war, after having rapidly pushed through a first package of targeted penalties following Russia’s initial moves to recognise Ukraine’s two breakaway republics, write Sam Fleming and Valentina Pop in Brussels.“We strongly condemn Russia’s unjustified attack on Ukraine,” tweeted European Council president Charles Michel, adding that “we will hold the Kremlin accountable”, a message repeated by many EU officials and leaders.The emergency summit — scheduled to begin at 8pm — is going to have to go well beyond symbolism as leaders debate the massive security crisis facing the continent.Ambassadors from the bloc will convene this morning to make the preparations for the European Council. The meeting this evening will take a lot longer than the hour-long discussion ahead of the EU-African Union summit one week ago, one EU official predicted.There remains an undoubted fear that when it comes to the next, far more punishing, round of sanctions EU resolve could falter in the face of the painful repercussions of the package. But diplomats stress the unaccustomed dexterity the EU showed in the first package, rapidly expanding the range of measures relatively late in the day after it became clear that the Russians were not simply recognising the two separatist-held territories in Donbas but planning to send in troops.And the advantage of the months of planning that went into the broader package is that EU member states are well aware of what the measures are, and had ample opportunity to voice their anxieties.The sanctions would include far-reaching restrictions on the Russian financial sector, the blacklisting of a swath of individuals in business and government, and voluminous export controls aimed at stifling the country’s high-tech industries. When it comes to the export controls, the measures have been carefully designed to focus on products that Russia would have a hard time finding elsewhere — including in China.Nevertheless, member states are braced for considerable economic pain as a result, with Germany expected to be the hardest hit.Michel’s letter to leaders yesterday said the topic tonight was not just how to “deal with Russia” but also how to help the Ukrainian people. This means examining ways of supporting the economy and also preparing for the prospect of an exodus of as many as 1mn refugees from Ukraine.Poland will face the highest burden of any large-scale influx of people. Unfortunately, discussions between member states and the European Commission over how to support Warsaw — and the other member states on the front line of any refugee exodus — appear far less advanced than over ways of punishing Russia for its actions.US and EU sanctions banning the trading of new Russian bonds could raise Moscow’s borrowing costs even higher and eventually shut western investors out of the country’s debt market entirely. (More here)As tensions in Ukraine escalated this week, Italy’s Prime Minister Mario Draghi tried to keep a low profile — and a moderate tone, writes Amy Kazmin in Rome.Italy’s heavy dependence on Russian gas (40 per cent of its gas imports) — and the reliance of its luxury and tourism industries on high-rolling Russian customers — means the country would be among the hardest hit in Europe by broad-based economic sanctions, and potential Russian countermeasures.Little wonder, then, that while Draghi condemned Moscow’s recognition of the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as “an unacceptable violation of Ukrainian sovereignty” on Tuesday, he still expressed hope for “a peaceful solution” that could “avoid war in the heart of Europe”.Italy is now moving to demonstrate its solidarity with the Ukrainian public — and its EU allies.Luigi Di Maio, Italy’s foreign minister, told parliament Rome would allocate €110mn to support the Ukrainians and their economy, with details on how the money would be used to be decided in conjunction with the government in Kyiv.He also told parliament Rome would send “non-lethal” military aid, such as demining equipment, to Ukraine. “We must give a clear signal of solidarity to the Ukrainian people,” Di Maio tweeted.Hungary’s government has started fortifying the country’s eastern border with Ukraine, in anticipation of the armed conflict in the neighbouring nation potentially spreading westwards, writes Marton Dunai in Budapest.Criticised for a long time for building cozy relations with Russia and raising objections to new sanctions against Moscow, Hungary has now fallen in line with western allies (including on sanctions) and made it clear it would support western efforts to resolve the conflict.Budapest would prefer a peaceful settlement but must recognise what is a war situation along the Russian-Ukrainian border, Hungarian defence minister Tibor Benko said on Tuesday, adding the armed forces must be ready for any eventuality.Hungary’s government said earlier this month — unlike other countries along Nato’s eastern flank — that it would defend its own border and did not require additional Nato troops or equipment at this point.“Citizens have no reason to fear, but we must be careful and foresighted,” Benko told a press briefing. “If the conflict in eastern Ukraine spreads to the territories of western Ukraine, we must be able to close the Hungarian-Ukrainian border.”“We must be able to secure free passage for refugees wishing to leave Ukraine while preventing armed groups from entering Hungary,” he said. “In order to strengthen the protection of the border, I ordered a military force with a sufficient number and equipment to settle in eastern Hungary.”The deployment was scheduled to start immediately, he said.Prime Minister Viktor Orban called Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday, telling him Budapest would support joint EU efforts to resolve the situation.“Viktor Orban assured Volodymyr Zelensky that Hungary, as before, will continue to support Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Orban’s press chief told Europe Express.How did we get to this point, and what will happen next? What are President Vladimir Putin’s ultimate objectives? How will sanctions affect the global financial system, energy flows and supply chains?

199  International oil benchmark Brent rose to $102 early on Thursday, the highest level since 2014. Gas prices have also jumped on rising concern over the escalating tensions in eastern Europe. The rally could accelerate, analysts say, given big producers’ limited capacity to increase supplies in response to further potential disruptions. Russia is the world’s third-largest producer of crude oil and the most important supplier of natural gas to Europe. “Spare capacity is falling and the [oil] market is having to reprice that lack of safety margin,” said Christyan Malek, head of global energy strategy at JPMorgan, which predicts Brent could rise as high as $125 a barrel in the second quarter of this year.Global spare capacity, or the amount of additional production that can be turned online within a matter of weeks, has fallen to 2.8mn barrels per day, according to JPMorgan’s calculations, well below the 5mn b/d historically desired as a buffer against any operational or geopolitical issues. As a result, Malek expects oil prices to climb higher, even if the Ukraine crisis does not disrupt Russian exports.“The oil price is going up, and an oil supercycle is inevitable,” he said. “There is nothing you can do.”Bob McNally, head of Rapidan Energy Group, said the risk of disruption was probably limited to the oil and gas that transits through Ukraine, which he said was approximately 250,000 b/d of crude and roughly 20 per cent of the gas Russia sends to Europe. But given the lack of spare capacity, McNally said the size or likelihood of a possible physical disruption did not matter. “Until it’s clear that there will not be an interruption in oil supplies and in gas, I think you’re going to see upward pressure,” he told an oil market discussion on Tuesday organised by Bloomberg.Global oil demand is expected to return to pre-pandemic levels of approximately 100mn b/d in 2022. But supply was already struggling to keep up. Spending cuts during the pandemic have compounded lower investment in production by an oil industry under pressure to reduce future emissions. Some members of the Opec producer group in particular have struggled to restore output slashed at the start of the health crisis, leading the US and a number of other big consumers to release emergency oil stocks last year to try to calm prices.One of the reasons for the lack of spare global capacity has been the failure of Opec and its allies, including Russia, to meet their production targets since July. In response, the US and other big consumers have repeatedly urged the cartel, in particular Saudi Arabia, to pump more to ease prices and calm inflation.Even if Saudi Arabia agreed to such steps, it was not clear that the proposed actions would be effective, McNally said, since boosting production would only eat further into spare capacity.Natural gas, which jumped on Wednesday to trade at more than €88 per megawatt hour is of greater immediate concern to Europe, given its dependence on Russia for 40 per cent of its supply.Wholesale prices in Europe have already soared by more 450 per cent over the past year owing to resurgent demand as lockdown restrictions have eased and reduced flows from Russia.Laurent Ruseckas, analyst at IHS Markit, a consultancy, said it was unlikely that Moscow would respond to western sanctions by cutting off gas supplies, which arrive in Europe via through pipelines that run through Ukraine, Poland under the Baltic Sea respectively.“I have never seen that as a plausible possibility. So what it really boils down to is could conflict in Ukraine disrupt gas flows somehow,” he said.Ruseckas said there was a lot of “redundancy” in the Ukraine gas pipeline network so the odds of a “stray shell” knocking out supply were low. A big disruption would therefore require intentional action by either Russia or Ukraine. “It’s difficult to assess the likelihood of that but it is certainly not a base case scenario,” he said.Russia’s energy minister Nikolai Shulginov, speaking at an energy conference in Qatar on Tuesday, said Russia was aiming to keep its gas flows “uninterrupted.” If there were a disruption, Europe would find it impossible to replace Russian supply. “There is no single country that can replace that kind of volume,” Qatar’s energy minister Saad al-Kaabi said at the same conference, adding that — much like in oil — there was not sufficient spare capacity in the market to pick up that shortfall.Energy is the world’s indispensable business and Energy Source is its newsletter.

In response, Europe was forced to draw on stockpiles, which have fallen to low levels.As part of the European reaction to Putin’s deployment of troops into Ukraine on Tuesday, Germany announced it was halting certification of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was due to bypass Ukraine to deliver Russian gas direct to Germany through the Baltic Sea.“In theory, this should not have any impact on natural gas flows to Europe, given that the pipeline is not yet operational and there is spare pipeline capacity via other routes,” said Warren Patterson, analyst at ING. “However, Russia could possibly retaliate to the suspension process by further reducing overall Russian gas flows to Europe.”
200  China is ready to throw Russia an economic lifeline as Vladimir Putin’s ties with the west deteriorate and Moscow is hit by snowballing sanctions over the crisis in Ukraine.Putin ordered the start of a military invasion of Ukraine on Thursday and demanded Kyiv’s army lay down its weapons, just a day after the west imposed new sanctions on Russia.US president Joe Biden said he would meet G7 counterparts on Thursday morning and would reveal further measures to punish Russia for the invasion.Financial analysts and geopolitical experts believed China would probably help Russia weather those sanctions, mostly through resource deals and lending by several state-owned banks, while seeking to avoid damage to its own economic and financial interests.“The level of Chinese support for Russian actions could be an influential factor in shaping an evolving crisis,” said Tom Rafferty, a Beijing-based analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit.Since Russia concentrated 190,000 troops near the Ukraine border, Beijing has tried to strike a balance between Chinese president Xi Jinping’s backing of Putin and Beijing’s self-interest in the region’s stability.In the hours after the invasion started, Zhang Jun, China’s envoy to the UN, said the “door to a peaceful solution” was not yet fully shut and urged all parties to exercise restraint.While Russian troops poured into Ukraine backed by artillery and missile bombardments, Hua Chunying, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, rejected describing Moscow’s moves as an invasion and repeated the Russian defence ministry’s statements.However, a day earlier, Beijing had reaffirmed its opposition to “all illegal unilateral sanctions”.“Since 2011, the US has imposed more than 100 sanctions on Russia,” Hua, told reporters in Beijing.“However, have the US sanctions solved any problem? Is the world a better place because of those sanctions? Will the Ukraine issue resolve itself thanks to the US sanctions on Russia? Will European security be better guaranteed thanks to the US sanctions on Russia?”Hua also labelled the US the “culprit” in the Ukraine crisis, “heightening tensions, creating panic and even hyping up the possibility of warfare”.Beijing has a record of providing economic support to Moscow during Putin’s stand-offs with the west, including in the wake of the Russian annexation of Crimea in early 2014.“Unless the west puts a really tangible cost on China, China will still help Russia behind the scenes,” said Jakub Jakobowski, a senior fellow with the China programme at the Eastern Studies Centre in Warsaw. China’s big policy banks, which are distinct from its state-backed commercial lenders, are expected to be critical conduits for economic support.Russia is by far Beijing’s biggest recipient of loans from official sector institutions, totalling as much as $151bn between 2000 and 2017, according to AidData, an international research lab at the College of William & Mary in Virginia.Those included $86bn of non-concessional and semi-concessional debt from China’s state-owned policy banks and commercial banks — mostly loans collateralised against future receipts from oil exports.China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China, in particular, are believed to be insulated from western penalties by a lack of US business interests.“They have less exposure to the dollar system and more options to finance things in different or innovative ways which are less vulnerable to sanctions measures,” said Rafferty.“For the commercial banks.they would still be very mindful of the impact it could have on their operations in other markets and their access to the US dollar system.”Chinese policy banks’ main lending activities are in the “global south”, Jakobowski said. “They have less worry about getting hit for violating US sanctions,” he added. “China will likely again lend money to Russia following the state-to-state sanctions-proof model.”Since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Beijing’s ability to soften the blow from sanctions has been strengthened as the two countries have steadily reduced the use of the dollar in their bilateral trade. Sino-Russian economic ties have also firmed. Bilateral trade hit a record high of more than $145bn in 2021, reflecting consistent double-digit annual growth.The success of Russian efforts to take the sting out of sanctions by boosting settlements in other currencies was reflected in a series of recent energy deals with China. These arrangements skirted the dollar-based financial system with loans and credit in renminbi.When Putin met Xi in Beijing this month, Russia’s Gazprom and China’s CNPC signed a 25-year deal on a new gas supply route, the Power of Siberia pipeline, which launched in 2019 and is expected to reach full capacity in 2025.Rosneft, Russia’s top crude producer and its top oil exporter to China, accounting for 7 per cent of the country’s total annual demand, this month agreed with CNPC to supply 100mn tonnes of oil to China through Kazakhstan over 10 years. Russia and China are also working on a third gas pipeline project via Mongolia. Some analysts said a deal could be signed by the end of the year.Last week, Gazprom Neft announced it was switching all settlement for fuelling Russian planes in China to renminbi, the first Russian company to do so.Despite those deals, experts noted that there was still a sizeable chunk of Russian trade in the conventional dollar system. During the first nine months of 2021, Russia and China conducted 8.7 per cent of their trade in roubles and 7.1 per cent in other currencies, according to the Russian central bank data. Dollars and euros accounted for 36.6 per cent and 47.6 per cent of Russia-China trade, respectively.The US is also exploring the use of export controls to cut off computer chip supplies to Russia, in a similar way to how it targeted Huawei, the Chinese technology group, according to government officials in Taiwan and Japan and US diplomats in Asia. The move could cripple Russia’s supply of components vital for industries ranging from telecoms to oil exploration.“We have been in discussions with the US about export controls,” said a senior Taiwanese government official, “and we have put together an inventory of potential products that might be relevant in the context of export controls here, including military and dual-use products, basic infrastructure, technology and strategic supplies.”Additional reporting by Max Seddon and Nastassia Astrasheuskaya in Moscow and Maiqi Ding in Beijing
201  The FT’s Max Seddon, reports from Moscow about Vladimir Putin’s order to launch a full-scale invasion into Ukraine, and the FT’s economics editor, Chris Giles, explains what a Russian invasion might do to the global economy. Mentioned in this podcasVladimir Putin orders start of ‘military operation’ in eastern UkraineUkraine crisis: Sanctions and high energy prices pose threat to global economyRussia-Ukraine webinar: What Next? 
202  Ukraine has been at war with Russia since Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014 and orchestrated a rebellion in the Donbas region in the east of the country. More than 14,000 Ukrainians have been killed. Many struggled to believe that Moscow would ever launch a full-blown invasion, including an assault on the capital, Kyiv, and other big cities. But with Ukraine’s western allies ruling out direct military intervention, they knew they would have to rely on themselves.Many Ukrainians have vowed to take up weapons and fight the invaders. Some have joined newly formed territorial defence battalions, units of selected volunteers overseen by military officers based in every region of the country. Others have organised local civil defence units. Many households already possess a hunting rifle or shotgun.The Ukrainian government recently adopted the concept of total defence: the creation of a national resistance movement to help the military defend the country and to maintain some kind of order over Ukrainian society even if its government is incapacitated or deposed. Facing a much larger, more powerful adversary, other countries, such as Finland, have implemented a total defence strategy for decades. The idea is that resistance is deterrence. Russia may try to seize swaths of Ukrainian territory but may only be able to keep them at great cost.Across the country, Ukrainians have been receiving basic training from army personnel, reservists and volunteers. Ukrainians of all ages come to learn how to handle an AK-47 assault rifle, move around when under fire or staunch a bullet wound. Some want to know how to fight, others are simply seeking advice on how to survive in a combat zone.Photographers Jean-Marc Caimi and Valentina Piccinni have been chronicling these preparations for the worst case, shooting the para­military schools and weekend workshops, the courses in tactical medicine and guerrilla drills. These images capture ordinary people coping with extraordinary circumstances at an exceptional moment.The banks of the river Dnepr in Kyiv are a favoured spot for courses in resistance and resilience. Some participants have reserved places in advance but passers-by also join in. These are not training camps for nationalist militia — which played a role in the 2014 Maidan revolution that removed a pro-Russian president from office and fought back in some places against Russian-backed separatists — although some ­members are instructors.One of Putin’s false narratives is that the Maidan revolution was a fascist coup and that Ukrainian governments elected since then have been illegitimate. But the upswell of interest in civil defence, recorded by Caimi and Piccinni, tells another story. It is everyday Ukrainians, men and women, old and young, who want to play a role in defending their country. It is an expression of the strength of Ukrainian civil society, a concept that Putin apparently cannot comprehend.Russian aggression has helped foster a stronger sense of Ukrainian national identity since 2014 and has strengthened support for the country’s western orientation. Many Ukrainians feel they are the ­victims of a bigger clash between Putin and the west, in which they have little say. Joining together in a spirit of resilience and resistance is, at the very least, a way to channel their worries in anxious times. 
203  Russia is confident it can shrug off Germany’s decision to halt certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and believes EU efforts to diversify the bloc’s energy sources will fail, according to three people close to the Kremlin and its state-run gas monopoly Gazprom.Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz surprised political observers on Tuesday when he froze the approval process for the $11bn pipeline, which runs beneath the Baltic Sea and would double the volume of gas sent directly from Russia to Germany. Scholz also vowed to wean his country off gas.The move was part of a European response to Moscow’s decision on Monday to recognise two breakaway regions of Ukraine as independent republics, before it launched a full-blown invasion of its neighbour on Thursday morning.But Moscow believes Germany cannot replace Russian gas in the short term and will fail to find sufficient substitutes for it even in the next 5-10 years, the people said.“The best strategy is to just not do anything, wait for three to five years, and then send gas through it once the Germans realise nothing else works,” said a person close to Gazprom.Scholz’s decision won widespread praise from Russia’s critics — particularly in Kyiv. Nord Stream 2 — which has been completed but has not yet been approved — and the existing first Nord Stream pipeline both bypass Ukraine to supply gas directly to western Europe and depriving Kyiv of lucrative transit fees.US president Joe Biden said on Wednesday his administration would impose sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG, the Swiss-based operator fully owned by Gazprom, and its corporate executives, as part of Washington’s response to the Ukraine crisis.The international sanctions will not necessarily prevent the pipeline from eventually going ahead, analysts say. But the increasing opposition to the pipeline means the stand-off could last for decades.Moscow is in effect betting that the short-term pain from losing Russian gas supplies will break Germany’s resolve to radically change its energy mix, the people close to the Kremlin and Gazprom said.However, the Kremlin might be underestimating Germany’s determination both to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045 and lessen its dependence on Russian gas, analysts say. Robert Habeck, the country’s Green economy minister, has made it clear Germany must seek alternatives. “If we don’t do that, we’ll become a plaything [of others],” he said earlier this month.Berlin’s decision dismayed the German gas industry. “The companies that financed NS2 had very clear ideas about why it made sense, and this fundamental perspective hasn’t changed,” said Timm Kehler, head of Zukunft Gas, a trade body. The route across the Baltic Sea was “shorter, cheaper and less prone to breakdown” than the “old, long route” across Ukraine, he said.With Germany phasing out nuclear and coal power and gas seen as a useful bridge to renewable energy sources, he said, “Europe is probably going to be consuming more, not less, gas in the next 10-15 years.” But gas production in Europe was declining. “We will see a growing import gap in Europe and Nord Stream 2 would help to close that gap,” he said.Kehler also criticised the German government for failing to diversify energy imports, for example by building a terminal to handle imports of liquefied natural gas from countries such as Qatar. “It did not create the right conditions for investments in LNG terminals to pay off,” he said. “It’s now going to have to do much more to improve Germany’s attractiveness compared with other EU member states.”Claudia Kemfert of the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) said Germany was paying the price for its delay in shifting to renewable energy from fossil fuels over the past 10 years.“Renewables could have accounted for 80 per cent of our energy supply by now,” she said. “But instead we had a targeted policy in favour of fossil fuels, particularly gas.”In recent years Gazprom has shifted its development focus to the new Bovanenkovo deposit that feeds Nord Stream 2, another senior figure in Russian energy circles said. Other pipeline routes are not connected to the deposit and rely on older, diminishing sources.“Bovanenkovo is really the source of future production and growth, and it can only supply significant gas via Nord Stream 2,” the person said. “It will get harder and harder to supply the needed volumes via [other routes].”For now, however, Gazprom could easily ride out the dispute without supplying gas via Nord Stream 2 and instead export via other pipelines, said Maria Belova of Vygon, a Moscow energy consultancy.“Russia will continue receiving export duties as the export volume will not change,” Belova said. If costs for Gazprom rose, she added, “European companies will receive more expensive gas.”Meanwhile, by next winter, Germany would have to replenish its storage facilities and face the reality of the higher costs of LNG, according to George Voloshin of consultancy Aperio.“For now, the trump cards are in the hands of Russia,” he said. “Europe will need to compromise because Europe needs these supplies.”
204  There were always two big problems with Europe’s latest diplomatic attempts to deter Russia’s President Vladimir Putin from seeking to crush Ukraine and bring it back into Moscow’s sphere of influence.The first, diplomats say, was the unrealistic hope of French president Emmanuel Macron — who became the west’s chief negotiator in the final days before Putin raised the stakes by recognising two breakaway “republics” in eastern Ukraine — that he could persuade him to “de-escalate” by offering talks about Russia’s strategic concerns.But the second and more important obstacle to success was Putin himself. He is judged by those involved in negotiations with him over the years to have become more hardline, more isolated (especially during the Covid-19 pandemic) and, in his rambling and aggressive speech about Ukraine from the Kremlin on Monday night, even “paranoid”. That was the diagnosis of Mark Rutte, prime minister of the Netherlands, and of one of Macron’s senior officials.Macron, who negotiated with Putin for nearly six hours at the Kremlin two weeks ago and wrested from him last weekend an agreement in principle to have a summit with US president Joe Biden, has been criticised as naive for thinking he had any influence over the Russian leader, and opportunistic for trying to use the international stage to help his chances of winning re-election in April.Kaja Kallas, prime minister of Estonia, a Baltic state bordering Russia and previously in the Soviet Union, recently suggested Macron did not grasp that Putin faced none of the pressures from the public felt by democratic leaders. She told the Financial Times she felt “there is a strong wish to be the hero who solves this case, but I don’t think it’s solvable like that”.Foreign policy analysts agree that Macron, hyperactive in foreign policy since he took office in 2017, has been overconfident about his powers of persuasion and afflicted by romantic notions of France’s historic relations with Russia.“When it comes to Mr Putin, Macron has clearly overestimated the impact of personal alchemy on a former KGB officer,” wrote Michel Duclos, a former ambassador and now special adviser at the Institut Montaigne think-tank, in his recent book on French foreign policy. It was published last year — before the latest Russian threat to Ukraine.Macron’s meetings and frequent phone calls with Putin, however, have made him more sceptical about Russia’s leader over the past few years.After being criticised by Germany and other EU partners for having launched a “strategic dialogue” with Putin without warning them and having invited him to the French Mediterranean presidential retreat in 2019, Macron has been very careful to consult closely with Biden, EU leaders and UK prime minister Boris Johnson in his recent negotiations with Russia’s president.Western diplomats say it was as obvious to Macron as to almost everyone else that this was a high-risk strategy with little chance of success, and one that would be unlikely to play to the French president’s domestic political advantage — but it was essential to try.“What the president is doing today are the last possible and necessary efforts to avoid a major conflict,” said one French official while the talks were continuing, adding later that Macron’s aim “was to have options, to make it so that President Putin could never say he was going to war because there was no chance of dialogue”.Marine Le Pen, Macron’s far-right rival in the presidential election, accused him of “trying to use this round of diplomacy to support the launch of his campaign”, but her open sympathy for the world’s authoritarian leaders and her party’s past financial dependence on Russia weakened her argument.France’s western allies were more appreciative of Macron’s last-minute efforts to persuade Putin to stand down, even if some thought he kept trying for too long. “One has to give credit, he has tried to the very end. And he has been very brave to take the responsibility,” said a senior EU official.A western diplomat said Macron “deserves respect for trying” but had been “foolhardy” to persevere.Given Putin’s darkening mood after two decades at the helm of post-Soviet Russia, and his record of extending the country’s influence over parts of its old empire, including Crimea and eastern Ukraine in 2014, French officials now conclude that there is very little anyone could have done through diplomacy to have changed the course of recent events.“The Putin whom Macron met [this month] at the Kremlin was not the same as the one he saw the previous time they had met in December 2019,” said one official. “This Putin was more rigid, more isolated, and basically one who had gone haywire in terms of ideology and security policy.”This week, the west applied economic sanctions on Russia and some of Putin’s associates, and has threatened to do much more if Putin sends his forces into the parts of Ukraine they do not already occupy.With nearly 200,000 Russian troops massed on Ukraine’s borders, Biden called off the proposed summit with Putin, while US secretary of state Antony Blinken and his French counterpart, Jean-Yves Le Drian, cancelled meetings with Russia’s Sergei Lavrov.As for Macron, one of his officials was asked on Monday whether he planned to pursue his dialogue with Putin. “For the time being, no new contacts are envisaged,” the official replied.Additional reporting by Henry Foy in Brussels
205  After consuming a couple of bottles of Minuty rosé, most ideas seem good. Like buying a boat, for example.Thanks to online auction sites — and in my case a sundowner overlooking a superyacht marina in Antigua — you can find yourself clicking and bidding on a boat you’ve never seen that’s moored in a port you’ve never been to. Amazing thing, the internet.Through the prism of alcohol, the boat we were looking at was delightful, even if it wasn’t a superyacht. A “gentleman’s cruiser”, the Rampart 48 was built in Southampton and commissioned in 1961. The blurb said it was valued at £70,000 and bidding had reached £20,000 — so we shoved in an offer. Bargain, right? A lot of beautiful varnished teak, with a dated, yet classic interior, a lovely set of dials and resplendent red velour soft furnishings. Honestly, I don’t know what we thought we were doing.But should one own a boat? After all, they’re relaxing, you can putt-putt about different ports, they give a focus for sunny holidays abroad and the deck is a splendid and sociable place to quaff rosé while debating how much it costs to run.People must like boats because in every classy sea or lakeside resort there’s a marina filled with the things. Problem is, I know very little about yachts, motor cruisers or indeed anything that floats. I can hardly sail and have only driven a motorised boat under supervision (as a child on the boating lake in Regent’s Park) and I’ve not been on a narrow boat holiday since the late 1970s. And everyone who’s ever owned a boat tells me how expensive they are to run.They say if it flies or floats, you should rent it. Another option? Make friends with someone daft enough to buy one.Years ago, when I had a real job in finance, we arranged a significant loan to a property company. These were the days when you could accept corporate hospitality without any questions asked, so off we popped to the south of France for a “celebration lunch”.A few years previously our clients had bought an 80ft Sunseeker motor yacht for “a couple of million”, joking throughout the deal that if we got it done, we’d celebrate by having a day out on their boat, kitted out with jetskis and other toys.In the course of our conversation, they said that although it was a superb symbol of achievement and wealth, keeping it afloat was such a hassle and expense that they planned to sell it. This brings to mind the old joke: “When do you want to sell your boat? The day after you bought it.”The cost of staffing and crewing, finding a decent berth, tax, fuel, insurance and maintenance soon adds up. If you only want the occasional blast, why indeed would you not rent one?I nervously started to tot up the likely damage for the boat we were bidding on. A cool €556 (about £460) plus VAT every month for its mooring in Spain. A 900-litre fuel tank to be filled on a regular basis. Insurance and an annual maintenance bill likely to run into several thousand euros. And that’s before the cost of getting to and from the boat every time you visit.Rich is a relative term. This column isn’t called Ultra High Net Worth Individuals’ Problems, but if it were, we’d be talking about owning superyachts. I assume that “mine’s bigger than yours” is the only way to explain why someone would spend hundreds of millions of dollars on something that looks like a cross channel ferry with nicer lights and a ’copter or two on the back.How else would you explain the $500mn (£370mn), 417ft superyacht that Jeff Bezos is having built in the Netherlands for launch in the summer? It is so tall it may require part of a bridge in Rotterdam to be dismantled on its route to the open sea.My fascination with these floating temples to wealth leads me to websites such as Superyachtfan.com, which tell you who owns the biggest boats, how much they cost and a selection of photographs demonstrating that money doesn’t buy taste. Very handy! I wonder if superyacht owners compare and contrast in the same way as neighbours will often look up houses on their street to see how appallingly they’re decorated or what they sold for?However, when you see a superyacht in real life, it’s quite something.A few years ago on a road trip around the Croatian coast, we happened to see the largest sailing yacht in the world — the 469ft colossus known as “Sailing Yacht A”. Designed by Philippe Starck for the Russian industrialist Andrey Melnichenko, it has space for 20 guests in 10 cabins, plus another 10 for the crew.According to Superyachtfan.com, it cost $600mn and has annual running costs of $50mn-$75mn. This confirms the simple rule I have learnt about the cost of boat ownership — whatever you buy the thing for, you’ll need to stump up about 10 per cent of the value in annual running costs.Still, there is something rather splendid about hopping aboard a boat. Every year, the property industry descends on Cannes for a trade fair known as “Le Mipim” or the Marché International des Professionnels de L’immobilier (though I always referred to it as the Massive International Piss-up in March).The most successful developers turn up in huge boats, where they host extravagant drinks parties to show how well they’ve done. For aspiring entrepreneurs, it’s an opportunity to rent a boat at the company’s expense to hold meetings and events.One year, the boss of the property company I worked for put me in charge of executing the Mipim strategy. I explained the pros and cons of renting a more modest vessel against a somewhat larger gin palace. His voicemail response — a simple instruction of “big boat!” — caused much amusement. But our week on board offered a little dip into the luxurious existence these things afford.The bedrooms are sumptuous, the living space accented with highly polished wood, oozing technology and leather in equal measure. And the best thing is having a crew who will bring whatever you don’t need whenever you want it. A glass of fizz here, a snackette there or a cup of strong black coffee to help blow away the cobwebs from the night before.The cost of renting it for the week? If my memory serves me correctly, around £60,000 (plus catering) and that was 20 years ago. As a future boat owner, could entering the corporate jolly market be a potential money spinner for me?Superyachts can be chartered for hundreds of thousands of pounds a week (even high net worth individuals want a contribution to some of those outlandish running costs).Mercifully, before our boat-owning dream could become a reality, we were outbid on the Rampart 48. I’ve decided to wait until I’m a billionaire before I reconsider buying a boat from which I can throw handfuls of money into the wind.James Max is a radio presenter and property expert.

206  Indisputably, Italy’s public debt is extremely high. According to Italian central bank data, published on February 15, the debt amounted to almost €2.7tn at the end of 2021, or slightly more than 150 per cent of gross domestic product.When the euro was launched in 1999, Italy’s public debt was 113 per cent of GDP. Earlier in the 1990s, EU leaders said a country could not join the currency union unless its public debt was 60 per cent or less of GDP — or, if it was above that level, it was supposed to be going down in a satisfactory manner.Yet the lowest level Italy’s public debt has touched in the euro era is 103.9 per cent of GDP in 2007. Since then, it has gone up and up. If Italy were outside the eurozone and wanted to join now, would it meet the criteria?Paradoxically, as Italy’s debt has ballooned in size, it has become more manageable. Particularly over the past two years, the crucial factor has been European Central Bank support. From March 2020 to the end of last year, the ECB bought some €250bn of Italian debt under its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme.Partly as a result, the average interest rate paid on Italian sovereign debt fell from 6 per cent in 2020 to 2.4 per cent last year, according to Frederik Ducrozet of Pictet bank. Moreover, Italy has reduced refinancing risks by increasing its average debt maturity to 7.6 years — about the same as the eurozone average. “It would take a large and permanent shift higher in bond yields to drive average interest payments to ‘unsustainable’ levels,” says Ducrozet.Still, financial markets remain hypersensitive to all the complex issues surrounding Italian public debt. At the start of the pandemic, Italian bond yields rose sharply after Christine Lagarde, the ECB president, said it was not the central bank’s job “to close spreads” between the borrowing costs of eurozone countries.She quickly walked back that remark, but the market turbulence underscored the connection that investors see between Italian debt sustainability and ECB policy measures. This was evident once more in early February when the ECB signalled that it might raise interest rates in response to inflationary pressures. Italian 10-year bond yields rose briefly to a 21-month high of 2 per cent.For markets to be reassured that Italian debt will not pose a risk to eurozone stability, the ECB will have to take great care about the timing and scale of any rate increases and withdrawal of asset purchase programmes. It will need to show markets that it will not tolerate financial fragmentation of the kind that splintered the eurozone in 2011-2012.At the same time, Italy has immense responsibilities of its own. Its public debt would concern markets less but for the fact that, for more than two decades, Italy has been the eurozone’s laggard in economic growth. One essential condition for sustained growth is a political climate conducive to economic reforms, moreover, which do not remain on paper but are actually implemented.Here the outlook is mixed. Preliminary data put Italian economic growth last year at 6.4 per cent, the fastest rate since 1995. Yet in January Italy’s central bank published some fairly cautious estimates of GDP growth over the next three years — 3.8 per cent this year, 2.5 per cent in 2023 and 1.7 per cent in 2024.Even these growth rates will depend to an extent on whether Italy makes good use of the €200bn in grants and loans available from the EU’s recovery fund. This has been the focus of the reform initiatives of Mario Draghi, Italy’s prime minister, during his year in power. He aims to make the reforms irreversible so that, even if he leaves office after Italy’s 2023 parliamentary elections, no future government will make a mess of them.Despite a promising start, not all is going Draghi’s way. Earlier this month, Italy’s rightwing parties pushed an amendment through parliament, against the wishes of Draghi’s government, that raises the limit for conducting transactions purely in cash to €2,000 from €1,000. The lower limit had been introduced to clamp down on illegality and the black economy.As this episode shows, it matters greatly who will govern Italy after Draghi and how reform-minded will they be. It is hardly surprising that the markets are still twitchy about Italian public debt.
207  Melike was already struggling with the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic when the new year delivered a fresh shock. The Turkish tailor, who owns a small shop in Ankara’s socially mixed neighbourhood of Esat, saw her monthly electricity bill more than double from about TL200 to about TL500 ($35) after recent price rises.A longtime supporter of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, she has found herself doubting whether she would ever vote for the president again as crushing inflation that reached almost 49 per cent last month has hit her business and her family life.“I’m undecided — like a lot of people,” said Melike, 46, who asked to be identified by a pseudonym because her husband has a government job. “The main reason is the economy. In the early days [the ruling party] were amazing. But in the recent period, the problems began.”Erdogan, who has ruled Turkey for close to two decades, must hold elections before June 2023 but faces growing public anger over the cost of energy, food and other basic needs.Living costs have skyrocketed after the Turkish leader, a life-long opponent of high interest rates, ordered the central bank to slash the cost of borrowing last year despite rising inflation — a move that sent the lira plummeting by 44 per cent against the dollar.Electricity prices rose between 50 and 125 per cent in January as the plunge in the value of the currency combined with soaring global energy prices to produce eye-watering increases in the cost of power.Angry social media users posted their bills online while shopkeepers displayed theirs on their windows. Small protests broke out in several cities.Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the country’s largest opposition party, announced that he would refuse to pay his bill in protest at the price rises. Cem Yilmaz, a famous comedian, joked that anyone who did not complain about the cost of living was either “a madman or a thief”.In an effort to staunch the criticism, Erdogan — who had already announced a 50 per cent increase in the minimum wage in January — unveiled new relief measures last week. He pledged an expansion of state subsidies to low-income households to help them pay their bills and said authorities would raise the threshold at which higher household electricity tariffs kick in. “Today, as always, we are listening to the voice of our nation and finding solutions to its problems,” he said.On the streets of Ankara, however, spiralling living costs are a source of mounting anxiety and hardship.Fatma Sahin, a 70-year-old retiree, said she had resorted to collecting plastic bags and selling them to the city’s roaming waste collectors to top up her partial state pension. She cannot afford to buy meat or even vegetables.“At home we eat pasta, pasta, pasta,” she said. “We are fed up with pasta.”Kenan, a motorcycle courier for a restaurant, complained that close to half of his daily earnings of about TL250 were eaten up by the cost of petrol. The 23-year-old, who lives with his parents, said his family had started watching less television to try to reduce their electricity bill.Yet, in a sign of the challenges facing the opposition, even some of those dismayed by the state of the economy have yet to be convinced that Erdogan’s rivals would be able to fix it.“Maybe it will take 20 years,” said Umit Ertan, 60, as she helped her husband run their small shop selling lightbulbs, vacuum parts and remote controls. The opposition, she said, was “attention seeking” with stunts such as Kilicdaroglu’s announcement about his electricity bill.Polls suggest that erstwhile supporters of Erdogan’s ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) make up a disproportionate share of the chunk of voters who say they are undecided about who to support in next year’s presidential and parliamentary elections.Can Selcuki, director of the Turkiye Raporu polling agency, said some may choose to stay at home on election day — a phenomenon that could work in favour of the opposition. But he said that, even in a country where ideological allegiances are more important than policy proposals, Erdogan’s rivals were missing a trick by failing to convince voters on the economy.“People want to hear about economic relief. Just as important as the content, they want to hear it in a credible way,” he said.Melike, the tailor, is among those who remain uninspired by the opposition. “If they come to power, I don’t think it will be a lot better,” she said.She sees no clear rival to Erdogan, whom she respects for his response to the coronavirus pandemic and his transformation of the Turkish defence industry into a manufacturing powerhouse that makes armed drones, helicopters and tanks. “There is no challenger,” she said.For now, Melike is focused on seeking to shelter her three children from the worst of the impact of the ongoing economic turmoil. “When my daughter sees that the price of chocolate has increased three times, she tells me not to buy it,” she said. “How can a 10-year-old think like that?”
208  It brings us neatly to two of her forthcoming projects. The first is an exhibition at the Musée Picasso-Paris about Widmaier Picasso’s mother, Maya Ruiz-Picasso, Picasso’s eldest daughter born of his affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter. The second is a book, Picasso Sorcier. Nearly half a century after his death, her grandfather’s presence continues to loom large. Widmaier Picasso was born in 1974, the year after her grandfather died at the age of 91. She grew up first in Marseille, then Paris, with her mother and father, Pierre Widmaier (a shipping magnate), and two older brothers. “When I was born, my grandfather’s fame was almost bigger than his art,” she recalls. “I didn’t want to talk about Picasso. I wanted to explore the world.” She studied law followed by art history at the Sorbonne before joining Sotheby’s, heading up the department of Old Masters drawings. In 2005, however, she left to focus on her grandfather’s work. “It’s hard to get away,” she muses. “I felt the need to be more involved in his legacy.” She set up DWP Editions, which aims to publish a catalogue raisonné of Picasso’s sculptures – a projected four-volume catalogue that is still ongoing. “I don’t even know if we will ever be able to fully understand this work,” she adds.Meanwhile, she has written numerous essays on her grandfather – from “Picasso and Marie-Thérèse Walter: Erotic Passion and Mystic Union” to “one on Picasso and hip-hop” – and already put together exhibitions, including Picasso Mania at the Grand Palais in Paris. She curated another about her mother a few years ago in Paris, but this one (curated with Emilia Philippot, director of collections and education at the Musée Picasso) “is much more complete”, she says. “It brings together for the first time a significant ensemble of 14 painted portraits of Maya – nearly the complete collection. It’s the evolution that is fascinating.” For Serena Cattaneo Adorno, director of Gagosian Paris, Widmaier Picasso’s “knowledge and insight in Picasso’s oeuvre is scholarly but personal. She transforms the research into her grandfather’s practice into her personal frontier.” Clearly that is a fine line to tread. She admits that putting together the 2011 exhibition, Picasso and Marie-Thérèse: L’Amour Fou, with the artist’s biographer John Richardson, was “very emotional. The show was an homage to love and lust. You really felt this central attraction – to the point that people would walk into the room and start crying.” Picasso’s love life remains a subject of contention. John Richardson said of his relationship with Walter: “What excited him was having psychological power over her.” Marina Picasso (granddaughter of Picasso’s first wife, Russian ballerina Olga Khokhlova) went further: “He submitted [women] to his sexuality, tamed them, bewitched them, ingested them and crushed them onto his canvas,” she wrote. Widmaier Picasso is a little more generous: “He was always ahead of the time. Today people want the truth. And I think he was honest with his feelings towards women, as tough as that could be.” Maya, now 86, has steadfastly stood by the memory of her father. Her expertise on his artwork has been regularly sought out by international auction houses, art dealers and collectors. “I felt immediately it was my mission,” she has said. “Above all, I wanted to protect my father’s work and ensure it was respected.” Of her daughter’s work, she adds: “I believe what Diana is doing is the fruition of what started with my father and Marie-Thérèse. I think the exhibition is a successful attempt to represent this sacred spirit which ties us all together.” Picasso was obsessed with dust; he didn’t want it cleaned up… He saw it as a layer of spiritual protection”When Maya was born, Picasso had, for a time, stopped painting and devoted himself to poetry: a notebook of his surrealist-inspired writing will be included in the Musée Picasso show. Other highlights include photography by Edward Quinn showing a 20-year-old Maya with her father on the set of Henri-Georges Clouzot’s Le Mystère Picasso, and previously unseen sketchbooks, some combining the penmanship of father and daughter. “I’m also co-writing and co-producing a film about Maya that will be shown at the end of the exhibition,” says Widmaier Picasso. Another room will be dedicated to what she calls “memorabilia”. “These are the things that Picasso kept, that my grandmother kept, that my mother kept. There are some clothes, some shoes, but also some hair and some nails.” These personal effects relate to Widmaier Picasso’s book. Researched and written alongside French anthropologist Philippe Charlier, it presents, she says, “a brand new angle” on her grandfather as someone deeply embroiled in superstitions and spiritual beliefs. Someone who kept his nail clippings to ensure they couldn’t be used to cast a spell on him. Someone who attached significance to everyday objects and would throw nothing away. “Even dust!” exclaims Widmaier Picasso. “Picasso was obsessed with dust; he didn’t want it cleaned up because it was a way for him to know when objects had been moved around, but he also saw it as a layer of spiritual protection.”The book paints a picture of Picasso as a “magician, in the strict sense of the term”, says Charlier, an expert in forensic research who has examined the remains of Richard the Lionheart and Louis IX. “His art was packed with magical processes in its creation, using all the elements of the human body as raw material: blood, urine, hair, nails, even excrement!” “The excrement is very interesting,” says Widmaier Picasso. “Picasso used some of it on one still life to create an apple. He turns it into a noble material.” The painting is Nature Morte au Pichet et à la Pomme, created on 19 February 1938; the excrement courtesy of young Maya. It will be on show at the Musée Picasso. Not all of Widmaier Picasso’s endeavours are associated with her grandfather. She’s a trustee for MoMA PS1 in New York and on the board of the KW Institute for Contemporary Art in Berlin, and is also involved with the Tate and the Met. Another sideline is the jewellery brand Mene, which she launched in 2017 with entrepreneur Roy Sebag. The premise was to create a classic range of 24ct-gold and platinum jewellery that functions as investment as well as adornment. “On our website, customers can buy, sell and exchange their jewellery by weight at the prevailing daily price for gold as quoted on the international bullion markets,” explains Sebag. The brand went public soon after its launch and has since been growing at 50 per cent year on year. Widmaier Picasso’s design team is headed up by former Kenzo and Missoni creative Sunjoo Moon. Playful charms and pendants are offered alongside classic chain bracelets, necklaces with oval links or woven rope-like cords, and serpent-shaped stud earrings. There are a few Picasso references – a Minotaur, for instance, and a dove, and he loved gold. Yet when Mene launched an artist edition in 2019 it was not with him but with Louise Bourgeois, translating her famous Arch of Hysteria and Spider sculptures into pendants. Doing something unassociated with the family name clearly feels good. “And it’s successful!”Her grandfather’s work retains a certain hold, though, and she has no problem with that connection. “I think in my family, and in the world, everybody has their own Picasso in themselves,” she says. “The name is associated with talent, genius and freedom. I have no reason not to be proud.” Maya Ruiz-Picasso: Fille de Pablo is at the Musée National Picasso-Paris from 16 April to 21 January. Picasso Sorcier is published by Gallimard in French in April (€19). An English translation will follow later this year
209  With the Russian army poised on his border, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky made what might have been a last-ditch appeal to the Russian people to prevent the outbreak of a full-blown war between the countries.The televised speech delivered by Zelensky early on Thursday morning in Kyiv came as Russia appeared to be inching closer to war after the Kremlin said two Moscow-backed separatist territories in Ukraine had asked Vladimir Putin to “repel the aggression of the Ukrainian regime”.Listing his deep personal ties to the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, Zelensky stressed that Ukraine wanted peace and urged Russians to question the information presented to them by domestic state television.“Lots of you have relatives in Ukraine, you studied in Ukrainian universities, you have Ukrainian friends. You know our character, our principles, what matters to us. Listen to yourselves, to the voice of reason. The people of Ukraine want peace,” he pleaded. “They’re telling you that this flame will liberate the people of Ukraine, but the Ukrainian people are free.”Ukraine was encircled by almost 200,000 Russian troops and thousands of armoured vehicles, which had been given the green light to step forward and enter Ukraine, he acknowledged. Earlier on Wednesday, Ukraine declared a state of emergency and urged its citizens to leave Russia.“This step could be the start of a major war on the European continent,” Zelensky said. “The trigger could happen at any moment, any provocation, any spark — that spark could burn down everything.”Zelensky, a former comic who made an unlikely entrance into politics, has often downplayed the prospect of war with Russia, even as Moscow massed troops along Ukraine’s border and western officials grew increasingly alarmed at Putin’s actions.Zelensky urged Russians not to trust Moscow’s narratives about Ukraine, including the often-repeated claim that its citizens supported Nazism. “Ukraine in your news and Ukraine in reality — that’s two different countries,” Zelensky said.He asked how he could possibly order artillery fire on Donbas, where he said he spent much time, had close friends and buried the relatives of friends.“We know for sure that we don’t need war, not cold war, not hot war, not hybrid war,” Zelensky said. But, he warned, if anyone tried to snatch away Ukraine’s freedom, the country would defend itself.“Attacking us, you will see our faces, not our backs,” he said, warning of the tens of thousands of deaths that could come.“I know this speech of mine will not be shown on Russian television,” he said. “But the citizens of Russia must know the truth. And the truth is this needs to stop before it’s too late.”“Do Russians want war?” he asked. “I wish I had the answer, but the answer depends only on you.”
210  The Kremlin said two Moscow-backed separatist territories in Ukraine had asked Vladimir Putin to “repel the aggression of the Ukrainian regime”, raising expectations that Russia was poised to launch a full invasion.The rebels’ plea to Putin came as Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, gave an extraordinary television address appealing to the Russian people to reject war.“Lots of you have relatives in Ukraine, you studied in Ukrainian universities, you have Ukrainian friends. You know our character, our principles, what matters to us. Listen to yourselves, to the voice of reason. The people of Ukraine want peace,” Zelensky said, speaking in Russian.But there was scant hope of avoiding a war after Russian newswires published letters on Wednesday in which the leaders of the breakaway statelets in the eastern border area of Donbas asked Putin to use force to protect them from “ongoing military aggression” by Ukraine.The White House said it was an example of the kind of “false flag” operations that Russia’s president was employing to create the pretext for an invasion. Josep Borrell, the EU’s chief diplomat, called it “a very dangerous additional step against Ukraine’s sovereignty that would put thousands of lives at risk”.After weeks of urging caution, Ukraine’s government braced for full-blown hostilities, declaring a state of emergency, ordering its citizens to leave Russia immediately and closing airports in the eastern cities of Kharkiv, Dnipro and Zaporizhzhya.Linda Thomas-Greenfield, US ambassador to the UN, told an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council requested by Kyinv on Wednesday evening that Washington believed “a full-scale further invasion into Ukraine by Russia is imminent”.“Tonight, we’re seeing the Russians close airspace, move troops into Donbas and move forces into combat-ready positions,” said Thomas-Greenfield. “This is a perilous moment. And we are here for one reason and one reason only: to ask Russia to stop.”UN secretary-general António Guterres appealed directly to Putin to prevent troops from attacking Ukraine. “Give peace a chance”, said Guterres.The Pentagon, meanwhile, warned that Moscow had deployed 100 per cent of the forces needed to mount an attack and the top US diplomat said he expected an invasion to begin soon.A senior US defence official said that Russia had positioned more than two dozen warships in the Black Sea, including 10 amphibious landing ships. “These ships exist for one reason and that is to put boots on the ground,” the official said.Kyiv and its western allies have characterised the claims of Ukrainian aggression — which have been spread widely on Russian state television and backed up by little or no evidence — as “phoney allegations” meant to justify a conflict.The separatists’ plea to Putin was taken as a final signal that Russia was ready to commence a full invasion after massing as many as 190,000 troops on the border in recent weeks, recognising the separatists’ claims of independence and vowing to hold Kyiv responsible for any “ensuing bloodshed”.“The intelligence picture is looking extra grim tonight,” a western official told the Financial Times on Wednesday evening regarding Russia’s military preparations.Western counties have imposed additional sanctions in hopes of persuading Putin to change course. The EU targeted officials close to Russia’s president while the US imposed sanctions on the company building the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline linking Russia to Germany — a move that a state department official said would render the prized project an $11bn “hunk of steel sitting at the bottom of the sea”.Even as they were announced, there was widespread acknowledgment that those measures were unlikely to change Putin’s calculus. EU leaders will hold an emergency summit meeting on Thursday to discuss a further response.Zelensky’s appeal was particularly emotive because he has for weeks dismissed suggestions that a large-scale Russian invasion was at hand.“Ukraine in your news and Ukraine in reality — that’s two different countries,” Zelensky said, recalling his grandfather’s service in the Soviet army in the second world war as he emphasised the shared bonds between Russians and Ukrainians.“I know this speech of mine will not be shown on Russian television,” he said. “But the citizens of Russia must know the truth. And the truth is this needs to stop before it’s too late.”The separatists declared independence from Ukraine in 2014, although they control only about a third of Donbas, in the country’s industrial east, after eight years of fighting in which more than 14,000 have died.Western efforts to mediate the conflict collapsed this week after Putin recognised the separatists, prompting US secretary of state Antony Blinken and French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian to cancel meetings with their Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov.Additional reporting by Aime Williams in Washington
211  Ukraine’s parliament approved a call by President Volodymyr Zelensky to declare a state of emergency in the country late on Wednesday, with a majority 335 MPs voting in favour.“We put off this decision for a long time,” the national security chief Oleksiy Danilov said, “.the situation is complicated but under control.” He added that the Russian threat would be greater if the domestic ‘destabilisation’ pursued by Moscow were allowed to be a factor.The government earlier told its citizens to leave Russia, amid growing signs that Ukraine was veering closer to a full-blown war with its northern neighbour.Kyiv’s move to introduce emergency rule comes after Zelensky called up reserve troops and his administration pleaded with the west to impose tougher sanctions on Russia.The measures underlined the gravity of the situation facing Kyiv after Russia’s president Vladimir Putin ordered Russian “peacekeeping” forces into the breakaway eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.The US announced sanctions against Russia on Tuesday, accusing Putin of beginning an invasion of Ukraine. These followed similar moves from the EU and the UK, which cast the measures as part of a first wave of economic curbs on Russia.But Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, called on the west not to delay tougher sanctions if it wanted to deter Moscow from “further aggression”.“First decisive steps were taken yesterday, and we are grateful for them. Now the pressure needs to step up to stop Putin. Hit his economy and cronies. Hit more. Hit hard. Hit now,” Kuleba said on Twitter.UK prime minister Boris Johnson announced on Wednesday that additional defensive weapons were being sent to Ukraine “in light of the increasingly threatening behaviour” displayed by Russia.The Ukrainian president urged calm and said he did not believe Russia would launch a major assault, although he said preparations were being made should one occur.Zelensky said the deployment of reserve troops was not a mass mobilisation, stating: “We must increase the readiness of the Ukrainian army for all possible changes in the operational environment. We are talking exclusively about citizens assigned to the operational reserve.”The state of emergency approved by parliament on Wednesday will have powers that fall short of martial law, putting Zelensky in charge of all decisions but allowing for measures to be implemented by special commissions composed of central and regional government authorities.The emergency order will apply to all of Ukraine except for the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which have been under a separate regime since 2014 when Russia fomented a proxy separatist war there after annexing Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula.Danilov said the emergency measures would include enhanced security procedures in public places, restrictions and inspections on transport, and document checks.“These are preventive measures imposed so that calm is preserved in the country, so that our economy continues to operate, so that our country continues to operate,” he said.“The main aim of the Russian Federation is to reach their goals through domestic destabilisation,” he added. “Today’s decision was adopted to prevent this.”As lawmakers were meeting, several Ukrainian government websites including that of its parliament, went down and some banking services were disrupted by denial of service cyber attacks. Netblocks, a group that tracks internet disruptions and shutdowns, said that among those targeted were Ukraine’s ministries of defence, foreign affairs, and internal affairs, and state banks PrivatBank and Oschadbank.Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister in charge of digitalisation, said the attack began at about 4pm. This was the third big cyber attack targeting Ukraine this year.Separately, Ukraine’s government told its citizens on Wednesday to avoid travelling to Russia, while Ukrainian citizens residing in Russia should “leave its territory immediately”.
212  The EU, which has put up strong defences for protecting personal data and user privacy, on Wednesday turned its attention to impersonal data with its latest legislative plans.The European Commission put forward proposals aimed at restricting the transfer of European big data to companies based in countries including China and the US, reports our Europe Express newsletter.The Data Act would put limits on the transfer of big data generated by smart household devices, cars or even connected irrigation systems to companies based outside the bloc. This is the kind of information that artificial intelligence systems are set to work on to spot efficiencies and build their powers.Thierry Breton, the French internal market commissioner, wants Europe to keep control of this industrial data. As he told the FT in an interview when he first outlined the idea: “My goal is to prepare ourselves so the data will be used for Europeans, by Europeans and with our values.”Meanwhile, the UK is leading in tackling Big Tech on the harms that can be caused by misinformation, illegal material and lax controls on protecting children from potentially harmful content. The Online Safety Bill would hold big tech firms accountable for controlling the content on their sites, writes Robert Shrimsley.There are new criminal offences for individuals including for threatening communications and those intended to cause harm or distress. Proof-of-age requirements for some content are demanded, though the mechanics are unclear. The regulator, Ofcom, will gain powers to demand plans from the big social media and search companies for how they will tackle not only illegal material but also content that is “legal but harmful” to children or adults. This could include cyberbullying or the algorithmic promotion of false or dangerous content.Free speech campaigners are worried and the bill’s broad sweep is a weakness. But the Online Safety bill is needed urgently and should be treated as a first salvo, argues Shrimsley, with swift amendments where the balance is wrong. Tech companies will surely understand if ministers conclude the right approach is to move fast and break things.1.

It can be a hard concept to grasp, so NFT marketplace Neon has just made it as simple as using a vending machine, in a store it has opened in New York. Open 24 hours a day, the machine accepts US-dollar credit and debit cards and dispenses a box with a unique code inside it for the chosen NFT, which is then easily redeemable on the Neon platform. The catch to me is that you don’t know what the NFT represents — the vending machine does not tell you what you are buying, but it will be some variation on the Party Pigeons and Project Color NFTs advertised in the store.
213  Vladimir Putin’s chief of staff and his defence minister have been blacklisted by the EU as part of the bloc’s first round of sanctions against Moscow as the US warned that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could start imminently.Anton Vaino, chief of staff in Putin’s presidential executive office, and Sergei Shoigu, defence minister, are among 27 people and entities named in a list of restrictive measures agreed by the EU’s member states.Sanctions were also imposed on two of Russia’s deputy prime ministers for their work in “threaten[ing] the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine”, and the heads of Russia’s navy, army and air force, in what EU officials said was the first of potentially multiple waves of measures against Moscow.Meanwhile, a day after Germany halted approval of the $11bn Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would bring natural gas directly from Russia, President Joe Biden said his administration would impose sanctions on the company and executives responsible for overseeing its construction.“These steps are another piece of our initial tranche of sanctions in response to Russia’s actions in Ukraine,” Biden said. “Through his actions, president Putin has provided the world with an overwhelming incentive to move away from Russian gas and to other forms of energy.”Jen Psaki, White House press secretary, said the US had not ruled out imposing sanctions on Putin himself. “It remains an option on the table,” she said. The decisions came as a Pentagon official warned that Russia could launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine at any moment after the Russian military put in place 100 per cent of the troops and weapons that it requires for a large attack on the country.“Putin and his forces are as ready as they can be,” a senior US defence official said. “They’ve advanced their readiness to a point where they are literally ready to go now if they get the order.They could go at any hour now.”The official added that Russia has already positioned more than two dozen warships in the Black Sea, including 10 amphibious landing ships. “These ships exist for one reason and that is to put boots on the ground,” he said.Charles Michel, European Council president, has convened a summit of the bloc’s leaders in Brussels on Thursday to discuss “how we deal with Russia” and hold Moscow accountable for its actions.“The use of force and coercion to change borders has no place in the 21st century,” he said in a letter to EU leaders.The EU’s move against Vaino and Shoigu, who are members of Russia’s powerful security council, takes the bloc’s Ukraine-related sanctions to Putin’s inner circle of advisers. The measures involve an asset freeze and a ban on providing funds to those listed, and a block on travel to and within the EU.The sanctions are a first step by the EU to punish Russia for its actions in eastern Ukraine, with policymakers warning they are ready to increase the pressure on leading Russian business figures and the country’s wider economy if Putin embarks on a full invasion of Ukraine.Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, on Wednesday stressed that she did not consider that Russia had yet engaged in a “military invasion” but that it was guilty of a serious breach of international law. However, she added: “If there is any further military action against Ukraine there will be a massive and robust second package that is coming.”She told CNN: “Russia will have to pay a price and it is president Putin who will have to explain to his people why he is putting this enormous price on them.”Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of RT, the Kremlin-funded English language TV channel that broadcasts outside Russia, is on the sanctions list for having “promoted a positive attitude to.the actions of separatists in Donbas”. Vladimir Solovyov, a prominent and influential Russian TV news anchor, and Maria Zakharova, foreign ministry spokeswoman, will also be hit with sanctions.The EU’s foreign policy arm warned this week of a wave of Russian state-backed propaganda targeting the bloc.The EU sanctions will also apply to three banks with operations in the Donetsk and Luhansk separatist-held territories — VEB, Promsvyazbank and Bank Rossiya, according to the list.While VTB Bank, Russia’s second-largest by assets, was not included on the list of lenders to be put under sanctions, its president, Andrei Kostin, and deputy president, Denis Bortnikov, were on the list of individuals to be placed under them. Bortnikov’s father is the head of Russia’s FSB spy service.Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is already in the EU’s Libya-related sanctions for his alleged links to the mercenary Wagner group, is included in the new list — alongside his mother and wife — for his business links to Crimea and the occupied areas of eastern Ukraine.“The EU’s willingness to target Putin’s inner circle with travel bans and asset freezes, as well as initiate sanctions against Russian sovereign debt is significant,” said Emre Peker, Europe director at Eurasia Group.Janis Emmanouilidis of the European Policy Centre said: “It is important that the EU27 have agreed on a set of sanctions. However, the scale of what has been decided will not be enough to actually put pressure on president Putin.in case of an escalation of the conflict, the union will have to agree to further scale up the coercive measures.”Letter in response to this article:South Africa shows sanctions do work / From Henry Hall, Porterville, South Africa
214  Boris Johnson has told the City of London to prepare to implement a tough new wave of financial sanctions if Russia launches a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, as Labour urged the prime minister to “get on with it”.Johnson has been stung by criticism that his first “barrage” of measures against Russia was too weak and left Britain trailing the US and EU in the scope and scale of its reprisals.The prime minister on Wednesday convened leading City figures including senior executives from HSBC, Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Lloyd’s of London to tell them that he wanted the next “wave” of sanctions to “really bite”. Trading exchanges and regulators were also represented at the meeting in Number 10.The City executives told Johnson they were already carrying out stress-testing on their business models to assess the impact of what Johnson claims will be robust sanctions.“We want the toughest possible next tranche and I do think that will make a difference and change the outcome,” Johnson told the meeting. “Putin must fail.”However, some of the bankers at the meeting bluntly told Johnson that they did not believe the UK sanctions had gone far enough, according to two people familiar with the discussion.They praised the German decision to suspend the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project as an example of what needed to be done to have an impact.Others stressed that the government should also consider widening the scope of sanctions to include real assets, such as property, owned by Russian citizens in the UK, not just financial instruments and bank accounts.Executives also asked for more time to implement the sanctions — two to three months, in line with US requirements — to reflect the amount of time it can take to unwind an international contract or identify and freeze a client’s assets.Johnson insisted that new sanctions should be co-ordinated with other western financial centres including New York and Paris, and said that they would go far beyond what had been announced so far.“We will be stopping Russia from raising sovereign debt, stopping companies from raising money and stopping Russian companies even clearing in sterling and dollars on international markets,” he told MPs at prime minister’s questions in the House of Commons.However, some City figures have privately approached ministers to point out that any international sanctions would have to include Switzerland. The country has yet to announce any sanctions on Russia and is a major conduit for oligarch money through its vast private banking system.The Downing Street meeting was also briefed by David Quarrey, Johnson’s deputy national security adviser, on the latest situation on the ground in Ukraine.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer increased the pressure on Johnson to move faster, saying Ukraine had already been invaded. “If not now, when?” he asked at prime minister’s questions. Labour MPs pointed at their watches and shouted: “Get on with it.”The US and EU have announced sanctions that go beyond Johnson’s opening effort, which targeted five banks and three oligarchs with links to the Kremlin. Tory MPs also said the measures were too modest.Liz Truss, foreign secretary, has suggested that Russian companies including those in the defence, chemicals, tech and energy sectors will also be targeted in the event of a full invasion.After confusion about whether new UK sanctions were contingent on further Russian aggression, Downing Street confirmed that they were being held back in the event Putin orders a major attack.Labour believes Johnson is moving too slowly against Russia on a number of fronts, including delaying until later this year an economic crime bill that would help root out illicit foreign investments.David Lammy, shadow foreign secretary, claimed the slow pace was partly because the Conservatives have received an estimated £2mn from donors with links to Russia since Johnson became prime minister in 2019.Tory officials said that all donations were properly declared and were received from British citizens, noting that foreign donations were illegal.
215  Twitter said it had mistakenly suspended the accounts of open-source intelligence reporters posting about Russia’s military build-up around Ukraine, leading to many of them accusing the Russian state of launching a “bot” campaign against them.Based on publicly available satellite imagery, open-source reporters have used social media to supply a steady commentary on the activities of Russian forces near the Ukrainian border, providing a valuable alternative source of information to western intelligence reports.The people behind the suspended accounts said they believed they had been the target of an attack by Russian bots — computers that mimic the activity of human users — that had mass-reported their content as being suspicious. This led their content to be removed automatically by Twitter’s moderation technology.“It is an attack on journalism and people who rely on these accounts to post the facts over other news outlets,” Kyle Glen, co-founder of @Conflicts, which has 337,000 followers, said.“Twitter has.a responsibility to ensure its own reporting systems aren’t being misused by individuals or nations.”Twitter told the Financial Times that there was no evidence of a co-ordinated bot campaign but admitted the company had taken action “in error”, suspending around a dozen accounts that had been flagged as containing manipulated or misleading media.It said it was “expeditiously reviewing these actions” and had reinstated many of the affected accounts.The suspensions took place at around the same time as several Ukrainian government websites and banks were temporarily shut down after a series of cyber attacks — Ukraine’s third since the beginning of the year. Kyiv has blamed the two prior attacks on Russia.That the Twitter accounts were suspended almost simultaneously fed suspicions that a Russian operation may have been behind the moves. Russia often uses proxy groups in its cyber operations so it can deny knowledge of any attack, even though the groups are believed by western officials and cyber experts to act for Moscow.“A number of.individuals saw their accounts locked at exactly 11:51 UTC last night,” said @Osinttechnical, who has 83,000 followers and whose identity the FT has independently verified.“The pattern of the account lockings indicates that the automatic features Twitter installed to handle account reports were triggered. In effect, a number of ‘people’ bombarded these accounts with reports at the same time, activating the Twitter blocks,” he added.The Twitter account of Ukrainian civil activist Serhii Sternenko was also suspended.Although open-source intelligence has provided some startlingly detailed images of military movements, analysts say it only shows a fraction of what is going on. Their reports, often on Twitter, have independently corroborated the publicly released western intelligence briefings and lent credibility to them.“Western governments have learnt a lot about the information warfare space.from [the] open intelligence space,” Sir Alex Younger, former head of the UK’s secret service, said.“It’s been a much better performance this time round and one of the reasons why is that there has been open-source [intelligence] to check on what they are saying, which has raised their credibility,” he told an FT forum on Wednesday.
216  Bringing a peashooter to a gunfight was how one analyst described the UK’s response to Russia’s renewed aggression towards Ukraine. After President Vladimir Putin ordered “peacekeeping” forces into breakaway Ukrainian regions, the US targeted some of Russia’s largest financial institutions and the EU unveiled measures against 351 members of the Russian parliament, as well as Putin’s defence minister and chief of staff. The UK, meanwhile, announced sanctions on five smallish lenders and three Putin cronies already on the US sanctions list. The underwhelming move has done little to improve the UK’s notoriety for being a hub where money and reputations of oligarchs close to the Kremlin can be laundered. More worryingly, such a paltry salvo risks emboldening Putin’s strategy of coercive diplomacy as Europe grapples with its worst security crisis in a generation.Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, has defended the strategy as escalatory, with more steps available should Russia step up attacks. A generous view may be that Germany’s commendable decision to halt the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline was intended to be the cornerstone of a co-ordinated initial response from the west. The UK may argue it wants to keep some measures in reserve, and a deterrent is needed against further Russian aggression. But there is far more that the UK could have done to prove its resolve, and should do without hesitation.Stopping Russia raising corporate and sovereign debt in London is an obvious step, and one Boris Johnson, the prime minister, said is among future measures. But the US already restricted the issuance and trading of Russian sovereign debt in 2019. Not having a parallel response from the UK was a glaring loophole. Meanwhile, Russian companies are shunning London capital markets anyway. Truss has promised to revive an economic crime bill — long promised but shelved multiple times — but only by the end of the year. It would create the most basic defences, such as bolstering the ability of the UK’s corporate registry to check identities.There seems to be a reluctance to end lucrative relationships with Kremlin-backed institutions and oligarchs. Russian ties — with UK banks, law firms, public-relations firms, universities, and politicians — were forged with perhaps the best intentions after the fall of the Soviet Union. But in the past decade, when it has become clear what kind of regime Putin has created, too little has been done to reverse course. Unpicking such close links is hard.Even US officials are reportedly dismayed about the potential of “Londongrad” to derail western efforts. The current Conservative government has come under scrutiny for ties to donors such as the wife of Putin’s former deputy finance minister. But successive governments of all stripes have failed to keep pace with a Russian strategy of bolstering its own defences against western sanctions — by “de-dollarising” its economy and ramping up foreign currency reserves — while simultaneously undermining the west’s ability to impose swingeing penalties.The crisis in Ukraine serves as a reckoning on many levels. For the UK, it should be a wake-up call over whom it is willing to do business with. For too long, the country has sold its City advice, education, football clubs and real estate to the highest bidder, with few questions asked. Claimant-friendly libel laws ensure journalists who do ask more searching questions can be gagged. Selling such services to kleptocrats, tycoons and princelings is dubious. Selling them to an adversary is far worse.
217  Good evening,Optimism that the global economy could be recovering from its pandemic-induced trauma is being severely tested by the unfolding Ukraine crisis.Russia’s movement of troops into Ukraine’s separatist regions have triggered sanctions that are likely to exacerbate the existing problems of rising energy prices and inflation, prompting sharp swings in share prices.Advanced countries have the capacity to cope, the FT’s economics editor Chris Giles writes, but Russia’s actions increase uncertainty over when central banks should tighten monetary policy.Meanwhile, the easing of pandemic restrictions in Europe, the US and elsewhere is raising business confidence, particularly in the travel and hospitality sector, although supply chain bottlenecks are frustrating the recovery for others.Heathrow, the UK’s busiest airport, predicted a surge in travellers getting away this summer and chief executive John Holland-Kaye said a third runway was “back on the table” to capitalise on the airline industry’s emergence from the ravages of lockdown.Equally bullish was InterContinental Hotels Group, the owner of the Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza chains, which said business was “closer to pre-pandemic levels” in 2021.Arundhati Bhattacharya, Salesforce’s India chief executive, said that her company was struggling to fill roles, as pandemic-fuelled demand for remote back office support had created skills shortages in the country.The do-it-yourself frenzy brought on by the coronavirus pandemic has helped Home Depot. But despite resilient consumer demand, the Atlanta-based retailer warned yesterday that elevated supply chain costs would continue to weigh on profits in 2022.The road to recovery was going to bumpy even before the Ukraine crisis erupted.

But the cautious, narrowly targeted measures announced over the last 24 hours will have little impact on Moscow, which can absorb significant economic pain, according to the latest Trade Secrets column by the FT’s senior trade writer Alan Beattie.The IMF has urged Rishi Sunak to bring forward planned tax rises to limit the risk of persistently high inflation, even though it would tighten the financial squeeze on Britain’s households. The fund added that in the short term the Bank of England should not increase interest rates rapidly — a view shared by the BoE’s deputy governor — as this could risk tipping the economy into recession.The UK government has also been criticised by a parliamentary committee for exposing taxpayers to “substantial, long-term financial risks” because of an estimated £15bn of Covid support lost to fraud and administrative errors. Future generations will be left to pay for these “unacceptable” sums that were “risked and lost” by ministers, according to the House of Commons public accounts committee report.Years of progress in tackling infectious diseases in the world’s poorest countries have been wiped out by the shift in resources to tackle the pandemic and subsequent disruption to treatments, experts have warned.Many fear that the disruption to treatments caused by lockdowns and the loss of funding to Covid prevention strategies will mean that deaths from HIV, tuberculosis and malaria in some nations are now on track to exceed those caused by the pandemic so far. However, the picture is not entirely bleak, with new approaches developed during the pandemic proving their worth.Surging prices for raw materials enabled Rio Tinto to make the second-biggest payout in UK corporate history on the back of bumper results. Rio investors will receive a total of $16.8bn (£12.3bn) for the 2021 financial year.Aston Martin narrowed its losses in 2021 as revenues climbed back above pre-pandemic levels, boosted by customer deposits for its high-price special cars and increased demand for its luxury sport utility vehicle.HSBC reported buoyant fourth-quarter earnings yesterday, showing that the bank is recovering from the worst of the pandemic and is optimistic about growth, with interest rates set to rise. However, the London-listed lender set aside $451mn as it braced for more defaults in the troubled Chinese real estate sector and warned of a slowdown in wealth management because of Hong Kong’s restrictive “zero Covid” strategy.The return to the office brings with it hidden dangers. One major — and much misunderstood — area of risk to all careers is the work social event, according to leadership and diversity consultant Nels Abbey, who offers tips for navigating the office party.The return to the office also creates real legal concerns. Employers in England have warned that they will be flying blind from tomorrow when all pandemic restrictions end. The UK government has not issued new workplace safety guidance and is refusing to fund free workplace coronavirus testing beyond April 1.Get the latest worldwide picture with our vaccine trackerThe collapse of the blood-testing company Theranos and the conviction of its founder Elizabeth Holmes was hailed as both the end of tech’s “fake it till you make it” culture and of the dubious cultural phenomenon of the “girlboss”.

218  US and EU sanctions banning the trading of new Russian bonds could raise Moscow’s borrowing costs and foreshadow tougher curbs that shut western investors out of the country’s debt market entirely, fund managers have said.US president Joe Biden on Tuesday announced a ban on participation in the secondary market for any Russian bonds issued after March 1, part of a flurry of new sanctions against Russia, as he accused President Vladimir Putin of launching an invasion of Ukraine. The EU followed suit on Wednesday with its own ban on the sale or purchase of new Russian debt.US investors were already barred from directly lending to Moscow. A ban on buying new Russia dollar debt has been in place since 2019* and Biden outlawed participation in the primary market — where new bonds are sold — for rouble-denominated debt last year. But the new curb in effect closes a loophole that allowed western lenders to indirectly finance the Russian state.“It brings more teeth to earlier sanctions,” said Kaan Nazli, a portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman. “Prior to last night, you couldn’t lend directly to the Russian government but technically someone could just wait until day two [after issuance] and buy bonds from a local bank that bought in the primary market. That wasn’t really a funding loss for Russia.”Russia’s borrowing costs have already risen sharply this year in anticipation of new sanctions being imposed, reflecting a sharp fall in the price of the country’s debt. The yield on 10-year local currency bonds has climbed to 10.9 per cent, up from 7 per cent in September. Yields on dollar bonds have also shot higher.While that is painful for some investors, Russia’s government should have little trouble managing without foreign financing — at least in the short-term — given its vast oil revenues, more than $630bn of foreign reserves and low debt levels, investors have said.“For Russia, it’s less of a problem,” said Viktor Szabo, a portfolio manager at Abrdn. “It will increase their cost of financing. Right now, that’s not a problem but if oil prices dropped to $20 a barrel again it would become a lot more urgent.” Brent crude hit nearly $100 a barrel on Tuesday.Local banks have already stepped up their holdings of rouble bonds in recent years, with overseas investors owning 20 per cent of the market at the end of last year, down from 35 per cent two years ago, according to figures from the Russian central bank. Moscow can borrow less from financial markets if need be, given that it ran a budget surplus last year.“It’s not a game-changer,” said Nazli. “It’s not a country like Turkey or South Africa that’s heavily reliant on funding itself from financial markets.”Despite the recent reduction, foreigners still hold roughly $64bn of Russian sovereign debt across local and foreign currency bonds, according to Elina Ribakova, deputy chief economist at the Institute of International Finance.Russia’s bonds comprise more than 6 per cent of JPMorgan’s widely followed emerging market bond index for local currency debt and 3 per cent of the foreign currency version. Cutting exposure to zero would be a large and risky bet on the underperformance of Russian bonds, meaning investors are in effect forced to hold them.JPMorgan has told investors that it expected newly issued Russian bonds to be excluded from its indices, following the new sanctions being imposed because of their inaccessibility to western investors, according to one fund manager. The bank declined to comment.Following last year’s US sanctions, the bank said actions that affected the “replicability” of its indices by investors could result in the exclusion of sanctioned issuers from the benchmark. If new bonds were excluded, Russia’s share of the index would gradually decline over time as eligible bonds mature.So far, the US and the EU have stopped short of fully barring secondary trading of existing sovereign debt. But some investors are bracing themselves for such a move if the Ukraine crisis continues to escalate, raising the question of whether it would see outstanding bonds dropped from indices, triggering a wave of forced selling by holders.“That would be the next step,” said Szabo. “As things stand, I see it as quite likely.”*This article has been amended to clarify that the US ban on buying new Russia dollar debt has been in place since 2019.
219  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
220  The UK culture secretary has been accused of putting British news organisations in Russia at risk after she called on the media regulator to review Moscow-based television station RT’s presence in the country.Nadine Dorries said Ofcom should take action against the broadcaster over concerns it would broadcast disinformation during the Ukraine crisis, prompting a warning from the Kremlin that it could expel UK journalists in response.Her intervention drew criticism from MPs for threatening the media regulator’s independence, while some senior insiders at the BBC and other leading UK broadcasters raised concerns about the risk of a backlash from Moscow.In a letter to Melanie Dawes, Ofcom’s chief executive, Dorries said she was concerned that RT had breached broadcasting rules in the past and described the station as “demonstrably part of Russia’s global disinformation campaign”.She said she respected Ofcom’s regulatory independence but went on to call for “timely and transparent” action as part of UK efforts to “limit Russia’s ability to spread their propaganda”.In response, Dawes wrote to Dorries that the regulator had already stepped up its oversight of news coverage of the Ukraine crisis but made no mention of RT.Dawes said officials at the regulator had been “keeping the situation under close review” and would “not hesitate to take swift action where necessary”. She pledged to expedite complaints received about Ukraine coverage.Instead of singling out RT, however, she said only that the watchdog was scrutinising broadcast output more generally.Tobias Ellwood, chair of the House of Commons defence select committee, said disinformation was best tackled by challenging it — not by excluding certain media organisations. “That leads to reciprocal actions against our media,” the former minister said.Maria Zakharova, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, said the UK would “not have to wait for countermeasures” if it “goes through with its threats against Russian media”.Zakharova hinted that Russia was likely to expel UK journalists in response, citing Moscow’s closure of Deutsche Welle’s bureau this month after Germany banned RT from broadcasting there.“It was a very foolish thing to do,” Steven Barnett, professor of communications at Westminster university, said of Dorries’ letter. “It’s a great shame that we have a secretary of state who can’t stop and take advice before she shoots.”Critics argued that an aggressive stance against RT could be against the UK’s geopolitical interests since the station has a minimal British audience, whereas the BBC has substantial global reach.“I’d be cautious about banning RT,” said Robert Largan, a Conservative MP. “Putin would respond by banning the BBC in Russia, which actually cuts through his propaganda to millions.”Ofcom has found RT in breach of UK broadcasting rules before: it fined the station £200,000 in 2019 for falling foul of impartiality rules over the coverage of the poisonings in Salisbury, a decision that is being challenged in the courts.However, in response to calls in the wake of the Salisbury incident that RT’s licence should be revoked, Ofcom said that it should focus on licenceholders’ “broadcasting record” and not matters such as political allegiances.Too aggressive enforcement would lead to a “poorer outcome for UK audiences in light of our duties on plurality, diversity and freedom of expression”, the watchdog said at the time.While Ofcom sets itself a high bar to revoke licences, it has taken the step on a handful of occasions in the past.China state broadcaster CGTN was taken off air last year after an investigation found the network was editorially controlled by the Chinese Communist party, in breach of its rules.Appearing in the Commons on Wednesday, Boris Johnson, prime minister, appeared to take a more cautious stance than his culture secretary.“We should leave it up to Ofcom rather than to politicians to decide which media organisations to ban,” he said in response to a question from Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer. “That’s what Russia does.”
221  The first western sanctions against Russia for its growing aggression towards Ukraine may aptly be described as warning shots. These signal disapproval but are innocuous in themselves.Nations led by the US and EU introduced modest counter measures after Russia recognised the independence of two eastern Ukrainian provinces and apparently moved troops there. The toughest sanctions were US crackdowns on some Russian banks and trading of Russian sovereign debt.The US is targeting two state-managed banks, VEB and Promsvyazbank, active in infrastructure and defence financing. It is freezing their US assets and prohibiting US transactions with them. The UK is also sanctioning Promsvyazbank alongside Rossiya, IS Bank, General Bank and the Black Sea Bank.These are hardly top-tier financial institutions. Altogether, their assets total about $100bn. They have been targeted for their purported connections to Russian president Vladimir Putin and his inner circle.The newly sanctioned banks pale into insignificance compared with the country’s largest lenders, Sberbank and VTB. They have assets of $488bn and $246bn respectively. Both are core lending and deposit institutions for ordinary Russian citizens and remain free from new sanctions for now. The US banned any investment in their securities beyond short-term trading in 2014.The US and EU are now also banning secondary trading in Russian sovereign bonds. The US prohibited participation in primary dollar and rouble issues in 2014 and 2021 respectively.Bond prices indicate the cost of borrowing is rising steeply, but canny Russia has limited its national debt to 18 per cent of gross domestic product. Of that, only 17 per cent is in currencies other than roubles. Foreign investors in rouble-based debt are already scarce. They owned only a fifth of outstanding bonds at the end of last year compared with one-third at the end of 2020.Sanctions, as they stand, will do little on their own to raise the cost of capital for Russia or Putin and his cronies any further. Meanwhile, jitters over energy supply have pushed up the price of Brent to almost $100 a barrel. What resource-dependent Russia is losing on the capital market swings, it is recouping on the hydrocarbon roundabouts.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Please tell us what you think of sanctions in Russia in the comments section below.
222  The writer is a senior fellow at Harvard Kennedy School and chief economist at KrollThe last time the European Central Bank raised interest rates, in 2011, then president Jean-Claude Trichet cited “sharp increases in energy and food prices”. The economy tanked, and the rate rises were quickly reversed. Now, food and energy prices are soaring again. This month, ECB president Christine Lagarde refused to rule out rate increases in 2022, and hawkish members of the governing council have urged quicker tightening. They risk repeating Trichet’s mistake.Eurozone inflation has exceeded the ECB’s target of 2 per cent since the middle of last year, accelerating to 5.1 per cent in January, the highest in more than 20 years. Inflation was forecast to slow as Germany’s 2020 value added tax cut and new CO2 tax dropped out of the annual comparison. This was a surprise, and Lagarde is right to be concerned.The problem is there’s not much she and her colleagues can or should do about it. The main driver of higher prices is energy, which accounts for just over half the headline reading. Gas prices rose nearly fourfold from June to December 2021 and jumped again this week as Russia moved into Ukraine. Roughly 40 per cent of Europe’s natural gas is imported from Russia. If Russia decides to turn off the energy taps in retaliation for sanctions, energy costs will rise further. Food prices have also lifted overall inflation.Strip out these factors, though, and core inflation fell to a 2.3 per cent annual rate in January from 2.6 per cent in December. Even with the threat from Russia, European natural gas futures forecast prices will fall in 2023. Brent oil futures, meanwhile, suggest prices will drop from nearly $100 a barrel to $86 a barrel by the end of the year. If the futures markets are right, higher energy costs are transitory and the ECB should look through them. If wrong, elevated energy prices would weaken demand — hardly an environment in which the ECB should tighten policy.Inflation in the eurozone has also been pushed up by supply chain disruptions. There are tentative signs these have been easing. According to Markit’s purchasing managers’ index, manufacturing suppliers’ delivery times continued to shorten in January. Sanctions on Russia could bring new interruptions, but again, that would portend slower growth, another constraint on tighter credit.Sustained wage growth could justify ECB rate rises this year. But so far there is little evidence of this. The labour market has tightened, with unemployment at historically low levels. While employment has recovered to pre-pandemic levels, there remains a significant shortfall in hours worked because of short-term working schemes. Serious wage pressures are only likely to appear once short-term workers are reabsorbed and people start working overtime.Negotiated pay deals play a significant role in eurozone wage growth, covering roughly two-thirds of the workforce and spanning multiple years. Unions, however, have been more focused on protecting employment and seeking benefits and flexibility than pay rises during the pandemic. HSBC research shows wage growth in pay deals dropped to an all-time low of 1.4 per cent year on year in the third quarter of 2021. This is well below 3 per cent, the level identified by ECB chief economist Philip Lane as consistent with the ECB’s 2 per cent inflation target. Hefty minimum wage increases in Germany and Spain will contribute to pay growth for workers up the wage scale, but they are a one-off measure and so won’t lead to a wage-price spiral.Finally, unlike the US, growth in the eurozone is weak. The Bundesbank recently forecast Germany will fall into recession in the first quarter. Eurozone gross domestic product remains below the pre-pandemic trend. High energy costs and Covid restrictions have dragged on consumption, and supply shortages weigh on industrial production. We should see a rebound in the second and third quarters as restrictions are dropped and new Covid cases subside, but it will be tempered by the income shock of higher inflation and energy costs.Aggressive rate estimates for the ECB now have the deposit rate rising 50 basis points to zero per cent by the end of the year. Spreads between peripheral bond yields and German Bunds have crept up in response. The ECB must move slowly and avoid being led by the markets. Raising the policy rate won’t alleviate oil or gas supplies and premature withdrawal of accommodation could kill the recovery and reintroduce fragmentation concerns. Those who do not learn from history risk repeating it.
223  On one level, the Turkish Netflix series The Club is a classic family drama, exploring thorny relationships between mothers and daughters, fathers and sons, and themes of revenge and regret. But it has a more complex, second layer that runs beneath the nostalgic depictions of 1950s Istanbul with its sharp tailoring, vintage cars and music hall stars.The heroine, who is based on the grandmother of one of the show’s writers, is a Jewish former convict called Matilda, whose family was decimated by a 1942 wealth tax that targeted the country’s non-Muslims.A second series, released last month, depicts another seminal moment for Turkey’s minorities: a 1955 pogrom that primarily targeted Istanbul’s Greek community but also engulfed Armenians and Jews. We watch Matilda search frantically for her daughter, Rasel, as nationalist mobs rampage along Independence Avenue, looting and beating.It is hard for those outside Turkey to understand how radical it is to depict these events, which devastated some of the country’s minority communities and remain deeply taboo. “I was amazed,” says Ivo Molinas, the editor-in-chief of the Turkish Jewish newspaper Salom. “We never thought that this kind of series, from the perspective of non-Muslims, could be shown in Turkey.”Turkey is a complicated operating environment for Netflix, like some of the other emerging markets the US streaming giant has sought to conquer. A country of 85mn, where the average age is 33, it is an important growth market as well as a key creative hub. But Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s increasingly heavy-handed efforts to police the cultural sphere have at times made life difficult.The Turkish president, who has described Netflix as an “immoral” outlet that “does not suit” his nation, has imposed stringent new requirements on foreign social media and streaming services. They now face frequent meddling in their output.In 2020, Netflix decided to cancel a Turkish drama called If Only after authorities said that they would only grant permission to film if it removed a gay character. It blocked access to an episode of its American political thriller Designated Survivor after officials in Ankara objected to the portrayal of a fictitious Turkish president as a villain. Last December, it was forced to take down a Spanish film called More the Merrier after the broadcast watchdog said that its depictions of incest and swinging were at odds with “Turkish family values”.Yet though it has at times bowed to censorship, Netflix has also pushed boundaries with shows like The Club. Another original series, Fatma, told the story of a cleaner who went on a killing rampage against men in response to years of misogyny and trauma. A show called Ethos sparked a debate about the country’s deep political polarisation. Turkish critic Kenan Behzat Sharpe said it was as if the show “put us all in the therapist’s office and asked us to speak”.It is striking, however, that no openly gay character has appeared in a Turkish Netflix original since the debacle over If Only two years ago. Any show that explicitly satirised or mocked the current government would presumably also be a no-go.Company executives insist they are not engaging in self-censorship. Pelin Distas, Netflix’s director of original content for Turkey, says she and her team would give the green light to any script that contained “authentic vision or a great story”. She says Netflix never tells its writers what to do: “We strongly believe in creative freedom and artistic expression.”Since obtaining a local licence, Netflix no longer has to submit scripts for approval to film in Turkey. But the streaming service must comply with local law — including takedown requests from the government. As a result, it seems willing to accept an uneasy compromise, pushing some boundaries but respecting others, in order to retain a foothold.“In an ideal world, they wouldn’t be bowing down, says Bilge Yesil, an associate professor of media culture at the City University of New York. “But it’s not an ideal world.” For all the virtues of series such as The Club, Yesil adds, “Netflix is not producing these shows to unearth the unspoken ugly truths about Turkish history.what drives Netflix is obviously profit.” This article has been amended to clarify that Netflix was forced to take down the ‘More the Merrier’ but was not fined
224  The writer is director of the New Europe Center think-tank, based in KyivHow it is it possible?.In the 21st century?. In Europe?” These are the questions echoing in Ukraine, voiced by people from all walks of life. Ukrainians are watching with horror and dismay as Vladimir Putin outwits the democratic world yet again and it seems nobody has the nerve to stop him.The Russian president is so confident that he hasn’t even bothered to upgrade his old playbook: he is using the same hybrid tactics he has in the past: moving troops into another country’s territory under the pretext of defending Russian-speaking people or those to whom he has granted Russian citizenship.This ploy is so tired that there’s a joke in Ukraine about a formerly Russian-speaking man who suddenly starts speaking in Ukrainian. When asked why he switched, he replies: “I don’t want Putin to come to defend me.” By pretending to be a peacekeeper in the Donbas region, and formally recognising the Moscow-backed separatist “republics” of Luhansk and Donetsk, Putin has once again proved himself a warmonger. There is no doubt in the minds of Ukrainians that his imperialistic agenda will not be satisfied by this incursion. Otherwise, why would he have massed up to 190,000 troops at the Ukrainian border?The reaction from western countries this week is strong by the standards of 2014 — but not by those of 2022. The wave of sanctions announced by the US and Europe on Tuesday is a good first step, but world leaders should make ready to roll out more of them before waiting for a full-scale invasion. Western leaders must now do what they have been reluctant to do for the past eight years, and choose deterrence rather than more dialogue. It was clear from the very beginning that Putin would start any new invasion in a manner that could allow him to dodge sanctions for as long as possible.US president Joe Biden in particular should be feeling a strong sense of déjà vu now: he is the only western leader who not only witnessed, but had to deal directly with Putin’s aggression in 2014 at the top of government. If anyone should be drawing lessons from that time, it is him.He deserves credit for his efforts to align the US and its European partners’ responses and for increased military assistance to Ukraine. He must now put in place the full force of sanctions available to him and give the green light to an upgraded version of the Ukrainian Democracy Defense Lend-Lease programme that would boost the provision of military equipment.Both Ukraine and the west have had enough time to draw lessons from the 2014 annexation of Crimea and, accordingly, to prepare for Putin’s next offensive. Some useful actions were taken, but even the most important of these has been blurred by the mixed messages western nations have sent to the Kremlin. The long prevarication over the Nord Stream 2 project, the calls from different world capitals to ease sanctions, the attempts by international leaders to establish dialogue with Putin — all these did nothing to deter him.Western leaders have failed to accept a simple fact: today Russia poses an external security threat, but it is also a source of domestic destabilisation — not only to Ukraine, but to the US and many other western countries too. Putin has convinced the world he is ready to start a war in Ukraine, but, as of now, the west has failed to convince him that the price of his aggression would be higher than the potential gains. As Ukraine imposes a state of national emergency, it is already paying the price for that failure. According to the most recent estimates by the Ukrainian government, the country is losing $3bn a month as a result of the current escalation.It is not too late to prevent what could be the bloodiest conflict in Europe since the second world war. I find it impossible to believe that the combined efforts of democratic leaders are not enough to counter a single authoritarian, who has been successfully outwitting the democratic world for more than a decade.Unless Putin is stopped now he will continue to do this for years — and each time his plans will grow grander and more catastrophic.
225  Well, that was a surprise. German chancellor Olaf Scholz’s decision yesterday to suspend the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project was the first sign that Berlin might get serious in opposing Russia’s aggressions against Ukraine.It remains to be seen whether Germany, hitherto President Vladimir Putin’s most reliable heavy-hitting friend in the EU, has stopped Nord Stream 2 for good or just hit pause to see how the situation evolves. The first-round package of sanctions the EU is collectively planning reaches further than many had expected, including asset freezes and travel bans on Putin’s defence minister and chief of staff. But by continuing mainly to focus narrowly on banks and individuals connected to the incursion, the sanctions suggest the EU may not fully recognise the weakness of its efforts at punishing Putin’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and incursions into eastern Ukraine.If Nord Stream 2 is cancelled, it won’t be an immediate economic blow to Russia, which already has the Nord Stream 1 and Yamal gas pipelines to Europe. The significance is rather that Germany might finally be signalling it is prepared to absorb substantial economic and political pain as a cost of isolating Putin’s regime. (The UK, because of the impact on London as a financial centre or, more likely, on the Conservative party, has manifestly failed the same test.)Russia isn’t intrinsically economically resilient to sanctions. It’s got a small and stunted economy — its gross domestic product is about the size of Spain’s at market prices — heavily dependent on exports of fossil fuels and other commodities and which imports a lot of food and consumer goods. Its oligarch business class holds huge amounts of assets abroad. But it has a proven ability to absorb a considerable amount of economic damage even when, perhaps particularly when, directed at households.The supposedly state of the art 2014 sanctions were co-ordinated between allies including the US, EU, Australia, Canada and Japan. Inevitably designated “smart”, they were aimed at pressure points including individuals involved in fighting in Ukraine and companies operating in Crimea while shielding EU companies dependent on imports from Russia.The Russian economy suffered in the years following, going into the longest recession in twenty years in 2014-2015. But most of that reflected the fall in the global oil price. The IMF reckons from 2014-2018, the oil price had a negative impact three times larger than the sanctions. When world oil prices recovered, so did Russian GDP.Nor did sanctions effectively constrain the activities or loyalty of many of the Russian oligarchs regarded as close to Putin. Their activities are typically concentrated in energy and energy-dependent commodities — fertiliser, steel — on which western European companies rely. Even when they did have an impact, it did not turn them against the regime. Oleg Deripaska, one of the highest-profile targets, took a personal financial hit over being forced to divest from the aluminium giant Rusal, but he is still regarded as a Putin ally. He is also still a billionaire.If the sanctions were supposed to undermine Putin’s standing with the public or the oligarchs in the short term, they failed. His personal popularity soared after the invasion, and he was confident enough to inflict a whole lot more pain on the Russian public by blocking imports from the EU in retaliation.Around 75 per cent of Russian consumer goods are imported, and before 2014 Russia was heavily dependent on food from abroad. Russia’s own trade sanctions didn’t do much lasting damage to EU exporters, who found other markets. But together with a sharp drop in the rouble, they drove inflation in Russia to double digits in 2015, cutting into household incomes. Even when the oil price recovered, Russia’s government decided to use the bonanza to buy some expensive insurance against future sanctions by running up foreign exchange reserves rather than allow the benefit to flow to consumers.Certainly, there is public discontent in Russia over stagnant living standards. But it doesn’t seem to be at a level that directly threatens Putin’s power or prevents further military adventures. The president’s approval ratings have dropped from 80 per cent plus levels after the crisis, but have generally held above 60 per cent since mid-2018.Similarly, if the EU’s sanctions on individuals active in Crimea were intended to breed mass discontent by inducing economic stagnation through keeping out competent administrators and business people, they haven’t succeeded yet.This is why gas is important. Despite Russia’s new pipeline to China, sales to Europe are a source of income it cannot currently do without. Russia has a fair degree of monopoly power there, but as a major customer Europe has some monopsony power to balance it. Of course, the cost to western Europe of actually ending dependency would be high, including having to import expensive liquefied natural gas from elsewhere, a point made yesterday by Putin conduit and former notional Russian president Dmitry Medvedev. An excellent time to do so would have been 10 or 15 years ago, when oil and gas prices were low. But it’s still a burden worth incurring now. It’s hard to put effective sanctions on a country that’s prepared to let its own public suffer without taking on some costs yourself.To be grimly realistic, it might already be too late for sanctions to restrain Putin’s attempt to carve two vassal republics out of Ukraine. He’s got some insulation from short-term risks through foreign exchange reserves and appears to be getting more rather than less reckless. But Germany’s announcement on Nord Stream 2 is at least a signal that Berlin knows what is required.
226  Two international public broadcasters are facing an imminent ban in Turkey after defying a demand from authorities that they described as “censorship”.Germany’s Deutsche Welle and the US public radio service Voice of America said they would refuse to comply with a request, published by Turkey’s broadcast watchdog on Monday, to apply for a broadcast licence within 72 hours — or have access to their websites blocked in Turkey.The two state-owned outlets, both of which produce an array of Turkish-language news content, said they would appeal against the demand.The France-based Euronews, which was subject to an identical request, will block access to its English-language videos and live TV feeds for people in Turkey in order to comply with the regulations. A spokesman for the company told the Financial Times that it had “made the required technical adjustments to ensure that our Turkish edition can remain legally online in Turkey.”The stand-off with two leading foreign news outlets risks triggering renewed tensions between Ankara and the west at a time when President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been seeking warmer ties after years of fraught relations.Responding to reports of an impending showdown between Ankara and the three broadcasters earlier this month, the US state department told Voice of America: “Our concerns regarding press freedoms in Turkey are well documented and we continue to urge Turkey to respect and ensure freedom of expression.”Turkey’s Radio and Television Supreme Council argues that, because they produce Turkish language on-demand and live video reports as well as text-based news stories, the three foreign outlets should comply with a law requiring online broadcasters to have a licence.That claim was rejected by Voice of America, which warned that licensing would lead to “directives from a regulator to censor or remove content”.The Washington-based news service said in a statement: “Licensing is the norm for radio and TV broadcasting, because broadcast spectrum is a finite public resource, and governments have a recognised responsibility to regulate the spectrum to ensure it is used in the broader public’s interest. The internet, by contrast, is not a limited resource, and the only possible purpose of a licensing requirement for internet distribution is enabling censorship.”Deutsche Welle said that submitting to the request would give Turkish authorities the option to “block the entire service based on individual, critical reports unless these reports are deleted”. “This would open up the possibility of censorship,” said Peter Limbourg, DW’s director-general. “We will appeal against this decision and take legal action in the Turkish courts.”The German public broadcaster added that it had already established a liaison office in Turkey in accordance with the 2019 law, and had been registered with the Turkish authorities since February 2020.Turkey has cracked down hard on local media in recent years as Erdogan has grown increasingly intolerant of dissenting views.Arrests, shutdowns, media takeovers and stringent court rulings that took place in the wake of a violent 2016 attempted coup “effectively eradicated the country’s mainstream media and prompted many journalists to leave the profession”, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.International news outlets and social media sites have increasingly found themselves caught up in the government’s efforts to curb free speech as they have become a haven for opposition voices.YouTube, Facebook and Twitter all bowed to pressure from the Turkish government to set up offices in the country and appoint local representatives after they were threatened with a de facto ban that would have hit their revenues. Critics said the move would make them more vulnerable to government pressure.A previous version of this article suggested that Euronews would apply for a licence from the Turkish authorities. It has been amended to reflect the fact that it will not apply for a licence but rather block access to English-language video content in order to comply with the regulations.
227  As Northern Ireland descended into sectarian violence in 1970, Britain’s home secretary Reginald Maudling travelled to Belfast for talks with Protestant and Catholic leaders. Boarding an RAF flight to return to London, he gave full expression to his feelings for this particular corner of the UK. “For God’s sake, bring me a large Scotch! What a bloody awful country”.A bloody awful country. This from a senior representative of the Conservative and Unionist party. Maudling, with his great fondness for whisky, was an unconventional minister, but his views were unexceptionable. For many at Westminster, Northern Ireland was, and is, a cross to bear — and a heavy one at that. Boris Johnson could never admit it publicly but, even as the UK prime minister grapples with the EU about post-Brexit trading arrangements for the province, he has scarcely shown himself as a staunch unionist. And while they profess their “Britishness”, unionist leaders do their cause few favours. Seen from the mainland, loyalist celebrations marking the Protestant William of Orange’s victory over the Catholic King James II several centuries ago look at best rather eccentric.England ruled Ireland for centuries. The 12th-century Normans were followed by the English Protestants and Scottish presbyterians dispatched to the north-eastern corner of the country by the Tudors and Stuarts. And as Fergal Tobin recounts in his “tumultuous history”, The Irish Difference, back in London, Ireland’s masters paid scant attention.Tobin’s narrative recalls spells of ruthless pacification interspersed with long periods of neglect and indifference. In the description of William Thackeray on the eve of the 19th-century great famine, Ireland was “a dirty and ruinous place”. Irish nationalism unsurprisingly coated its dreams of a lost Gaelic past with burning hostility towards the English.A publisher-turned historian, Tobin sets out to explain why, even as it has by and large rubbed along with Wales and Scotland, England’s ties with its island neighbour have been so violently fraught. Even allowing for periodic English fears that Ireland offered a backdoor to the British mainland for its continental, Catholic, enemies, what has made the relationship so different?Tobin eschews a conventional retelling of Cromwell’s wars of the 17th century, the 1916 Easter Rising, the creation of the Free State and such like for the broad sweep of the relationship. His style is anecdotal, focusing on social, emotional and cultural collisions. We learn that the Gaelic Athletic Association, an essential pillar of modern Irish nationalism, was born “in a billiard room of Miss Hayes’ Commercial Hotel in Thurles, Co Tipperary on 1 November 1884”. Soon afterwards, the newly formed National Literary Society asked the Gaelic League’s Douglas Hyde to deliver an inaugural address: “The Necessity of De-Anglicising the Irish People”.One way or another, Tobin notes, Scotland and Wales made their accommodations with the English, at least since the Scottish Act of Union in 1707. But then they could hold on to their national identities. Scotland retained the social and cultural infrastructure of a state, including a landowning aristocracy, legal system and church. Ireland, on the other hand, was colonised, its native aristocracy destroyed and lands confiscated by the English interlopers.The structural faultline was confessional. The Reformation never reached Ireland, and England failed dismally in repeated attempts to snuff out Irish Catholicism. True enough, the Anglo-Protestant Charles Stewart Parnell led the Home Rule movement of the second half of the 19th century, but the visceral force of nationalism was rooted in its Catholicism.By the early 1800s, a network of seminaries in continental Europe was supplying the priests, and the parish system — a Catholic church in every village — the local bases for grass roots opposition to English rule. The nationalist Daniel O’Connell mobilised Catholic Ireland behind, as Tobin puts it, “faith and fatherland”.If there was a single event that made rupture unavoidable it was the famine of 1845-52. At the start of the 1840s the census recorded a population of 8mn Irish citizens. A million died and another million were forced to emigrate, mostly to the US, by the successive failures of the potato crop. England turned its back, its inaction shaped by “economic ideology, godly providentialism and cultural condescension”. Ireland would never forget. Nor, incidentally, would the descendants, including one Joseph R Biden, of those who fled across the Atlantic. The island’s population, at present about 6.6mn, has never since reached pre-famine levels.A century after partition left six of Ulster’s nine counties in the UK, the Irish question has not gone away. Brexit has loosened the cement of the UK union. Northern Ireland’s mostly unionist Protestants are set to lose their numerical majority over, mostly nationalist, Catholics. Sinn Féin, long associated with the violent republicanism of the IRA, is leading the opinion polls in the Republic and may soon emerge as the largest party in the Stormont assembly.The title of Kevin Meagher’s short book, A United Ireland, speaks for itself. Like many on the nationalist side of the argument he believes that Britain and Ireland will soon write the story’s final chapter. Beyond the centrifugal forces of Brexit and the march of demography, Meagher, a journalist and former political adviser to the Labour party’s Northern Ireland spokesperson, assembles an impressive array of reasons as to why a united Ireland is now in plain sight.For one thing, the Republic can now make a more attractive offer to its cousins in the north. It is less threatening. The backward, inward-looking Catholic theocracy of Éamon de Valera’s Free State has made way for a thriving, socially liberal modern European nation. Once the poor neighbour, the Republic is now the rich kid, an EU success story. As for the confessional divide, the Catholic Church’s grip has been broken. Protestants would be joining a secular state. Meagher is confident: “A united Ireland within a decade or so is a real, and growing, possibility”.The mechanism would be the referendums, north and south, provided for in the Good Friday, or Belfast, peace agreement of 1998 which brought an end to nearly 30 years of violent conflict between hardline republicans and unionists. Meagher takes Sinn Féin’s advance as confirmation, if any were needed, that the Republic is fully behind unity. As for the north, numerical parity between the two communities will over time make way for a Catholic (read nationalist) majority.All in all, politics, demography and economics are pulling in the same direction. Attachment to a struggling Brexit Britain is not so attractive a proposition to unionism. For its part, England, he judges, will be happy to see Northern Ireland go. It all makes sense, Maegher says. And so it does if one thinks that the door can be smoothly closed on centuries of antagonism, that identity politics will succumb to economic logic and that Irish unity is really only a question of numbers.The writer Glenn Patterson is not at all so sure. It is one thing to talk about the mechanics of removing the legal as well as the physical border on the island of Ireland. Quite another to imagine a spontaneous meeting of minds between communities separated by centuries of difference. For many unionists, Patterson notes in The Last Irish Question, the Republic remains a distant country of which they know little and care less. The south is terra incognita. Why should it be anything else?Patterson is unconvinced that the Protestant community will be easily persuaded. The peace in the province promised by the 1998 Good Friday Agreement is better defined as an absence, by and large, of violence. The sectarian divide has not been bridged and paramilitaries on both sides still lurk in wings. Extremists aside, unionists do not hate the Republic — indeed, you will find them cheering from the stands alongside nationalists when the all-Ireland rugby team take on the English in the Six Nations cup. But they prefer to see themselves as British. And for most of them the south sits behind a curtain of gauze.The author, brought up in Belfast’s Protestant community, sets off on a tour of the Republic to pull back a corner of the curtain. His travels, written up in loose diary form, coincide with the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, the dispute with Brussels about Northern Ireland’s special economic status, and political upheaval in the north’s Democratic Unionist Party.Patterson returns from his travels unconvinced the Republic has an offer that will accommodate a million Protestants who identify as Brits. To the contrary, nationalist Ireland seems disinclined to accept that it too might have to change. Among the Sinn Féin politicians demanding an early vote on unity he finds the mood depressingly triumphalist. “We’ve won”. Northern Ireland’s unionists may think otherwise.Therein lies the lesson of history. Majorities north and south can vote to remove the legal border between the 26 southern counties and the six of the north. But building a united Ireland will take a lot more than a couple of referendums. Ireland and Britain may well be on the cusp of a final chapter but these three very different books are a sharp reminder that it may not be easily written.The Irish Difference, A Tumultuous History of Ireland’s Breakup with Britain by Fergal Tobin, Atlantic, £18.99, 302 pagesA United Ireland.

228  As the world watches Russian troops massed near the Ukrainian border, Moscow’s military is quietly making inroads in a different region: the Sahel. Last week, French president Emmanuel Macron said Paris would withdraw its troops from Mali, the centre of a spreading jihadi threat, after Mali’s military government invited in 1,000 mercenaries from Russia’s Wagner group.The causes of the threat in the Sahel, a semi-arid strip below the Sahara, are complex. They include weak or military governments; pressure on land from rising populations and climate change; lack of opportunity; and the free flow of arms from Libya, scene of a previous flawed intervention. Stirred into this deadly cocktail are enmities between pastoralists and farmers, criminal gangs and the millenarian ideology of multiple jihadi groups loosely affiliated with Isis and al-Qaeda. Violence has spread, initially into Burkina Faso and Niger, but also to more stable coastal states such as Ivory Coast. Thousands have been killed and millions displaced.Inevitably, France, the former colonial power of the countries most affected, has been drawn in. So to some extent has Europe, which has helped bolster the French military presence in Mali, and in whose interest it is to stabilise a region that could become a source of migration and terror.There is no military solution, though armed forces must inevitably play a role. France sent troops to Mali in 2013 to defeat jihadis threatening to take over the country. Its intervention, requested by Mali, was effective and initially popular. It has been subject to mission creep. France has sought to decapitate the hydra-headed terrorist threat with air strikes, hardening public opinion against it. In fairness, Mali’s government has complained more bitterly about the withdrawal of French troops than about their presence.Russian mercenaries will not improve things. They cannot defeat jihadis. If their record in the Central African Republic is anything to go by, they will commit atrocities and pursue narrow commercial interests. Under such circumstances, France and Europe, including the UK, need to have some sort of military presence in the region, probably centred on Niger.There may also be some merit in talking with “jihadi” groups, some of which are less militant than others. France has resolutely opposed dialogue, but Mali’s government is now free to pursue that option.It is in the economic arena where Europe can do most good. The EU made a tentative start at the EU-Africa Summit last week. European states pledged to work more closely together under the framework of the Global Gateway, a six-year €300bn fund of which Africa is due about half, and which is Europe’s counter-offer to China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Commercial competition is fine, but neither Europe nor China will gain anything by treating the Sahel as a theatre for geopolitical rivalry. Better to co-operate where they can on projects such as ports, roads and power.Europe should closely integrate its offering with the World Bank to provide the biggest development bang for its donor buck. Investments in health and education, especially of women, will pay dividends as will those in viable businesses that can raise living standards. The only possible long-term solution to the brewing catastrophe in the Sahel lies in the development of legitimate, preferably democratic, states that can offer young people the means to resist the siren call of violence. In their absence, an already dire situation will get worse.
229  The Ukraine crisis poses a severe threat to global optimism about the recovery from the pandemic after Russia ordered troops to enter Ukraine’s separatist regions, triggering a round of sanctions and higher energy prices.Even before the Ukraine crisis had escalated, central banks were sounding the alarm over the threat of a prolonged period of high inflation.Now the tensions are forecast to push oil and gas prices higher, and further slow the economic recovery, especially in Europe, increasing concerns over the course of inflation and amplifying the dilemma of when to tighten monetary policy.Most economists think advanced economies have the resilience to emerge without deep scars despite the difficulties.Daniela Ordonez at Oxford Economics noted that, although the “Russia crisis will put economic optimism to the test”, confidence was high after strong business surveys.But an escalation of tensions could quickly sour the mood in advanced economies, warned Nathan Sheets, global chief economist at Citi.A conflict across Ukraine would undermine his base case of a relatively smooth economic path ahead as inflationary pressures squeezed household incomes. “In the face of these mounting pressures, recession is no longer seen as just a tail risk,” he said.The immediate threat to the global economy from escalating sanctions will be limited, economists believe. Although some sectors and commodity users are dependent on trade with Russia, overall exports have fallen back sharply since Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014. Russia’s share of German exports has fallen from 3.5 per cent in 2014 to under 2 per cent and its share of US exports is less than 0.5 per cent.But the indirect effect of Russia’s actions on global oil and gas prices threatens to be much more significant. Brent crude prices rose sharply on Tuesday to levels just below $100 a barrel, with wholesale gas prices also up sharply.Bethany Beckett, economist at Capital Economics, said that “clearly, a Russia-Ukraine conflict raises the risk that inflation stays higher for longer”, hitting energy consumers among both companies and households.But if supplies of gas from Russia were to be disrupted, a European Central Bank simulation exercise showed the effects could be painful. It estimated a 10 per cent shortage in gas could knock 0.7 per cent off eurozone gross domestic product, with the effects most pronounced among countries with large gas and electricity sectors and industries most dependent on gas.Qatar’s energy ministry stressed on Tuesday that neither it nor others could fully replace Russian gas supplies to Europe if they were cut.The ECB was a little more reassuring about real-world effects, however. It stressed that while energy price rises at the end of last year will probably reduce eurozone output by 0.2 per cent by end-2022, a “significant negative” effect the ECB said, this was a smaller impact than its simulation of gas shortages.Most economists think this scale of impact would not be that serious in countries that have suffered much larger contractions during the pandemic and which could adapt to reduced gas supplies from Russia.Immediate actions such as Germany’s decision on Tuesday to halt the approval of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline would have “strong symbolic value” and “limited practical implications”, said Elina Ribakova, deputy chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, because it is yet to be operational.Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, believes Russia would feel the pinch of tit-for-tat sanctions before western countries. He argued that if the crisis did not amplify significantly, sanctions “would weaken the Russian economy over time with very limited impact on the advanced world”.Financial markets would return to normal after a while, he predicted, and after a few months of setbacks to business and consumer confidence, “economic growth in Europe [would be] back on track for a strong post-Omicron rebound amid easing supply shortages”.Central banks, however, would be faced with a more acute dilemma if there were further rises in energy prices and inflation. They would need to demonstrate they were serious about controlling price rises but also recognise that the squeeze in incomes would also be more powerful in bringing inflation down than tightening monetary policy.“Should food or energy prices rise further and add to near-term inflation pressures, the ECB and Bank of England will need to ask searching questions as to whether that will have a larger upward effect on inflation expectations and pay, or a downward effect on real incomes, confidence, spending and thereby medium-term inflation,” said George Buckley, chief European economist at Nomura.Having signalled that they are increasingly keen to tighten policy, central bankers are now making noises suggesting they would worry as much about the potential for lower growth as higher inflation.Isabel Schnabel, a member of the ECB’s executive board, told the Financial Times last week that if tensions in Ukraine escalated, “it is in my view unlikely that we would accelerate policy normalisation in such circumstances”.Noting uncertainties over Ukraine and market expectations for a sharp rise in UK interest rates, Sir Dave Ramsden, deputy governor of the BoE, said “there are also risks from tightening monetary policy too much”.Financial market expectations of a 0.5 percentage point increase in US rates in March have also been scaled back over the past week, with most expecting a tightening of half the size.Views are changing rapidly in response to events on the ground in Ukraine.Erik Nielsen, adviser to UniCredit, said the main thing economists knew was how little they knew. There were now “unprecedented uncertainties across the entire economic and geopolitical waterfront”, he said.
230  Good morning after another whirlwind of developments on the Russia-Ukraine front.The EU, the US and the UK have adopted a first wave of sanctions in response to Russia’s recognition of Ukraine’s eastern breakaway republics and its subsequent deployment of troops into those territories. EU ambassadors last night agreed on blacklisting 351 members of the Russian parliament, three banks (Rossiya, Promsvyazbank, VEB-bank) and trade in securities — with the legal text set to be approved later this afternoon.But given that Vladimir Putin endorsed the claims of Russian-backed separatists to the entire Donbas region, setting the stage for a full-blown conflict, more sanctions are likely down the road. “We are afraid that this story has not finished,” said EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, adding that allies were still “keeping ammunition in our toolbox”.Meanwhile, Germany halted the approval of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline indefinitely, a decision which prompted threats from Moscow with a considerable increase to the price of gas. The EU imports 40 per cent of its gas from Russia and says it could survive a cut-off. But two of the EU’s alternative gas suppliers, Azerbaijan and Qatar, caution that no country could make up for the gap. We’ll unpack their arguments and the reasons for the EU to be so confident.In disinformation news, the EU’s diplomatic service has registered a considerable uptick in Russian propaganda justifying a war in Ukraine.As for Brussels’ other initiatives, the European Commission today is set to put forward proposals aimed at spurring the use of big data by European companies — the flipside being criticism that restrictions for transfers outside the bloc have a protectionist tinge.Europe’s strategy to rely on alternative gas supplies in case Russia turns off the tap was given a reality check yesterday, with officials from two fossil-rich countries warning they can’t fill the gap in the short term, write Valentina Pop and Henry Foy in Brussels and Andrew England in London.Last week, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said during the Munich Security Conference that the bloc could even withstand a full cut-off in Russian gas supplies. The EU has received a boost from liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipments and relatively mild winter weather recently, slowing depletion of gas reserves — even if that hasn’t warded off the threat of high prices.But in an interview with Europe Express, the ambassador of Azerbaijan to the EU, Vaqif Sadiqov, said that while his country is willing to increase gas deliveries to Europe, it will take at least a year to tap new reserves in the Caspian Sea or connect other potential suppliers such as Turkmenistan to the pipeline network shipping gas to Europe.“We are not looking at ourselves as saviours of Europe or heroes that will cover all the demand in Europe. That would be ridiculous,” Sadiqov said.Even if Azerbaijan were to use a direct pipeline to Italy at its maximum capacity, around 30bn cubic metres per year, it would still fall far short of the roughly 150bcm a year Europe gets from Russia, he said. “We are not going to compete with Russia on the European market,” Sadiqov said.He also warned against expecting countries would offer Europe their own reserves “as a means of emergency support or supply”.Meanwhile, the energy minister of Qatar, one of the world’s biggest LNG producers told reporters in Doha yesterday that there was “no single country” that could replace Russian exports to Europe.The US has asked Qatar, the world’s largest exporter of LNG, to help fill the energy gap if Russian gas supplies to Europe are disrupted. But Qatar would require the consent of its big Asian clients, which are locked into long-term fixed contracts, to divert any LNG to Europe. Qatari officials have also cautioned that even then it would only be a short-term fix and not be sufficient to meet Europe’s needs.Saad al-Kaabi, Qatar’s energy minister, said the amount of Qatari LNG that could be diverted to Europe is only 10-15 per cent.Russian officials have wasted no time in making unveiled threats with the price of gas, following Germany’s move yesterday to pull the plug on Nord Stream 2. Former president Dmitry Medvedev, currently deputy chief of the Russian security council, tweeted that Europeans are “very soon going to pay €2,000 for 1,000 cubic metres of natural gas.”After Putin ordered troops into Ukraine on Monday evening, the EU’s diplomatic service observed a considerable uptick in disinformation coming from the Kremlin and targeting the bloc, writes Eleni Varvitsioti in Brussels.“We see an astonishing co-ordination of many outlets,” said a senior EU official, noting that state-controlled information manipulation is pushed in a very co-ordinated way.What officials have seen in the past hours is a change in the Kremlin narrative with an abundance of stories talking about Russia being under threat and needing to defend itself. Ukraine has been portrayed as a failed, corrupt state not worth protecting. In addition, fabricated stories are circulating in social media that could be used as a “casus belli”, an act that justifies war.“It is relatively clear to us that it’s about the destabilisation of Ukraine, targeting European audiences and portraying Kyiv as a failed state,” said an EU senior official.EU officials who have been looking into Russian disinformation since 2015 can see a “clear state-organised information manipulation” taking place at this moment. Key government figures from the ministry of foreign affairs, ministry of defence, members of the Duma are taking part to pass the message. “A clear playbook is rolled out; it’s planned and co-ordinated,” an official from the bloc said.Brent crude oil headed towards $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014, European natural gas prices jumped and global equities traded choppily yesterday after Russia’s President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into Ukraine. (More here)The European Commission is expected to put forward proposals today aimed at restricting the transfer of European big data to companies based in countries including China and the US, writes Javier Espinoza in Brussels.Not content with draft regulations aimed at severely hampering the growing power of Big Tech, regulators in Brussels will today unveil the Data Act, that outlines limitations of transfer of big data generated by smart household devices, cars or even connected irrigation systems to companies based outside the bloc.Some concerns are legitimate and have been growing since privacy activist Edward Snowden lifted the lid on mass US surveillance nearly a decade ago. Last year, the EU’s top court also scrapped a transatlantic data transfer deal between the US and the EU that is used by thousands of companies to move data on privacy concerns.But while existing regulation has safeguards for the transfer of personal data, the Data Act replicates that when it comes to non-personal, large data sets that can be used by artificial intelligence.Industry lobbyists are worried about the feasibility of keeping European data in Europe while at the same time cutting out key trade partners in the US and China.Still, Thierry Breton, the French internal market commissioner, has defended this philosophy. In an interview with the FT when he first outlined the idea, he said: “My goal is to prepare ourselves so the data will be used for Europeans, by Europeans and with our values.”
231  The writer is Levin professor of history at Yale University and the author of books on Russian and Ukrainian history including ‘Bloodlands’ and ‘The Road to Unfreedom’On Monday afternoon I took part in the dissertation defence of a young Ukrainian historian. I had to call in to Lviv, to the Ukrainian Catholic University. On a day full of threats, we had a discussion of history.The candidate submitted a biography of Mykhailo Rudnyts’kyi, a poet and literary critic who hailed from an illustrious Ukrainian family: one of his brothers, Antin, was a composer; his other brother, Ivan, was a journalist; and their sister, Milena, was a feminist, parliamentarian, an activist at the League of Nations.They were born in the old Habsburg monarchy and matured in the Poland of the 1920s and 1930s, which had a large Ukrainian minority. The Rudnyts’kyis lived in a cosmopolitan city that they called Lviv. Not far to the east was the Soviet Union, with its Ukrainian republic, home to far more Ukrainians.A century of Ukrainian pain and hope came through the details of the family history. In 1932 and 1933, Milena struggled to bring the attention of the world to the Holodomor, Stalin’s political famine in Soviet Ukraine, which killed some 4mn people. Stalin, for his part, blamed Ukrainians themselves for starving and his propaganda called anyone who mentioned the famine a Nazi.Hitler had just come to power. Like Stalin, he wanted to master the fertile black earth of Ukraine and his ultimate war aim was to win it for a German racial empire. In 1939, Stalin and Hitler were allies in the first part of the second world war and split Poland between them. Suddenly the Rudnyts’kyis’ home city of Lviv was part of the Soviet Union.Three siblings fled; Mykhailo remained. Then, in 1941, Hitler betrayed Stalin, and Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union. Now Lviv fell under Nazi rule. Mykhailo went underground and earned a living as a pseudonymous translator.He and his siblings were Jewish on their mother’s side. They were all famous Ukrainians; it was a nation they had chosen. Two of their grandparents were Jews, one was a German-speaking Pole and only one was Ukrainian. Their father and their mother had spoken Polish together, and their father had died young. Yet they all helped to make a Ukrainian nation.I was thinking about all this as Russian artillery began to fall in eastern Ukraine.Ukraine has been independent since 1991, since the end of the Soviet Union. In 2014, Russia invaded, occupied and annexed a good deal of Ukrainian territory. And on Monday evening Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered troops into eastern Ukraine.While a young Ukrainian was getting his PhD, Russia’s president justified violence with a bizarre diatribe about the past that brought into intense focus claims Putin made last July in a long essay: there is no Ukraine; no Ukrainians; it is all just part of Russia, or invented by Russia, therefore to be claimed and controlled and, if necessary, annihilated by Russia. Putin is no historian. Ukraine has its own distinct and fascinating history and Ukrainians have as much a right to a future as anyone else.Putin thinks that everyone who speaks Russian must be a Russian, and needs his protection. Pretty much everyone in Ukraine does speak Russian. Everyone in the room during the dissertation defence spoke Russian, I would guess. Mykhailo Rudnyts’kyi, for that matter, knew Russian. But all of these people, past and present, also know Ukrainian. The dissertation was written in Ukrainian. And all of these people, past and present, knew Polish, and other languages.There is a deeper issue here. Whatever language we speak, it is what we say that matters. Our identity is not to be decided by distant tyrants, whatever language they might speak.Nations are built by people who take risks now in the name of a better future for the people they choose. It can all be swept away, of course, by people with other ideas and greater power. Stalin and Hitler had visions for Ukraine that comported with their own ideologies. When the two of them were in power, between 1933 and 1945, Ukraine was the most dangerous place on earth. Putin has his own contorted view, and seems to be dragging Russia to war on its basis.At the end of the dissertation defence, everyone clapped. Knowledge had been secured and civilisation, in some humble way, consolidated. Not long after the ceremony ended, Russian soldiers crossed the border. They had been given a copy of Putin’s essay on Ukraine and Russia, a farcical myth of enforced unity. We need more dissertations from young people and fewer war pamphlets from old dictators.History cannot stop a war. But it can help us, at least, to understand how one begins, which is with arrogance and lies.
232  Western powers impose sanctions on Russia as Biden says Ukraine ‘invasion’ has begun, and Russian assets are set to bear the brunt of the Ukraine conflict. Plus, the FT’s Berlin bureau chief, Guy Chazan, explains what freezing the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project means for Germany. Biden imposes wave of sanctions on Russia for Ukraine ‘invasion’Russian stocks sell off on mounting sanctions risksPutin backs separatist claims to whole Donbas region of Ukraine
233  Joe Biden launched a salvo of sanctions against Russia as he accused President Vladimir Putin of beginning an invasion of Ukraine, and warned that Washington was prepared to take further action if Moscow escalates its assault on Ukrainian territory.Speaking from the White House on Tuesday, the US president announced measures targeting two of Russia’s largest financial institutions, VEB and Promsvyazbank, which support economic development and defence projects, as well as the country’s elites and their family members.Sanctions would also be aimed at Russia’s sovereign debt. “We’ve cut off Russia’s government from western financing,” Biden said. “It can no longer raise money from the west and cannot trade in its new debt on our markets or European markets either.”He warned that Washington was prepared to go further if Russia escalated its hostilities. In recognising the two breakaway provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent, Biden said, Putin had “bizarrely asserted that these regions are no longer part of Ukraine and their sovereign territory”.“To put it simply, Russia just announced that it is carving out a big chunk of Ukraine,” said Biden. “He is setting up a rationale to take more territory by force in my view. He’s setting up a rationale to go much further. This is the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.”While Biden said he was taking measures to ensure the sanctions would not hit a US economy suffering from high inflation, he acknowledged that “defending freedom” would impose costs at home.The sanctions followed similar moves from big US allies in Europe, including Germany’s decision to halt a controversial pipeline project that would create a direct artery for Russian natural gas.In a sign of the dwindling hopes for diplomacy, Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, cancelled a meeting later this week with Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, the last scheduled contact between Moscow and a big western country.The Pentagon said the US would redeploy some Europe-based troops and fighter jets to the Baltic states and Nato’s eastern flank, emphasising the move was for defensive purposes.Biden, ominously, noted that the Russian military was readying blood supplies for its troops. “You don’t need blood unless you plan on starting a war,” he said.Scott Morrison, Australia’s prime minister, said on Wednesday that Russia would probably launch a full-scale invasion within 24 hours.Biden’s remarks capped a frantic day of activity as Moscow pushed ahead with the groundwork for a Ukraine invasion while western governments countered with sanctions and appeals for diplomacy.In a move that appeared to take the two countries closer to full-blown conflict, Putin endorsed the claims of Russia-backed separatists to the entire Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. At present, the rebels control only about a third of what is a vital industrial region. Russia’s upper house of parliament unanimously approved a “peacekeeping” mission to the Donbas.Hours earlier, Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, halted certification of Nord Stream 2, scuppering a pipeline project that would deliver Russian natural gas directly to Germany.That prompted a warning from Dmitry Medvedev, the former Russian president, that Europeans would suffer higher energy prices. “Welcome to the brave new world where Europeans are very soon going to pay €2,000 for 1,000 cubic metres of natural gas!” he said in a tweet.Daleep Singh, US deputy national security adviser, said the US was working with energy producers to provide global energy markets with “spare capacity” in the event of a disruption.The EU announced a batch of sanctions targeting 351 members of the Russian parliament and 27 individuals and entities it said were responsible for undermining Ukraine’s sovereignty.The bloc also intends to take measures against VEB and Promsvyazbank, as well as Russia’s sovereign debt and its central bank, according to people familiar with the plans.US officials said the measures against VEB and Promsvyazbank would freeze their assets in the US, prohibit US individuals and businesses from doing any transactions with them, shut them out of the global financial system and foreclose their access to the dollar.Among the Russian individuals hit with sanctions by Washington are Denis Aleksandrovich Bortnikov, the son of Federal Security Service director Aleksandr Vasilievich Bortnikov; Petr Fradkov, the chair and chief executive of Promsvyazbank; and Vladimir Kiriyenko, a Russian business executive and the son of a senior Putin official.A senior US official said the speed at which Washington and its allies had responded was “historic” and dismissed suggestions that it had not hit back more forcefully. Russia’s largest state-run banks, which play crucial roles in financing its energy sector, were spared.“If this invasion proceeds, we are ready to press a button to take further action on the very largest Russian financial institutions, including Sberbank and VTB, which collectively hold almost $750bn in assets,” the official said.Some experts have urged Biden to cut Russia off from Swift, the international payments network. The US official said there were other measures that would have a comparable impact without harmful “spillover costs”.But the official said Biden was keeping the Swift option on the table, along with export controls to make it harder for Russia to obtain critical technologies, such as semiconductors.VEB was founded by Vladimir Lenin and formerly chaired by Putin when he served as prime minister from 2008 to 2012. It is essentially a special-purpose vehicle for the Kremlin to support priority projects regardless of their financial prospects.Though it styles itself after development institutions like the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, it does not have a banking licence, central bank regulation or an independent board, and cannot take deposits.The bank was placed under US and EU sanctions in 2014 that limited its ability to repay $18bn in outstanding foreign debt.VEB said in a statement that “despite increased pressure” it “will continue to improve its financial stability and operational efficiency, properly fulfil its obligations, and use all available means to protect its rights and legitimate interests”.Promsvyazbank, formerly a privately owned top 10 lender by assets, was nationalised in 2017 by the central bank, which then made it a special-purpose vehicle to finance defence contractors that were already under US sanctions.While the door for US-Russia diplomacy appears to have closed, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukrainian foreign minister, said his country would “utilise every tool of diplomacy to deter Russia” and prevent escalation. “If that fails, plan B is to fight for every inch of our land, and every city and every village,” he added.Additional reporting by Eleni Varvitsioti in BrusselsLetter in response to this article:The Swiss currency should also be off-limits to Putin / From John Turner, Dublin, Ireland
234  As world leaders tried to face down Vladimir Putin, UK prime minister Boris Johnson warned the time had come “to bring in some tough sanctions against the Russian regime”.The “first tranche” of measures he unveiled on Tuesday targeted five small banks and three oligarchs, but were quickly criticised by British lawmakers as underwhelming.Johnson insisted he had weapons in reserve including “stopping Russian companies raising money on London markets or stopping them even trading in pounds and dollars”. Recent trends, however, suggest such threats carry less weight than they used to.London has been the go-to market for Russian companies to raise money outside Moscow for the past two decades: Thirty-nine Russian companies have listed in London and raised $44bn since 2005, according to data from FactSet.But Russia’s reliance on London capital markets has approached its lowest point. Since 2014 — and following the peak of the commodities boom — only three companies have listed in the UK: gold miner Polyus, metals and energy group En+ and discount retailer Fix Price.UK sanctions put in place as part of an international response to the annexation of Crimea in 2014 also put a brake on Russian activity.Forty-four equity and debt capital markets deals, raising $26bn, were executed in London between 2010 and 2014, according to Dealogic. In the seven years since, there have been 43, but they raised only $8bn and there have been none this year, it found.Although down sharply from their peak, 24 Russian companies are still listed in London with a combined value of about $515bn. Most, including En+ and Polyus are traded as global depositary receipts — which represent shares in overseas companies while the issuer holds the underlying shares in a company’s home market — on the London Stock Exchange’s International Order Book. Russia accounts for the highest number of companies in the IOB.Stocks such as Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank, and energy groups including Gazprom and Lukoil last month traded more than $1bn of deals, higher than many FTSE 100 companies.As tensions have risen, turnover on Russian stocks rose 66 per cent last month, compared with the same month in 2021 and the $7bn of deals comprised three-quarters of all trades.The UK does have options to go further. Toughened regulations in 2018 gave the government greater powers to unilaterally act on any area of the British financial system, including the payments networks and securities depository, where hard currency such as dollars and euros are held to settle deals. Most are aimed at ensuring the “gatekeepers” such as bankers and brokers cannot transact business with targeted entities and individuals.The House of Commons foreign affairs committee in 2019 urged the government to “close the “laundromat” that would end the flow of so-called dirty money being laundered through London.Earlier this month, the UK extended its powers to target companies and institutions “carrying on business in a sector of strategic significance to the government of Russia”, and its wide-ranging list included energy, mining, defence, IT, financial services and chemicals.“The Russian money [in London] we’ve always had access to, to control but there’s not been the political will,” said Ross Denton, senior consultant and head of international trade at Ashurst, the law firm. “That’s a completely different issue from what we’re considering now. What we didn’t have is the ability to say to Russian companies that ‘we will make it difficult to make and send your payments from London’.”Many in the City have turned cautious in recent weeks. Investment banks have been discussing their exposure and how their systems would handle potential market volatility. Fund managers have been moving their risks elsewhere.“My personal position has been very cautious since last December, end of November,” said Giampaolo Isolani, head of emerging market investment solutions at Amundi, the fund manager, which has been decreasing its Russian equity positions in recent weeks. “We are in a lower position than a month ago.”If wide-ranging sanctions are imposed that would prevent UK, US or EU citizens from investing in Russian companies, index compilers such as MSCI International and FTSE Russell can delete from indices the securities under sanctions with a few days’ notice.Abrdn, the fund manager, estimated that more than $20bn could flow out of Russian stocks if the measures were pursued, a large amount in isolation but not when compared with the more than $7tn benchmarked against the MSCI EM index alone.Abrdn said its Russian equities positions were evenly split between London, New York and the local market in Moscow. “If you went back a decade, we would have had a lot more in depositary receipts because the local market didn’t offer as much,” said William Scholes, investment director of EM equities at Abrdn.The UK may need to balance its desire for broad and tougher sanctions against hurting ordinary investors, while also trying to show that its capital markets are open to business from around the world.Nick Bayley, managing director at Kroll and a former regulator, said: “Many of these companies aren’t vehicles of the Russian state. Once you’ve been on the markets for a while it becomes difficult to throw them off. If you’re a big global. investor the chances are you’ll want exposure to former Soviet companies.”
235  The food and drink industry is demanding “urgent action” from the government to tackle a severe shortages of vets to process UK food exports after Brexit.Industry groups warned that a sharp decline in EU vets registering to work in the UK since Brexit, coupled with an immense increase in paperwork for exporters, was creating an “unsustainable” staffing squeeze.Food producers estimate that Brexit-related bureaucracy, which has seen the number of official export forms to be filled increase 12-fold since January 2021, is costing the industry £60mn a year.Qualified vets are required to sign off the highly detailed export health certificates, or EHCs, needed to send food to the EU after Brexit, putting huge pressure on the UK’s network of vets, according to the British Veterinary Association.The number of EHCs increased from 29,000 in 2020 to more than 288,000 in 2021, according to official government figures, requiring the equivalent of 580,000 hours of work for vets.James Russell, senior vice-president at the BVA, said the nosedive in EU veterinary registrants since Brexit, coupled with soaring demand for veterinary certification, was creating “a storm of shortages” in the profession.He added that shifting vets from farm work to export certification work was just “robbing Peter to pay Paul”.“The potential consequences are worrying. If we can’t find long-term solutions to veterinary workforce shortages we will see impacts on animal welfare, public health, and international trade,” he warned.Before Brexit, EU vets working in the UK were a critical part of the certifying workforce, according to the BVA. However, since new immigration controls came into force in January 2021, the numbers applying to work in Britain fell from 1,132 in 2019 to just 364 last year, according to data from the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.Food industry groups estimate that absorbing the costs of the new sanitary and phytosanitary measures — so called SPS checks — would require an additional £3bn of sales in the first year of Brexit.The Food and Drink Federation, the industry lobby group, calculated that food sales to the EU fell by £2.4bn, or 23.7 per cent, in the first three quarters of 2021 as a result of Brexit red tape and Covid-19.Karin Goodburn, director of the Chilled Food Association, said the figures were actually an underestimate of the total cost to the food industry as they excluded the wider costs of new bureaucracy for agrifood products.Post-Brexit rules requiring detailed documentation of source produce in composite products, such as ready meals or processed snacks, were further straining the system, and many food companies had ceased trading with the EU as a result, she said.“Without urgent action the situation is only set to deteriorate and there are no quick fixes. As an example, it takes more than five years to train the vets we need to certify the EHCs,” Goodburn added.The SPS Certification Working Group, a cross-industry body that includes 26 food producer groups, from millers to petfood producers and shellfish farmers, is demanding that the government do more to ease the short-term recruitment of vets and speed up the process of digitisation of certificates.The group, which is chaired by Goodburn, is asking the government to seek a formal SPS agreement with Brussels to reduce checks — something the government has consistently ruled out on the grounds that it requires too much alignment with EU law.The British Meat Processors Association said the BVA’s report underlined that current export certification arrangements were “unsustainable”. “The entire British food industry needs a solution which removes the need for these processes and that requires a comprehensive veterinary agreement with the EU based largely on some form of alignment. Not only will this cut costs but it will put veterinary resource back where it is needed,” the BMPA added.Defra, the agriculture department, said it was taking steps to address the issue, including more funding, adding vets to the Home Office’s list of shortage occupations and tripling the number of official veterinarians qualified to sign EHCs.The department said it was also in discussion with the European Commission and would welcome any flexibility that could be offered by EU border control points in handling SPS issues.“We continue to work closely with the meat-processing and veterinary industries to ease any pressures on the market,” the department added.
236  As Vladimir Putin announced that his decision to recognise two Moscow-backed separatist states in the Donbas extended to large swaths of Ukraine-controlled territory, the Russian president made it clear his options were not at an end.“Predicting any kind of specific outline for possible actions is totally impossible. It depends on the concrete situation that takes place on the ground,” Putin said on Tuesday.The decision to send Russian troops on a “peacekeeping” operation into the Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics essentially buries the Minsk agreements to try to end the conflict, which has killed more than 14,000 people since 2014.But Putin, who has massed up to 190,000 troops on Ukraine’s border, has previously hinted he is contemplating “all kinds” of further options — outlined here — that western countries warn could end in a full-scale assault on Kyiv.During an extraordinary televised session of his security council on Monday, Putin grilled his top officials for their stance on recognising the separatists.The prospect, and implied likelihood of war with Ukraine, made even some of his most hawkish advisers visibly uncomfortable. Nikolai Patrushev, security council secretary, suggested that Putin delayed recognition for “two or three days” and used the threat as leverage to force Ukraine to “stop all this bloodshed”.Though Putin has pressed ahead with recognition, he could be calculating that the spectre of future conflict is enough to secure concessions from the US and Nato.Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, was set to meet his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov but cancelled the talks. The Kremlin said French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Olaf Scholz had expressed an interest in further discussions during a call with Putin.A settlement based on the current state of play would go further than the aftermath of Russia’s 2008 war in Georgia, when it sent troops to protect the separatist enclaves of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.Putin demanded Kyiv “demilitarise,” recognise Russia’s 2014 annexation of the Crimean peninsula, give up its ambitions to join Nato and pledge neutrality, and negotiate the disputed borders in the Donbas with the separatists.Kyiv sees all those requirements as unacceptable and has refused to negotiate with the separatists throughout the conflict on the grounds they are Russian proxies.If a drawn-out negotiation process begins, however, recognising the separatists and ripping up the Minsk agreements may satisfy Putin’s goals for now, according to a former senior Kremlin official.“It’s better to have a horrific end than an endless horror,” the official said. “A chicken pecks at one grain at a time, not all at once.”Luhansk and Donetsk, the two Ukrainian provinces of the eastern Donbas region, are only about one-third controlled by the separatists now recognised by Russia. But separatist officials in Luhansk demanded on Tuesday that Ukraine remove its troops from the Kyiv-controlled parts of the province and threatened they would “take measures to restore the territorial integrity of the republic” if ignored.Vladimir Kolokoltsev, Russia’s interior minister, raised the prospect of recognising the separatists’ “historical borders” in 2014 which encompassed the entire Donbas before they were “occupied by the Ukrainian armed forces”, and Putin later said Moscow recognised separatists’ claim to the entire Donbas region.If, as is likely, the Donbas border dispute cannot be solved by negotiations, Russia’s overwhelming firepower could quickly beat back Ukraine’s army and seize control of the territory, analysts say.As lawmakers prepared to ratify recognition yesterday, they watched a video of a December speech by far-right firebrand Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who predicted Putin’s moves almost to the hour — and hinted how far he could go.“At 4am on 22 Feb you’ll feel [our new policy],” Zhirinovsky said. “I’d like 2022 to be peaceful. It won’t be peaceful. It will be a year when Russia finally becomes great once again, and everyone has to shut up and respect our country.”Though Russia’s forces have been present there throughout the conflict and turned the tide during its active phases in 2014 and 2015, the Kremlin denied it was a party to the conflict despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Even as those claims became increasingly less credible, the obfuscation allowed Russia to paint the war as an “inter-Ukrainian event” and mask casualties among its forces.Recognising the separatists changes that. The treaties between Moscow and the separatists, signed in a ceremony involving Putin on Monday night, will allow Russia to set up military bases in separatist territory and guard its borders.An official troop presence raises the prospect for Russia to claim its forces have come under fire from Ukrainian attack. Moscow’s security services and state TV have backed up evidence-free claims by the separatists that Ukraine has intensified artillery fire and “terrorist attacks”.On Monday, Russia claimed it had exchanged fire with Ukrainian forces for the first time in the eight-year conflict.Putin said that Russia’s troops would not necessarily go in to the Donbas “right now” but warned that Moscow would “fulfil the obligations it has undertaken if necessary.”Further clashes — a prospect the US has warned of as “phoney allegations” — would potentially give Putin a pretext to retake the entire Donbas or launch a larger operation against Ukraine.“There’s no reason for Moscow to just go into the [separatist territories]. It only makes sense if they go further,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of political consultancy R. Politik. “In Putin’s logic he needs to take a significant part of Ukraine.”“I can’t imagine how he’d justify an assault on Kyiv, but I don’t see any alternative,” she added. “The goal is to end Ukraine’s existence in its current form. No Ukraine, no problem.”
237  If Vladimir Putin thought his invasion by decree would slip under western countries’ threshold for response and sow disarray among governments, swift agreement on initial sanctions against Moscow proved him wrong.Within hours of Russian troops being given orders to go into eastern Ukraine on Tuesday, Germany’s decision to halt approval of Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, EU agreement on sanctions targeting hundreds of Russian parliamentarians and moves by the US and UK against oligarchs and banks underscored the west’s pledge to respond to Russian aggression.That first wave of targeted but less economically significant measures was in response to the Russian president’s decision to recognise and deploy soldiers in separatist-held areas of Donetsk and Luhansk.Western officials say they are holding back the bulk of a long-threatened “crippling” sanctions package for what they believe to be an inevitable attack on the rest of Ukraine in the coming days.After President Joe Biden announced sanctions on Russia, a US official said Washington was keeping other measures in reserve, such as targeting large Russian banks including Sberbank and VTB and imposing export controls. The Biden administration was also keeping alive the option to cut Russia off from Swift, the international financial payments network, the official added.“This was the beginning of an invasion, and this is the beginning of our response,” the US official said. “If Putin escalates further, we will escalate further using both financial sanctions and export controls.”The west has previously punished Russia with sanctions, including after its 2014 annexation of Crimea when big companies and close Putin allies were hit. At the time, the administration of Barack Obama expressed hope that such measures would impose costs that would eventually persuade Moscow to change its behaviour. That did not happen.Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, on Tuesday said the new sanctions went “well beyond” those enacted in the past as he challenged criticism that Washington had underestimated Putin.A senior state department official acknowledged there were some limitations, saying any sanctions imposed on Russia should not disrupt global oil and natural gas flows.“There are more sanctions we can impose.but even when we do [impose] those, the base characteristic of trying to impose them on the Russian economy and not on energy markets will be a top priority for us,” the official said.The US language marked a shift from Monday when officials steered clear of using the word “invasion” in response to the military orders from Putin.“Putin lost in terms of what he wanted to achieve, what he was betting on,” Ingrida Simonyte, prime minister of Lithuania, told the Financial Times. “Today we see incredible unity not only within western democracies.but also with Ukraine.”Simonyte said not all the options should be unleashed at this point, but pointed out that “a clear message that this is just the beginning has been sent to Putin”.Western intelligence officials told the FT that there was near certainty that Russia would in the coming days begin an attack on areas of Ukraine not held by the Kremlin-backed separatists, and likely strike Kyiv and crucial military sites.Nato has moved from a state of “preparedness” to “defensiveness”, one official said, adding: “It is clear that what has happened now is definitely not the final act.”Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, described the EU’s measures, which also targeted Russian banks, as “a first package of sanctions”.“The EU has prepared and stands ready to adopt additional measures at a later stage if needed in the light of further developments,” she warned.Tougher measures that the EU and US have drawn up but not yet deployed include targeting bigger and more systemic Russian lenders, restricting Russian banks from converting roubles into dollars and blocking high-technology exports in certain industrial sectors that are critical for the country’s economy.“Washington and Brussels.want to send a tough message in response to Russia’s actions to date, but also don’t want to play all their cards right away,” said Olga Oliker, programme director for Europe and Central Asia at International Crisis Group. “But in a rapidly changing situation, with facts on the ground difficult to ascertain, they will have to make tough calls.”Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a Russia expert and former US intelligence official, said the White House was adopting a “start high and stay high” approach to sanctions that would allow it to retain leverage to impose more measures if Putin launches a more intense invasion with warplanes and tanks attacking Ukraine.While the first sanctions may not be the full package, she said Putin was likely to have been surprised at the German decision on Nord Stream 2 and the unity among allies. “They have been more united and cohesive than he had expected,” said Kendall-Taylor, who is now at the Center for a New American Security.Angela Stent, a Russia expert at the Brookings Institution and former senior intelligence official, said the Biden administration may be holding off on the full package of sanctions partly to leave the door open for diplomacy.“Maybe they are holding out hope that they can walk Putin back from this,” said Stent, although she said she thought the prospects of that were poor.Ahead of Putin’s decision, some EU members had disagreed over whether it was preferable to adopt a single powerful sanctions package or a more gradual approach.But once it became clear that Putin was preparing to recognise the breakaway territories, officials opted for a graduated approach, preparing an initial, relatively targeted response that was presented by the commission and the EU diplomatic service on Tuesday morning.This, EU officials said, meant that the bloc would still have scope to respond with more restrictive measures directly targeting the Russian economy and business sector if Putin increases his assault on Ukraine.“Some would like to act with everything we have now, but they understand that we have to be able to increase if need be,” said one EU official. “We still have quite a big package in reserve.”A G7 meeting on Thursday would provide an additional opportunity to gauge the right response, the official said, saying “it will be discussed if we need to scale up the intensity”.Additional reporting by Derek Brower in New York
238  US stocks fell, with the S&P 500 index dropping into a correction, while oil prices neared $100 a barrel on Tuesday after Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered troops into eastern Ukraine.The international crude oil benchmark Brent rose as high as $99.50 a barrel, the highest price since 2014, as traders weighed the possibility of disrupted supply from Russia. It later trimmed its gains to settle at $96.84 a barrel, up 3.5 per cent from the previous day.The moves came after Putin directed his military to enter Ukraine’s rebel-held Donetsk and Luhansk regions, prompting Germany to halt the approval of the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline and western powers to announce new sanctions against Moscow.Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 ended the day down 1 per cent to its lowest closing level since late 2021, led lower by energy and consumer discretionary stocks. The decline on Tuesday brought the index into a correction, or 10 per cent below its recent peak in January.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1.2 per cent. The Stoxx Europe 600 share gauge slipped as much as 1.9 per cent, before recovering to close 0.1 per cent higher.Volatility indices showed traders expected equity markets to continue to swing on headlines concerning Ukraine, with the Vix gauge of expected volatility on the S&P 500 trading at 28.9.European natural gas contracts rose by about a tenth to €79.50 per megawatt hour, ahead of the US and western allies launching a package of sanctions against Moscow later in the day.Sanctions on Russian sovereign bonds will prohibit purchases of debt issued after March 1. Russian sovereign bonds issued in euros showed little reaction to the news, having already sold off earlier in the day.European government bonds came under selling pressure on the prospect of higher gas prices in the bloc exacerbating record-high inflation levels.“One of the very few definitive things we can see from this crisis is that energy prices are going higher,” said Bastien Drut, chief thematic macro strategist at CPR Asset Management. “Even if there is no further escalation in Ukraine, the main consequence is still going to be higher inflation.”The FTSE All-World index of global shares has lost 3.3 per cent this month, taking its year-to-date loss to 8 per cent, as geopolitical tensions added to market jitters caused by the US and European central banks tightening monetary policy.“An energy price shock amidst an aggressive central bank pivot focused on inflation could further dampen investor sentiment and [the] growth outlook,” strategists at JPMorgan wrote in a note to clients.The US Federal Reserve is expected to embark on a string of interest rate rises from next month, after pinning borrowing costs close to zero two years ago. The European Central Bank, meanwhile, is set to phase out emergency government debt purchases this year.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was flat on the day at 1.93 per cent.The yield on Germany’s 10-year Bund rose 0.04 percentage points to 0.24 per cent as the price of the benchmark European debt instrument fell. The UK’s 10-year gilt yield rose 0.06 percentage points to 1.47 per cent.Russian assets were volatile on Tuesday. The rouble hit its weakest level against the dollar in more than 15 months early in the session, before paring losses to trade 0.7 per cent higher.In Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 2.7 per cent and Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 share index closed 1.7 per cent lower.
239  Vladimir Putin has endorsed the claims of Russian-backed separatists to the entire Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, taking the countries closer to full-blown conflict despite tougher than expected western sanctions.Minutes after Russia’s upper house of parliament unanimously approved a “peacekeeping” mission to the Donbas, Putin said “the best solution” to the crisis would be for Ukraine to “demilitarise”, abandon its goal of joining Nato and pledge neutrality.The move came hours after Germany’s Chancellor Olaf Scholz halted the approval of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which connects Russia directly with Germany, scuppering Europe’s most controversial energy project.Moscow warned European consumers would end up paying the price for the halting of Nord Stream 2. “Welcome to the brave new world where Europeans are very soon going to pay €2,000 for 1,000 cubic metres of natural gas!” tweeted Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chair of Russia’s security council and a former president.By recognising the two breakaway provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk, Russia had committed a “grave breach of international law”, Scholz said. The two Moscow-backed separatist states only control about a third of the Donbas, an important industrial region, but claim “historical borders” that Ukraine won back from them after the conflict broke out in 2014.Putin’s decision to send in military support while endorsing the territorial ambitions of the rebel enclaves has heightened western fears of a broader Moscow offensive in coming days.Nato believes Putin’s move is part of a plan for a “full-scale attack” on the country. “Every indication is that Russia is continuing to plan for a full-scale attack on Ukraine,” alliance secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday. “Moscow has now moved from covert attempts to destabilise Ukraine, to overt military action.”Putin said Russian forces would not necessarily enter the Donbas “right now” and said he hoped the border dispute could be resolved through negotiations, but warned of unspecified consequences if his demands were ignored.The sanctions packages under preparation by the US, UK, EU and Japan were expected to fall short of the toughest economic curbs available, which diplomats said would be triggered if Russia were to drive deeper into Ukraine.Volodymyr Zelensky, president of Ukraine, urged the west “not to wait” with sanctions until Russia escalated its military campaign, saying “the first steps of this aggression have already been taken”.At the outset of Russia’s massive troop build-up on the Ukrainian border, Scholz angered critics of Nord Stream 2 by saying it was “purely a commercial project” and appearing to suggest it would not be included in any sanctions package. But his public comments on the pipeline have hardened in recent weeks.Nord Stream 2 AG, the operator of the pipeline, said it “took note” of Scholz’s comments but could not comment until it had “appropriate information from the authorities”. Gazprom, which owns the pipeline and was due to supply the gas that will flow through it, declined to comment.Global stocks fell on Tuesday and oil prices rallied, with Brent crude rising more than 3 per cent to close in on $100 per barrel, topping a seven-year high. Russian markets remained volatile for the second day in a row. The benchmark Moex index fell as much as 9 per cent before ending the day up 1.6 per cent.In the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced sanctions on five Russian banks and three “high net worth” individuals after Putin ordered troops into eastern Ukraine. In what he described as the “first tranche” of sanctions, Johnson said the people — Gennady Timchenko, Boris Rotenberg and Igor Rotenberg — will have their assets frozen and be banned from entering the UK.“We hold further sanctions at readiness to be deployed,” Johnson said.Bill Browder, a financier and prominent advocate of tougher sanctions on Russia, called the UK measures “pretty tepid”. The three “have been on the US sanctions list since 2018”, Browder said on Twitter.The EU has unanimously approved a package of sanctions against Russia and its surrogates in Ukraine, targeting 351 members of the Russian parliament and 27 individuals and entities blamed for undermining Ukraine’s sovereignty.“This package of sanctions has been approved by unanimity,” said the EU’s top diplomat Josep Borrell after a meeting of foreign ministers in Paris. “It will hurt Russia and it will hurt a lot.”He added the EU was targeting “the ability of the Russian state and government to access our capital markets and financial services”, including the raising of sovereign debt, but gave no further details.On Monday night, the Biden administration issued an executive order banning new investment, trade and financing by US people and entities in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. A White House official said further sanctions against Russia would be announced on Tuesday: “We are co-ordinating with allies and partners on that announcement.”Additional reporting from Henry Foy, Sam Fleming and Eleni Varvitsioti in Brussels, Laura Hughes in London, Victor Mallet in Paris, Leila Abboud in Vendome and Demetri Sevastopulo in Washington
240  Uefa, European football’s governing body, is under mounting pressure over its ties to Russian state energy company Gazprom after Vladimir Putin’s decision to order troops into Ukraine.The crisis has forced Uefa to consider moving this season’s Champions League final from St Petersburg, while raising deeper questions about Gazprom’s longstanding sponsorship of European football.UK prime minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday told the House of Commons there was “no chance of holding football tournaments in a Russia that invades sovereign countries”.Chris Bryant, Labour MP who sits on the Commons foreign affairs select committee, told the FT that Uefa should cut ties with Gazprom.Uefa is discussing its options for moving the final, set to take place at the Gazprom Arena in May, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The stadium hosted matches for the 2018 Fifa World Cup and Uefa’s Euro 2020 tournament.“Uefa is constantly and closely monitoring the situation and any decision would be made in due course if necessary,” the governing body said. “Uefa has no further comments to make at present.”When asked whether it was committed to its wider partnership with Gazprom, Uefa said only that it would “continue to closely monitor the situation”.Gazprom renewed its Champions League sponsorship in May last year, when it also agreed to back the next two European championships. At the time, Uefa described Gazprom as one of its “most trusted partners” and “a leader in its field”.Alexander Dyukov, chief executive of Gazprom Neft, is a member of Uefa’s executive committee.SportBusiness Sponsorship, the data and research group, has estimated that Gazprom’s 2018-21 deal was worth roughly €40mn a season to Uefa. The football governing body and Gazprom have been partners since 2012.Sports marketing expert Tim Crow said that terminating such a contract was generally the result of a company not being able to pay its bills or doing “something that would bring what it’s sponsoring into disrepute”.“You’d have to show cause to tear up this sponsorship contract,” said Crow. “That would be a big call.”In Germany, FC Schalke 04 is coming under pressure to end Gazprom’s sponsorship of the club, with prominent fan and marketing expert Raphael Brinkert saying that the deal “was, and is, and remains a mistake”.The club said it was watching the “latest developments in eastern Europe with great concern” but added that Gazprom Germania had been a “reliable partner” for 15 years and officials were “in constant dialogue with our main sponsor”.The club said it “stands for peace and peaceful coexistence” with its members “committed to non-violence”. The club said it had “expressed this attitude” in its conversations with the Gazprom unit.Simon Chadwick, professor of Eurasian sport at Emlyon Business School in Paris, said European football had been “sleepwalking into this situation for the best part of 15 years”.He said the Uefa-Gazprom tie-up was a sponsorship deal like no other, adding: “Sponsors come with baggage and clearly in the case of Gazprom, we can now see what that baggage is.”
241  Europe has been thrust into its most dangerous security crisis since the second world war. President Vladimir Putin’s decision to recognise Ukraine’s breakaway eastern regions and order in Russian troops as “peacekeepers” is more than just an unprovoked invasion. Along with his televised comments on Monday night, it signals a denial of Ukraine’s right to exist. It strikes at the heart of the post-Cold war settlement that allows all European states to choose their own destinies. It steps up Moscow’s efforts to redraw the continent’s security architecture in its favour, so marking an assault on the rules-based international system. The US and European allies have resolved not to use force to defend Ukraine against a nuclear-armed Russia. But they should not hesitate now in rolling out the punitive economic sanctions they have threatened.Despite all the denials from Putin downwards of any intention to invade, events have unfolded since last week according to an obviously pre-planned script: from the intensification of shelling along the contact line between the “people’s republics” of Donetsk and Luhansk and the rest of Ukraine, to a comically choreographed Russian security council meeting urging Putin to recognise their independence.Putin’s TV announcement that he would do so repudiates the Minsk agreement that has been the basis of efforts to resolve the conflict around the two entities since 2014. It violates international law, and Ukraine’s territorial integrity. Moscow’s latest steps stop short, so far, of the all-out assault that western capitals have feared. Yet the rest of the world should be under no illusion: while Russia fomented the conflict around the separatist regions and has had a presence there for eight years, moving troops across the Russian-Ukrainian border now constitutes a new invasion.It is unclear how much further the Kremlin may go. While Putin said late on Tuesday Russian troops would not necessarily go in “right now”, he said Moscow recognised the breakaway entities’ claim to the entire broader Ukrainian regions in which they are located. That could presage Russian troops crossing into Ukrainian-held territory — including the Azov Sea coast and port of Mariupol — prompting a direct confrontation with Kyiv’s forces.Putin might conceivably stop here. He would have taken a further bite out of Ukraine’s territory, after annexing Crimea in 2014, and made Ukraine more indigestible to Nato. He could use his strengthened position to demand that Kyiv drops its ambitions to join the North Atlantic alliance, or pledges neutrality, as he is now openly suggesting. He might go further along the coast to establish a land bridge from Russia to Crimea — or as far as Odesa in the west. Moscow would then have severely compromised Ukrainian statehood.Western intelligence agencies suggest that with up to 190,000 troops around Ukraine, Russia could seize the capital, Kyiv. That number still looks wholly inadequate to hold even Ukraine’s eastern portion beyond the Dnieper river in the face of determined local resistance — making this an extraordinarily risky venture. The Russian leader has so far been shrewd and calculating. Yet it is possible that, as some western officials say, Putin no longer weighs risks as he once did. In the security council meeting, where he humiliated key advisers, and his rambling TV address, he seemed a different figure: twisted with anger, intent on dragging his inner circle, and Russia’s people, down his perilous chosen path.The west should respond with tough measures, within the constraints it has set by ruling out direct military confrontation over Ukraine. The US, UK and EU are right to have responded with some immediate sanctions. It is encouraging that a previously wavering Germany has suspended certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Steps from the UK remain disappointingly limited. Western allies should now proceed with the full package of measures they have discussed — on Russian debt, on banks and energy companies raising western financing, on exports of sensitive technologies, and on Putin’s inner circle and oligarchs close to him.Holding back now, in the hope of deterring more severe aggression by a Russian leader who seems intent on his course, is misguided. The west risks making its response look weak, sending Putin the wrong message.Imposing the kind of sanctions that have been discussed entails undoubted dangers. Kremlin officials and mouthpieces have threatened retaliation — from cyber attacks and energy disruptions to undisclosed measures. The shortage of natural gas in storage leaves Europe especially vulnerable. To convince the Kremlin that they are prepared to stand up for the values they espouse, however, western allies need to be prepared to demonstrate that they will suffer economic pain. By targeting companies and individuals not directly involved in Russia’s military effort they will face accusations that they are harming their own reputation for rule of law. But they are confronting a revisionist foe which has shown itself ready to trample on international rules and treaties.The Nato alliance should also take steps to reassure and strengthen its eastern flanks — from the Baltic states and Poland through to Romania and the Black Sea. Its members are right, for example, to conduct freedom of navigation exercises in the Baltic Sea — but must take care not to engage in anything Russia might seize on as an alleged provocation. An emboldened Putin should be left in no doubt that any encroachment into Nato territory will trigger alliance members’ mutual security guarantees.The experience of Moscow’s aggression towards Ukraine in 2014 suggested Russia’s president will push as far as he can until he meets resistance, including opposition at home. In confronting a Putin whose goals appear even more reckless and threatening than eight years ago, the west will have to go much further to convince him of its collective resolve.
242  At a meeting of Ukraine’s security council in the early hours of Tuesday, President Volodymyr Zelensky responded with calm defiance to Russia’s recognition of two breakaway republics in eastern Ukraine and its decision to send in troops.“We are not afraid of anything or anyone,” Zelensky said. “We owe nothing to anyone and we will not give anything to anyone.”Yet Kyiv has few ways to respond beyond bolstering its defences and spurring its population to prepare for conflict, at a time when Ukrainians are looking to their leader to strike a more assertive stance.Any military response to Russia’s latest aggression risks pitching Ukraine into a full-blown war. Ukrainian leaders have repeatedly vowed to exercise restraint in the face of Russian provocations to avoid falling into the trap of providing a pretext for the Kremlin to engage the up to 190,000 troops it has massed around Ukraine.The danger has been heightened by Russia’s deployment of “peacekeepers” to the breakaway regions, which would bring them face to face with Ukrainian troops along the militarised “line of contact” that has divided separatist and Ukrainian forces since the conflict began in 2014.Zelensky struck a cool tone on Tuesday, saying “we do not believe there will be an intense war against Ukraine [or] that Russia will escalate further”. But he also spoke of the need to prepare, including the option to introduce martial law.Tensions ratcheted up further later on Tuesday when Russian president Vladimir Putin said Moscow would recognise the separatists’ claim to the entire Donbas region in eastern Ukraine — far beyond the contact line.Ukrainians steeled themselves for conflict, canvassing for donations for military charities online and discussing just how far into Ukraine Moscow planned to deploy its troops.Zelensky would focus on defence, asserting a “no retreat” policy on the contact line, said Mykhailo Gonchar, president of Ukraine’s Centre for Global Studies Strategy XXI. This will be harder to maintain if Putin decides to use force to expand the separatist states to incorporate the wider Donbas region.Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraine’s defence minister, said the focus was on “strengthening defence” while warning of “difficult challenges” and “losses” ahead.“We will have to go through pain, overcome fear and despair,” he said. “But we will definitely win.our strength is in unity and confidence.”Ukrainians have reacted without panic to the latest threats. For many, it did not mark the start of a potential new conflict, but an escalation in a war that has been ongoing since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and supported the eastern separatist rebellion.“This has been going on for eight years,” Gonchar said, adding that he saw unease but no signs of fear among his friends and colleagues.Alongside a focus on its defences, Kyiv has called for western sanctions to act as a deterrent to future Russian aggression.Petro Poroshenko, Ukraine’s president from 2014 to 2019, told the Financial Times that Russia’s action “pushes the world to the brink of a new world war”. He urged the west to “immediately impose sanctions on.Putin and his entourage”, including Russia’s security council, oligarchs and members of both houses of parliament.The US, UK and EU imposed fresh sanctions on Russia on Tuesday in response to its move into the Donbas, and Germany suspended the approval process for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that is meant to transport Russian gas to Europe.But some observers have said these measures, which stop short of the toughest economic curbs available, do not go far enough.“Putin is acting fast. But we do not yet see a quick and comprehensive western reaction,” said Mikhail Podolyak, a close adviser to Zelensky. Stopping Moscow “depends directly on how and when the west will answer to Russia’s actions”, he added.He also called for western economic support for Ukraine. “We are suffering such economic losses every day as if a massive invasion had already begun. What will be the response of the west to this as well? We have no clarity,” Podolyak said in written comments to the FT.The options for Zelensky may also be hemmed in by a public mood that is hardening amid ever more brazen aggression from Russia.“Zelensky proved many times that as president he is committed to peace and negotiations. He never initiated any military assault,” said Alyona Getmanchuk, director of the New Europe Center think-tank in Kyiv.Now there is “growing appetite in society for him to prove that he could be an effective commander-in-chief since belief in diplomacy is fading”, she added. Getmanchuk said she expected increased public pressure on Zelensky to apply martial law in areas bordering Russia and in the east of Ukraine.Another Zelensky adviser said Ukrainians had rallied around their leader in recent days following the Russian escalation and a heartfelt speech by the Ukrainian president at the Munich Security Conference, which struck a chord with its criticism of western appeasement of Moscow.But further aggression from Russia, such as the seizure of the wider Donbas region beyond that held by the separatists, would place huge pressure on Zelensky to hit back.“If the Russians take [the city of] Mariupol, they will be on the Maidan,” the adviser said, referring to the Kyiv square at the centre of the 2014 protests.Concessions to Russia were fast becoming a thing of the past, said Volodymyr Fesenko, director of the Kyiv-based Penta think-tank. “Most Ukrainians would not accept this,” he added.
243  For weeks, German chancellor Olaf Scholz was ridiculed by politicians and journalists around the world for refusing to even name Nord Stream 2, let alone promise to halt it if Russia invaded Ukraine.On Tuesday he surprised even hardened political observers by freezing the approval process for the gas pipeline from Russia to Germany — part of a broad European response to Moscow’s decision to recognise two breakaway regions of Ukraine as independent republics.Scholz’s move won praise from across Europe, and particularly in Ukraine. Its foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba called it the correct step “morally, politically and practically”. He wrote on Twitter: “True leadership means tough decisions in difficult times. Germany’s move proves just that.”NS2’s backers, including successive German governments, always insisted the project was a purely commercial enterprise. But its critics saw it differently — as part of a Kremlin plot to increase Europe’s dependence on Russian energy exports, with Germany cast as its willing accomplice.Halting the project, which is completed but awaiting approval, removes an irritant that burdened Germany’s relations with the US and its east European partners. Former president Donald Trump enraged Berlin by imposing extraterritorial sanctions on companies involved in NS2’s construction, and in recent years opposition to the pipeline has been one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans in Congress could agree on.The pipeline came to symbolise Berlin’s close energy ties to Russia, a relationship it seemed bent on expanding even in the midst of the worst crisis in east-west relations since the cold war.Russia hawks in Germany were delighted at Scholz’s decision but said Berlin should have acted much sooner. “The fact that it could even get this far was a grave mistake,” said Norbert Röttgen, a foreign policy expert with the opposition Christian Democrats. “It’s been clear for a while now that it was finished.”From Russia there was a flash of sardonic humour. “Welcome to the brave new world where Europeans will soon be paying €2,000 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas!” said Dmitry Medvedev, former president and deputy head of Russia’s Security Council.Medvedev’s Twitter message touched a sore point. Germany continues to import vast quantities of Russian oil and gas; Scholz said on Tuesday that gas accounted for a quarter of the country’s energy mix, and more than half of it comes from Russia.Germany’s reliance on gas could even rise. The country decided to shelve nuclear power in the aftermath of the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan and Scholz’s coalition government is committed to phasing out coal-fired power by 2030.Scholz insisted, however, that Germany would wean itself off its addiction to gas. It would be carbon-neutral in 25 years, he said, and would expand solar and wind power capacity “so we can produce steel, cement and chemicals without using fossil fuels”. Germany is also building import terminals for liquefied natural gas so it is less reliant on Russia.NS2’s approval by Germany’s energy regulator had long been seen as a foregone conclusion, especially after the previous government of Angela Merkel concluded that the pipeline, which would double the volume of gas piped directly from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea, would have no negative impact on the security of Germany’s energy supply.That assessment has now changed. Robert Habeck, the Green economy minister, said on Tuesday that the crisis over Ukraine, coupled with the “situation on the gas market over the past few months.virtually forces us to re-evaluate” the project. He had therefore withdrawn the energy security report, and in so doing frozen the certification process. Until a new one is completed, “NS2 can’t be approved”, he added.Habeck made clear it was not just Vladimir Putin’s actions this week that had triggered this change of heart but Russia’s behaviour over several months.Some energy experts have suggested that in the run-up to Europe’s winter heating season, Gazprom deliberately held back supplies to the spot market and depleted its gas storage facilities in Europe while gas prices and energy demand were rocketing. Gazprom denied any such interference with supplies.“We have to overcome our lopsided dependence on one supplier, one that in the past few weeks and months has proved to be geopolitically unreliable, acting according to its own calculations,” Habeck said.In Moscow, Germany’s NS2 move was viewed as an act of deliberate self-harm. “The German decision is equivalent to shooting yourself in the foot,” said a senior figure in Russian energy circles, comparing it to the nuclear phaseout announced in 2011. “And to be honest, if it [NS2] comes to a complete and utter halt, we should just build a cross-link gas pipeline to China in three to five years and move on.”But in Berlin there was acclaim for the decision. Germany was, said Jana Puglierin, head of the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, “raising the bar for all other EU countries”. The government was “ready to bear potentially high costs”, she added. “For me, this is real leadership at a crucial moment.”Additional reporting by Polina Ivanova and Roman Olearchyk in Kyiv and Max Seddon in Moscow
244  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
245  Pressure is mounting on Spain’s opposition leader to end a damaging internal conflict that threatens both his own position and the election prospects of his centre-right party.Pablo Casado, national head of the People’s party (PP), has been urged to call an extraordinary party congress as he seeks to placate regional leaders and grassroots supporters infuriated by his handling of the crisis.Several members of the PP’s parliamentary group on Tuesday also called for a leadership election to address the “extreme gravity” of the internal strife.The feud centres on Casado, party leader since 2018, and Isabel Díaz Ayuso, the charismatic leader of the Madrid region since 2019 and widely seen as a future PP leader.Casado was forced into an embarrassing climbdown last week after publicly attacking Díaz Ayuso for allegedly using her position to help her brother gain a €55,000 commission from a €1.5mn deal to supply face masks to Madrid’s health services in 2020. Díaz Ayuso denies any wrongdoing and accused Casado of being behind the allegations, which surfaced in the media last week.She also accused the PP leader of trying to “destroy” her by fabricating corruption claims and resorting to espionage in an attempt to uncover compromising information about her.Casado denies any wrongdoing. He agreed to drop his call for the party to investigate the corruption allegations, effectively resolving the issue in Díaz Ayuso’s favour. But his attempt at appeasement has failed to pacify opponents within the PP.A PP congress, the only body with powers to elect a new leader, is not scheduled until July. But Carla Subirana, Europe analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said the party was likely to call one within days in an attempt to restore stability.The bitter dispute comes as the PP faces a growing challenge to its status as opposition leader from Vox, its hard-right rival.Vox has surged in recent polls and is expected to enter a regional government for the first time after making big electoral gains in Castile-León, where the PP has held sway for the past 35 years.“The PP’s crisis has important implications for the future of the Spanish right,” said Antonio Barroso, deputy director of research at Teneo Intelligence. “How far Vox advances in the polls, however, will be contingent on how quickly the PP can find a leader who can unify the party.”The PP’s chances of winning the next general election, due in 2023, “will be slim unless they appoint a new leader”, he added.Pedro Sánchez, Spain’s socialist prime minister, was unlikely to call a snap parliamentary poll to take advantage of the opposition’s weakness, Barroso added.Thousands demonstrated outside the PP’s headquarters in Madrid at the weekend to show support for Díaz Ayuso. A poll published by the El Confidencial newspaper showed 71 per cent of PP supporters would prefer her as Spain’s next prime minister, compared with only 14.5 per cent favouring Casado.Fourteen of the PP’s 17 regional leaders, including its powerful “barons” based in the party’s strongholds, reportedly called on Tuesday for a snap congress and leadership elections. Alberto Núñez Feijóo, the longstanding head of the regional government in Galícia, is seen by many as the strongest contender to succeed Casado.
246  A virus in China had kept markets on edge for a few weeks and was starting to look like it could be serious. Stocks around the world were suffering knocks of around 1 or 2 per cent a day. Fear not, the sage minds of Wall Street said, pointing to previous outbreaks of viruses such as Zika and Ebola, which left no lasting damage to stocks. This newfangled coronavirus would probably follow a similar path and prove to be an opportunity to buy the dip, they said. We all know how deep and dark that “dip” turned out to be.This is not a criticism as such. Hindsight is a wonderful thing. Nonetheless, that period of 2020 should stick in investors’ minds now that market participants have largely decided Russia’s latest display of military force in Ukraine is likely to mimic its annexation of Crimea eight years ago and produce only a modest and well-contained impact on global asset prices. Russia accounts for only around 3 per cent of the global economy, after all — about half as much as California. Hedge funds that wagered Vladimir Putin would pull back from the brink — and the oligarchs with wealth tied up in Russian shares — have certainly suffered. Moscow’s Moex index has dropped almost 9 per cent this week. This is shaping up to be that market’s worst month since 2009 — well beyond the scale of Covid’s impact. More broadly, markets have already absorbed a fair amount of Russian stress. In a note earlier this week, Goldman Sachs estimated that the tensions over Ukraine that had been bubbling up for months are responsible for a little over half of the 9 per cent drop in the S&P 500 benchmark index of US stocks so far this year. The nerves had also pushed some investors into the safety of US government bonds, lopping around one-quarter of a percentage point off 10-year yields, the bank said. Gold — another classic bolt-hole for jittery investors — is also higher in price than it would otherwise have been. The rouble, meanwhile, is around 9 per cent weaker than it would have been without this latest military adventure, considering how far it has fallen compared with a generally upbeat run in similar emerging market currencies.All in all, nasty, especially for Russian markets, but very manageable.“Investors should keep things in perspective and not overreact to headlines,” says Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at Barclays. “Although equities can fall more in the near term, we note that market drawdowns due to past military conflicts did not last very long and were mostly buying opportunities.” The annexation of Crimea generated just a 4 per cent drop in European stocks in a hiccup that lasted eight days, he added.For some seasoned Ukraine watchers, this all underplays the crisis, especially given Russia’s central role in providing oil and gas to continental Europe. “This is going to be a big conflict. There are massive risks to European energy,” says Tim Ash, an emerging markets strategist at BlueBay Asset Management. “Beware of unexpected consequences,” he adds, pointing out that the outbreak of Covid-19 and the shock of rapid exits from subsequent lockdowns proved that even true experts in supply chains and inflation have their limits.The big risk is that through the energy market Putin effectively makes the inflation shock biting into markets much worse and saps economic growth momentum. The US Federal Reserve has already indirectly acknowledged this. Geopolitical “risks”, “tensions” and “turmoil” crop up in the minutes of its January meeting no fewer than four times.Energy is the world’s indispensable business and Energy Source is its newsletter. Every Tuesday and Thursday, direct to your inbox, Energy Source brings you essential news, forward-thinking analysis and insider intelligence. Sign up here.Capital Economics reckons that in the worst-case scenario, oil prices could hit $120 to $140 per barrel, well above current levels of a shade under $100. Europe’s already elevated natural gas prices are also likely to keep climbing, the research house said, potentially adding as much as 2 percentage points to inflation in advanced economies.“In normal times, central banks would tend to look through an energy-led rise in inflation, but given the current high rates of inflation, and corresponding concerns about it feeding higher inflation expectations, it’s possible that this adds to the list of reasons for policymakers to raise interest rates,” wrote Neil Shearing at Capital Economics.The upshot is that, in markets at least, the latest Ukraine crisis is likely to get lost in the noise about inflation. But it is stalking investors nonetheless. And, in contrast to the pandemic crisis of 2020, if the market reaction does get messy, the Fed is unlikely to step in to help. 
247  Russia’s stock market gyrated on Tuesday as traders assessed Vladimir Putin’s decision to send troops into two separatist regions in Ukraine and weighed the impact of retaliatory western sanctions.The Moex index ended the main session 1.6 per cent higher, having fallen more than 9 per cent earlier in the session. The whipsawing moves marked the most volatile two days of trading for Russian equities since Moscow seized control of Crimea in 2014.On Monday, the Moex had fallen as much as 14 per cent — ultimately closing down by more than a tenth. Its initial declines on Tuesday came after Russia ordered forces into the rebel-held Donetsk and Luhansk regions at Ukraine’s Donbas border, sparking international condemnation.Despite a recovery late in Tuesday’s session, Moscow’s main stock benchmark has still collapsed by more than a quarter since October, as investors responded to the escalating crisis and the growing chance of a Russian attack on Ukraine, which could trigger swingeing western sanctions in response.Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, denounced Russia’s move as a “clear attack” on Ukraine’s sovereignty, while European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said Russia’s advance — billed as a “peacekeeping” exercise by Putin — constituted a “blatant violation of international law”.“Markets are waking up to the reality today that this is the biggest threat to European security since world war two,” said Tim Ash, an emerging markets strategist at BlueBay Asset Management. “I think a lot of foreign investors were still long on Russian assets, and it seemed like the locals overwhelmingly didn’t think an invasion was going to happen.”The rouble fell to its lowest level since November 2020 before rebounding to trade about 1.9 per cent higher against the US dollar.In a statement on Tuesday, the Bank of Russia said it was “monitoring the developments in the financial market and is ready to take all necessary measures to maintain financial stability”.The escalation of tensions briefly sent oil prices soaring to a seven-year high, with Brent crude, the international benchmark, rising as much as 4.3 per cent to $99.50 a barrel before trimming its gains. Natural gas prices also rallied, buoyed further by the news that Germany has halted the approval of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.“If this kicked off in terms of a wider war, you’d expect to see natural gas prices in Europe being the greatest threat to the global economy,” said Charlie Robertson, chief economist at Renaissance Capital. “Oil could go up another $10 or $20, but natural gas, because of Europe’s dependence on it, could shoot up higher.”Shares in state-owned energy group Gazprom, which has lost about a quarter of its value since the start of the year, rose 7.6 per cent, while shares in oil and gas group Tatneft advanced by about a tenth. Russian internet group VK also added about 10 per cent, recovering from a 17 per cent slide earlier in the day.Other large Russian groups fared less well, however. Shares in Rosneft, another oil and gas major, fell more than 5 per cent. In a sign of investors’ growing concerns, turnover of stocks listed on the Moex index hit a record high of $7.7bn on Monday, data from Bloomberg showed. About $5bn had traded hands by the evening in Moscow, according to Moscow Exchange.Foreign-listed shares in Russian companies have also come under strong selling pressure. An MSCI index tracking Russian stocks trading in London and New York has shed about a fifth of its value this year.Putin’s recognition of the two Ukrainian regions prompted JPMorgan to downgrade Russia from overweight to neutral — meaning it no longer recommends taking an outsize position in the country relative to the benchmark — on expectations that the US and the EU will impose sanctions in response.The US bank added that “further declines near-term” in the Russian stock market were likely.However, for Robertson, Russian assets are “probably sold off enough now”. He noted that a dollar-denominated MSCI index tracking stocks traded on Moscow’s markets was down almost 40 per cent from its October 2021 peak. “We’ve only seen 45 per cent declines twice in the last 10 years.”Investors continued to sell Russian debt, fearful of sanctions that could bar the trading of the country’s bonds in the secondary market — in effect making it unfeasible to hold them and potentially seeing them kicked out of widely followed indices.The yield on Russia’s dollar bond maturing in 2030 climbed to 6.1 per cent, the highest since 2015 and up from about 2 per cent at the start of the year. Ukrainian bonds also fell sharply. The price of a dollar bond maturing in 2032 was down 7.5 cents to roughly 72 cents on the dollar, a level that indicates investors are concerned about the potential for a default.
248  The writer is a novelist based in Kyiv and author of ‘Death and the Penguin’After Vladimir Putin recognised the separatist republics yesterday and sent in Russian troops, American diplomats who had previously moved from Kyiv to Lvіv, in western Ukraine, decided to start spending their nights in Poland. It’s 90 minutes by car from Lviv to Poland. There are long queues at the border crossings, but I am sure that US diplomats will be allowed to skip the line in both directions. They will need to get a good night’s sleep because right now they have to be super-vigorous, even aggressive.In the course of Ukraine’s eight-year confrontation with Russia, Ukrainians have got used to variations in the way friendly countries support them. “We express deep concern about Russia’s actions.” This well-known phrase has become a symbol of European reaction to Russian policies and speaks volumes about the attitude of political leaders and diplomats towards Ukraine. It has left little doubt in the minds of Ukrainians that it makes no sense to expect more from Europe than “concern”. That same “concern” has also served as a signal to Russia that no serious consequences would result from its actions against Ukraine. While Russia was building the Nordstream 2 gas pipeline to Germany, French Champagne producers were printing new labels for bottles, so as to come in line with a Russian law decreeing that only Russian producers can sell their sparkling wine as “champagne”. Against the backdrop of this weak European response, the diplomatic efforts of the US, Great Britain, Canada and Japan stand out more favourably. These countries have reacted much faster to changes in the border situation. The voices of American politicians and diplomats have sounded louder than others, louder and more resolute, especially now that Ukraine finds itself surrounded by Russian troops from the north, east and south.As soon as the US and Great Britain began to send weapons to Ukraine, the attitude on the ground towards them improved dramatically. Interest in statements from these countries has also grown. At the same time, there has been more criticism of Europe in social networks and online media. Pro-Ukrainian actions and speeches by German diplomats and members of the new government are perceived here with a large degree of scepticism. A symbolic gift from Germany to the Ukrainian army in the form of 5,000 helmets was treated as a joke. Only the belated announcement that the plug has been pulled on Nordstream 2 has caused a lessening in anti-German rhetoric.Now Ukrainians are looking forward to the reaction of world leaders to Russia’s latest move. This will indicate how events in Donbas and Ukraine more generally will develop. If the promised sanctions turn out to be symbolic and not particularly damaging to the interests of the Russian Federation, then this will be a signal to Putin that he can continue military operations and take Ukraine under his control.The danger is obvious to Ukraine’s western neighbours Poland, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, who already feel threatened by the Russian Federation. In the event of a “big war”, aggression will certainly spill out further, beyond the borders of Ukraine. The recently announced mobilisation of the unrecognised Transnistria region poses a threat not only to the southern region of Ukraine, but also to Moldova itself and even to Romania.Sanctions imposed on Russia in support of Ukraine are important for Ukrainians who understand that they bring financial loss to the countries imposing them. But surely the moment of reckoning has arrived? Surely this invasion does warrant the most severe sanctions? Or does the rollout of Russian troops in the Luhansk and Donetsk territories amount to “a minor incursion” of the type mentioned by President Biden back in January — the type of aggression that doesn’t warrant serious sanctions, but rather leaves everyone trying to decide what to do next?Not all embassies have left Ukraine for Poland or Romania. The ambassadors of Poland, Lithuania, South Africa, Brazil, Argentina and Kuwait among others are still in Kyiv, despite the threat of an attack on the capital. I think that as long as the embassies remain here, there will be no attack. The diplomatic presence can play a very important stabilising role in the current situation. The return of the embassies that left Kyiv yesterday would be a further sign of stabilisation and a signal that, this time, Ukraine can expect more decisive actions rather than sympathy and concern.
249  Boris Johnson faced widespread criticism on Tuesday that British sanctions announced in response to Russian troops crossing into eastern Ukraine were not tough enough.The reaction came after the UK prime minister announced punitive measures in the House of Commons that targeted five medium-sized or small Russian banks and three billionaires close to Vladimir Putin.The move followed the Russian president’s decision on Monday night to recognise the separatist rebel enclaves in Ukraine’s Donbas region and send in the military.But in light of Germany taking the big step of pulling the plug on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline earlier in the day, many British MPs were disappointed that Johnson’s promised “first barrage” of sanctions against Russia was not more robust. Johnson claimed the measures were “draconian” and would be ratcheted up, but Sir Iain Duncan Smith, former Conservative leader, warned the first sanctions did not go nearly far enough to “hit” the Russian government. Duncan Smith told MPs that Britain needed to hit Russia “hard and hit them now”. Sir Ed Davey, Liberal Democrat leader, urged the UK to seize assets belonging to “Putin’s cronies” in London.Tom Tugendhat, Tory chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said: “The ratchet could be misinterpreted as giving a free pass at an early stage, rather than drawing a clear line that needs not to be crossed.”Sir Keir Starmer, Labour leader, “understood” why sanctions were being held back to deter further Russian aggression, but said: “A threshold has already been breached. A sovereign nation has been invaded.”Starmer called for Russia to be excluded from financial mechanisms such as the Swift international payments system, a ban on trading the country’s sovereign debt and for RT, the Kremlin-backed news channel, to lose its licence, preventing it “from broadcasting propaganda around the world”.In what he described as the “first tranche” of sanctions, Johnson announced an asset freeze and a ban on entering the UK on three oligarchs: Gennady Timchenko, and Boris and Igor Rotenberg. All three are already on the US sanctions list.Assets of five Russian banks, which Johnson claimed were involved in bankrolling the Russian invasion, were frozen with immediate effect, although UK officials could not say what assets they — or the three oligarchs — had in Britain.The banks facing sanctions are Bank Rossiya, which Britain claims is close to the Kremlin, Black Sea Bank for Development and Reconstruction, IS Bank and GenBank. All four are already subject to US sanctions.The assets of a fifth bank, Promsvyazbank, which has close links to Russia’s defence sector, have also been frozen. It is the only institution among the country’s top 10 biggest banks that was targeted.Tom Keatinge, an expert in finance and security at the Royal United Services Institute think-tank, was dismissive of the UK measures. “All the talk on sanctions so far has meant to be a deterrent and we have turned up to a gunfight with a peashooter.”Jason Hungerford, partner specialising in sanctions at Mayer Brown, agreed. “To say the UK sanctions list is underwhelming is an understatement,” he said.Anton Lopatin, senior director at Fitch Ratings, said: “Promsvyazbank is the largest bank in this list, but this is a bank focused on military financing. It operates with companies operating in the defence industry. Adding it to the UK sanctions list will have very little impact.”Johnson insisted Britain would impose much tougher sanctions if Putin ordered troops further into Ukraine. He said those measures would include “stopping Russian companies raising money on London markets or stopping them even trading in pounds and dollars”.British officials said the sanctions package was being “closely co-ordinated” with EU and Nato allies and that new measures would be unveiled “in waves”. Downing Street has said Russian aggression so far did not amount to “a full-scale invasion”.Subsequently, Liz Truss, UK foreign secretary, said Britain would “prohibit a range of high-tech exports and further isolate Russian banks from the global economy” if Putin did not “pull back from the brink”. Russian defence, chemicals, tech and energy companies would also be targeted.Britain would also impose sanctions on members of the Russian parliament who voted to recognise the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk, while no UK individual or business would be allowed to deal with non-Kyiv-controlled regions in eastern Ukraine, she added.British officials said the UK would apply more sanctions in the event of further Russian aggression but that more measures would also be introduced if Putin refused to de-escalate and withdraw troops from eastern Ukraine.
250  Business magazine Wirtschaftswoche encapsulated the problem with a recent cover: Vladimir Putin controls Germany the way a dealer controls a junkie. Natural gas is the drug of choice.The shrewdness of Putin’s strategy is clear now Russian tanks are rolling. Effective sanctions would ban Russian energy exports, or payments for them via the international banking system. But that severe blow to Russia’s resource-dependent economy would badly hurt Germans. The energy policy errors of their leaders are woefully apparent.Chancellor Olaf Scholz has only halted a second pipeline, Nord Stream 2, now that Russia is invading eastern Ukraine. This would have doubled the capacity of imports to 110bn cubic metres.The first Nord Stream pipeline system already supplies two-thirds of Germany’s imported energy. Half of Germany’s 40m households keep warm using natural gas, 97 per cent of it from overseas.Scholz’s predecessors Gerhard Schröder, a friend of Putin who is now a Gazprom board nominee, and Angela Merkel steered Germany towards its addiction. The renewables endorsed by Merkel provided 44 per cent of the country’s energy generation in the first half of 2021, according to official data. But she also ordered the closure of nuclear plants.Fossil fuels produce the bulk of Russia’s foreign income. Last year, Russia’s natural gas exports brought in $55.5bn — mostly from Europe. That was the highest since 2013. European natural gas prices have quintupled over the past year. Tellingly, the futures curve has now flattened, says consultancy Rystad Energy. Fears of Russian supply disruption have forestalled the typical spring and summer price slide.Annexing the whole of Ukraine would strengthen Russia’s grip on western Europe’s energy supply. Ukraine would no longer be a transit country able to cut off exports via its ageing pipeline system.In the short term, Putin has the whip hand. Autocrats can contemplate hardship for their compatriots more cheerfully than democratic politicians. The west is unlikely to impose a full export ban on gas. Germany has few other energy choices. Conventional sources, such as coal and nuclear, are politically unpalatable with the Green party, a member of Scholz’s coalition government.Longer-term, Germany must build up alternative gas supplies. It should finally heed US warnings and mothball Nord Stream 2 permanently. It should invest in terminals to import liquefied natural gas. It has none operating and only one under construction.The easier, cheaper choice would be to open Nord Stream 2 after the renewed Russian invasion has faded into recent history. Politicians would bill this as “the normalisation of relations”. Pretending suppliers are friends is one hallmark of the addict.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Please tell us what you think of Germany’s dependency on Russian gas in the comments section below.
251  Ukraine must be allowed to retain the option of Nato membership, Finland’s foreign minister has said, warning that Moscow’s open aggression seemed to be based on a “concept of the past and rebuilding the Soviet Union”.Pekka Haavisto said Russian president Vladimir Putin’s move on Monday to recognise the two breakaway republics in eastern Ukraine followed a worrying pattern that began with the 2008 annexation of parts of Georgia, then Crimea in 2014 “and now this one step further”.While he said a full-blown Russian invasion of Kyiv looked “unlikely [as] it would be very challenging”, there was a real chance of “open war” between Ukraine and Russia.“There were clues in Putin’s speech and in recent propaganda [about] Ukraine developing nuclear weapons and with the mentions of Odesa,” he told the Financial Times. “So you can start to see locations on a map that give a hint of what may be [the Kremlin’s] next steps.”Finland, which is a member of the EU but not of Nato, always maintained a careful neutrality with the Soviet Union during the cold war, which gives it a valuable perspective on the Ukraine crisis and the challenges of being one of Russia’s neighbours.Putin has demanded that Nato withdraw from eastern Europe and the Baltics and bar Ukraine from joining the military alliance. Haavisto said this seemed to have grown out of Putin’s apparent “frustration with the past 30 years, the collapse of the Soviet Union and Russia’s self image” and that the Russian president’s actions were “based on some sort of concept of the past and rebuilding the Soviet Union”.Although Nato has firmly rebuffed Putin’s demands, some have suggested a compromise whereby Ukraine effectively remains outside of the alliance while retaining the theoretical possibility of joining. Haavisto rejected that idea.“It is very important that Nato keeps its open-door policy, that Finland keeps the right to apply.and that is our position for Ukraine and Georgia as well. Every country should have that right,” he said.Russia, which has massed up to 190,000 troops around Ukraine’s borders, sent its troops on a “peacekeeping” mission in the Moscow-backed Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics late on Monday, after months of uncertainty over its intentions.In a rambling hour-long speech in which he recognised the breakaway republics, Putin also referenced the 2014 protests in the Ukrainian city of Odesa that left 42 pro-Russia demonstrators dead, calling it a “terrible tragedy.where participants in a peaceful protest were brutally murdered.by criminals”.The Russian president added ominously: “We know them by name and will do everything to punish them, find them and bring them to justice.” US officials have warned that Russia had a “hit list” of targets for assassination or arrest once it had troops in Ukraine.Russia’s move to a war footing after a sustained military build-up on the Ukrainian border has forestalled attempts to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis. It has also pushed the US and western allies to introduce limited sanctions and vow to respond with further curbs should Russia extend its incursion into areas held by Ukrainian forces.Haavisto said “you have to be a believer in diplomacy” and that the so-called Minsk process may have been one way of bringing peace to eastern Ukraine. “But that was then,” he added, given that Putin’s decision to send troops into the separatist areas had buried the Minsk agreements, which aimed to end the conflict that has left more than 14,000 people dead since 2014.Haavisto also squashed the idea of using Finland’s cold war relationship with the Soviet Union as a model for Ukraine’s present-day relationship with Russia — the so-called Finlandisation of Ukraine.“The term comes from history and the days of the cold war,” he said. “We don’t recommend that path to anyone.”
252  President Vladimir Putin made extensive reference to tsarist Russian, Soviet and postcommunist history on Monday in a speech that sought to justify the Kremlin’s second territorial dismemberment of Ukraine since 2014. The speech was notable for its distortions of that history and for a number of glaring omissions of the facts surrounding the emergence of Ukrainian national consciousness and independence.Putin kicked things off by asserting that “since time immemorial, the people living in the south-west of what has historically been Russian land have called themselves Russians and Orthodox Christians”. His purpose was to deny the very notion of a Ukrainian nationhood separate from that of Russia.Yet the ancestors of modern Ukrainians were known by various names up to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. The tsarist empire labelled them “Little Russians”, but those in the Austro-Hungarian empire — now an area of western Ukraine, where many were and remain Catholics — were called Ruthenians. In the 19th century, with the rise under tsarism of patriotic intellectuals and writers such as Taras Shevchenko, the national poet, the idea of a modern Ukrainian identity began to spread.Putin glossed over the fact that the tsarist government perceived an acute threat from the growth of Ukrainian national consciousness. In its Ems Decree of 1876, it banned the publication and import of all Ukrainian-language publications. Yet the late tsarist empire’s insistence that all east Slavs were essentially Russians was a point of view more or less indistinguishable from Putin’s.The Russian president asserted that “modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia or, to be more precise, by Bolshevik, communist Russia”. This statement ignored the fact that the overthrow of tsarism in 1917 generated a wave of Ukrainian political activism that resulted in the creation of the Central Rada, a provisional governing body. The Central Rada proclaimed the independence of Ukraine in January 1918 — a landmark event unmentioned by Putin.Amid the turbulence of the 1917-21 Russian civil war, Ukraine was unable to put its statehood on a firm footing and was overrun at different times by German, Polish, Russian and Ukrainian forces until the Bolsheviks took control. In 1922, Soviet Ukraine became one of the four founding republics of the Soviet Union.Putin blamed Vladimir Lenin for employing “a slogan about the right of nations to self-determination, up to secession” in the process that led to the adoption of the 1924 Soviet constitution. “Lenin’s principles of state development were not just a mistake, they were worse than a mistake,” Putin said, because they laid the ground for Ukraine’s declaration of independence in 1991 as the Soviet Union broke up.Yet Soviet Communist party leaders in the 1920s were in no doubt at all that Ukrainians were a nation distinct from Russians. Indeed, they adopted a policy of “Ukrainisation”, under which the state supported Ukrainian education, culture and language and promoted Ukrainians to high administrative posts. One aim was to make communist Ukraine attractive in the eye of Ukrainian minorities in Poland and other newly independent states in eastern Europe.The most horrific event of 20th-century Ukraine’s history also received no attention from Putin. This was the Holodomor, or deliberately induced famine, that ravaged Ukraine and caused several million deaths as a result of Joseph Stalin’s forced collectivisation of agriculture in the early 1930s.If, as Putin suggests, modern Ukrainians are unworthy of a state of their own, one may ask why more than 90 per cent of them voted for independence in a referendum of December 1991. Every province of Ukraine backed independence, including Crimea, which Putin annexed in 2014. Despite having an ethnic Russian majority population, Crimea voted in 1991 by 54 per cent in favour of Ukrainian independence.Similarly, Putin’s argument that postcommunist Ukraine became infested with “extreme nationalism . . . aggressive Russophobia and neo-Nazism” is a gross exaggeration. Ultra-nationalists played a part in the Maidan revolution of 2014 that ejected Viktor Yanukovich, the Russian-backed president. However, in the parliamentary elections that followed the revolution, the extremists fared very poorly.Putin’s speech amounted to a flat denial of Ukraine’s identity and right to sovereignty. The question now is whether he plans more steps to dismantle the Ukrainian state.
253  Welcome to another Energy Source.Russia-Ukraine remains the focus of international energy markets. Diplomatic efforts to avert a full-scale war were enough yesterday to keep a stronger oil price rally at bay — until Vladimir Putin delivered a speech in which he recognised the autonomy of Moscow-backed breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, a move that could hobble prospects for a negotiated resolution. Western leaders condemned Putin’s announcement.As he spoke, oil soared. Brent, the international benchmark, was up 3 per cent to $96.35 a barrel in late trading in New York yesterday, while WTI was up to almost $94/b. The odds of $100 oil are suddenly very short indeed.But oil prices are just one energy element now in the balance. If Russia invades, sanctions on Moscow will follow — and western energy companies will be affected. Russian retaliation would threaten gas supplies to Europe too, believe some politicians.Our first note today, from Australia, is on Woodside Petroleum — a new entrant to the US oil and gas upstream that thinks it has found a fossil fuel pitch that will remain attractive to environmentally conscious investors.Our second picks out the five biggest claims from Shell’s new liquefied natural gas outlook. Spoiler alert: one of the biggest LNG producers in the world is bullish about long-term LNG demand.Data Drill is a reminder of what’s at stake in Europe right now. Despite decades of rhetoric about diversifying energy supplies and decarbonisation, the continent remains heavily dependent on fossil fuels. It’s not a position of strength in a geopolitical showdown with your most important oil and gas supplier.Soaring oil and gas prices and the potential for shortages are stark reminders that the road to cleaner energy is far from smooth. Join us on April 7 for our Energy Source Live Summit where we will take a deep dive into the issues set to reshape the US energy industry in the years to come. Register today.Australian liquefied natural gas company Woodside Petroleum is poised to become a big player in the US oil market, with the planned acquisition of BHP’s oil and gas business mid-year. And Woodside CEO Meg O’Neill tells ES she believes the company will give local shale producers a run for their money. She gives three reasons for this. First, she says because none of the company’s US oil assets are in shale or other unconventional projects, they will avoid what she calls the “ongoing capital treadmill risk of being in the unconventional” sector. Second, she thinks investors will like the diverse geographical footprint the company will have, spanning Australia, the Gulf of Mexico, Canada and Algeria. But the third reason is perhaps the most interesting. She argues that because 70 per cent of Woodside’s business will be gas and only 30 per cent the more carbon-intensive oil, the overall carbon emissions intensity of the company will be much lower than companies that specialise in oil. Woodside, which is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, is planning a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange and O’Neill believes the company will be an “attractive” proposition for US investors looking both for exposure to oil and gas stocks, but also looking to keep their emissions profile as low as possible. But what do investors actually think? Ed John, head of government and engagement at the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors — a firm that advises big pension funds on ESG matters — says while carbon intensity can be a “useful” metric, the most important measure is absolute emissions and a clear transition plan. “Investors are increasingly keen to see the detailed analysis that supports these claims,” he adds. By absolute emissions, Woodside, which remains mostly a pure play oil and gas producer, may not stack up so well against oil companies that are moving more aggressively moving into renewables and hydrogen. Kristian Fok, the chief investment officer of the A$65bn Australian pension fund Cbus, tells ES that what’s needed is a clear “taxonomy” of what counts as a green investment — and that’s a long way from being completed in most countries (with the EU being an exception). In Australia, investors are crying out for such a taxonomy, but the government has shown little interest in legislating one. Until that happens, there’s a slight feeling companies are making it up as they go along. Woodside may well point to a recent BloombergNEF report, which rated it higher than a number of oil majors on its readiness for the energy transition, in part because shareholders and governments in the jurisdictions where it drills (often state rather than federal governments) are demanding Woodside take the transition seriously. The company is also constantly hounded by Australian activist groups, who have become expert at using tools like shareholder resolutions to mobilise big investors and force change. Whether Woodside can in fact persuade US investors it is a greener alternative to pure-play oil companies remains to be seen. But the fact O’Neill is thinking about it shows that, as oil and gas producers fight over a dwindling pool of willing capital, such considerations must be front of mind. (James Fernyhough)Shell’s new liquefied natural gas outlook is out. Its big conclusions mark a big shift in mood from the gloom that was settling over the LNG business a couple of years ago, when the question was whether the fossil fuel could possibly have a future in an energy transition. Here are five takeaways.You might think that commitments to zero carbon emissions are bad news for LNG — natural gas is a fossil fuel that emits lots of CO2 in combustion. But Shell says 98 per cent of imports are now made into countries with net zero emissions ambitions. Replacing coal with natural gas is the main reason for this, even though natural gas’ emissions will also have to eliminated to meet net zero goals. Evidently, those solutions will wait for later.Shell says 30 per cent of new vessel orders are now for LNG-fuelled ships. The LNG fleet is currently 251 strong, but another 403 will be on the water by the end of the decade. More than a quarter of container ships on order will be fuelled with LNG.Europe’s energy needs are dominating the LNG market at present. But Asian consumers will continue to drive demand in the next two decades, says Shell, as the continent sucks in imports to replace declining local production.In Europe, renewable power generation capacity rose in 2021. But generation fell, leaving the continent exposed to a turbulent fossil fuel market. Shell thinks the turbulence will last. Europe’s gas fundamentals — falling domestic gas production and pipeline imports — “point to continued exposure to price volatility”.Shell reckons that global upstream capital spending by 2025 will be 25 per cent lower than pre-pandemic expectations. In tandem with Asia’s soaring demand for LNG, this will create a supply gap within three years.(Derek Brower)Falling gas inventories and tensions between Russia and Ukraine serve as a stark reminder to the EU of its reliance on fossil fuels. Fossil fuels made up 70 per cent of the EU’s energy supply in 2020, according to new data from Eurostat. Supply varied largely across member states. In Malta, fossil fuels made up 97 per cent of the total supply, three times its share in Sweden.Brussels has worked gradually over the years to reduce its fossil fuel dependence. In 2010, three-quarters of the bloc’s energy supply was fossil fuel, according to Eurostat. Estonia and Denmark saw the largest declines in the past decade, with the shares of fossil fuels falling over 20 per cent.As gas, hydro, and wind generation fell in the past year, Brussels has turned to dirtier sources like coal to fill the gap. Coal generation jumped 18 per cent last year, the first increase in almost a decade according to Rystad Energy. If tensions persist, the firm expects coal generation to jump another 11 per cent.The EU raised its renewable energy goals last summer as part of its “Fit for 55” package, with plans to make renewables 40 per cent of its energy mix by 2030. All EU member states except France achieved their renewable energy targets in 2020. (Amanda Chu)
254  Good morning after quite an eventful evening, in which Russia’s Vladimir Putin ordered troops into eastern Ukraine under the guise of peacekeepers, proving that he has no intention of heeding any warnings and diplomacy attempts from the west.We’ll examine the European response to his announcement that he will recognise the independence of the two separatist regions in Ukraine — following his own playbook for an invasion — and why foreign ministers were at odds yesterday over the scope and timeline of sanctions.Meanwhile, with EU contingency planning well under way, including for extra cash and support for refugees from Ukraine, the migration commissioner will visit Poland today.The country is likely to become the main destination for people displaced by a large-scale Russian attack. But Poland will also be in focus because of its rule of law issues, as EU affairs ministers hold another hearing in the so-called article 7 proceedings that started in 2017 (the last hearing was held in June 2021).On a very different note, the EU’s new regime on corporate reporting is set to be unveiled tomorrow, so we’ll bring you up to speed with the latest provisions aimed at cracking down on abuses in supply chains.And the mood music in EU-UK relations has improved somewhat, so I’ll give you the rundown of how yesterday’s Brexit meeting went and what the remaining sticking points are.Josep Borrell warned yesterday evening that Vladimir Putin would face a “strong and united front” if the Russian president recognised two Kremlin-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, write Sam Fleming and Henry Foy in Brussels.Hours later, that pledge was firmly put to the test as Putin used a televised rant against Ukraine’s right to exist to announce he would indeed recognise the independence of Luhansk and Donetsk — and then ordered Russian troops to cross the border as “peacekeepers” in those territories.EU council president Charles Michel and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen condemned the move and said that “the union will react with sanctions against those involved in this illegal act” — without spelling out exactly who or what was in line of fire. EU ambassadors are set to meet this morning to discuss whom to target.US president Joe Biden has already unveiled penalties to target “new investment, trade, and financing by US persons to, from, or in the so-called DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine”. Additional sanctions will follow, the White House said, adding that these measures were separate from the “swift and severe” economic measures the US has been preparing with its allies should Russia further invade Ukraine. The UK also announced targeted sanctions as soon as today.All this brought some clarity after a day in which foreign affairs ministers meeting in Brussels gave conflicting messages over what triggers they should set before implementing any sanctions on Russia.At one end of the scale were hawks such as Lithuania, where foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis arrived yesterday morning arguing that the allies should already be discussing sanctions given the damage Russia has been doing to Ukraine. Others, such as France, have been more circumspect about pre-emptive punishments for fear that they could derail last-gasp diplomatic efforts to find a negotiated solution to the crisis.The EU has never set out a sliding scale of triggers for different levels of sanctions, preferring to avoid a mechanistic approach. So there remains the risk that member states will stumble as they seek to define what level of hostilities by Putin would trigger the full-blooded response hitting Russian companies and economic sectors, as well as individuals, they have been planning for months.The steps announced by the Kremlin on Monday night provide the allies with a trial run, which will probably result in a relatively narrow package aimed at those involved in the actions in Donetsk and Luhansk. One senior EU official said to expect “something quick, solid, visible and quite tough”, along the lines of those imposed on individuals involved in the 2014 annexation of Crimea.But it seems increasingly likely that far wider sanctions will become necessary as the full extent of Putin’s plans becomes clearer in the coming days.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is backing unorthodox measures to stabilise Turkey’s currency and curb inflation, which is expected to top 50 per cent this year, but analysts are sceptical it will work. With average deposit rates standing at 17 per cent in mid-February, the value of savers’ money still faces severe erosion. (More here)After a drawn-out and occasionally fraught internal debate that has run into this week, the commission will come out tomorrow with its long-awaited rules forcing companies to crack down on abuses in their supply chains, writes Sam Fleming in Brussels.The latest draft, seen by Europe Express, is largely in keeping with earlier versions of the plans. The rules will be of acute interest to larger companies with complex supply chains that straddle the world.Here are the key provisions of the draft directive, which will need to be thrashed out by the European parliament and Council before becoming a law:The mantra coming out of yesterday’s Brexit meeting in Brussels was that “there was neither a breakthrough, nor a breakdown in talks”, according to commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic after meeting UK foreign secretary Liz Truss.The same issues remain unsolved, including the uncertainties and potential bureaucratic traps surrounding 3mn EU citizens who should benefit from the same rights as before Brexit, which the two sides have been discussing for more than a year.On customs checks, while the UK now has an IT system in place, it is still negotiating the terms and conditions of EU officials being granted access to that system.And on the European Court of Justice, the EU’s position remains that it cannot be eliminated from the arrangements governing the post-Brexit relationship without having to reopen the Northern Ireland Protocol.But at least the tone between Truss and Sefcovic is markedly better (they even put out a joint statement yesterday) than it was with her predecessor, Lord David Frost.Sefcovic said his relation with Truss was “excellent” and that they’ve been calling each other at least once a week and plan to continue to do so and keep their respective teams engaged, even as in-person meetings are likely to take a back seat in the run-up to May elections in Northern Ireland.By contrast, Frost engaged in some Twitter trolling yesterday, when he juxtaposed the security talks on Ukraine with the EU worrying about “the strategic risk from olive oil”.The EU official who gave that example later in the day noted that any goods, be they olive oil or children’s toys, could become a safety threat if the EU cannot check what’s coming in on its market. “Everyone should be honest and clear about what’s at stake and perhaps also be honest and clear about how we got here,” the official said.
255  Vladimir Putin has ordered troops into eastern Ukraine after recognising two Moscow-backed separatist regions, hobbling the prospects of a diplomatic solution to the crisis as he put his country on a war footing.The Russian president directed his military to enter rebel-held Donetsk and Luhansk regions in Ukraine’s Donbas border area for “peacekeeping” operations after signing decrees pronouncing their independence.The decrees and military order sparked international condemnation as the US and European allies vowed to respond with sanctions, and Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, accused Russia of violating its sovereignty.Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, said the move to recognise the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics as independent was a “clear attack” on Ukraine’s sovereignty. “States have an obligation not to recognise a new ‘state’ created through the threat or use of force,” he said.Blinken added that US diplomatic staff based in the western city of Lviv would spend the night in Poland for “security reasons”.“Ukraine unequivocally qualifies the latest actions of the Russian Federation as a violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our state,” Zelensky said in an address to the nation.Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, said he planned to meet Blinken in Washington on Tuesday.Putin announced the moves following an angry televised speech in which he cast doubt on Ukraine’s statehood and accused the west of using the country as a tool to destroy Russia. He also made clear that his grievances with Kyiv stretched to the country’s existence in its current form.The separatist Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics were recognised at a signing ceremony in the Kremlin after Putin warned that Russia would hold Ukraine responsible for any “ensuing bloodshed” in the region.A senior US official said Putin’s speech was part of an effort to justify an invasion of Ukraine that could come as early as in the “coming hours”.“It was an attack on the very idea of a sovereign and independent Ukraine,” the US official said. “He made a number of false claims about Ukraine’s intentions that seemed designed to excuse possible military action. This was a speech to the Russian people to justify a war.”The Russian troops look set to remain in the Donbas region indefinitely, according to draft agreements published by the Kremlin under which Russia would defend the separatist states’ borders. Moscow deployed troops to the Donbas in 2014-2015, but has denied, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that it was a party to the conflict there.Western powers worried that the troops could help create a pretext for Russia to attack Ukrainian forces. Putin repeated unsupported claims that Ukraine has stepped up an artillery and “terrorist” campaign against the separatists, which Kyiv and its western allies said was laying the groundwork for a “false flag” operation.Following Putin’s decision to recognise the areas as independent, US president Joe Biden issued an executive order banning new investment, trade and financing by US entities in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.The White House said it would unveil additional measures to respond to the “blatant violation of Russia’s international commitments”. The US official said Washington was watching the movement of the Russian troops and would respond accordingly, without providing any specifics.“We plan to announce new sanctions on Russia tomorrow in response to Moscow’s decisions and actions today. We are coordinating with allies and partners on that announcement,” said a second US official.A spokesperson for Olaf Scholz said the German chancellor “condemned” the recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states, adding that the move was “completely at odds with the Minsk agreement on a peaceful solution of the conflict in eastern Ukraine”.Putin’s decision sparked an intense round of diplomacy involving Biden, Scholz and Emmanuel Macron, president of France.“This step will not go unanswered,” said Scholz’s spokesperson.A French official said “proportional, targeted sanctions” would be discussed in Brussels and that “Russia must pay the price of its decisions.” UK foreign secretary Liz Truss said the UK would also unveil sanctions on Tuesday.Putin’s speech followed a meeting with his national security council where Russian officials lined up to denounce Ukraine and the US, disparage the stalled Minsk peace process and urge him to recognise the separatists.“No one should mistake the theatrics as legitimate statecraft,” said the US official. “This is Potemkin politics. President Putin accelerating the very conflict that he is creating.”The UN Security Council held an emergency meeting on Monday evening to discuss the Ukraine crisis. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador, said Putin was laying claim to territories, such as Finland and the Baltics, that were part of the Russian Empire.“Putin wants the world to travel back in time. To a time before the United Nations. To a time when empires ruled the world. But the rest of the world has moved forward. It is not 1919. It is 2022,” Greenfield-Thomas said.Zhang Jun, the Chinese ambassador, stressed the need for diplomacy and called on all parties to “exercise restraint and avoid any action that may fuel tensions”.Russian ambassador Vasily Nebenzya accused the US and its allies of making “highly emotional” statements in response to Putin’s decision to recognise the two areas in the Donbas as independent.He also said Ukraine had increased shelling in the area, the latest in a string of claims that the US and its allies have dismissed as lies intended to help create the pretext for an invasion.“We remain open to diplomacy for a diplomatic solution. However, allowing a new bloodbath in the Donbas is something we do not intend to do,” Nebenzya said.Daily reports of clashes in eastern Ukraine have been an ominous backdrop to diplomatic efforts to defuse the crisis. On Monday, Russia claimed it had destroyed two Ukrainian military vehicles that strayed into its territory, killing five. The unconfirmed incident would be the first direct clash with Ukraine’s forces since Moscow mobilised 190,000 troops on its border.Additional reporting by Guy Chazan in Berlin, Derek Brower in New York and John Reed in Kyiv
256  In a converted loft in Budapest a disparate group of six party leaders gathered last week to rally around the opposition’s joint candidate Peter Marki-Zay as he outlined the coalition’s strategy to unseat Hungary’s strongman leader Viktor Orban.Calling Orban’s government “the most corrupt Hungarian regime in the past thousand years”, Marki-Zay railed against Orban for undermining democracy and failing to reform healthcare and education, and attacked him for Budapest’s mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic.The event was intended to show a united front after months spent bickering over campaign details, policy and candidates since Marki-Zay, a small-town mayor widely considered a long shot, secured the opposition candidacy in an unprecedented primary election in October.In coalescing around a single candidate for the premiership, the opposition hoped to give itself the best chance yet of ousting Orban at the ballot box. But with six weeks to the poll, confidence is fading. Even optimistic insiders only put the coalition’s chances of victory at 40 per cent on April 3.Political leaders and analysts say the disjointed United for Hungary campaign will struggle to beat the ruling Fidesz party’s political machine, with polls putting Orban on course to continue his premiership until 2026.In his speech, Marki-Zay acknowledged the difficulties of spearheading a broad coalition where the once far-right Jobbik rubs up against socialists and greens.“We have weathered difficult times, sometimes full of argument, when values and interests clashed,” he said.“[But] we have more power and more of a chance to win this election than any time before.”However, as he spoke there was still no agreement on a common election programme, nor a final list of candidates.“This has been crazy difficult,” said Budapest mayor Gergely Karacsony, who leads one of the green parties in the coalition, after the Marki-Zay speech. “It’s picking up now but in the beginning it felt like only we supported this effort.”The two largest opposition parties — the centre-left Democratic Coalition (DK) and Jobbik — were the most reluctant participants after the shock of seeing their candidates lose to Marki-Zay in the primaries, according to four campaign sources.“We need to win arguments with DK and Jobbik or compromise with them on everything. But that is OK. That’s how we will have to govern, too,” said Peter Zarand, who manages Marki-Zay’s and the coalition’s national campaign.Jobbik torpedoed the coalition’s joint candidate for president this month, sparking a damaging public spat, even though the presidency is a largely ceremonial role and Fidesz will easily carry a vote in the Orban-dominated parliament on March 10.Marki-Zay has also made life difficult for the coalition, surprising his partners when he insisted that his small party should appear on the ballot papers despite skipping the primaries as a group. Again, his coalition partners resisted because this would have given Marki-Zay extra influence.And the parties have argued for weeks over the distribution of each party’s candidates on national voting lists, with the allocation of parties to one seat still unresolved, several aides said.The bickering contrasts with years of organisational efficiency and consistent messaging from Orban’s Fidesz party. “It is conspicuous because Orban has stifled public debate on public matters for so long,” Zarand added.A win for Fidesz even by a small margin would give Orban a comfortable cushion in the 199-member parliament because of distortions in Hungary’s election system. About a quarter of voters are still undecided.Gerrymandered voting districts and an electoral system that can amplify winning margins mean Fidesz needs fewer votes to win than the opposition, said Robert Laszlo, an election expert at Budapest think-tank Political Capital.Fidesz also benefits from lightly enforced boundaries between party and government campaigns, and lax rules on private groups campaigning on behalf of a party.It only began its own formal campaign last week, but the government, municipalities, political action committees and communication companies have already spent big to promote Orban’s campaign.According to the website 444.hu, pro-government spending online is roughly double the opposition’s spending, at around €7.5mn. Fidesz advertisements also far outnumber those from the opposition on billboard spots around the country.Orban created a vast media machine, including a loyal group of hundreds of media outlets, a lavishly funded public broadcaster and news agency, which flood the market with free content that toes the government line.In such a hostile environment, campaign leaders said the opposition coalition will combat spending with traditional door-to-door campaigning across the country. DK and Jobbik leaders both said voter pressure has persuaded them to commit to abandoning their differences in the pursuit of a singular goal: unseating Orban.“We managed [last autumn’s] primaries running on fumes, deploying and co-ordinating thousands of volunteers,” Klara Dobrev, who was the DK’s candidate in last year’s primaries, told the FT. “We will build on that base to make sure all six parties support each candidate.Voters forced us to join and will force us to govern together.”Jobbik chair Peter Jakab said the earlier disagreements, such as quarrels over lists of candidates, would not undermine the campaign.“Voters couldn’t care less about the lists,” he said as he left the loft to get back on the campaign trail. “They care about the future of the country, which is down to getting out the opposition vote for April 3.”
257  Italy’s €200bn post-Covid recovery fund is its last chance to solve its structural weaknesses and rebuild its industrial power, according to the head of the country’s largest infrastructure group.Pietro Salini, chief executive of Milan-listed WeBuild, described the EU-funded “national recovery and resilience plan” as a historic opportunity for the country to improve public administration, pass reforms and upgrade infrastructure, especially in the south. The plan is part of the €800bn Next Generation EU fund, of which Italy is the biggest beneficiary.However, Salini also said that the EU’s focus on the transition to cleaner energy would be challenging. “The reduction of our carbon footprint is harder for Italy compared to other countries because unfortunately our economy is [gas dependent],” Salini told the Financial Times.“We have to unhook energy prices from gas but we must also aim for realistic renewable energy sources, which can cater to our industries.solar and wind can’t be those sources.”“And to rule out recourse to nuclear energy is crazy,” he said. In a referendum in 2011, Italy voted to block the restarting of its nuclear power programme.Salini, who is 63 and has led the company, which was founded in the 1930s by his grandfather, since 1994, said WeBuild had increased its activities in Italy spurred by the plan.The group, which took over Italy’s other two main construction companies Impregilo and Astaldi in 2011 and 2020, respectively, operates across five continents and employs more than 35,000 people worldwide.It has developed projects including the Paris metro expansion, the Houston to Dallas high-speed railway in the US and the Brenner tunnel between Italy and Austria.At the end of 2021, it unveiled the new Genoa bridge which it rebuilt after the old bridge collapsed in 2018, killing 43 people.Salini said the company would recruit more than 9,000 people in Italy in 2022 as projects were agreed and EU funding released. Italy accounted for 10 per cent of the group’s annual revenues in 2018, compared with 22 per cent of its €5.8bn of revenues in 2020.“The recovery plan envisages strategic projects worth more than €100bn. There’s a great effort on [southern Italy’s development] and on infrastructure,” Salini said.“Denmark has multiple bridges that connect the island to the mainland. We don’t have a single one that connects Sicily to the rest of Italy,” he added.A three-kilometre bridge across the Strait of Messina to connect Sicily and the mainland has been a subject of debate for decades in Italy, and Rome is currently looking at its feasibility.“It currently takes a whole day to travel [by road or rail] from Sicily to Milan. Obviously, this is a big limit and for the first time in 70 years there can be a thorough reorganisation,” he said.Salini also called for rules and regulations to be simplified. “Businesses can be the drivers of change, but the public administration must be proactive in its support. The legislation and bureaucracy cannot be used to effectively put the brakes on projects,” he said.But Salini is confident, nonetheless, of positive results. “I see a generalised willingness to succeed. And we benefit greatly from the credibility of [prime minister] Draghi and [president] Mattarella.”
258  Some of the world’s biggest oil companies and commodity traders are at risk of disruption to their extensive business operations in Russia if the west follows through with “unprecedented” sanctions against Moscow for any further invasion of Ukraine.The US has emphasised measures that would target Russia’s financial sector and members of President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle, rather than sanctions that would directly disrupt supplies of Russian oil and gas into Europe and potentially push elevated energy prices even higher.However, the G7’s threat of financial and economic sanctions on “a wide array of sectoral and individual targets” could still hit oil companies such as BP, Shell and ExxonMobil, and commodity traders such as Glencore, Vitol and Trafigura, which all have important business relationships in the country.“Extensive sanctions would be really problematic for the energy sector, even if they don’t directly target exports,” said Livia Paggi, head of political risk at consultancy GPW.Russia’s energy industry is so vast and the involvement of Putin’s allies so pervasive that new sanctions would, at a minimum, force western companies “to down tools while they worked out their exposure”.BP owns almost a fifth of Russia’s largest oil producer Rosneft. UK-listed rival Shell controls 27.5 per cent of Gazprom’s huge Sakhalin-2 offshore gas project in Russia’s far east. Exxon has been operating in the country for 25 years and producing oil and gas in eastern Russia since 2005 in a partnership involving two Rosneft affiliates.Trafigura and Vitol both have stakes in a controversial Arctic oil project run by Rosneft, and are big traders of Russian oil. Geneva-based Gunvor also lifts Russian crude while Glencore owns 10.55 per cent of En+, the hydropower and metals group formerly controlled by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, as well as a small stake in Rosneft.The state-backed oil producer has been under US and EU sanctions since 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine.The measures were designed to ensure Rosneft could still export oil and gas but stymie its future growth. It blocked the energy producer’s access to western financing with a maturity longer than 90 days, and its access to technology and personnel needed for certain exploration activities.Rosneft’s chief executive Igor Sechin was also targeted with individual sanctions that prevent US nationals or entities from dealing with him.As a result, BP, for example, was still able to report profits of more than $2.4bn from its Rosneft stake last year and collect $640mn in dividends, while chief executive Bernard Looney has continued to sit on the Russian group’s board.Brian O’Toole, a former sanctions expert at the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, said the thrust of any new energy-related sanctions was likely to be similar, and that “any significant sanctions on Gazprom and Rosneft that affect the current supply” were unlikely.Instead, sanctions might target midstream infrastructure including pipelines or downstream businesses such as Russian trading houses, O’Toole added. “Things like that may be more palatable and might not have an impact on current production but would send something of a message that the energy sector is not completely untouchable.”US president Joe Biden last week suggested the most severe sanctions would target Russia’s largest financial institutions. Such measures — such as eventually blocking Russia from international payments network Swift — would be unlikely to prevent western companies from taking or making payment for energy supplies but would make it more difficult for groups such as BP or Shell to operate, said O’Toole, now a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think-tank in Washington.Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said the Biden administration continued to stress it would not directly target Russian energy exports but that some measures under consideration could make it “challenging” for international oil companies. “These measures are apparently not at the top of the implementation list but could be included in the second or third round of punitive measures,” she said in a note.BP, Shell and Exxon declined to comment. In an interview with the Financial Times this month, Looney said BP would only worry about new sanctions if and when they materialised. “Let’s see what happens. There are sanctions today, we comply with sanctions and we will continue to do so,” he said.Trafigura, Vitol, Glencore and Gunvor all declined to comment.In 2018, when the US imposed sanctions on Deripaska and his aluminium companies Rusal and En+ it threw metals markets into chaos and caused significant supply chain disruptions.Rusal, in which Glencore then held a 9 per cent stake, was blacklisted by financial institutions, creating huge problems for European companies and sending the price of aluminium on the London Metal Exchange up by a third.Russia is also a key producer of palladium, which carmakers use to remove toxic emissions from exhaust fumes, as well as platinum, copper and nickel, a key battery material.The biggest risk to commodity markets, however, would come not from the sanctions but from how Russia might retaliate, said RBC’s Croft.“There is broad concern about the weaponisation of commodities by Russia in response to potentially facing the most onerous sanctions to date,” she said.Given an already tight market, with gas at record levels and oil trading above $90 a barrel for the first time in seven years, any move by Russia to hold back supply would send prices even higher.Christian Lindner, Germany’s finance minister, told the FT last week that the Kremlin could retaliate by reducing or even stopping gas flows to Europe.Russia supplies Europe with about 40 per cent of its gas. It is also the world’s third-largest oil producer, behind the US and Saudi Arabia, pumping roughly 10mn barrels a day last year, approximately 10 per cent of global output.“There is very little the west can do in terms of sanctions that doesn’t directly harm their direct commercial interests,” said GPW’s Paggi.* This article has been amended to reflect that BP last year reported profits of more than $2.4bn from its Rosneft stake, from which it collected $640mn in dividends
259  There is only one sort of race in the regulation of financial services: to the bottom.That’s worth remembering in the UK’s sudden hurry to overhaul European financial rules as part of a broader push to show the benefits of the glorious freedom gained by leaving the EU.No sooner had newly-anointed minister for Brexit opportunities, Jacob Rees-Mogg, expressed concern about the slow progress in producing changes to the Solvency II rules for insurance companies, than there came a promise of “slashing of red tape” from the Treasury.The insurance framework was “ripe for reform”, to use Rees-Mogg’s words, as evidenced by the fact that Europe is also changing the rules. And it is more restrictive than in some markets such as Australia. But the implication that it is important that Britain go further and faster than its nearest neighbours is a concern.For a start, the hurry for change glosses over the complexities of what is, after all, insurance regulation. There were two big areas for reform. Everyone broadly agreed that the risk margin, effectively an extra capital buffer, has been too volatile and too high in a low-interest rate environment. A promised cut of 60-70 per cent looks close to the industry’s hopes.The more contentious area (and more significant in the UK annuity market) is the matching adjustment, which allows writers of long-term business to match predictable investment cash flows against their liabilities. The resulting capital benefit is huge: at the end of 2020, it meant an improvement to the sector’s solvency position of £81bn against a total capital requirement of £116bn, according to the Bank of England.There seems to be more flexibility on offer to enable a wider range of long-term investments, in politically-appealing areas like infrastructure or green energy, to qualify for the matching adjustment.But the regulator had raised concerns that the calculation of what risk should be retained by insurers, or the fundamental spread, was incorrect in Solvency II. That was a view for which the industry says it has seen no evidence. Ultimately, the sector will want to be assured that overall the UK reforms, like those in Europe, will release capital and if so, how much.Shrouded in the insurance wonkery here is a pretty typical tension over capital requirements. Experts may be out of favour in post-Brexit Britain. But let’s agree they remain useful in the world of insurance regulation and that this was a debate worth having given the implications for policyholder protection.So why the rush? Europe published its proposals last year. But a few months at this stage makes little difference except in the fevered minds of politicians seeking a Brexit dividend.Europe’s new rules are unlikely to take effect until the end of 2024 at the earliest, given the cumbersome process involved. The tug of war between industry and regulator is also going on there, with a similar debate over the calculation of the volatility adjustment that is important to the types of business written in most European markets.The clear coalescence in the UK of post-Brexit political goals and industry priorities is a red flag for regulatory policymaking. Solvency II is just one prong of a strategy to get more British money into long-term British investments, in various ways that come with potential costs to policyholders or savers. The desire for an “investment big bang” is also coming with looser caps on fees paid by defined contribution pension schemes, and a push for local government pension funds to set aside money to go into local projects.That also rings alarm bells given proposals to introduce a mandate for regulators to consider the UK’s international competitiveness in their rulemaking. Rulemakers should be subject to greater scrutiny given the extra powers they will have in a post-Brexit world. But “competitiveness” is simply a stick that politicians eager for quick wins and a sector keen to tilt the playing field in its favour can use to prod the watchdogs.There will inevitably be other areas where tinkering with regulation is seen to present an opportunity to steal a march on our neighbours — ones more fraught than Solvency II, where everyone agreed change was needed.The regulator should hold the line that post-Brexit regulation is better done right than done fast.
260  Russian stocks plummeted in turbulent trading on Monday, on mounting concern that Moscow could soon launch an invasion of Ukraine.The Moex index plunged as much as 14.2 per cent after Moscow claimed that it had destroyed two Ukrainian military vehicles that entered Russian territory, in an unconfirmed incident that would be the first direct clash with Ukrainian forces since Moscow mobilised 190,000 troops on its border.The index closed the main trading session down 10.5 per cent in the biggest one-day fall since Russia seized Crimea in 2014, according to Refinitiv data.Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, also on Monday convened his top security advisers and agreed to recognise two Moscow-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine.“It does feel like the market isn’t quite panicking but that it has moved into a stronger form of risk aversion,” said Altaf Kassam, head of investment strategy and research at State Street. “There’s a feeling that Russia could yet escalate and take us over a cliff edge, [when] before it felt like Russia was as incentivised as the west to calm things down.”Shares in Rosneft, Russia’s leading oil producer, were down almost 20 per cent in Moscow on Monday and have shed close to 30 per cent of their value since the start of this year. State-owned gas producer Gazprom declined almost 16 per cent, before trimming some of its losses, taking its fall for 2022 to 19 per cent. Shares in gas producer Novatek were trading 12 per cent lower.The sell-off in Russian assets has also hit the likes of food group Magnit, down more than a tenth, and bank VTB, shares in which fell about 19 per cent on Monday.Joe Biden, US president, and Putin on Monday agreed “in principle” to hold a summit which it is hoped could lead to a de-escalation of tensions on the Ukraine border. Yet hours later, Russia’s army said it had destroyed the two Ukrainian infantry fighting vehicles, killing five people.Over the weekend, Boris Johnson, UK prime minister, vowed to impose economic sanctions and stop Russian companies raising money on UK markets in the event that Moscow moved to invade Ukraine.Monday’s share price declines were evidence that proposed western sanctions on Russian companies “would clearly be problematic” for investors, said Charles Hall, head of research at UK-based investment bank Peel Hunt.Even so, many of Russia’s biggest energy groups “don’t need to raise money right now as they’re doing very well from a profitability point of view”, added Hall. “Russian billionaires might now get a slightly less warm welcome in London than they’re used to, however.”Russian government bond prices also tumbled on Monday, pushing yields to their highest level of the current crisis. The yield on Russia’s dollar bond maturing in 2030 climbed three-quarters of a percentage point to 5.14 per cent, up from just above 2 per cent at the start of the year.Ukrainian yields also surged, with the yield on a dollar bond maturing in 2032 up more than half a percentage point at 11.1 per cent.In currency markets, the rouble fell 3 per cent to trade at 79.6 to the dollar, its weakest level since October 2020.The risk of tougher western sanctions was weighing on Russian assets and the rouble, according to Natalia Lavrova, senior economist at BCS Global Markets in Moscow.Following Biden’s comments about an imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine, “the volume of capital outflow may grow significantly, hence, the rouble will remain under pressure”, said Lavrova.
261  Britain’s City minister has said tens of billions of pounds of investment would be unleashed from insurance companies as he released further details of a post-Brexit rewrite of rules governing the sector.John Glen said the overhaul of the Solvency II rules represented a “genuine opportunity” to encourage the sector’s growth, protect policyholders and make it easier for insurance companies to invest for the long term.Glen told the Association of British Insurers’ annual dinner that EU regulation “doesn’t work for us any more”. He said the government would adjust “prudential regulation of insurers to our unique circumstances.”Details released included a reduction in the risk margin, an extra capital buffer that insurers must hold against shocks, of around 60 to 70 per cent for long term life insurers, close to the 75 per cent that insurers had sought.The ABI, which had previously raised concerns that the reforms could present a “Brexit penalty” rather than a “Brexit dividend” if they fell short, welcomed the details.“This announcement is a positive step that sees us well on the way to ensuring that we have a package that provides additional investment in the UK, without undermining the high standards of policyholder protection we have,” said Charlotte Clark, the ABI’s director of regulation.The trade body looked forward to “close collaboration” with the government and regulator on the final reform package, she added.Sir Nigel Wilson, chief executive of Legal & General, also welcomed the planned reform. “When implemented it will enable Legal & General to invest billions more in the UK’s levelling up, net zero and science super power agenda,” he said.The other big area where the industry is looking for changes to the rules is to the so-called matching adjustment, which effectively determines what assets insurers can use to back their long-term liabilities.The Treasury promised a “more sensitive treatment” of how credit risk is calculated here, while promising a “significant increase in flexibility” to allow insurers to put more money into long-term assets such as infrastructure.The reforms would also include a reduction in reporting and administrative burden on companies, according to the release.Jacob Rees-Mogg, Brexit opportunities minister, told the FT: “Solvency II was a particularly bad piece of EU legislation.” He said he was “very pleased” that reforms were now under way.The Treasury will publish a full consultation in April, while the Prudential Regulation Authority will carry out a more detailed consultation later in the year.A Financial Services bill is expected in this year’s Queen’s Speech to set out a regulatory framework for the City, with changes to the Solvency II rules implemented through detailed secondary legislation.The government has called for an “investment big bang” through reforms to the regime, inherited from the EU, which determines how much capital insurers must hold and influences where they invest their funds.Brussels, which is running a parallel reform, proposed changes last year that it said would release up to €90bn in short-term capital for the bloc’s insurers.
262  Russia and the Moscow-backed separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk have made increasingly lurid accusations against Ukraine in recent days, claiming attacks that Kyiv flatly denies and many observers believe to be falsified pretexts for starting a war.Russia’s army on Monday claimed a Ukrainian “sabotage and reconnaissance group” and two armoured personnel carriers had penetrated the Russian border, leading to a firefight in which Russia’s army said it killed five Ukrainian soldiers and destroyed both vehicles.Since Saturday, Russian state media and security services have also alleged that Ukraine fired a projectile hitting a Russian border service post, launched two shells into Russia’s Rostov region, and killed civilians while shelling the two breakaway republics in Ukraine’s east.The claims were made as Russia’s President Vladimir Putin on Monday moved to recognise the separatist-controlled Donetsk and Luhansk regions, ratcheting up international concern over the crisis.They were accompanied by state media footage of rubble and remnants of attacks. Open source investigators at the Bellingcat group have poked holes in some of these videos, alleging at least one shared by the separatists likely had audio of gunfire lifted from a YouTube video.“It’s amazing. I mean, it’s really extraordinary,” said Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian defence minister.No Ukrainian armoured personnel carriers or saboteurs crossed any borders, he said. “None of that happened. So basically it’s a virtual war, it’s a war which exists in the information space. It doesn’t exist in reality.”Whatever their credibility, Moscow’s claims of Ukrainian incursions, which analysts said were targeted largely at a domestic Russian audience, have pushed Kyiv into a defensive position. “Ukraine does not plan any such actions,” Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister said. “Russia, stop your fake-producing factory now.”The conflicting accounts have bolstered US claims in recent weeks, citing intelligence, that Moscow planned to fabricate incidents that would serve as a casus belli for launching military operations in Ukraine.“Prevention by disclosure is a well-known method for activities whose success is based on being unexpected,” Zagorodnyuk said. “A false flag operation that is disclosed in advance, it delegitimises itself to a great extent.”“But it seems like they’re so stuck with this plan that they go with it anyway, even if it’s already delegitimised even before it started. So that’s weird,” he added.Apart from the conflicting accounts emanating from Moscow and Kyiv, people following the conflict in Ukraine and the west noted with worry Putin’s use of emotive language similar to the kind that preceded Russia’s incursion into Georgia in 2008.In a joint press conference with Germany’s Chancellor Olaf Scholz last week, Putin repeated a claim he had made before that “genocide” was happening in the Donbas.Putin has also repeatedly — including during Scholz’s visit — made an analogy between the conflict in Ukraine and Nato’s 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo war. Some observers interpreted this as laying the groundwork for “humanitarian” intervention on behalf of Russian passport holders who live in the Donbas’s two breakaway republics.“These messages of ‘genocide’ and of Ukraine being the aggressor are targeting Putin’s domestic audience with the intention to claim that Russian intervention serves some kind of greater purpose, that they are protecting the local population,” said Natia Seskuria, associate fellow with the Royal United Services Institute.“What we are seeing now is just the preparation for a pretext for a military invasion,” Seskuria said.Analysts said that while Russia’s military plans were still murky, its mounting allegations were also intended to pile on pressure to Volodymyr Zelensky’s administration.“This is a psychological operation. They need to break Zelensky, to force him to sign the concessions,” Oleksandr Danylyuk, chair of Centre for Defence Reforms in Kyiv.Moreover, he added, “they need to break the west and force them to break Zelensky, as he is not going to be broken by Russia”.As Moscow moved towards recognising the Luhansk and Donetsk “republics”, Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister, urged restraint. “A lot of emotions out there, but it’s exactly now that we should calmly focus on de-escalation efforts,” he said. “No other way.”
263  For Vladimir Putin’s extraordinary meeting with his top security officials on Monday, he chose the Kremlin’s ornate Hall of the Order of St Catherine. Designed by the tsars to show off the glories of Russia’s empire, the setting perfectly underscored how much the president has come to resemble his autocratic forebears of old.In a made-for-TV spectacle, Putin asked his subordinates one after the other to make the case for recognising two separatist-held territories in eastern Ukraine — a move the west fears could mark the start of a war between Moscow and Kyiv, with as many as 190,000 Russian troops massed around Ukraine’s borders.As he did so even his longest-serving allies looked terrified. Telling him what they evidently thought he wanted to hear, mostly repeating baseless claims from state television, they looked less like a sounding board than an imperial court.“Are there any differing points of view?” Putin asked at one point. There were not.In some ways, Monday’s session was the culmination of Putin’s 15-year grievances with the US and Nato, which he said were using Ukraine as a tool for “confrontation” with Moscow and ignoring Russia’s demands.Nikolai Patrushev, the security council’s secretary, told him: “We don’t just need talks, we need to achieve concrete goals. They hide their concrete goal, which is to destroy the Russian Federation.”But it also marked what could be a defining moment in Putin’s 22-year rule.Holding the meeting in the room where he annexed Crimea in 2014 underscored how much more autocratic Russia has become in eight years of the eastern Ukraine conflict. Then, Putin stayed up until 7am with four of his top security officials hatching a plan to seize the peninsula.Today, the extensive efforts Putin takes to avoid catching Covid-19 have deepened his already substantial isolation. He holds most of his meetings in public, forces most visitors to quarantine for two weeks, and attended a Christmas service in a chapel empty save for the priests.During his few in-person meetings, armchair Kremlinologists have turned to Putin’s idiosyncratic furniture choices for clues into his state of mind.French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Olaf Scholz, who refused to take a Kremlin-administered PCR test, were seated at the other end of a comically huge table. Allies such as Alexander Lukashenko, meanwhile, sat around a tiny table, with the bulky leader of Belarus squeezed into a chair that could barely hold him.This time the two dozen or so members of the security council were at the other end of the hall as Putin slouched at a table at least 20 feet away from them. Even the most powerful state officials were made to look like schoolchildren reporting to the headteacher as Putin asked them for their views on recognising the separatists.Dmitry Medvedev, who once represented dashed hopes for a more liberal Russia when he filled Putin’s role as president, told him that “the scale of potential conflict can’t be compared with what we faced in 2008” during the war with Georgia.“But now we know what is going to happen,” he said. “We know how to withstand this pressure.”At one point, Sergei Naryshkin, the powerful foreign intelligence chief, suggested using the threat of recognition as a tool to compel Ukraine to conclude peace on Moscow’s terms. Putin then told him: “Are you proposing starting the negotiation process, or recognise the republics’ sovereignty? Speak clearly!”Naryshkin began to stutter. “I will support the decision to recognise.”Putin cut him off. “I will support or I support? Speak clearly, Sergei!”A visibly flustered Naryshkin mumbled that he supported incorporating the separatist territories into Russia.“That’s not what we’re discussing!” Putin said. “We’re talking about whether to recognise their independence or not.”Naryshkin meekly assented.Putin insisted he had not discussed the topic with any of the officials beforehand. But the heavily stage-managed nature of the event made that hard to believe — viewers spotted some speeches were cut and defence minister Sergei Shoigu’s watch showed a time five hours earlier, adding to suspicions the video was pre-recorded.Mikhail Mishustin, prime minister, admitted that the cabinet had “been preparing for the potential reaction to our recognition [of the separatists] for several months now.the risks have been quite well worked out”.Putin’s decision will only be the beginning of a long and fraught process. Vladimir Kolokoltsev, interior minister, urged him to recognise the separatists in their “historical borders”, much of which is still controlled by Ukraine. Doing so would guarantee an all-out war.“A decision will be taken today,” Putin said. The TV feed abruptly cut off — as if to underscore that the decision will be Putin’s, and Putin’s alone.* This story has been amended since original publication to correct a quote from Dmitry Medvedev, who said the potential conflict “can’t” be compared with 2008
264  Downing Street on Monday distanced itself from suggestions by the new Brexit opportunities minister that the UK might cut red tape by unilaterally accepting testing on industrial goods by the EU and other countries.Jacob Rees-Mogg this month endorsed a report by the rightwing Institute of Economic Affairs think-tank which said the UK could “unilaterally recognise EU regulations and conformity assessments”.He added to confusion in the British business community, which is gearing up for a new domestic testing regime, when he told The Times there was “no point” in the UK repeating tests that other countries did to an acceptable standard.But on Monday, Number 10 said Rees-Mogg was not setting out a new government stance: “Our position has not changed.” Government officials confirmed that Rees-Mogg was articulating his broad ambitions for his new job rather than specific new policies on removing “non-tariff barriers” to trade.Rees-Mogg’s apparent acceptance that the UK should unilaterally recognise testing by the EU and other countries to avoid duplicating costs for business had left industry groups perplexed.One senior industry executive said such a policy, while attractive to many companies seeking to avoid Brexit red tape, would have “driven a coach and horses” through three years of government policy, which has insisted on the UK creating its own copycat standards for industrial goods and chemicals.The government is demanding that from January 1 2023 businesses wanting to place goods in the UK market must meet a new “UKCA” safety standard, which largely duplicates the EU’s “CE” safety mark.In a call with industry last week, officials from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy repeated warnings that companies needed to prepare for the new UKCA regime.“We didn’t know if this was a change in policy, or if the minister was just freelancing, but it looked very much like this hadn’t been through the Whitehall government policymaking sausage machine,” the executive added.A senior auto industry executive added that Rees-Mogg’s remarks had raised hopes that Downing Street might have been about to change tack on the issue. “It is disappointing that a senior government minister has such a weak grasp of the details of this critical area of regulation,” he added.William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said business was still unpersuaded that the UKCA scheme was necessary or practical. “We need a clear cross-government message that it is willing to listen well and act pragmatically in the interests of UK businesses,” he added.Despite government insistence that it was sticking to its guns on UKCA marks, there have been some signs that the government is listening to industry’s complaints by twice extending the original deadlines for meeting the new standards’ regime.The chemical industry is in negotiations with Defra, the environment department, on how to reduce the burdens created by the new “UK Reach” chemicals safety database after ministers announced registration for the scheme would be delayed by two years “It does look like the government are getting the message about the need to match standards,” said a person familiar with the discussions.During the Brexit trade negotiations, industry persistently lobbied for the UK to strike an agreement with the EU to mutually recognise standards, such as the “CE” safety and quality mark and the EU Reach chemicals regulations database.In the event, the EU refused to cut such a deal on terms acceptable to the UK. Michel Barnier, the EU chief negotiator, said Brexit meant that the UK must lose its place as a “regulatory and certification hub” for goods and services entering the EU single market.As a result, the UK started the UKCA mark and its own version of the chemicals database, both of which have met strong resistance from business groups, which have argued the schemes create costs for no gain.Russell Antram, head of EU trade at the CBI business group, said that if the UK and EU were unable to reach mutual recognition agreements, unilateral recognition on the UK side would be a “step in the right direction” for many companies.However, he cautioned that unilateral recognition of standards by the UK would not be without its problems, since it could leave UK exporters facing more checks than EU exporters.
265  The decision, announced after a televised meeting of Russia’s security council, came in response to pleas from the leaders of the self-proclaimed People’s Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk for Putin to recognise them as independent states and protect them from what they said was a planned offensive by Ukraine to retake them. Ukraine has denied this and said Russia was trying to use the allegation — and renewed hostilities by its proxies — as a pretext for a renewed invasion.More than 14,000 people have died in the conflict in eastern Ukraine since Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014. Ukraine and western countries have said there was evidence that Russia had been providing weapons and fighters to fuel the separatist war, which Moscow denies.Self-proclaimed but almost wholly reliant on the Kremlin for support, Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics declared independence from Kyiv in April 2014 after Russia-backed militias seized control of local government offices and other infrastructure following Moscow’s invasion of Crimea. Bordering Russia on Ukraine’s eastern flank, the largely Russian-speaking regions are home to more than 3mn people and have received large amounts of financial, humanitarian and military assistance from the Kremlin. Moscow’s support for the regions came after the pro-western Maidan movement toppled Ukraine’s pro-Russia president in February 2014.Under the Minsk agreements — peace talks brokered by France and Germany — a ceasefire left the separatists in de facto control of roughly a third of the Ukrainian administrative districts of Donetsk and Luhansk, with a heavily fortified line of control separating them from Ukrainian troops.Ukraine describes the regions as “temporarily occupied territories” and the Minsk agreements envisage their eventual return to Kyiv. But both Kyiv and Moscow have failed to implement the terms of the agreements, leaving the status of the territories in limbo.At the same time, Russia has spent the past eight years increasing its leverage over the territories. It has given out passports and citizenship to about 800,000 of their citizens, Russian officials said on Monday, while stressing the need for the Kremlin to protect them.Moscow has in the past stepped back from recognition, preferring instead to exert indirect control and use the territories as leverage in its wider disputes with Ukraine and the west.Recognition will probably bring two major initial outcomes. First, the collapse of the Minsk agreements and hopes for a diplomatic solution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. On Monday, a stream of senior officials told Putin that they believed there was no prospect for the peace deal to be fully implemented, something they said gave Moscow no choice but to take other measures.Second, it would give the Kremlin justification to send Russian troops and military equipment into the territories. That would likely increase the risk of full conflict between Moscow and Kyiv along an already active front line. A bigger problem emerges in the medium-term: the two statelets each claim all of the Ukrainian districts of Luhansk and Donetsk. Russia has not made clear whether it is acknowledging their claims to territory under Kyiv’s control.Nato and the EU have warned that recognition of the breakaway regions would be a big escalation in the conflict between Moscow and Kyiv, while some European officials have called for it to be a trigger for a threatened sanctions package against Russia.Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said last week that recognition would represent “a blatant violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty” and breach international law. Such a move would be “an open escalation”, said Lithuania’s foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis, adding it “should be met with swift and decisive sanctions” if approved by Putin.However the EU, US, UK and other western countries have previously said that major sanctions threatened against Moscow would be deployed in the event of a military attack on Ukraine itself and there has been no public agreement on how to respond in the event of recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk.After a major Russian military build-up close to the borders of Ukraine, western governments have warned for weeks that Donetsk and Luhansk could be used to create a pretext for war, either by provoking a response from Kyiv or staging a “false flag” attack that Russia could blame on Ukraine.Russia has denied it plans to invade but insisted that the west agree to a number of security guarantees, such as banning Ukraine from ever joining Nato and withdrawing Nato troops from alliance members close to Russia. Moscow has previously seen the two statelets as an insurance policy in Ukraine. It has demanded that their return to Ukraine would come with their veto over major foreign policy decisions, notably Kyiv’s application to join Nato, which is a red line for Moscow.Their recognition by Putin now ratchets up the threat of conflict with Kyiv.The move suggests Putin has lost faith in diplomatic efforts to avert further conflict in Ukraine, led in recent days by French president Emmanuel Macron. The future of the two statelets is seen as a critical area for compromise in any negotiated solution and recognition would appear to end that possibility.Dmitry Medvedev, deputy secretary of Russia’s security council and a former president, made it clear on Monday that he thought Russia should proceed regardless of the risk of conflict and fallout.“The scale of potential conflict can’t be compared with what we faced in 2008 [with Georgia],” he told Putin. “But now we know what is going to happen.all the sanction ideas that we can hear now broadcast [from the west].”He added: “But we know how to withstand this pressure.” * This story has been amended since original publication to correct a quote from Dmitry Medvedev, who said the potential conflict “can’t” be compared with 2008
266  Uniper has all but scrapped its dividend as the German utility looks to preserve cash in the face of wild price swings in energy markets and rising geopolitical tensions. The Düsseldorf-based company said on Monday it would declare a payment of just €0.07 per share for 2021, down from €1.37 in 2020, citing high gas prices and uncertainty over Ukraine.The proposed dividend amounts to just €26mn, against €501mn the year before, and is the lowest possible amount the company can pay under German law. The move had been backed by its majority shareholder.“Given the continued high volatility on the energy markets, the geopolitical situation and the increasing momentum of the European energy transition, Uniper is placing a stronger focus on liquidity and investment capacity, which is reflected in the dividend proposal,” it said in a statement.The company said it was not planning at “present” to decide on a dividend policy.Uniper, which is majority owned by Finnish power company Fortum, was forced to seek €10bn of additional financing earlier this year to avoid a cash crunch after slowing gas supplies from Russia to Europe caused prices to surge.The company is dependent on Russian gas to generate electricity and also supply a large customer base with the fossil fuel. Like its competitors, Uniper uses derivatives to hedge future power and gas sales.As prices have soared over the past year to record levels, the losses on these hedges have increased, requiring Uniper to make margin payments to brokers, exchanges and other counterparties. When the gas and power is delivered the margin is returned.Analysts at Barclays said the proposed dividend for 2021 was almost 95 per cent below market expectations of €1.381 per share but that the company had softened the blow by signalling better than expected earnings guidance for 2022. Uniper expects to report adjusted earnings before interest for 2022 of €1bn to €1.3bn because of a strong performance from its midstream gas business and gains in power generation. Analysts had been expecting earnings of €1bn for the year. “We see a very favourable investment case for the European utility sector,” the Barclays analysts said. “One of the key arguments of our recent reports is that.consensus [forecasts] still do not reflect the power price rally.”German baseload power prices surged last year, rising from about €50 per megawatt hour in January 2021 to a record €438 in December, before retreating this year to less than €200/MWhUniper is among Europe’s largest electricity generators with 34 gigawatts of capacity and is also a big gas supplier. It has about 600 clients in Germany and neighbouring countries, ranging from industrial customers and municipalities to regional distributors.It was one of five companies to back Nord Stream 2, the $11bn pipeline across the Baltic Sea that will allow Russia’s Gazprom to send up to 55bn cubic metres of gas to Europe a year, bypassing Ukraine.
267  The writer is director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia UniversityIf US President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin do manage to hold a summit on Ukraine, what should Biden’s approach be? Biden has said repeatedly that the US is open to diplomacy with Russia, but on the issue that Moscow has most emphasised — Nato enlargement — there has been no American diplomacy at all. Putin has repeatedly demanded that the US forswear Nato’s enlargement into Ukraine, while Biden has repeatedly asserted that membership of the alliance is Ukraine’s choice. If a summit does materialise in the days ahead, and in the planned meeting this week between US secretary of state Antony Blinken and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, the US should propose a guarantee that Nato will not enlarge to include Ukraine in return for a full withdrawal of Russian forces from the Donbas region and an end to Russian support for the independence of the two Moscow-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, a demobilisation along the Russia-Ukraine border and an assurance of Ukrainian sovereignty. If the US won’t do this, then France and Germany should step forward instead.This would inevitably lead to cries of appeasement. Many insist that Nato enlargement is not the real issue for Putin and that he wants to recreate the Russian empire, pure and simple. Everything else, including Nato enlargement, they claim, is a mere distraction.This is utterly mistaken. Russia has adamantly opposed Nato expansion towards the east for 30 years, first under Boris Yeltsin and now Putin. Before that, the Soviet Union largely opposed Nato expansion, too.It is easy to understand why. The US would not be very happy were Mexico to join a China-led military alliance, nor was it content when Fidel Castro’s Cuba aligned with the USSR 60 years ago.Neither the US nor Russia wants the other’s military on their doorstep. Pledging no Nato enlargement is not appeasement. It does not cede Ukrainian territory. It does not undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty. It would in fact help to secure it. Ukraine should aspire to resemble the non-Nato members of the EU: Austria, Cyprus, Finland, Ireland, Malta and Sweden.Americans can learn much from the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. As the historian Martin Sherwin showed in his book Gambling with Armageddon, the crisis was resolved by a deft compromise. The Soviet Union agreed to remove its missiles from Cuba while the US agreed to remove its missiles from Turkey.The American public never appreciated this, alas, because President John F Kennedy insisted on keeping the US removal of missiles from Turkey secret. Kennedy did not want to appear to speak for all of Nato, and sought to protect himself from charges of appeasement from the US right. The public therefore believed that the crisis ended with Soviet capitulation, not compromise.Despite claims to the contrary, the western nations offered informal assurances to the Soviet Union that Nato would not enlarge to the east after German unification. The US and allies acted deceitfully, using sophistical arguments to claim that previous pledges were not binding. It was especially reckless in 2008 for President George W Bush to open the door to Ukraine’s (and Georgia’s) Nato membership.Biden and the US foreign policy establishment has so far refused to reconsider Nato enlargement for three reasons. First, they fear the charge of appeasement. Second, the US wants the prerogative to puts its military in any country that will have it, even if that disregards the legitimate security concerns of neighbouring states. Third, the US foreign policy establishment has long failed to acknowledge valid Russian security concerns that go back to the second world war and even earlier.Russia has long feared invasions from the west, whether by Napoleon, Hitler or latterly Nato. For this reason, cooler and wiser US foreign policy strategists, including Bill Clinton’s defence secretary William Perry, the great statesman and diplomat George Kennan and former ambassador to the Soviet Union, Jack Matlock, argued that Nato enlargement to the east after the demise of the USSR was unnecessary, reckless and provocative.If war comes, Putin would of course deserve the blame and global opprobrium. Russia’s threats are thuggish and dangerous. Yet as misguided as the Russian actions are, American intransigence regarding Nato enlargement is also utterly misguided and risky. True friends of Ukraine, and of global peace, should be calling for a US and Nato compromise with Russia — one that respects Russia’s legitimate security interests while fully backing Ukraine’s sovereignty.Letters in response to this article:Why Russia’s security concern is hard to ignore / From Keiichi Katakami, Chair, Institute for International Economic Studies, Tokyo, JapanWhether to join Nato is Ukraine’s choice to make / From Pawel Konzal, London NW1, UK
268  Eurozone economic activity rose more than expected and at the fastest pace in five months in February as restrictions to prevent the spread of coronavirus were lifted, while rising energy bills and wages led to the sharpest price increases on record.The flash purchasing managers’ composite index for the eurozone, an important measure of the health of the manufacturing and services sectors, rose to 55.8 in February, up from 52.3 in January and the highest since September.This was much stronger than the 52.7 forecast by economists polled by Reuters.Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the eurozone economy “regained momentum” in February, as an easing of restrictions designed to control the Omicron coronavirus variant led to renewed demand for many consumer services, such as travel, tourism and recreation, and helped alleviate supply bottlenecks.However, Germany’s central bank, the Bundesbank, warned that output in Germany may decline “noticeably” in the first quarter of 2022, having already contracted by 0.7 per cent in the final three months of 2021. The bank cited a surge in Covid-19 cases caused by the Omicron variant.“In contrast to the last waves of the pandemic it is not just activity in the services sector that is being hit by restrictions and adapted behaviour,” it said in its monthly report. “Rather pandemic related absences of workers could significantly dampen economic activity.”If output declines in the first quarter, Germany would have suffered its second recession since the pandemic began.The eurozone purchasing managers’ survey showed that persistent cost pressures caused by rising wages and energy bills led to the sharpest rise in average prices charged for goods and services since the company started to collect this information in 2002. This is despite an easing of supply delays that helped to reduce inflation for raw material input costs.The evidence of steep increases in prices could add to pressure on policymakers at the European Central Bank to tighten monetary policy faster than expected, analysts said.The reading “signals that inflation is set to remain elevated over the coming months, putting pressure on the European Central Bank to unwind its emergency stimulus programmes quicker than it previously envisaged”, said Melanie Debono, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.Eurozone inflation rose to a record 5.1 per cent in January and the PMI points to price pressure accelerating in February. Earlier on Monday, separate data by the German statistics office showed that producer prices rose 25 per cent in January, the fastest pace since 1949.February’s PMIs suggest “that the winter economic dip could be much milder than expected, labour market pressures continue to build and second-round effects are resulting in more broad-based price pressures at the moment”, said Bert Colijn, an economist at ING.“Expect this to add to hawkish pressures ahead of the European Central Bank March meeting,” he added.While rising prices threaten the recovery in eurozone consumption as they erode households’ spending power, the survey points to a strong rebound in business activity in February following declining Covid-19 infections and the easing of restrictions.The PMIs showed that activity rose at the fastest pace in eight months in France and the highest in six months in Germany.The acceleration in eurozone business activity was driven by the services sector, with the corresponding index also rising to 55.8 in February from 51.1 in January.Any reading above 50 indicates a majority of businesses reporting an expansion compared with the previous month.Eurozone manufacturers also reported improved production gains as a result of rising demand and fewer supply bottlenecks. The report shows that supplier delivery delays were the lowest since January 2021.With strong orders, both domestic and from abroad, plus rising optimism, businesses also increased the number of workers. Jobs increased at the fastest pace in seven months in manufacturing and the highest in three months across the whole eurozone economy, according to the report.The eurozone unemployment rate fell to a record low of 7 per cent in December and the PMIs support the consensus that the labour market will strengthen further in the months ahead.Having regained its pre-pandemic level at the end of last year, “the eurozone economy is likely to expand at a reasonable pace in the first quarter and accelerate in the next two quarters as tourism, travel and hospitality continue to normalise”, said Andrew Kenningham, an economist at Capital Economics.Additional reporting by Guy Chazan in Berlin
269  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
270  Hello and welcome to another week of wondering when the whole trade story might suddenly be dominated by a geopolitical rupture and energy shock emanating from eastern Europe rather than the slow and technocratic processes of, for example, the EU taking China to the World Trade Organization over what it calls a power grab to set smartphone technology licensing rates, the UK reaching the next stage of its application to join the Asia-Pacific CPTPP pact, or ministers wanting the WTO to hold its postponed ministerial by the end of June. Apparently, the question of a Ukraine invasion all comes down to a few old men in Moscow who aren’t really that bothered about what happens to the Russian economy and might even personally benefit from sanctions, which isn’t the most comforting thought.Speaking of which, in future Trade Secrets we’ll take a look at financial and trade sanctions in the Russia context and whether co-ordination between the two big participants (the US and Europe) can be made effective. In the rest of today’s newsletter we’ll look at two issues: first, the broader subject of transatlantic co-operation on strategic trade policy; second, the EU-Africa Union summit at the end of last week and what it tells us about trade and development.Charted waters this week looks at how the price of a British pint is being hit by the rising cost of raw ingredients.The EU is tooling up to be more strategically assertive on trade, the US wants the EU as a geopolitical ally against China and (of course) Russia, ergo the US should be super-keen on the EU’s new get-tough direction. Right? Right?Well, hmm. Depends how they get used and against whom. This came to mind because I heard an interesting nugget recently. The EU’s anti-coercion instrument (ACI) has built up a lot of momentum, including with some central and eastern European countries that aren’t always on board with tools that might be used for protectionist ends. Why? Partly, because said countries instinctively look to the Atlanticist alliance. And what with the Russia-Ukraine (and the China-Lithuania) situation, there’s a perception there that the US is looking quite kindly on the ACI as evidence that the EU is getting serious about an assertive strategic trade policy.If the US ends up a fan of the ACI (it will no doubt depend on exactly what the instrument eventually looks like), it will be quite the turnround. The ACI started life as a weapon created with the US as a target. It was a response to former president Donald Trump’s threats to impose tariffs on French handbags and other strategically vital goods in retaliation for EU countries imposing digital services taxes. (To be more precise, the ACI was the European Commission’s attempt to head off plans in the European Parliament to create an even more radical unilateral tool that looked a lot like the US Section 301.) With the digital services tax issue defused and Joe Biden replacing Trump, the likely target shifted to China and Russia.It’s not the only time recently a US policy has inspired an EU counterpart. There’s a lot of America-envy going on in certain quarters of Brussels at the moment. The European Chips Act was designed to generate a headline figure somewhere near the $52bn the US Congress was planning to dump on America’s semiconductor industry, and the export restrictions in the European policy mimic the use of the US Defense Production Act in requiring state-subsidised companies to prioritise the domestic market when required.But creating similar kinds of tools doesn’t mean transatlantic coherence and co-ordination. Although there are some vague references to co-operation on semiconductors, for example, it’s pretty clear that each economy is going its own way on boosting production. As for the anti-coercion instrument, it would be unwise to assume it could never be turned on the US, especially if there’s a change of administration back to Trump or someone like him. There is an awful lot of unilateralism going around with a hope rather than a clear plan that it will be co-ordinated.The leaders of the unions European and African had a summit at the end of last week. It wasn’t exactly all rainbows and kittens. Predictably, despite the European Commission’s attempts to change the conversation by talking about mobile vaccine factories and technology transfer, the African Union leaders brought up the intellectual property waiver they are seeking in the WTO “Trips” agreement about which I was sceptical last week. However far the issue remains from resolution, it still isn’t going away, and the EU had to promise the AU another meeting in the spring with no doubt a great deal of painful communique-drafting to come.With regard to actual economic relations between the two continents (please skip lightly over my crude generalising here), it’s remarkable how the debate has shifted from endless talks of the geometry of preferential trading arrangements. Time was when the discussions were all about Economic Partnership Agreements (Epas) and Everything But Arms and tariffs and rules of origin and so on. Then it turned out that straight-up market access wasn’t really the problem with African economies selling into the EU so much as delivering the investment and growth that meant they would have something to sell. And there China often looks like a much better partner than Europe.Trade between the EU and Africa has stagnated for a decade despite highly preferential treatment for most of Africa’s exports. Meanwhile, internal rivalries undermined attempts to create blocs with critical mass. The EU agreed last year to implement bilaterally with Kenya a deal originally intended to encompass five countries in the East African Community, something of an admission of defeat. The EU’s problem now is that the trade-related areas African governments want to discuss, such as European investment in infrastructure to rival China, are issues where the EU has only weak collective ability to act. Trade policy isn’t mainly about trade deals any more, and this is a clear example of why.Now could be a good time to forswear the demon drink. British pub groups have warned of a looming escalation in beer prices owing to the increase in the cost of the raw ingredients — the price of malting barley, the most important element of lager, have more than doubled in the past year.It is an international problem, compounded by snarl-ups in global supply chains. The problem for retailers — including pub landlords — is how much of the extra cost to pass on to their customers. They may of course welcome a stiff drink — whatever the price — to alleviate the misery of escalating inflation more generally.China’s shoppers are switching to local brands, a trend with big implications for global supply chains.The transport company Flexport’s regular indicator of timeliness in delivering shipping containers shows no sign of improvement, indicating that the supply chain crunch continues.Exports of Mexican avocados to the US will resume after threats to an American inspector temporarily halted sales.Australia is expecting a surge of tourists as it admits double-vaccinated travellers for the first time in two years.
271  Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden have accepted “the principle” of a summit to ease tensions over Ukraine, the White House and French presidency said, capping a series of increasingly urgent diplomatic efforts led by Emmanuel Macron to defuse the crisis.The possibility of a meeting between the Russian and US presidents follows days of rising fears that Moscow will launch a full invasion of Ukraine. These concerns were heightened over the weekend when Belarus said 30,000 Russian troops participating in joint drills would stay in the country indefinitely.The Kremlin said on Monday that there were “no concrete plans” for such a meeting, but did not rule out the option. “It is too early to speak of any concrete plans to arrange some sort of summit,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. But he added: “A meeting is possible if the heads of state decide it is useful.”Instead, he pointed to a potential meeting between Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, and Sergei Lavrov, Russian foreign minister. “We understand that this week a meeting of Lavrov and his US counterpart is possible. Also, we do not exclude the possibility of ministers of France and Russia,” Peskov said. Putin is due to address a session of Russia’s security council on Monday.Moscow has massed as many as 190,000 troops on Ukraine’s borders, including those participating in the Belarus drills, despite previously pledging they would return to base.Macron spoke to Russia’s leader in two lengthy phone calls on Sunday, in what a French official described as “part of the last possible and necessary efforts to avoid a major conflict”. He also spoke separately with Biden.After those conversations, the French presidency said Macron had proposed a “summit to be held between President Biden and President Putin and then with relevant stakeholders to discuss security and strategic stability in Europe”.It added that the substance would be prepared during a meeting between Blinken and Lavrov set for Thursday.The summit could “only be held at the condition that Russia does not invade Ukraine”, according to the statement from the Elysée. A French official said the French statement on the summit was seen by both Moscow and Washington before it was published.The White House said: “President Biden accepted in principle a meeting with President Putin following that engagement [between Lavrov and Blinken], again, if an invasion hasn’t happened.”A Biden administration official separately told the Financial Times that the format and timing of a possible Biden-Putin summit remained “to be determined” and it was “all completely notional”.France said Putin had also agreed to a trilateral meeting on Monday between Russia, Ukraine and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe to enforce the ceasefire on the 500km “contact line” in eastern Ukraine.The conflict between Russia-backed separatists and government forces in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine has escalated in recent days. The separatists have accused Ukrainian troops of breaching the ceasefire and ordered an evacuation of civilians, a move Kyiv and its western allies said could be a pretext for a Russian invasion. Kyiv has reported heavy shelling on its positions on the frontline.The Kremlin earlier said Putin “recognised the importance” of finding a diplomatic solution to the crisis “through the foreign ministries and political advisers of the Normandy format countries”, a reference to Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France.“It falls upon these contacts to ensure the ceasefire is restored and progress in regulating the Donbas conflict is made,” it said, without confirming any specific agreement on more talks.Putin blamed clashes in eastern Ukraine on “provocations by Ukrainian security forces”, as Washington accused Moscow of creating false pretexts for an attack.Belarus’s defence minister Viktor Khrenin said on Sunday that Putin and Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, made the decision to extend the drills for an unspecified period because of “increasing military activity on [the countries’] eastern borders and the worsening situation in the Donbas”.Blinken said Washington believed Putin had decided to invade Ukraine, but that diplomacy was still an option. Emphasising the US president’s willingness to talk to Russia’s leader, Blinken told CBS: “Even if the die is cast, until it’s settled, until we know that the tanks are rolling, the planes are flying and the aggression has fully begun, we’re going to do everything we can to prevent it.”He added: “But we’re prepared either way, and we’re prepared with a response that will have massive consequences for Russia if it actually carries this through.”The US embassy in Moscow warned Americans in Russia on Sunday to prepare evacuation plans.Peskov told state television that “tensions have been ramped up to the maximum [on] the contact line” in the Donbas. “Any spark, any unplanned event or minor provocation could lead to irreversible consequences,” he said.But Peskov said western claims that Russia was planning an imminent invasion were “provocative” and “could have disastrous results”. He repeated Putin’s denials that Russia would attack Ukraine.“Russia, which has lived through so many wars, is the last country in Europe that wants to so much as say the word ‘war’ aloud,” he said.Additional reporting by Jasmine Cameron-Chileshe in London
272  Good morning and welcome to another cliffhanger week of diplomacy and worst-case scenario preparations on Russia and Ukraine.Following the latest diplomatic efforts led by Emmanuel Macron, the White House and French presidency said overnight that Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden had accepted the “principle” of a summit to discuss Ukraine. There has not yet been any confirmation of the proposed summit from the Kremlin.The economic impact of a protracted conflict — or even just the threat thereof — on the EU’s post-pandemic recovery is likely to feature prominently at the informal meeting of finance ministers in Paris later this week. We’ll bring you the latest, including what eurogroup chief Paschal Donohoe had to say on the economic outlook.With 30,000 Russian troops set to stay indefinitely in Belarus and heavy shelling continuing over the weekend in Donbas, we’ll look at what EU foreign affairs ministers are likely to discuss today with their Ukrainian counterpart and why an extension of the old sanctions regime against Russia — rather than triggering the new package — may be on the cards.And with EU lawmakers starting to pore over individual pieces of legislation making up the EU Green Deal, I’ll run you through the areas of contention when it comes to saving energy by better insulating buildings.When finance ministers meet in Paris to discuss EU economic policy later this week, they will be uncomfortably aware of how rapidly the ground is shifting beneath their feet, writes Sam Fleming in Brussels.The threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the jolts this could deliver both to inflation and confidence, risk damaging the EU’s economic outlook at a time when the bloc is attempting to engineer a smooth transition away from the massive pandemic-related fiscal support packages.An example of the strains came on Friday, when Italy’s Prime Minister Mario Draghi unveiled an €8bn package to shield consumers from rising energy prices and support the auto industry.In an interview with the FT, Paschal Donohoe, Ireland’s finance minister and eurogroup president, said that while the euro area has “exceptionally low” unemployment and activity that is returning to pre-pandemic levels in many economies, “we are by no means yet out of the woods”.There is further to go to turn the rebound into “something that is really firm and really sustainable”, he said. That entails, among other things, “recognising the challenges of what can happen with security and what can happen with inflation”.The trick, he said, will be getting the balance right between “debt sustainability and continuing to support the recovery within our economies”.The European Commission’s take on how to handle this will come on March 2, when it puts out its fiscal guidance for 2023.The EU’s Stability and Growth Pact is due to be reimposed next year, after being suspended during the pandemic, but the commission is by no means planning to pursue a mechanistic reapplication of the rules given the massive debt blowouts that occurred over the past two years.Debt and deficit reduction will have to be both gradual and differentiated as countries begin their journeys away from vast public support. And having advocated supportive fiscal policy overall this year, the commission is now considering a shift to a more neutral stance.Donohoe observed the trend is already towards economies gradually reducing the “emergency levels of economic support” that were in place, pulling down fiscal deficits this year compared with last.Alongside the commission’s guidance comes the debate about whether to make more enduring changes to the Stability and Growth Pact after the transition year when it’s reapplied next year.While the commission is considering legislative proposals to achieve this, some of the more ambitious proposals come from Paris and Rome, which would like to have investments in green and digital projects carved out of deficit calculations.However, Christian Lindner, Germany’s finance minister, told the FT in an interview last week that he did not support the idea of a so-called golden rule, saying “everyone would end up having their own definition for investment.”Donohoe, who will help steer this debate in the eurogroup, said all ministers accept there is going to be a need for higher levels of investment in digital policy and the green transition. But when it comes to reform of the stability and growth pact to achieve these goals, “there is not a consensus in place at the moment”, he observed.Belarus’s announcement yesterday that the 30,000 Russian troops which took part in military exercises will stay indefinitely raised the temperature in the three Baltic states, which unlike Ukraine are EU and Nato members. Western leaders in Munich over the weekend warned of Moscow waging a disinformation war, including about allegedly withdrawing its troops. (More here)EU officials endlessly intone how much better prepared they are to impose sanctions on Russia than back in 2014 during the invasion of Crimea. But it’s another question deciding when exactly to impose the package, write Sam Fleming and Valentina Pop.At the Munich Security Conference, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky made the case for immediate action.“We don’t need your sanctions after the bombardment will happen and after our country will be fired at or after we will have no borders, or after we will have no economy,” he said.With heavy shelling continuing over the weekend in the Donbas region, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, is likely to urge EU ministers to act as he sits down with them in Brussels today.But the appetite of EU governments to discuss what constitutes an aggression worthy of triggering the sanctions package remains low, given that this is an area of disagreement (as we wrote here). Instead, the bloc could — initially at least — consider expanding the old sanctions regime.“We don’t have pre-emptive sanctions, so bad luck for them,” said one EU official familiar with the discussions. “But if the current level of provocations in the east [were to] escalate, we could use the existing sanctions related to the eastern Ukraine and enlarge them.”The EU has imposed sanctions against 185 individuals and 48 companies in response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea and hostilities in the Donbas region and more names could be added to that blacklist.As for the new sanctions package, detailed lists of companies and entities that would be targeted have now been prepared in close co-ordination with the US, UK and other allies. EU governments could convene rapidly to sign off on them, although the procedures may take longer than in the US, given the need for 27 member states to unanimously agree on the package.Amid anxiety in a number of member states about the economic pain that would be inflicted by the sanctions, Brussels has also started to examine ways of compensating sectors or countries that are most affected, officials said. That could go beyond preparations for potential interruptions in Russian gas supplies to cover other sectors that might be hit by the penalties — or by measures Moscow takes in response.Contingency planning also extends to the threat of a massive surge of refugees from Ukraine into bordering EU states, diplomats said, and for the potential for an escalation of cyber attacks on capitals.The ability of households to cope with rising energy bills and upcoming new obligations to insulate their buildings is shaping up to be the subject of fierce debates within the EU.Part of the EU’s Green Deal announced last year are tougher requirements for energy efficiency in buildings — seen as one of the easiest ways to save up on energy and thereby lower greenhouse gas emissions.But the current spike in energy prices and labour shortages may be throwing a spanner in the EU’s plans.The European parliament is traditionally an advocate of tougher and more binding requirements for governments in meeting their climate goals by 2030 — coupled with more generous handouts for low-income households.In his draft report seen by Europe Express, the lead MEP on the file, Denmark’s centre-left lawmaker Niels Fuglsang is calling for higher energy efficiency targets by 2030, which he argued will contribute to a reduction of the bloc’s dependence on fossil fuel imports. “When energy efficiency is increased by one per cent, gas imports decline by 2.6 per cent,” the draft report reads.Fuglsang is asking countries to increase their energy efficiency target to at least 43 per cent by 2030, compared to the proposal by the EU commission tabled in June, which floated a goal of 36 per cent.“We cannot afford to miss the 2030 target,” the report reads. “Therefore, the target must be binding for member states.”But not all MEPs are embracing Fuglsang’s tough stance. Centre-right MEP Pernille Weiss (also Danish), told Europe Express that given the large initial investments needed to insulate buildings and the current shortage of construction workers, it was important to aim for “realistic targets”. Her group, the European People’s party, is in favour of sticking to the commission’s target of 36 per cent.“EU governments have very different infrastructures, buildings and industries. It is very important that we respect these differences in order to make sure that we can reach the climate goals and prevent energy poverty,” Weiss saidand later this week
273  Addressing the European Parliament last week, the European Commission president proclaimed a “unity of purpose that is truly remarkable” within the EU in the face of Russian aggression on the Ukrainian borders. Yet even as Ursula von der Leyen spoke, a European court ruling was raising the stakes in a dangerous confrontation between her commission and one of its biggest member states that has the potential to undermine the EU’s agenda just as it seeks to present a united front to its adversaries.The European Court of Justice on Wednesday said that a new regulation seeking to protect the EU budget from rule of law violations by member states was legally solid. The move paves the way for Brussels to start withholding funding from countries including Poland — where a contested judicial overhaul has morphed into a fundamental challenge to the bloc’s legal order.For von der Leyen, who took over the commission just months before the Covid pandemic, the stand-off with Warsaw is proving to be one of the most treacherous issues she has been forced to address. Within the EU, she faces loud calls to take a hard line with Poland over what some believe to be an issue at the very core of the EU’s identity — the rule of law and judicial independence.Yet like her mentor, former German chancellor Angela Merkel, the commission president’s instincts incline more to the search for compromise, as she seeks to damp down a damaging legal and political battle that some have warned could ultimately pave the way to Poland exiting the EU. In recent days, there have been signs that Poland’s leaders are also now actively seeking to de-escalate the issue. Warsaw’s push for detente has been framed in part by the near and present danger in the east, where the Russian troop build-up on Ukraine’s border has put a premium on western unity.But Warsaw is also facing economic strains from rising energy prices and inflation, meaning it has become increasingly anxious to unlock Poland’s €36bn share of the EU’s Covid-19 recovery fund — a condition for which is judicial reform. Senior officials in Brussels privately welcome the tentative signs of a thaw coming from at least parts of the Polish political establishment, and on Wednesday Poland’s de facto leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, founder of the ruling party, said he was “optimistic” about resolving the dispute.The nagging fear in the EU remains, however, that Poland will fail to muster the domestic political consensus needed to push through anything other than narrowly targeted reforms to aspects of its heavily contested judicial overhaul. Absent a significant breakthrough, the feud still risks spilling over and disrupting the broader legislative business of the EU.“The rational step for Poland would be to wind down this rule of law conflict urgently — partly because of geopolitical reasons but also because they have so much money at stake,” says Petri Sarvamaa, a Finnish MEP from the centre-right EPP Group who helps lead its work on rule of law issues. “But they are still not doing enough.”Once seen as the EU’s greatest economic and political success story following the union’s eastern expansion, Poland has in recent years become its most disruptive member. At the core of its fractious battles with Brussels lies a project led by the conservative-nationalist Law and Justice Party (PiS) that has progressively subjugated the judiciary to the executive.This has involved efforts to neuter its constitutional court and the creation of a disciplinary chamber with the ability to punish judges for the content of their rulings, which critics say amounts to a tool for politicians to bend judges to their will.Brussels has responded with a series of infringement actions against Poland as well as a 2017 decision to open so-called Article 7 proceedings — the provision of the EU treaty that protects the bloc’s values against rule of law violations.Last year, relations between Warsaw and Brussels slumped to their lowest ebb since Poland’s accession in 2004. The country’s bid in May for a share of the €800bn NextGenerationEU recovery fund became snarled in Brussels, as the Polish government resisted calls for reforms to abolish the disciplinary chamber as part of the conditions attached to the plan.Then Brussels in September demanded the imposition of daily penalties on Poland for its failure to comply with court-ordered interim measures related to the disciplinary chamber.The decision, spearheaded by justice commissioner Didier Reynders and EU vice-president for values Vera Jourova, provoked deep anger within PiS, given that Poland had made a pledge during the summer to reform the chamber. “It destroyed the atmosphere,” recalled one senior Polish official.The depth of the bad blood towards the commission was laid bare during a November trip by Reynders to Warsaw, when Zbigniew Ziobro, justice minister, publicly presented him with pictures of a ruined Warsaw in the aftermath of the second world war.Reynders later told the FT that Ziobro had explained this was what Germany had done to his country. “My answer”, the commissioner said, was that since then “we have enlarged the European Union and we are now living in peace and democracy.” This, he added, involved “full respect for fundamental rights and the rule of law.”Reynders made it clear that he intended to continue applying unrelenting pressure on Poland to reform its judiciary and abide by European court judgments — including via the unprecedented step of deducting unpaid fines from EU budget payments.The framed photograph was still sitting on the floor of Reynders’s office when the FT visited last month, and the commissioner indicated he had no intention of mounting it on his wall, saying he preferred the portrait of Nelson Mandela that dominates his office.Finding a response to this rancorous stand-off has proven one of the most internally divisive topics faced by von der Leyen, and her internal critics say she has struggled to forge a coherent strategy. Her inclination has been to seek political space for compromise with Poland, rather than adopt the more confrontational posture that some commissioners have advocated.Germany’s CDU, from which both von der Leyen and Merkel hail, has trod a relatively emollient line on rule of law disputes in the union — an approach mirrored in Merkel’s handling of illiberal Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban. German relations with Poland have always been particularly sensitive, given their fraught history.While some senior commission officials pushed last autumn for the president to unleash the new conditionality mechanism against both Poland and Hungary, allowing EU funding to be interrupted because of rule of law violations, von der Leyen held back.Instead, she opted in November to dispatch an informal letter of inquiry to Poland and Hungary airing concerns about rule of law standards, triggering acute frustration in the European Parliament, which is still calling loudly and persistently for the commission to act. “Deep down, I don’t think von der Leyen wants to use [the mechanism],” says one EU official.To Brussels’ dismay, Poland’s constitutional tribunal declared in October that key elements of the union’s law were incompatible with its constitution, triggering fears that Poland’s Eurosceptic rightwing was setting the country on a path that could one day lead to exit from the EU.Nevertheless, at the urging of Merkel, von der Leyen continued to seek a political solution to the stand-off, working to find a way to strike a deal with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki over the recovery fund.When von der Leyen privately tested the appetite among senior commissioners for a deal on the recovery plan in late November, however, they warned that there was no evidence that the Polish government was fully committed to seeing through the judicial reforms necessary to unlock the funding.Hopes for a deal fizzled, to von der Leyen’s deep disappointment. “They genuinely believed it was feasible last year. The problem was Morawiecki’s lack of authority,” recalls an EU official.That dismay was mirrored in Warsaw, where Morawiecki, says the Polish official, felt he received too little support from the commission president. “He has a feeling that he paid a lot, and she doesn’t pay anything, but still expects we will find a solution,” the official said, adding that von der Leyen failed to appreciate how difficult the dynamics were within the Polish coalition government. “The situation has deteriorated week after week, and frankly we have lost control.”It was against this inauspicious backdrop that the mood in Warsaw appeared to abruptly change a few weeks ago.Andrzej Duda, Polish president, put forward a bill to scrap the disciplinary chamber for judges. Duda, an ally of PiS, pitched the overture as an effort to help the government unblock the billions of euros of recovery funding currently being withheld by Brussels. But amid mounting tensions in Ukraine, he also argued that Poland needed to improve relations with its allies.“I am deciding to do this to give the government a tool to end the fight, because a fight with the European Commission is not what Poland needs at the moment,” he said. Government officials echo his arguments.“The most important thing in foreign policy is to preserve the security of our community and our own countries.This discussion with the European institutions is a kind of family dispute,” said Marcin Przydacz, Poland’s deputy foreign minister. “The reform needs to be continued. The previous one was not perfect. Second, we need to concentrate on security issues. And third, we need to have better relations with the European institutions.”Rather than simply backing Duda’s proposals, PiS MPs a few days later put forward changes of their own, which they claimed addressed EU concerns about the chamber’s independence. These include moving the power to discipline judges to newly formed randomly selected panels of Supreme Court judges.The bill also provides for judges disciplined for the content of their rulings to be reinstated except in cases where rulings were the result of “serious and totally inexcusable forms of conduct on the part of the judge”.In Brussels the offers by Duda and the PiS were greeted as the most promising proposals from Poland in many months, with one official spying “a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel”.The fact that Poland had finally put down concrete and detailed proposals was enough for officials from both sides to re-engage in technical talks last week, after they were previously halted.Yet neither of the offers addresses the full suite of conditions the commission wishes to see Poland fulfil in order to access the recovery fund, much less the EU’s broader concerns about other changes — such as to the National Council of the Judiciary — that have given politicians greater influence over the judiciary. And whether either bill has any chance of becoming law depends on Poland’s fractious politics.PiS’s hardline junior coalition partner, United Poland, led by Ziobro, seems unlikely to back either proposal, neither of which was discussed with it before being presented.In a sign of the mutinous mood in United Poland, one MEP, Patryk Jaki, published a YouTube video questioning whether Duda’s move amounted to “betrayal” and admitting that he was now “ashamed” to have voted for him.United Poland has also made little secret of its reservations about PiS’s proposals. In a statement, it said that it was analysing whether they amounted “to the realisation of the illegal demands of EU institutions”.Many in Warsaw remain sceptical that Brussels will ultimately budge when it comes to the blocked recovery fund. Some believe Poland could remove the EU’s leverage by withdrawing from bidding for the recovery fund altogether, saying it would now struggle to spend the money before the deadlines set by the EU.Yet officials in Brussels still think Poland is sufficiently desperate for the recovery fund cash that it will forge a compromise. “It’s really hurting the [Polish] government that they’re not getting this money from the EU,” argues one official.The hurdles to a deal are in some ways lower now than they were last year. If Poland had landed on a deal last year it would have unlocked a big wedge of recovery fund pre-financing that was not subject to any of the rule of law conditions the commission was insisting upon.With the arrival of 2022, however, pre-financing is no longer available. That means that the commission could strike a symbolically positive deal on the Polish recovery fund and still withhold any actual payments until Warsaw proves it can deliver on its rule of law pledges.Meanwhile, many diplomats suspect the commission will continue to hold back from deploying the rule of law conditionality mechanism against Poland in the short term, preferring instead to bring its first ever case under the new law against Hungary as soon as next month.That is partly because the grounds for proceeding against Hungary are easier to establish given the longstanding corruption allegations against the country, and the commission is anxious not to flub its first-ever use of the mechanism and find its case rejected in the court.Despite the whiff of detente in the air, many EU officials remain deeply sceptical that Poland’s political establishment is ready to embrace serious judicial reforms.The far-reaching nature of the EU’s concerns is set to be aired once again this coming week in the council of ministers, where the longstanding Article 7 proceedings against Poland will once again be litigated.What Poland proposed “does not seem to fully meet the demands of the ECJ, even if it is an important step forward,” warns one EU diplomat.In a sign of their continued determination to fight back against the EU’s demands, Ziobro and his allies have been pushing for the Polish government to veto EU measures which require unanimity, including a plan to send a part of the funds from the EU’s emissions trading scheme directly to the EU’s budget.Ziobro also told the FT last year that he would urge the government to suspend payments to the EU’s common budget if the EU “escalated” the stand-off with Poland — although that threat was widely dismissed in Brussels given Poland is such a big beneficiary of EU cash.Without support from United Poland, PiS would need to rely on the support of MPs from opposition parties to force a judicial reform bill through parliament. But passing a bill on the judiciary over the protests of Ziobro’s party would raise questions about the future of the coalition.It is for this reason that some EU officials see the current thaw between Brussels and Poland as being only a limited reprieve, rather than the basis for a properly worked-through strategy to bury the deeper differences between the two sides.“The Polish government had ample time during the Article 7 procedure and following the ECJ cases to bring their laws in line with their EU commitments, but they didn’t,” said the EU diplomat. “So why might Warsaw want to move now? They want the EU money, and the situation in Ukraine gives them some political cover.”Additional reporting by Henry Foy in Brussels
274  President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has hailed the recent period of calm in the Turkish lira as a sign that the economy is about to enter the “strongest period in the history of Turkey”.That bold declaration comes after Erdogan, a staunch opponent of high interest rates, triggered a collapse in the currency at the end of last year when he ordered the central bank to aggressively cut borrowing costs despite soaring inflation.Emergency measures — including a multibillion-dollar backdoor intervention by the central bank — have helped to restore calm in the currency markets. But inflation continues to climb, reaching almost 50 per cent in January, and it is unclear if the lira stability can last.Some political analysts believe the Turkish president is simply trying to muddle through until he can call an early election — bringing forward parliamentary and presidential votes scheduled for June 2023 — in the hope of securing another five years in office.“Holding things steady for a campaign period might be all he needs to win,” said Alp Coker, head of the Turkey desk at the London-based consultancy GPW. “Short-term solutions can work politically. It doesn’t need to work for a long time for it to translate into political success.”Here are five key things that must go Erdogan’s way if he is to keep the lira steady in the coming months.Turkish authorities are gambling on turning the country’s chronic imbalance between exports and imports, which sucks foreign currency out of the country and puts pressure on the lira, into a surplus.That requires limited consumer demand at home — something Erdogan may be unwilling to tolerate if he wants to pump up the economy ahead of elections. It also needs strong tourism revenues this summer and the avoidance of further escalation in tensions between Ukraine and Russia.A conflict could cause a sharp rise in the price of energy, a key component of Turkey’s import bill.Some analysts are sceptical, but Ugras Ulku, of the Washington-based Institute of International Finance, predicts that Turkey will run a $4bn surplus this year — compared with deficits of $15bn in 2021 and $36bn in 2020 — thanks to limited imports and booming exports and tourism. “We project that tourism revenues will recover fully to 2019 levels,” he said.At times of turmoil, Turks often prefer to keep their savings in accounts denominated in dollars, euros and precious metals — a phenomenon known as dollarisation that has been a source of pressure on the lira. At the end of last year, 64 per cent of all deposits in the banking system were in foreign currency or precious metals, according to central bank data.That figure has fallen to 60 per cent after the launch of a savings scheme, unveiled in December, that promises to protect savers against exchange rate losses if they convert their dollar and euro holdings into lira. About $13.7bn out of foreign currency savings had been switched by February 14, according to data from the country’s banking regulator. That has helped to bolster the national currency and bring down total foreign currency deposits from about $264bn at the end of last year to about $251bn.Will that trend continue if, as analysts expect, inflation tops 50 per cent in the months ahead and stays at that level for much of the year? “I’m expecting the volumes to grow, but for them to taper off over the coming months as inflation continues to be very high,” said Phoenix Kalen, global head of emerging markets research at the French bank Société Générale.With average deposit rates standing at 17 per cent in mid-February, the value of savers’ money still faces severe erosion once inflation is taken into account. While the government predicts that inflation will fall to single digits next year, Kalen warns that there is a strong risk that the government will “grossly exceed its inflation forecast”.Erdogan argues that his “new economic model” will attract foreign direct investment that will bring hard currency into the country. Even with rock bottom valuations, western investors who have traditionally been the strongest source of FDI into Turkey remain hesitant due to concerns about the country’s economic management and the rule of law.However, a recent diplomatic thaw with the United Arab Emirates came with a promise of a $10bn investment from the Gulf nation. Last month, the UAE struck a $5bn swap agreement with Turkey that bolstered the headline reserves of the country’s central bank.Ankara hopes that a drive for détentes with other regional nations, including Saudi Arabia, Israel and Armenia, will provide a further boost to trade and investment. But GPW’s Coker warned that there had not been any sign of “frenzied dealmaking to buy up Turkish assets” as yet.Turkey is, to some extent, sheltered from volatility in global equity and bond markets because flighty portfolio money, which can be pulled out at a moment’s notice, has largely already left. But the country is still reliant on foreign finance for its banks and corporate sector. It has close to $170bn in external debt coming due in the next 12 months.If the US Federal Reserve starts raising interest rates next month and ending its programme of asset purchases as some analysts predict, this would “increase the challenges” of rolling over that borrowing, said Selva Demiralp, professor of economics at Istanbul’s Koc University.If companies and banks have to repay foreign debt, rather than having it extended, that would create demand for foreign currency and put renewed pressure on the lira. Demiralp believes, however, that the Fed may end up being less hawkish than markets fear. “Three [interest rate] hikes in 2022, as opposed to six to seven hikes, would clearly be good news for Turkey, which is already sitting on a fragile equilibrium,” she said.At least some of the recent stability in the lira is thanks to intervention by the central bank, which sells dollars and buys lira at times of turmoil in a bid to bolster the local currency.While Turkey’s headline gross reserves have shown a marked improvement in recent weeks, net reserves are still deeply negative once money borrowed through swap agreements with domestic lenders and international central banks is stripped out — standing at about minus $50bn on February 16, according to Goldman Sachs. That means limited firepower for further interventions. A current account surplus and continued de-dollarisation would help the bank build up its war chest.But if those things fail to materialise, the central bank could struggle. “How far can they keep going with negative net reserves? Of course, it depends on the flows in the markets,” said Ugur Gurses, an economics commentator and former central bank official. “But it’s a kind of a gamble.If you deduct swaps and gold, they’ve got a very small amount of reserves left in their pockets.”
275  It is tempting to pin the recent volatility in markets only on the fluidity of the Russia-Ukraine situation.After all, every day we seem to get competing indications of a stand-off that confronts Europe with the highest possibility of an armed conflict with Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union.After an initial flurry of activity, markets settled into mostly trading the conflict within a range bounded by the hope of an eventual diplomatic resolution and the more protracted period of “no peace and no war”.This has accounted for most of the daily volatility in the main US stock indices in the past few weeks when we have seen swings of 0 to 1.5 per cent. The stronger moves occurred when markets sensed the possibility of a decisive move towards one of these bookends.After all, depending on which scenario is in play, the global economy would either benefit from a sharp reduction in commodity prices or, at the other end, deal with a major stagflationary shock.But this should not blind us to two important structural issues that will be with us for a while, almost regardless of how the conflict plays out.First, markets are losing the anchor of abundant and predictable liquidity provided by central banks. This unifying theme proved an extremely powerful driver to repress volatility, insulating markets from a wide range of worries while driving asset values higher.With a US Federal Reserve belatedly seeking to tackle high and persistent inflation, markets must now navigate a fundamental shift in their liquidity regime. This involves not only higher interest rates but also a contraction in the Fed’s $9tn balance sheet.Equity valuations may be more attractive than they were a few weeks ago but have not reached the level needed to constitute an obvious standalone and generalised investment case to buy stocks.This is not to say that markets are without anchors. Solid corporate earnings and behavioural conditioning of investors tempted to ‘buy the dip’ are still in play. But these are inherently less strong and highly sensitive to the Fed being able to deliver an economic soft-landing.The likelihood of this has been significantly undermined by the extent to which the Fed first mischaracterised inflation and then dithered in adjusting policies. Even today with 7.5 per cent consumer price inflation, the Fed is still injecting liquidity into the economy.I would estimate the probability of a comfortable soft landing for the economy and markets over the next 12 months at 10 per cent, well below three other macroeconomic scenarios.One is that economic growth is severely damaged by a late Fed that is forced into slamming on the policy brakes in response to persistently high inflation (40 per cent probability). Another is a Fed that gives up for now on its inflation objective in the hope that exogenous favourable developments will emerge such as a productivity surge or fast-healing supply chains, helping to accommodate rising labour costs (30 per cent). A third scenario is stagflation (20 per cent), the most worrisome outcome for livelihoods, financial stability and policy effectiveness.The second structural factor overhanging markets is the structural erosion of market liquidity.The past decade has seen a significant reduction in the risk absorption capacity of markets as intermediaries have been both less able and less willing to expose their balance sheets. This has coincided with an enormous expansion in the size of asset holders who deal through those intermediaries.As such, this mismatch in supply and demand can lead to big market moves. or ‘price gapping’, whenever there is a change in conventional wisdom, a phenomenon that has been visible not only for individual stocks but also for other market segments.Now lacking a strong unifying theme and navigating a wide range of potential macro scenarios without a first best Fed policy option, stocks will remain sensitive not just to the vagaries of the news on Russia-Ukraine, but also other factors such as competing remarks by central bankers and data releases that are significantly different from the median forecast.This requires investors to anticipate more unsettling volatility and have a strong stomach for dealing with it (remember, many of the major investment mistakes occur at such times).It also warrants favouring individual name selection over indices, and subjecting holdings to granular quality reviews on a much higher frequency basis than has been warranted in recent years.
276  Five energy groups are suing four European governments for almost €4bn over the stymying of coal, oil and gas projects as climate change concerns rise, using a secretive process based on an international energy treaty.Energy and exploration companies including Germany’s RWE and Uniper and the UK’s Rockhopper have launched cases against the Netherlands, Italy, Poland and Slovenia under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT).The active cases revolve around the decisions by the relevant governments to either mandate the closure of coal power plants, prevent the development of specific projects, or require an environmental impact assessment.RWE said it endorsed “the importance of the energy transition” but “does not consider it right” that the Dutch coal phaseout “does not provide for compensation for the disruption to the company’s property”.Uniper said its “first concern” was “to obtain legal clarity” about having to close its coal power plant early without adequate compensation. Rockhopper declined to comment.The ECT, crafted after the cold war and signed by more than 50 countries, was intended to protect international energy investments by foreign companies or individuals. This protection extends to fossil fuel projects and climate change experts say it discourages governments from making policies to wind down the industries behind global warming owing to the risk of legal action.The various companies are seeking an estimated €3.7bn in compensation in the five cases, according to documents reviewed by the Financial Times. A sixth case, for an unknown sum, was brought against Romania by the Austria-based Petrochemical Holding over a petroleum development contract.Petrochemical Holding legal counsel Andrew Savage, a partner at global law firm McDermott Will & Emery, warned Romania’s “stated desire to move away from fossil fuels.may lead to further claims”.Climate experts rang the alarm about the treaty becoming an obstacle to curbing projects that lead to global warming in an open letter more than two years ago.Dmitri Evseev, a partner at law firm Arnold & Porter, agreed that the legal action “may have a chilling effect, undoubtedly, on all kinds of policy change”. “Investor-state arbitration is the biggest stick that investors have,” he said.The German finance ministry warned the chancellor’s office in 2019 that using regulation to phase out coal would create an “increased risk of litigation, especially international litigation based on the ECT”, according to an email seen by the FT.When the Dutch minister and state-secretary of economic affairs and climate were asked last year about accelerating the decommissioning of coal and gas fired power stations, they said “further intervention in the coal sector entails major legal risks in the context of pending claims”.One of the lawyers representing Italy in the case brought by Rockhopper — after the state’s refusal to permit the development of the Ombrina Mare oilfield in the Adriatic Sea — said a defeat would be “extremely serious”, as it would give other companies “the desire to emulate Rockhopper”.The active cases add to mounting global climate litigation involving both public and private sectors. But ECT cases are often shrouded in secrecy, with documents rarely made public. The secretariat website notes that “some awards (and even the existence of some proceedings) remain confidential”.The cost of bringing or defending a case related to the treaty can run into the millions, with some complaints financed by specialist litigation funders in return for a share of any damages. The compensation sought by investors can include estimated future lost profits.A 2021 report by the International Institute for Sustainable Development found that “the majority of known fossil fuel [investor-state dispute] cases are decided in favour of investors”.Talks to “modernise” the treaty are under way. The European Commission has submitted a proposal that would see protections for fossil fuel investments phased out, which so far has been rejected by other signatory countries.EU member states that remain reliant on fossil fuels, including Poland, are pushing the commission to leave the treaty if the debate is not resolved. “The EU needs to have a set of well-prepared options for a possible EU exit from the ECT,” wrote Poland’s minister for climate and environment, Michał Kurtyka, in a letter seen by the FT and sent to the EU’s climate policy chief Frans Timmermans last year.However, countries that withdraw from the treaty remain bound by it for 20 years under the agreement’s so-called “sunset clause”.
277  Russia’s threats to invade Ukraine are forcing China to strike a balance between President Xi Jinping’s growing support for Vladimir Putin and Beijing’s self-interest in the region’s stability, according to analysts.The crisis, sparked by Putin’s decision to concentrate 190,000 Russian troops near the Ukraine border, remains volatile. Putin and Joe Biden have accepted “the principle” of a summit to ease tensions over Ukraine following warnings from the US president that Russia could invade within “several days”.China joined Russia this month in opposing Nato expansion, highlighting a new level of co-operation between Xi and Putin.But Wang Yi, China’s foreign minister, told a European security conference on Saturday that “the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of any country should be respected”.“We hope that a solution can be found through dialogue and consultation that will really guarantee security and stability in Europe,” he added.His remarks reflected a change from late January, when he offered support for Russia in its stand-off with the US and Nato over Ukraine, saying Moscow had “reasonable security concerns”.Wang’s tone departed, too, from his own ministry, which has lambasted Biden for stoking tensions.Beijing, according to one senior international relations academic at a top Chinese university, must “strike a balance” in supporting Moscow while also not damaging its own military and economic ties with Ukraine.“There is a common misunderstanding among western media — and even some western officials — that China supports a Russian invasion of Ukraine. That is fictitious,” said the academic, who asked not to be named. “Any military conflict, especially large-scale war, will undoubtedly hurt China’s interests there.”Wang’s attempt to appear neutral, however, will be tested if the west imposes financial sanctions on Russia.“China’s decision either to adhere to new western sanctions or to help Russia avoid them will shape escalation pathways and determine the magnitude of economic and political isolation that sanctions impose,” Chris Miller, director of the Eurasia programme at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, a US think-tank, wrote in a report.Analysts said China would seek to separate pushback against the US and Nato, on which it openly supports Russia, from its reservations about a potential violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty.“China’s and Russia’s support for each other is strongest when they are challenging US supremacy because that’s where their interests are most aligned. When it comes to territorial claims, both have been displaying a rather ambivalent stance towards each other’s behaviour,” said Alexander Korolev, an expert on the Russia-China security relationship at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.China’s interests in Ukraine include billions of dollars in construction contracts as well as telecommunication investments via Huawei and its purchase of Ukrainian military equipment.Beijing has urged Kyiv and Moscow to revive the stalled Minsk agreement as a path to peace while insisting on adhering to its own policy of non-interference.Experts diverged over whether Beijing, which has been increasingly inward-focused since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, would seek a higher profile diplomatic role in defusing the tensions, or would stand by as Putin edged closer towards an armed conflict.The possibility that Russia would launch a full invasion of Ukraine has also presented China with a “gift” to increase its leverage over Moscow, strengthen its energy security, test the west’s sanctions regime and take advantage of a splintering Europe, said resource and geopolitical analysts.“Russia does not give access to its resources very easily, [but] here China has leverage to say ‘we want to own this’, rather than to simply finance or pay for it,” said Gavin Thompson, an Asia energy expert at consultancy Wood Mackenzie.Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis could also deepen Moscow’s dependence on Beijing, while their success or failure would be instructive to Xi for future conflicts with the US, experts said.“If they succeed in imposing severe costs on Russia, western sanctions threats against China — which could be used in case of a crisis in Asia — would be more credible,” said Miller. “[But] if China helped Russia mitigate the impact of these sanctions, the US would lose an important tool and its ability to constrain China using economic means would be reduced.”When Xi and Putin met in Beijing earlier this month, the leaders also agreed to increase Russian gas supplies to China.Thompson believed that the US might find it “very difficult” to target resources shipped directly from Russia to China.“I think they feel quite bulletproof when it comes to those deals,” Thompson said of Russia’s energy arrangements with its neighbour. “If you can’t touch it and the pricing and the payment structures are mostly outside the standard global banking system, outside of the US dollar system, you can’t really do very much about it.”There is little transparency over the arrangement’s terms, but experts believe Sino-Russian energy deals have previously entailed Chinese loans and credit facilities. Typically, China lends in renminbi, which Russia then uses to purchase Chinese goods and services.“[China has] the opportunity to do great deals.I think that is the opportunity to push hard on equity ownership of resources,” Thompson said.Cao Xin, secretary-general of the International Public Opinion Research Center of the Charhar Institute, a Beijing think-tank, said he believed a Russian invasion remained “highly unlikely” but that Moscow appeared to be exploiting fissures between the US and Europe’s big powers to sow divisions in Nato.Korolev said conflicting interests in their immediate neighbourhoods had not undermined the partnership between Beijing and Moscow, as the countries had pragmatically navigated related crises such as Russia’s armed intervention in Georgia in 2008 and its aggression in Ukraine in 2014.“China avoided openly voicing support of Russian actions, but they did not directly oppose or criticise Russia either,” he said.Additional reporting by Maiqi Ding in Beijing
278  Britain and the EU will on Monday agree at a key “stocktaking meeting” to keep talking on reforms to post-Brexit trade rules with Northern Ireland, as both sides try to avoid splits during the Ukraine crisis.Months of negotiations on the so-called Northern Ireland protocol have yielded little progress, prompting speculation that Boris Johnson, UK prime minister, could soon suspend parts of the accord to curry favour with Eurosceptic Tory MPs.But Liz Truss, UK foreign secretary, will tell a meeting in Brussels that she wants to settle the row to allow both sides “to focus on building a stronger relationship and focus on external issues, not least the situation in eastern Europe and standing up to Russian aggression”.The “joint committee” — a forum including the UK, the European Commission and EU member states set up to monitor the Brexit agreement — is meeting for the first time since June 2021.The meeting will note some limited progress in talks to simplify post-Brexit trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but will acknowledge that big gaps remain. “It won’t be a breakthrough or breakdown,” said one EU diplomat.The stand-off over the protocol has triggered speculation in Brussels and Whitehall that Johnson will soon deploy Article 16, the safeguard clause of the agreement, allowing him to suspend some parts of the deal.Contingency planning has been stepped up in London for such an outcome, including likely trade retaliation by the EU. The US has also warned of trade repercussions if Article 16 is activated, although the UK insists Washington is not linking discussions on steel tariffs to Northern Ireland trading rules.But Johnson is under pressure from the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory MPs to suspend the protocol, which was agreed in order to avoid the return of a north-south trade border on the island of Ireland and left Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods.Iain Duncan Smith, former Tory leader, tweeted on Sunday: “Time to call time on the Northern Ireland Protocol. Two years after we formally left the EU, the Protocol still gives Brussels a hold over wider UK policymaking. It’s divisive, restrictive and is causing real harm to the local economy.”EU diplomats fear that Johnson may cede to that pressure, particularly if the Metropolitan Police fine him for breaching Covid rules in the so-called “partygate” affair, putting his leadership under renewed scrutiny.“It wouldn’t surprise us. Johnson will do anything to stay in power,” said one diplomat.An alternative UK strategy could be to request further delays to instigating full checks on goods from July while continuing talks. The EU would have to decide to refuse or restart legal proceedings for the UK’s failure to implement the protocol.British government officials admit that there has been “increasing chatter” about Article 16 and that Northern Ireland’s pro-UK Democratic Unionist Party, which opposes the protocol, has been urging the ERG to push Johnson to put it into abeyance.One Tory official said there was “no imminent move” towards using Article 16. The official added: “Nobody is expecting all that much from Monday’s meeting but that obviously doesn’t necessarily mean Article 16 is inevitable.”The only concrete achievement after months of UK-EU talks has been to ensure free circulation of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland after Brussels agreed to change its rules to allow UK regulators to approve them.The two moved some way to converging their positions on customs formalities, but large gaps remain on the sensitive issue of checks on food, and animals and plants.
279  Nato members have held back from supplying offensive military support to Ukraine for fear of provoking Russia. That may be about to change.Western countries, including the US and UK, have already provided Kyiv with training and defensive NLAW and Javelin anti-tank weapons as well as Stinger anti-aircraft missile systems to help deter a Russian attack. They are now weighing how to support Ukrainian resistance forces if Russia decides to further invade or continue intimidating its neighbour, according to western officials.“If Russian pressure is prolonged, we will need to take a very different approach to what we have done so far and look hard at how to manage that confrontation as part of an enduring process,” said one senior western official.Washington estimates Russia has massed between 150,00 and 190,000 troops on Ukraine’s borders, who, combined with missiles and air cover, could quickly overrun Ukraine’s 261,000 active personnel.But a well-supported resistance would make a Russian occupation prohibitively costly and Nato allies hope that such a prospect could shift President Vladimir Putin’s calculus against launching a full-scale invasion.It was in the west’s “collective interest that Russia should ultimately fail and be seen to fail” if it launched a full-scale invasion, UK prime minister Boris Johnson told the Munich Security Conference on Saturday.“A lightning war would be followed by a long and hideous period of reprisals and revenge and insurgency,” he added. “If Ukraine is overrun by brute force, I fail to see how a country encompassing nearly a quarter of a million square miles.could then be held down.”Johnson held talks with his counterparts from Latvia and Estonia, where they “agreed to continue working together to impose a significant cost on Russia should [it] decide to further violate Ukraine’s sovereignty”.US defence secretary Lloyd Austin and General Mark Milley, chair of the joint chiefs of staff, have already warned their Russian counterparts that an invasion would be followed by an insurgency like the one that drove the Soviet Union out of Afghanistan, the New York Times reported last week. Biden administration officials have also told allies the CIA and Pentagon would help any Ukrainian insurgency with covert and overt aid.Two people close to the Kremlin told the Financial Times the military cost of an occupation was already so obvious that claims by US and UK intelligence that a Russian invasion was imminent was evidence of western “hysteria”.“Nobody thinks Ukraine is something you can just grab,” said one senior former Kremlin official. “It’d be very unpopular domestically because so many people have relatives there, and you can’t hold the territory because of partisan warfare.”Ruslan Pukhov, director of the Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, a Moscow-based defence think-tank, said Russia would likely stick to “managed escalation” in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas, ravaged by a conflict with Moscow-backed separatists since 2014 and Russia’s annexation of Crimea.“I don’t believe in a large-scale military campaign,” Pukhov said. “It’s not clear what [Russia] would get out of a campaign involving taking territory other than more problems.”Unless Moscow extensively co-opts local collaborators, occupying the entire country would require 20 Russian combatants for every 1,000 Ukrainians, equivalent to a force of almost 900,000, according to a 1996 Rand study.Recent polls also indicate that while most Russians believe the west is to blame for the current tensions, they have little appetite for war. Their Ukrainian relatives would also get caught in the crossfire if Russia used the brutal counter-insurgency tactics it employed in Syria and Chechnya.“In Aleppo and Grozny, Russian forces could reduce the towns to rubble, plant a flag on top and declare victory,” said Mark Galeotti, a Russia military expert. “But Ukraine is a brother country.”Ukraine has a long history of resistance movements, and the government passed a law last year for “total national defence” that gave special operations command responsibility for organising resistance forces.Nationalist insurgents fought Soviet forces in the west of the country until 1949. Much of the fighting against Russia-backed separatists in the Donbas was also undertaken by volunteer battalions, who notched up some battleground victories and have since been incorporated into the national guard.“The resistance in Kyiv would be huge,” said Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian defence minister and director of the Centre for Defence Strategies think-tank.Ukraine would rely on three levels of defence: regular armed forces complemented by the national and border guards, territorial defence forces organised into 150 battalions led by military officers, and neighbourhood civil defence units. Kyiv estimates Ukrainian households have 1mn firearms, many of them hunting rifles but also semi-automatic weapons.Ukrainian army units had been trained for guerrilla warfare, with small groups of 20 to 50 troops using “mosquito” tactics of attack, Zagorodnyuk said.Nato allies, which have long experience of training and equipping missions from Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq, have also increased military aid.Over the past year, the Biden administration has approved about $850mn in military equipment for Kyiv. Among Nato allies, the Netherlands last week authorised delivery to Kyiv of protective military equipment as well as sniper rifles, while Canada delivered machine guns, night vision and surveillance devices.Even so, sustaining a resistance movement is difficult, analysts caution, and carries significant risk to human life and of a wider conflict between Nato and Russia.Western special forces have been in Donbas for several years, said a Ukrainian military intelligence officer, acting as frontline observers to study Russian tactics and help Ukrainian forces with targeting. Support for an insurgency would imply deeper involvement.Insurgents could receive training and shelter across Ukraine’s borders with Romania, Slovakia and Poland. In turn, Moscow could interpret every insurgent operation as Nato aggression, which could lead to further escalation, especially if a border incident occurs, according to Emily Harding, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Another complication is eastern Ukraine’s open terrain, which makes it ill-suited to guerrilla warfare. The cost to life may also render resistance futile.“There has been a lot of talk about Ukrainian resistance — a gun in every window,” Samuel Cranny-Evans, an analyst at the Royal United Services Institute, told UK MPs this month. “But given that we have seen what Russian counter-insurgency looks like in Syria and Chechnya.that eventuality should be treated with some level of concern because it would be potentially a humanitarian disaster.”
280  Merkel was talking after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Now the US and British governments are warning that Putin is poised to start “the biggest war in Europe since 1945” by launching a much more extensive invasion of Ukraine, involving a direct assault on its capital, Kyiv.This weekend, much of the western security and political elite was gathered in Germany for the Munich Security Conference. Alongside the tension and foreboding, one of the dominant emotions on display was simple incredulity. Many diplomats and politicians, predominantly Europeans, still refused to believe the intelligence-based briefings pouring out of the Anglosphere. The sceptics’ view was broadly that fighting would remain confined to eastern Ukraine. They speculate that Putin’s goal is to build political, economic and psychological pressure to the point where the Ukrainian government collapses: or the west makes massive diplomatic concessions.There is a different sort of incredulity among those who are convinced that Putin is about to “go big” and launch a full-scale, bloody invasion, aimed at overthrowing the Ukrainian government. One senior policymaker said that, in the midst of a conversation with his US counterpart about impending war: “We both paused and said, ‘I can’t believe we’re having this conversation’.” Those conversations do indeed contain mind-boggling and distressing scenarios. Western officials believe that if the Russian military attacks or surrounds Kyiv, they are likely to use the brutal tactics Putin has deployed in Chechnya and Syria. This would mean massive deployment of artillery and air power — and the possibility of more than 50,000 military and civilian deaths in a week. How did we get here? There are short and long-term answers to that question. In the short term, the White House has been convinced that war was likely since before Christmas. Since then the efforts of the Biden administration have been directed towards trying to divert Putin by making it clear that he will pay a heavy economic and diplomatic price for war. The Americans were always pessimistic about their chances of success but were determined to give it a try.The US and UK governments believe the decision to attack was taken last week. They have considered the possibility that the Russians are deliberately laying a trail of false intelligence, as part of a psychological pressure campaign. But the sheer volume of preparation that they are seeing and hearing has convinced them otherwise. The decision to go to war has to be disseminated across the Russian system. It cannot be hidden. Nervous chatter among Russian troops who believe they are going into battle is also being monitored. That belief that war is imminent is further reinforced by unfolding events: an upsurge in fighting in eastern Ukraine; an increase in cyber attacks; the announcement that Russian troops will stay in Belarus; and the news that Russia is staging nuclear weapons drills, designed to intimidate its adversaries. As one senior European official told me: “It’s like seeing a film script acted out in every detail.” Efforts to prevent war continue. But the Americans believe they are now in the business of trying to get Putin to reverse a decision that has already been taken.The longer term question about how we got here goes back to the 2007 Munich conference. It was there that Putin made an angry speech denouncing the post-cold war order and the use of American power in Iraq and around the world. The following year, Russia went to war in neighbouring Georgia. In 2014, the first attack on Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea took place. Western leaders threatened Russia with what Merkel called “massive damage.economically and politically”. But Russia weathered the sanctions and by 2018 was staging a successful World Cup, which ended with Putin hosting the presidents of two EU countries, France and Croatia, in the VIP box.If Putin is now willing to shrug off the threats of western sanctions, it may be because he has literally heard it all before. A full-scale assault on Ukraine would, however, represent a massive escalation in his willingness to use force and accept confrontation with the west. After more than 20 years in power, at the age of 69, he may now be in the legacy business. He has expressed a deep desire to “reunify” the Russkiy Mir, or Russian world, which, as he sees it, is now divided. Bringing Ukraine back into Moscow’s orbit could be seen as the completion of a historic task.If he does indeed think like a 19th-century figure, Putin will believe that massive bloodshed is justified to unite the nation. After all, Abraham Lincoln’s army burnt down Atlanta in 1864 to preserve American unity. Otto von Bismarck fought three wars to unify Germany — and is still the subject of admiring biographies.Many analysts, however, including Russian liberals, believe Putin is dangerously deluded if he believes those kinds of wars are still possible in Europe. Today, every atrocity committed by Russian forces will be recorded on somebody’s smartphone and broadcast around the world. Russia’s young people enjoy the same technological and social freedoms as their contemporaries in western Europe. Will they really accept the dangers, deprivations and moral opprobrium that Putin could bring down?Can he, in short, continue to use 19th-century methods in the 21st century? We may be about to find out.
281  One of Germany’s leading business schools sits awkwardly in Berlin between the reconstructed Humboldt Forum museum complex and a rose garden planted by Margot Honecker, an ex-education minister and wife of the last leader of communist East Germany.The European School of Management and Technology, founded to train the country’s capitalist elite, is based in the former state council office of the defunct German Democratic Republic. It is replete with retro lights, hammer and compass emblems and a stained-glass window portraying the leftwing intellectual and revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg.Its surroundings reflect the distinctive past attitudes to business and education in Germany. But in the two decades since ESMT’s creation, much has changed in the country, its companies and attitudes to management, bringing about a flourishing business education sector with ambitions to compete with international rivals.“For a long time we didn’t have an international business school in Germany on the same level as Harvard, Insead or IMD,” recalls Gerhard Cromme, the industrialist who chaired the group of executives who created ESMT in 2002. “We were sending our people to the US, the UK, France and Switzerland. In the late 1990s, we came together and said let’s do something about it.”In the US, UK, Canada and Australia, many universities launched business schools during the 20th century. Other countries such as France and Spain instead opened independent private institutions which built strong international reputations.But Germany was slower to develop business schools. One reason was the 19th-century legacy of the Prussian scholars Wilhelm and Alexander von Humboldt, after whom the museum complex near ESMT is named, says Claus Rerup, a professor of management at the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, which was created in 1957 as a specialist training academy for banks.“They focused on the importance of education to build autonomous world citizens rather than to offer narrow professional training,” he says. The result was the domination of public, free universities decoupled from business education and without selective admission policies for students.“What is missing is an elite education in Germany. After the second world war, the prevailing spirit was that university education should be open to everybody,” argues Markus Rudolf, dean of WHU — Otto Beisheim School of Management, a private business school established in 1983 in Koblenz and now with a second campus in Düsseldorf. “That spirit has not changed. Elite is a bad word,” he adds.Both men point to a conservatism and suspicion of business as an academic discipline in the country’s public universities. “The dominance of the public institutions is too big,” says Jörg Rocholl, president of ESMT. “There was completely different governance that did not allow for the emergence of world-class business schools.”Joachim Lutz, the dean of the business school at Mannheim university, a rare exception of a state institution which opened its own faculty in 2005 — albeit with a separate legal status — points to broader structural explanations. German companies focused on offering apprenticeships and providing in-house training for managers rather than recruiting from business schools, he argues. “During the postwar economic miracle, the job market was fantastic and the educational system didn’t need to look elsewhere,” he says.Furthermore, many of the country’s largest and most successful businesses were industrial and manufacturing groups in sectors such as chemicals, equipment and cars. That meant workers with engineering training — as well as law, given Germany’s strong legalistic culture — were the focus of recruitment and promotions.“Often the best technical specialists were promoted to management. Germans thought that learning about management came only through experience,” says Hiltrud Werner, a former board-level executive at Volkswagen who undertook executive education programmes at ESMT.But that changed in the 1990s, says Lutz. “We had reunification and the EU’s opening of the market for goods and jobs. German industry looked further afield in expanding globally.”Indeed, Werner says German companies are now becoming more internationally oriented, expanding sales and operations abroad and recruiting foreigners with more diverse backgrounds into senior roles at home. This has increased the range of skills required of executives, boosting demand for business education. “We need different skills to be successful in China or Brazil. The global footprint of the German economy has forced management to expand their skills,” she says.Business training is becoming “more significant”, agrees Oliver Hennig, senior vice-president of operations at BioNTech who also attended ESMT. “It’s expected that technical staff going into managerial roles and negotiating contracts understand what is happening,” he says.His company, a pioneer of mRNA vaccines to tackle Covid-19, is part of the country’s expanding start-up culture. Rocholl at ESMT says students are turning their backs on traditional corporate hierarchies and want to work for newer businesses that are more inclusive, agile and entrepreneurial. “It will be an interesting battle to see how mature companies can keep attractive for young talent.”If business schools are attracting a growing number of German students, they are also raising their reputation and appeal to foreign students for masters’ degrees. The country offers the prospect of careers within Europe’s largest economy — and the chance for non-Europeans to gain work visas across the EU after completing their studies.Since Brexit and Covid-19, German business schools such as Mannheim have gained in two ways, says Lutz: fresh interest from foreign students who will gain access to the EU labour market no longer open to those who study in the UK; and domestic students who now prefer to remain at home since the pandemic began.“We are based in Germany but we don’t see ourselves as a German business school. Most of our competitors are abroad,” says Rudolf at WHU. He and his peers may not yet be viewed as strongly as some of its international rivals, but they have ambitions to equal their peers abroad.
282  On both sides of the eastern Ukrainian frontline, ravaged by a bloody eight-year stand-off between government forces and Moscow-backed separatists, residents are bracing themselves for the coming of an even more violent turn in the conflict.The Ukrainian army says it has witnessed the heaviest shelling in years, marking the most serious breach of a fragile ceasefire negotiated in 2019 and never properly implemented. Meanwhile the leaders of the Russia-backed forces across the line began evacuating civilians, in a move western officials warned may be part of a scripted plan to create a pretext for Russia to start a new invasion of Ukraine.In the small settlement of Novoluhanske, 2km from the frontline, mortar fire hit Ukrainian army positions on Saturday, severely injuring an officer and killing another nearby, the unit’s commander told a group of politicians and journalists including from the Financial Times who had been taken on a tour from Kyiv the same day.The visitors, who included David Arakhamia, the leader of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky’s parliamentary group, were forced to run for cover after shelling broke out while approaching Ukrainian army frontline positions. An FT reporter heard at least two dozen bouts of mortar fire during an hour spent in the Novoluhanske area, before the group was forced to evacuate.Arakhamia described the degree of artillery fire along the length of the contact line as “exceptional” and at “the highest peak” in seven years. The attacks intensified about three days ago, he said.Speaking later in the town of Kramatorsk, about 50km from the frontline, Oleksandr Pavlyuk, Ukrainian joint forces commander, said there had been 98 ceasefire violations that day alone, from about three to five daily cases in previous weeks. Two soldiers were killed and four wounded in action, he added.On Sunday morning, the Ukrainian army was reporting 20 violations including 18 shelling incidents.The shelling marks a sharp escalation in the conflict in the far eastern Donbas and Luhansk regions. Ukraine and its western backers say evidence shows Russia has been providing weapons and fighters to fuel the separatist war after it invaded and annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in 2014. The conflict has claimed more than 14,000 lives according to Kyiv.Now the west fears a full invasion of Ukraine. The US estimates that Russia has massed up to 190,000 troops along its border with Ukraine and that of Russian ally Belarus. US president Joe Biden warned on Friday that he expected a Russian attack on Ukraine within days.Maryana Bezuhla, deputy chair of the Ukrainian national security parliamentary committee, said in Novoluhanske that she welcomed western military aid. “It’s not just for defending Ukraine. It’s for defending peace in Europe,” she said, wearing a flak jacket and helmet.US officials have warned that any action by Russia would probably begin with a false flag operation in the eastern territories held by the Moscow-backed separatists.On Friday, a string of events inside the breakaway regions led many western observers to conclude that they were following a script. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, US vice-president Kamala Harris described a “playbook of aggression”.First, separatist commanders reported bomb scares and explosions. Then they warned of an imminent invasion by Ukrainian forces, and later ordered an evacuation of civilians to southern regions of Russia by train and bus.In separatist-held Donetsk, residents contacted by phone said the announcements felt divorced from reality. The night the civilian evacuation was announced, a hashtag began trending on local social media: “I stay to live.”Vladimir Mischenko, speaking via video call on Saturday from his tattoo studio in Donetsk, said people were concerned about increased hostilities. “But I wouldn’t say that today we’ve seen some start of active fighting,” he said.Mischenko, a volunteer reservist in the Donetsk forces, said he did not believe in a staged script, and insisted artillery fire was targeting Donetsk from Ukraine. But when he received a call from local education authorities asking whether he planned to evacuate with his two young children, he declined.“I don’t see the point,” he said, adding that the situation was not even close to what it was like in 2014-15 at the start of the war.Driving around the city on Saturday, Mischenko saw no columns of buses departing, or lines of evacuees, he said. Petrol and groceries were available. “The apocalypse hasn’t happened, as of today,” he said.Russian emergency services said more than 40,000 people had been evacuated from the breakaway regions. Videos and photos showed tent cities set up in the southern Russian region of Rostov. In videos of the evacuation to Rostov, some residents expressed fear about the conflict and said they heard increased shelling in recent days.The FT was not in a position to verify the number of evacuees. However, the two Russian regions bordering the breakaway regions also shared data on how many of them they had received. The Rostov region said that by late Saturday, it had housed 4,000 people, while Voronezh region said it had welcomed 1,000 as of early Sunday.Western officials have urged Kyiv to refrain from responding to mortar fire.On the ground in Novoluhanske, Brigadier General Mykhailo Drapatiy insisted that while all his units had been targeted by enemy fire in the past day, soldiers “do not respond to these attacks unless it threatens the lives of civilians or military, a direct threat”.As the violence intensifies, such a posture gets harder to hold, Arakhamia said: “It’s very hard, psychologically, because they have to sit and not respond.”
283  As the world waits to see how the Russian threat to Ukraine plays out, the three Baltic states are focused on what Moscow is up to in neighbouring Belarus and what it means for their security.About 30,000 Russian troops have been on the ground in Belarus this month ostensibly for a military exercise. On Sunday, Minsk announced they will remain indefinitely when the manoeuvres end on Sunday, leaving Russian troops on their doorstep.While an imminent attack on the Baltics seems unlikely, the three countries worry about Russia’s ability to cut them off from the rest of Europe via the Suwalki gap, the narrow 65km Polish-Lithuanian border, seen as one of Nato’s most vulnerable points. To the west lies the heavily weaponised Russian exclave of Kaliningrad; to the east is Belarus.“We are becoming West Berlin, as a smaller country surrounded by an enemy that has much more military might,” said Marius Laurinavicius, an independent security consultant in Lithuania.Illegally annexed by Moscow after the second world war, the Baltic states are the only ex-Soviet countries to have joined the EU and Nato, providing an example to the likes of Ukraine and provocation to Russia through their fierce defence of freedom.Kusti Salm, permanent secretary at Estonia’s ministry of defence, said the war games in Belarus meant Russia had 10 times the number of forces in the region than Nato has on its eastern flank in the Baltics and Poland.He said Russia’s show of military strength and readiness was “a dramatic change that has not happened in decades”. If the situation remained, he said, “there needs to be a dramatic change in force posture in Nato too”.Belarus was seen by the west as a satellite state, even before next week’s referendum in the country that could end its formal neutrality and agree to host Russian nuclear weapons.“With every year, with every exercise, we see the integration getting closer. There is a military imbalance in the region. We will never match the military strength the Russians have. But we can deter,” said Margiris Abukevicius, Lithuania’s deputy defence minister.“The Suwalki corridor is where the many weaknesses in Nato’s strategy and force posture converge,” said a 2018 study co-authored by Ben Hodges, the former US commanding general in Europe.A senior Baltic security official said that during last year’s Zapad military exercises by Russia and Belarus, troops practised closing the Suwalki gap and a mock invasion of Lithuania. “That was definitely an alarm,” the official added, which showed Russia’s superior capability in the region.“If you seize control of [the Suwalki gap] you will make efforts to reinforce the Baltics much more of a challenge. It is possible with sea and air, but all the reinforcements are via land currently. It’s a complex issue that would very seriously affect the ability of allies in a crisis situation,” said Abukevicius.Alar Karis, Estonia’s president, spoke for many in the region when he said he did not think there was at present “a direct threat to Estonia” but he added that Russia was “an opportunist, ready to challenge Europe and Nato”.The senior Baltic official said “the most dangerous scenario for us” is that Russia makes a very limited incursion, possibly using separatists, something that Nato could struggle to respond to quickly.Nato allies have been rushing to reassure the Baltics. The UK, Germany, Norway and Denmark have all sent extra troops to the region this month as part of three multinational battle groups of about 1,000 each in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The US also has a battalion on rotation in Lithuania and has sent reinforcements to its base in Poland. But the Baltics would like more.Mikk Marran, director-general of Estonia’s foreign intelligence service, said some Russian troops were likely to remain in Belarus after the exercises. “That would reduce preparation time for an attack against the Baltics.If Russia is successful in Ukraine, it would encourage it to increase pressure on the Baltics in the coming years,” he added.“We need to use some tactics used by western countries in the cold war,” said Laurinavicius, the Lithuanian security consultant, including increased defence spending by the Baltics, a permanent US troop presence and Nato reinforcements in the region.Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are all increasing their defence spending to 2.5 per cent of gross domestic product compared with the Nato target of 2 per cent.Nato is gradually increasing troop numbers in eastern Europe but is still a long way from matching Russia’s strength in its western regions.The senior Baltic official said: “Having a cold war-style permanently established force, it’s a fantasy. What we have now can be improved so reinforcement is the name of the game, allied boots on the ground. Credible defence isn’t achieved by x number of troops in Estonia or Latvia or Lithuania but the quality of the equipment.”For now, Baltic officials are watching Belarus as anxiously as Ukraine. Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania’s foreign minister, said: “Everything is on the table — hybrid provocations, Anschluss of Belarus, leaving troops permanently there, creating these tension points near the Suwalki corridor. It’s very difficult to predict the outcome and we need to be prepared for many possible outcomes and have answers to them.”
284  The Brexit bargain was simple: in return for the loss of private freedoms to work, learn, trade and move freely in the EU, the government acquired the right to make decisions without EU control. Not surprisingly, the politicians who brought this bargain about wish to show that it was worthwhile. Jacob Rees-Mogg, staunchest of Brexiters, has duly been appointed Brexit opportunities minister, apparently with a mandate to discover “1,000 regulations we want to get rid of”. He can surely find the regulations. But abolishing them will be far harder. This fishing expedition is unlikely to end with a satisfactory haul.The fundamental reason why it is hard to prove the benefits of Brexit from regulatory divergence is that the regulatory divergence it allows also causes its costs. To take a crucial example, the more UK standards diverge from the EU’s, the more costly border checks have to become. That is why post-Brexit trade with the EU has been weak and why the Northern Ireland agreement has led to those unpopular border controls — a reality Boris Johnson has, of course, denied.So far, as a recent report from the think-tank UK in a Changing Europe shows, actual divergence has been modest. The government has certainly not delivered the bonfire of controls leading Brexiters desired. Still, change is inevitable, especially where EU policy has vanished, notably in trade, agriculture, fisheries and subsidies. There are also opportunities for change in areas like finance, public procurement, taxation, consumer protection, environmental policy and aviation. Finally, there are newer sectors, such as climate, data and the digital economy, autonomous vehicles and bioscience. In all these areas, then, regulation will surely evolve.The question is whether any of these issues can be sensibly reduced to the goal of scrapping thousands of regulations. The answer is no. Modern economies are regulated for powerful reasons: externalities, systemic risks, asymmetric information and inequalities of power are pervasive. Moreover, the UK is embedded in international agreements and global relations that businesses and government cannot ignore. If, to take one example, British data protection standards diverge from those in the EU, UK-based business will find itself at a significant disadvantage.In practice, then, the creation of effective regulatory regimes is a technically and politically complicated activity. In a few areas, there have already been developments. The reform of the EU’s indefensible agricultural policy towards protecting biodiversity and meeting targets for “net zero” emissions is a benign example, as is a surprisingly liberal immigration policy for skilled workers. But the UK’s flexible new subsidy regime offers disturbing opportunities for rent-seeking.One of the most significant areas of regulatory reform will be finance. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has indicated his preference for divergence and so loss of favourable market access in the EU in favour of promoting the UK, and London in particular, as an internationally open financial centre. Here there is surely an opportunity. But there is also danger in his desire to introduce a statutory secondary objective, to provide for a greater focus on “growth and competitiveness”, into the terms of reference of the prudential regulatory and financial conduct authorities. Why might this be so dangerous, even as a secondary objective? The answer is that it might, once again, turn the UK into a leading player in a global regulatory race to the bottom, rather like the one that preceded the 2008 financial crisis. A growth objective may be acceptable, but not one of competitiveness.Above all, the principles and practices of regulation should be rigorously set out. They must not be a mere political football. Maybe we should move from prohibitive and adversarial regulation towards more trusting and co-operative approaches, as Oxford’s Christopher Hodges suggests. What we must not do is discard important regulations haphazardly. There could be big costs to safety, market access and other goals.There is an alternative to deregulation: go for symbols instead. The government’s report on the benefits of Brexit shows the way, by stressing the return of “iconic blue passports”, a review of the ban on using pounds and ounces, and permitting a “crown symbol” on pint glasses. Surely, Rees-Mogg can find more such talismans. If so, in the words of the Roman poet Horace, Parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus (the mountains will labour and a ridiculous mouse will come forth). To deliver mice is merely silly. Delivering monsters is dangerous.
285  More than three decades ago, the nations of central and eastern Europe proudly celebrated their self-liberation from one-party communist rule. Now this achievement is under threat from two directions.On one hand, Russia’s pressure on Ukraine and demands for a redrawn European security order are making the region anxious about its hard-won independence. On the other, some countries are disfigured by democratic backsliding, degradation of the rule of law, deep-seated corruption, organised crime and a prickly variety of postcommunist nationalism.Elections on April 3 in Hungary and Serbia appear likely to underscore that, at least in these two countries, the malign internal trends will not fade away soon. The pair have much in common even though Hungary belongs to the EU and Nato, the west’s premier institutions, and Serbia does not.In its 2021 “Freedom in the World” report, Freedom House, a non-partisan, US government-funded organisation, categorised each country as “partly free”. Hungary’s Viktor Orban and Serbia’s Aleksandar Vucic practise a form of strongman rule imbued with cultural conservatism, friendship with Russia and China and vigorous support for their national minorities abroad — namely, Hungarians in Romania, Slovakia and Ukraine, and Serbs in Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina.The cultivation of warm ties with Vladimir Putin’s Russia does not mean either Hungary or Serbia supports the Kremlin’s revisionism in Ukraine and eastern Europe in general. Each depends on Russian energy supplies, and Serbia values Moscow’s diplomatic backing in the Kosovo dispute. Yet Orban and Vucic have made clear in recent days that they support Ukraine’s national independence.On domestic matters, the similarities between Hungary and Serbia are striking. One, which may prove decisive in April’s elections, is that Orban and Vucic bend the media and judiciary to their will and deploy state resources on behalf of their ruling parties. Undoubtedly, both command considerable popular support, but just to be sure each tilts elections in his favour before even one Hungarian or Serb has cast a vote.For these reasons, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe plans to send observers to Hungary’s parliamentary vote. They will scrutinise the election administration, voter registration, possible voter intimidation and vote-buying, media coverage, campaign finances and the complaints and appeals process. Such missions to EU countries are, to say the least, unusual.The OSCE observers will also visit Serbia, which holds presidential and parliamentary elections on the same day. One imagines they will be busier than during the 2020 parliamentary campaign, which opposition parties boycotted in a futile protest that let Vucic’s party walk off with more than 60 per cent of the vote. Yet the opposition has no chance of victory in a contest defined by Vucic’s domination of the media, state administration and public sector patronage.Not everything is going smoothly for Vucic, who has concentrated power in his hands since 2014, first as prime minister and then as president. Precisely because national elections are lopsided contests, real opposition manifests itself not in Serbia’s rubber-stamp parliament but in sometimes very large, angry street protests. Such demonstrations forced the government last month to drop plans for a multibillion-euro lithium investment project with Rio Tinto, the mining company. If political change is to come to Serbia, popular protest may be its main source.Hungary’s opposition hopes that, having formed a six-party electoral alliance, it can wrest power from Orban, who has ruled since 2010. Orban takes the threat seriously enough to shower voters with more than €5bn in tax cuts and handouts. He can count on massive support from Hungarian minorities in neighbouring countries, on whom his government has bestowed citizenship, the right to vote and large subsidies.For the EU, it is a frustrating time. Vera Jourova, commissioner for values and transparency, acknowledges the EU can do little if the Hungarian elections fail to meet the standards expected of a member state. Yet in some respects the EU has only itself to blame.It goes easy on Vucic because it yearns for Serbian co-operation on the Kosovo and Bosnia disputes. For a long time, it went easy on Orban because Fidesz, his party, belonged to the main centre-right EU group. Now Fidesz is out of that club, but Orban, like Vucic, is well-placed to stay in power. Strongman rule in central and eastern Europe reflects poorly on the EU, but its end is not in sight.
286  Europe’s fragmented single market is like an obstacle course, relegating the region’s companies to also-rans in the global race for growth.The failure to harmonise the rules inside the trading bloc has allowed US companies to take the lead in the growth stakes, say some of the continent’s leading industrialists. A patchwork of regulations is stifling innovation and expansion, they believe.“There are so many obstacles and barriers that are making it hard to grow,” said Carl-Henric Svanberg, chair of the influential Brussels-based European Round Table for Industry, which brings together leaders of 60 of the continent’s biggest industrial and technology companies.He said the US economy grew far more strongly than Europe in the decade between 2008 and 2018. US cumulative real growth was close to 19 per cent, against 11.4 per cent for the EU, including the UK. “The price we pay for not realising that growth is huge,” added Svanberg, who is also chair of Sweden’s AB Volvo and has led European giants such as Ericsson and BP.Svanberg’s comments in an interview with the Financial Times come as Europe shares out a €750bn post-Covid-19 recovery fund aimed at driving the EU’s digital and green transition. But business leaders fret that failure to fully harmonise rules in areas such as digital services, capital markets and energy is holding back European companies.The region’s problems appear to have been exacerbated during the pandemic, when just 16 European companies, including four from the UK and Switzerland, edged into the global top 100 in terms of market capitalisation growth over the two years to the end of 2021.In contrast, the US delivered 58. During the same period, the S&P 500 rose by 46 per cent, against just a 16 per cent rise for Europe’s Stoxx 600. The gap remains, even though in 2022 investors are retreating from the tech stocks that drove US valuations.“We are very slow, very complicated,” said Martin Brudermüller, chief executive of European chemicals group BASF. “Low-carbon solutions and digitally advanced technologies can be scaled up much quicker by companies if they are not facing national barriers, lengthy permitting procedures and fragmented policies in various member states.”European companies have long lagged behind rivals in the US, where companies are able to scale up more quickly because of a single market of 330m people sharing the same language, harmonised regulations and deeper capital markets.Analysis by capital markets think-tank, New Financial, found that, on average, capital markets across the EU27 are half as large relative to gross domestic product as in the UK, which in turn is roughly half as developed as the US. But Andre Köttner, global co-head of equities at Germany’s DWS, said Europe suffered a double blow from the pandemic. First, it lacks fast-growing global tech giants. Companies such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google were able to exploit the shift to online consumption that came with the global lockdown.Second, “Europe treated the Covid pandemic more severely than other countries, so companies were hit harder,” Köttner said. “In the US, there were fewer restrictions.”There was also a difference in the speed and scale of government support, according to Jorma Ollila, the former chair of both Royal Dutch Shell and Nokia, and now a board member at investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners. “Expansionary fiscal and monetary policies had an impact in Europe, but the impact in the US was bigger,” he said. US measures were “more aggressive than in Europe. And the US started earlier.”The difference is highlighted by the substantially greater expansion of the US Federal Reserve’s balance sheet compared with the European central bank in the early months of the pandemic. By the end of March 2020, Donald Trump, then US president, had signed into law a bill outlining $2.3tn in emergency measures to aid individuals, businesses and the wider economy, equal to roughly 11 per cent of GDP.European support was also structured in a way that did not favour competitiveness, said Simon Freakley, chief executive of consultancy AlixPartners in New York. “In the US, federal programmes supported the employee directly while in Europe they supported the employer, to protect employment in Europe,” he said.“There was no incentive for employers to slim down workforces. So US companies have come out of the blocks quicker than in Europe.”Data from Refinitiv confirms that view, with aggregated earnings in the S&P 500 surpassing early 2019 levels by the third quarter of 2020, while Europe’s Stoxx 600 companies took until the first quarter of last year to recover.But the pandemic experience does not mean that European companies are worse than their American rivals, insisted Drew Dickson, chief investment officer of London-based fund, Albert Bridge Capital.Nor does Europe’s lack of big global tech companies signal something rotten in the state of European business. Instead, that is simply “the outcome of history and chance” — the migration decades ago of tech geeks to Silicon Valley. “It wasn’t Chicago, New York, Nashville or Austin,” he said.“It isn’t an American thing. You have four of the biggest companies in the world within 40 miles of each other. There was a clustering that happened.” European companies are highly competitive in other sectors, Dickson argued. “If there is a Boeing, there is an Airbus,” he said. “Where there is a GM, there is Volkswagen. A Southwest, a Ryanair. Once you are in other sectors there is no clear winner. This argument that somehow there is something better in the US is wrong, except in tech.”Daniel Grosvenor, director of equity strategy at Oxford Economics, agreed that there is a danger of being too pessimistic about European companies. “They haven’t done badly in absolute terms. European profit margins are back at an all-time high. It is not that they had a bad pandemic, just that they underperformed their US counterparts.”Dickson argued that the underperformance has been driven in part by global investors’ obsession with the high-growth tech stocks that dominate US indices. Europe, meanwhile, is weighted towards value stocks, or companies where profits or book values suggest that a higher share price is merited.But Europe’s lack of global tech giants is still a weakness in an increasingly connected world, said James Watson, director of economics at the lobby group BusinessEurope. “The concern is we are not in the areas where we expect profits to be in the future,” he said.There are signs that this may be changing. Last year, Europe’s tech sector drew investment of $100bn, close to three times the level recorded in 2020. According to Atomico’s State of European Tech 2021 report, the sector added $1tn in value over just eight months for a total of $3tn last year, and returns on venture capital investment in Europe are outpacing the US. But there is still a big gap.So the question is whether the pace can be accelerated as European governments prepare to spend roughly a third of the €750bn recovery fund on digital transformation.For Svanberg that can only happen if barriers to the single market are addressed. For example, “we don’t have a single market for 5G in Europe,” he said. “That makes it harder for digital companies to scale. And we have to have digital success, otherwise we won’t be able to deliver on the green transformation.”It is not just big companies that worry about the scope for growth if Europe fails to create a comprehensive single market. “A lot of small and medium-sized businesses still don’t consider Europe as a domestic market,” said Ben Butters, chief executive of Eurochambres, which represents more than 20m businesses, most of which are SMEs.“There are many barriers that preclude business from capitalising on the single market. When that happens, hopefully we will have a lot more names on that list of leaders.”
287  Western leaders said Russia was following a “playbook of deception” to justify an invasion of Ukraine, amid intensifying clashes in the east of the country between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists.Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, US vice-president Kamala Harris said Moscow was creating false pretexts for an attack while amassing troops and firepower in plain sight.“We are seeing Russia spreading disinformation, lies and propaganda,” Harris told the annual get-together of politicians, diplomats and military officials, calling it “the playbook of Russian aggression”.The White House said President Joe Biden would convene a meeting of his National Security Council on Sunday to discuss the situation in Ukraine.Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine had fallen victim to an “information war, a hybrid war” but was “not responding to any provocations”.“We know they’re firing from civilian areas, to provoke us, to make us respond,” he said. “We need to keep calm.”The massive Russian troop build-up on the Ukrainian border has raised fears of a new war in the heart of Europe.Western leaders speaking at the conference called for a diplomatic solution, urging Russia to “pull back from the brink”. But they also warned Moscow of the consequences of an invasion: far-reaching sanctions that they said would inflict huge damage on its economy.Zelensky appealed to the west to stand by Ukraine and said western nations had let Kyiv down by appeasing Russia.“Some countries are committing crimes while others are indifferent, and that indifference has turned them into accomplices,” he said.Zelensky referred to a speech Vladimir Putin gave at the Munich conference in 2007 when he “threw down a challenge to the global security system”.“How did the world respond? Appeasement,” he said. “What do we have as a result? The annexation of Crimea and aggression against my country.”Speaking to CNN on Saturday, Zelensky suggested Kyiv had a “different vision” than the west about when to apply sanctions. While the US and allies want to impose them after an attack as a punitive measure, Zelensky said they should be introduced immediately, particularly since an attack seemed close.“We don’t need your sanctions after the bombardment will happen and after our country will be fired at or after we will have no borders, or after we will have no economy.why would we need those sanctions then?”In a statement on Saturday, the G7 foreign ministers said: “While we are ready to explore diplomatic solutions to address legitimate security concerns, Russia should be in no doubt that any further military aggression against Ukraine will have massive consequences, including financial and economic sanctions on a wide array of sectoral and individual targets that would impose severe and unprecedented costs on the Russian economy. We will take co-ordinated restrictive measures in case of such an event.”Oleksandr Pavlyuk, Ukrainian joint forces commander, said the situation around Donetsk and Luhansk had deteriorated over the past three days.“If we take into consideration the past three months there were three to five ceasefire violations per day. Compared to that number, on Feb 17 we had 60 incidents of ceasefire violations by the Russian Federation Forces and 43 incidents of weapons banned by the Minsk agreements,” Pavlyuk said.Ukraine said two soldiers were killed and four injured during shelling in the eastern border region of Donbas on Saturday, where more than 14,000 have died in a slow-burning war that broke out after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.Ukrainian military officials and lawmakers touring frontline areas were forced to evacuate after coming under artillery fire.Russian-backed separatist leaders in Donbas accused Kyiv of carrying out “terror attacks” that they said, without providing evidence, left unspecified numbers dead and wounded.Russia said Ukrainian artillery fire had landed on the Russian side of the border. Zelensky dismissed the reports as “lies”.The separatist leaders announced a mass evacuation of civilians to Russia — where Putin promised them a payment of Rbs10,000 ($130) — and called on all fighting-age men to mobilise.Time codes on the separatists’ video appeals were dated Wednesday, before the uptick in shelling began, boosting suspicions of a false flag operation as a pretext to invade.British prime minister Boris Johnson said the world needed to prepare for a “Russian playbook of deception” and that Moscow was “spinning a web of falsehoods designed to present any Russian attack as a response to provocation”.Germany and France urged their citizens to leave Ukraine. Lufthansa, which owns airlines including Lufthansa, Austrian and Swiss, said it would stop regular flights to Kyiv and Odesa until the end of February. KLM and Norwegian have also cancelled flights to Ukraine.Exacerbating the tensions, Russia began strategic nuclear exercises on Saturday.Harris warned the west would impose “far-reaching financial sanctions and export controls” against Moscow should Putin give the order to attack Ukraine.“Make no mistake, the imposition of these sweeping and co-ordinated measures will inflict great damage on those who must be held accountable,” she said.Johnson said in the event of an invasion the west would “sanction Russian individuals and companies of strategic importance to the Russian state”.“We will make it impossible for them to raise finance on the London capital markets,” he told the conference. “We will open up the matryoshka dolls of Russian-owned companies and Russian-owned entities to find the ultimate beneficiaries within.”Other leaders appealed to Russia to step back from the brink.Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, said Russia’s attempt to turn Kyiv’s possible membership of Nato into a “casus belli” was a “paradox” because the issue was not on the west’s agenda.Additional reporting by Philip Georgiadis and Jasmine Cameron-Chileshe in London, and James Politi in Washington.This article has ben amended to correct the amount that Vladimir Putin has promised evacuated civilians.
288  Germany fears Russia could retaliate against western sanctions in the event of war with Ukraine by cutting off gas supplies, its finance minister has said, a move that could cripple Europe’s largest economy.Christian Lindner told the Financial Times that Russia had always been a reliable supplier of natural gas to Germany, even at the height of the cold war. But that could change if Russia invaded Ukraine and the west punished Moscow with a swingeing sanctions package.“If you look at the cold war, whatever happened between Nato and the Warsaw Pact, there was never a situation where political tensions harmed co-operation in the energy sector,” Lindner said. “Things might be different now.”The US said this week that Russia could be poised to invade Ukraine within several days, after massing an estimated 150,000 troops on the Ukrainian border.The west has warned Russian president Vladimir Putin of grave economic consequences if he attacks his western neighbour. Germany has made clear these would include a halt to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline bringing Russian gas directly to Europe under the Baltic Sea.Some fear the Kremlin could respond to sanctions by reducing or even stopping gas flows to Europe, which relies on Russia for 40 per cent of its gas. Lindner’s remarks suggest such a scenario is being taken seriously in Berlin.The growing tensions over Ukraine have coincided with a surge in European gas prices, amid lower-than-expected deliveries from Russia and rising demand from economies emerging from the Covid-19 pandemic.Some experts believe Russia held back supplies to the spot market and deliberately depleted its gas storage facilities in Europe ahead of winter demand, driving stockpiles to their lowest seasonal level in more than a decade.“Gazprom, a Russian state-owned company, is deliberately trying tostore and deliver as little as possible,” Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, told the Munich Security Conference on Saturday. “While prices and demand are skyrocketing, this is very strange behaviour for a company.”Such developments have persuaded many in Berlin that Russia is prepared to use its energy exports to exert pressure on the west, regardless of the damage that might do to its reputation as a reliable supplier.The EU has said it would be able to cope with a partial cut-off of gas and has spoken with the US, Qatar, Egypt, Azerbaijan and other countries about increasing deliveries of liquefied natural gas (LNG), either through additional shipments or contract swaps.Lindner insisted Germany had made adequate contingency plans to source alternative supplies of gas should Russia turn off the tap. But he added that the current crisis underscored the need for Germany to diversify its energy imports, in particular by procuring more LNG.“I’m very much in favour of Germany building LNG terminals, and have been for years,” he told the FT. “If we get LNG terminals built then that would be a positive outcome of this situation.”In the interview, Lindner — leader of the liberal Free Democratic party, which is traditionally hawkish on public spending — also intervened in the debate about the future of the EU’s fiscal rules, known as the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). The rules, which cap budget deficits at 3 per cent of gross domestic product and try to limit public debt to 60 per cent of GDP, have been shelved since the start of the pandemic but will come back into force from 2023.The European Commission is working on proposals for reforming the SGP and some EU countries, particularly in the south, would like to see investments in green and digital projects “carved out” of deficit calculations — an approach described as the “golden rule”.Lindner rejected that. “I don’t support the idea of a golden rule,” he said. “Everyone would end up having their own definition for investment.”“For the financial markets, debt is debt,” he continued. “It doesn’t matter if it’s debt in the pension system or debt for public sector investment.” The priority for the eurozone was, he said, “to have a clear path to lower debt levels”.Lindner’s conservative fiscal views have had a marked impact on the policies adopted by the three-party coalition government, which brings together his FDP with the Greens and Social Democrats. Under FDP pressure, the government has eschewed tax rises and pledged to stick to the debt brake, Germany’s constitutional curb on new borrowing, which was suspended during the pandemic but is due to come back into force in 2023.Lindner was critical of the European Central Bank’s ultra-loose monetary policy, saying there was a risk of “fiscal dominance” — a situation where government debt has risen so high that a central bank may be reluctant to raise interest rates to tackle high inflation. It was a danger highlighted by Jens Weidmann last month as he bowed out as president of Germany’s Bundesbank, and has also been raised by his successor Joachim Nagel.“With the ECB’s policies and bond purchase programmes and very low interest rates, there is the danger of fiscal dominance,” said Lindner. “That’s why we are in favour of returning to crystal-clear fiscal rules, both in Germany and the eurozone.”Lindner said he could “understand” why the ECB had decided to gradually reduce its asset purchases if inflation remained high, noting that some eurozone central bankers, such as Nagel and Klaas Knot of the Netherlands, were talking about the need to raise interest rates. “I would certainly support a return to normalised monetary policy,” he added.
289  Inter Milan’s chief executive has said the club’s Chinese owner remains committed to the Italian champions following a €415mn debt refinancing, as he warned teams across Europe must invest more to close the financial gap with the England’s Premier League.Alessandro Antonello, the club’s chief executive, told the Financial Times that Suning, the Chinese retail conglomerate which has controlled Inter since 2016, is open to securing new financial and commercial partners and would consider the sale of a minority stake.“No, no, no,” Antonello said in an interview when asked if Suning was exploring an outright sale. “The shareholder [Suning] is committed to long-term investment in the club.”Inter declined to comment on reports that Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, the state-owned $500bn sovereign fund, is set to acquire the club. A person close to Inter said there had been no contact with PIF.Suning is itself under financial pressure as it struggles with weaker sales at its physical stores, steep losses on investments and $1.2bn in bonds maturing this year. Alibaba and Chinese local government backed a $1.4bn bailout for the company last year.The retailer also secured a $275mn loan from Oaktree Capital to help fund Inter, with the Los Angeles-based distressed debt specialist investing in the latest refinancing, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.While Inter had returned to public debt markets to raise cash in January, Antonello stressed that more investment was needed to enable European rivals to catch up with the Premier League. England’s top-flight competition this month said the value of its broadcast rights, already the highest in Europe, was set to climb to £10.4bn in 2022-25, up from £9.2bn in the previous three-year cycle.Rather than being concerned, Antonello said: “We need to be stimulated by the improvement of the Premier League in order to work very hard and to recover the gap.”Yet, in a nod to the failed European Super League, he insisted a “competitive balance” across clubs in Europe was essential in order to keep fans interested in the game.With Inter and local rival AC Milan constructing a new stadium to replace their shared ground, the iconic San Siro, Antonello said infrastructure investment and improvements were vital to clubs’ success as much as performance on the pitch.Inter reclaimed the Serie A title for the first time in a decade last season, but the club subsequently sold star striker Romelu Lukaku to Chelsea and parted ways with manager Antonio Conte. The club recorded a net loss of €245mn at group level in the 12 months ended June 30.Across Europe, average revenues at top-flight clubs fell 10.4 per cent to €20.6bn in the 2020 financial year, according to Uefa, European football’s governing body, while Serie A teams’ revenues fell 21 per cent to just over €2.0bn.Talks last year between Serie A and external investors, including private equity firms CVC Capital Partners and Advent International and Italian investment group Fondo FSI, failed to result in a transaction.CVC later invested in Spain’s La Liga.Paolo Dal Pino, who was criticised by clubs for his handling of the discussions, resigned as president of Serie A this month.While external funding remains an option for Italy’s top league it is “not the only way”, said Antonello.“It could be private equity, it could be something different, but what’s most important is to have someone supporting us in a new governance and creating value-added for Serie A in the future.”
290  Joe Biden said he was convinced Russian president Vladimir Putin had made a decision to invade Ukraine, issuing his starkest warning yet amid mounting signs Moscow was creating a pretext for military action.Speaking at the White House after a call with transatlantic leaders over what the US president described as a “rapidly escalating crisis”, he accused Moscow of creating a pretext for an assault on its neighbour that he said could begin “in the coming week, in the coming days”.Asked by a reporter if he believed Putin had already decided to launch an attack, Biden responded: “As of this moment, I’m convinced he’s made the decision. We have reason to believe that.” It was the first time the US has said it thinks the Russian president has made his mind up.“We believe that they will target Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, a city of 2.8m innocent people,” Biden added.Even so, he said it was not “too late” for Putin to “de-escalate and return to the negotiating table”.Biden cited plans by Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, and Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, to meet on February 24 in Europe as a possible opportunity for further talks, but warned if Moscow took military action before then it will have “slammed the door shut on diplomacy”.He added that if Putin chose war, he would “pay a steep price for doing so, not only from the sanctions that we and our allies will impose on Russia, but the moral outrage the rest of the world will visit upon them”.After Biden’s remarks, a White House official said his statement about Putin’s decision reflected “the assessments of the intelligence community”.Biden’s comments followed a day during which western fears of an impending Russian attack on Ukraine grew sharply as tensions rose in the eastern region of the country that is partially controlled by pro-Russian separatists.The president pointed to an increase in ceasefire violations by Russian-backed fighters, the shelling of a kindergarten in the region that Moscow sought to falsely blame on Ukrainian forces, and “more and more disinformation” about the conflict being “pushed” to the Russian public, including “phoney allegations” of genocide carried out by Ukraine.“All these are consistent with the playbook the Russians have used before to set up a false justification to act against Ukraine,” Biden said. “This is also aligned with pretext scenarios that United States and our allies and partners have been warning about for weeks.”He ridiculed Russia for claiming Ukraine was preparing a “massive offensive” in the Donbas region, adding: “It defies basic logic to believe that Ukrainians would choose this moment — with well over 150,000 troops on its borders — to escalate [the] conflict.”A few minutes before Biden started speaking, Russian news wires reported multiple explosions in Luhansk, the second big city held by separatists, and posted footage of what they said was a fire at a large pipeline.Earlier in the day, Moscow-backed separatists ordered an evacuation of civilians to Russia, claiming Ukrainian forces were preparing to attack the region. Biden did not refer to either episode but praised Ukrainian forces for showing “restraint” and not allowing Russia to “bait” them into war.The president spoke as several of his top officials, including Blinken and Kamala Harris, vice-president, were in Europe to attend the Munich security conference, where the Ukraine crisis was at top of the agenda as the biggest threat to the continent’s security since the end of the Cold War.On Saturday, Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, is also expected to attend the conference and call for western unity in response to the looming Russian aggression.“Allies need to speak with one voice to stress to President Putin the high price he will pay for any further Russian invasion of Ukraine,” Johnson said ahead of his attendance.Biden equally sought to reinforce that message. “There are many issues that divide our nation and our world. But standing up to Russian aggression is not one of them. The American people are united, Europe is united.”At a White House briefing earlier on Friday afternoon, Anne Neuberger, Biden’s top adviser on cyber security, blamed Russia for cyber attacks that hit some Ukrainian banks and government operations this week.Daleep Singh, Biden’s deputy national security adviser, warned Moscow that European countries and the US were aligned on massive economic sanctions to be imposed on Russia if it followed through with an invasion. However, cutting the country’s banks off from the Swift international payments system would not be in the “initial” tranche of measures, he added.“Russia would face the prospect of intense capital outflows mounting pressure on its currency, surging inflation, higher borrowing costs, economic contraction, and the erosion of its productive capacity,” Singh said.
291  Kremlin brinkmanship along the Ukrainian border escalated on Friday, with President Vladimir Putin accusing Kyiv of intentionally stoking tensions in eastern Ukraine, where Moscow-backed separatists ordered an evacuation of civilians to Russia.Ukrainian security services vociferously denied any unilateral moves in the region. But the increased Russian sabre-rattling reinforced the view in several western capitals, including Washington, that Putin was creating a pretence to invade.The French and German foreign ministers issued a joint statement condemning the separatists’ claims that Kyiv was preparing to attack the region, saying there was no evidence of any Ukrainian provocation.“We do not see any grounds for these allegations and urge Russia to use its influence over the self-proclaimed republics to encourage restraint and contribute to de-escalation,” the French and German ministers said.“We are concerned that staged incidents could be misused as a pretext for possible military escalation,” they added.Putin made his allegations on Friday after meeting his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko in Moscow. They came as the Russian defence ministry said it planned to hold nuclear exercises, which US officials have interpreted as a show of strength by Moscow to Nato.“We are seeing an escalation in the Donbas,” the Russian president said.At the same time, Putin denied Russia was planning to invade, adding: “Of course, we are looking at what is happening around the world and around us. But we have clearly defined guidelines in line with the national interests of the Russian people and the Russian state.”Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, which Russian-backed separatists have controlled since 2014, has long been seen by US and allied intelligence officials as the most likely place for Putin to instigate a conflict.Denis Pushilin, head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed in a video message that Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky had given the Ukrainian army orders to attack the separatists “in the next few hours”. He did not provide evidence.Asked on Russian state TV if “things are heading for all-out war,” Pushilin replied: “Unfortunately, yes.”But Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, “categorically” denied what he called “Russian disinformation reports” on Kyiv’s alleged offensive operations or acts of sabotage. “Ukraine does not conduct or plan any such actions in the Donbas,” he said.Putin dispatched his acting emergencies minister to deal with a possible influx of people from the Donbas and ordered that each refugee in Rostov receive a one-time payment of Rbs10,000 ($130), according to state newswire RIA Novosti.Ukraine’s army says it recorded 60 ceasefire violations in the past 24 hours in the war-torn region, including 43 artillery salvos, which it described as attempts by Russia and its proxies to trigger a pretext for further aggression.The developments cast a pall over an annual meeting of western defence officials in Munich, where diplomats from several Nato allies issued warnings that Putin appeared dead-set on an invasion.“A new war threatens to break out in the middle of our Europe,” Annalena Baerbock, the German foreign minister, said in a speech to the Munich Security Conference. “This is one of the most dangerous moments, where from provocation and disinformation we can see escalation.”Michael Carpenter, US ambassador to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, said the US estimated Russia had increased its troop deployments near the Ukrainian border to more than 169,000 and described it as “the most significant military mobilisation” on the continent since the second world war.Late on Friday, the UK said it had temporarily relocated its embassy from Kyiv to Lviv in the western part of Ukraine.In Washington, Daleep Singh, US deputy national security adviser, warned Russia that the sanctions package being put together by the US and allies would be targeting the “commanding heights of the Russian economy and the Russian state”. Russia would be facing “less foreign capital, higher borrowing costs, less investment, and lower growth,” Singh said, though he acknowledged that a cut-off from the Swift international payments system, which underpins trillions of dollars of transactions a year, would not be included in the initial round of sanctions.Russia’s decision to conduct nuclear drills added to the mounting tensions. The defence ministry said on Friday that units from its air force, army and navy would take part in the drills to test its launch crews and personnel as well as its nuclear and conventional weaponry. Putin will personally supervise the drills.Although the Kremlin said the annual nuclear exercises — which were not held in 2020 or 2021 because of the pandemic — were long planned, the last time the exercises were moved to February from their usual autumn timeframe was shortly before Russia invaded Crimea in 2014.Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesperson, told reporters the exercises were regular and should not “give anyone cause for questions and concern”.Despite the sabre-rattling, Moscow also said it would pursue talks with western powers after Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, invited his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to meet in Europe next week to discuss “mutual security concerns”. Russia’s ambassador to the UK said the meeting could be held in Geneva or Finland, according to Interfax.Additional reporting by James Politi in Washington and Jasmine Cameron-Chileshe in London
292  Thousands of UK tourists hitting the Alpine slopes during their half-term break this week will have found something missing: there are far fewer British ski and snowboard instructors available this year.Instructors from Britain are finding it much harder to work in the Alps since Brexit because mutual recognition of their professional qualifications was left out of the trade agreement between Britain and Brussels that was signed at the end of 2020.This has created serious obstacles for Britons wanting to work as instructors in ski resorts in Italy, France, Austria and even Switzerland, since they reopened to foreign tourists this winter following two years of disruption due to the pandemic.Andy McIntosh is snowsports training manager at Interski, a tour operator with almost 40 years’ experience in the Aosta Valley, north-west Italy. His work permit application was recently turned down by Italian authorities.“My job requires me to be in the UK for seven months and in Italy for five months, where I deliver instructor training,” he said. “I am now in a position where I can’t work in Italy; this is very frustrating and also very sad for me personally, and for the wider profession.”While Interski recently booked its first British school ski trip since March 2020, McIntosh said the disruption of Brexit meant most client lessons were booked with Italian schools, rather than its own British instructors, despite many outfits being short of capacity.“We were the largest British ski school in the Alps, employing up to 400 British ski instructors a season and covering 1,200 instructor teaching weeks,” said McIntosh, who has taught skiing in France and Italy for 17 years and holds the highest UK instructing licence available, the BASI level four diploma. “We have lots of clients and lots of British ski instructors who want to work but, because of Brexit, it is now impossible to employ the British instructors that our clients would like,” he added. “The current situation does not benefit anyone.”Tom Cloke, interim chief executive of the British Association of Snowsport Instructors (Basi), said that as the UK was outside the EU, local employers were required to deal with added bureaucracy in order to hire British citizens. The disruption of Brexit had set UK winter sports back by several decades, he added.The country’s performance at the Winter Olympics in Beijing has been criticised by the sports community for being its worst in decades.Robert Greatbach worked as a British ski instructor in Italy before the pandemic, but his dream of working in the popular French ski resort of Tignes was dashed this year after his application for a work permit was turned down. “I always wanted to work in Tignes,” he said. “After leaving the EU, my British qualification is not recognised in France. The procedure for getting it recognised still will not be formalised until the summer.”Instead, Greatbach managed to fulfil the preconditions to work in a Swiss ski school, which allows him to spend 90 days a year working in Zermatt, near the Italian border. He qualified to work in Zermatt under an agreement signed between Britain and Switzerland on the eve of Brexit in late 2020 to preserve access of UK services providers to the Swiss market.“I’m lucky to be able to work in Switzerland.because I’m self-employed,” he said. “I have many friends and colleagues who cannot take advantage of that because they do not qualify for certain parts of the legislation.”Despite not being in the EU, Switzerland allocates work permits more readily to EU citizens and British nationals now find themselves among other nationalities competing for jobs there. Ben Woodhead, a trainee ski instructor at the French resort of Méribel, has seen first hand how Brexit has made it harder to get British qualifications recognised.“You basically just can’t rock up and get work like you could before, or move between countries,” said Woodhead. “Everything needs to be applied for and approved before the season begins.”Woodhead aims to gain France’s top-level Eurotest qualification, but he said the authorities were discussing allowing their off-piste test to be taken only in French, which would make it harder for UK citizens who do not speak the language fluently.“Ultimately it’s also just going to stop most British people being able to train as instructors in the first place.”Even if British citizens had EU residency, it allowed them to work in only one country, said Cloke, which can be restrictive in resorts that cross national borders because they cannot “follow the snow and adapt to weather conditions for their clients, from valley to valley”.
293  Stocks on Wall Street slid on Friday, registering their second-consecutive weekly loss as tensions between Russia and Ukraine intensified at the end of a volatile five trading days.The S&P 500 fell 0.7 per cent on Friday as traders removed some of their bets ahead of a long weekend, girded for news that could move markets. The decline took the losses for the index this week to 1.6 per cent. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.2 per cent on Friday and finished the week down 1.8 per cent.The Cboe’s Vix volatility index, which measures expected swings on the S&P 500 and is known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, briefly surged towards 30 — an indication of market stress. While it ended the day slightly lower at 27.79, it remained well above its long-term average.Financial markets have swung sharply over the past week as developments in Ukraine added to fears of potential sanctions against Russia, exacerbating market jitters about inflation and central banks raising interest rates. The S&P is down nearly 9 per cent for the year, after hitting a record high in January, while the Nasdaq has lost 13.4 per cent.Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine announced plans for a “mass evacuation” of civilians to Russia. Also on Friday, Russia announced plans for nuclear drills to test ballistic and cruise missiles, while saying it would pursue talks with western powers after Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, invited his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to meet in Europe next week.“If there were an invasion then we know for sure the oil price will go higher, that’s inflationary, and that will make the Fed a bit more aggressive,” said Marija Veitmane, senior strategist at State Street. “So that’s the transmission mechanism between these geopolitical risks around Russia and global markets.”Russia is one of the world’s largest oil producers and a leading commodities exporter.In the US, inflation has surged to a 40-year high, and markets are predicting that the Federal Reserve will lift interest rates by six quarter-point rises this year. The dollar rose 0.3 per cent against a basket of major currencies.On Friday, Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, gained 0.6 per cent to $93.54 a barrel.Russia’s Moex share index fell 3.4 per cent, following a 3.7 per cent drop in the previous session. The rouble declined 1.7 per cent against the dollar.Europe’s regional Stoxx 600 share index fell 0.8 per cent, Germany’s Xetra Dax dropped 1.5 per cent and the UK’s FTSE 100 lost 0.3 per cent.Lale Akoner, senior market strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management, said stock markets were likely to remain under pressure until geopolitical risks receded. “The market has been pricing in the economic implications if sanctions were implemented on Russia,” she said.If an invasion did not occur, she added, “then oil prices fall, commodities prices and precious metals go down and equities will go higher as risk sentiment improves”.In Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dropped 1.9 per cent as Chinese technology stocks fell sharply. The moves came after the National Development and Reform Commission, Beijing’s top state planning agency, urged online food delivery platforms to lower the fees they charge restaurants.Shares in food platform Meituan dropped almost 15 per cent. Hong Kong shares of internet holding company Alibaba, which owns food delivery platform Ele.me, fell 2.9 per cent.In government bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note, which moves inversely to its price and underpins borrowing costs worldwide, fell 0.05 percentage points to 1.92 per cent.Germany’s equivalent Bund yield dipped 0.04 percentage points to 0.19 per cent.
294  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
295  As warnings flooded in that Russia was set to launch a full-blown military assault on Ukraine, Orest Putsentela wondered whether he too should pack his bags — despite living more than 700km from the Russian border.While normal life continued in Lviv this week, the pressure and anxieties of the escalating conflict have reached the tram-crossed cobbled streets of the city in Ukraine’s far west.On Wednesday, Putsentela rushed to collect his children after a false bomb threat at their school, one of several intimidating calls to city institutions this week. Then a cyber attack targeting a number of Ukrainian banks left him struggling to withdraw cash.“And that was just one day,” said the violin-maker, sitting in his apartment surrounded by musical instruments. “The situation is quite stressful.”Ukrainian authorities blamed Russia for the cyber attack and previously accused it of being behind bomb threats. Despite the uncertainties, Lviv’s 1mn residents were sticking with their routines.“Everyone is going to their jobs, the kids were at school again the next day. It’s normal life,” said Putsentela, 39. One street performer in the city said he sensed no fear or panic among the passers-by he stopped to photograph in the city’s main square.Lviv, located closer to the Polish border than to Kyiv, this week became home to several western embassies which relocated there on security concerns, as they set up makeshift offices in local hotels, unsure when they could return. Organisations such as the World Bank and IMF followed suit.Many in Ukraine, who have experienced eight years of war in the eastern Donbas region, have reacted with incredulity to the ramp-up in tensions this week, when some flights were cancelled and a dozen countries called on their citizens to leave Ukraine immediately. The government in Kyiv urged calm, and argued that the embassies’ switch to Lviv was alarmist.“We can welcome everybody here, we’ve got lots of space,” said Yurko Nazaruk, co-owner of hospitality company !Fest that employs about 2,000 people in Lviv. He flashed a grin and waved to the former glass factory below his office, offering to convert the hipster bar space into a “diplomatic co-working” spot, complete with flagpoles.Nazaruk’s ventures are often tongue-in-cheek, such as Pravda beer, known for lampooning world leaders on its bottle labels. Next, he said, might be a depiction of French president Emmanuel Macron’s recent meeting, across a now infamously long table, with Russian president Vladimir Putin.On Friday the US warned that the situation was escalating sharply, with up to 190,000 Russian troops stationed on Ukraine’s borders, a jump from 100,000 last month.Lviv has made preparations for any assault. “We became relaxed in recent years.But the tensions of the past few months have sobered us,” Andriy Sadovyi, Lviv’s mayor, said in an interview at city hall.Officials have stocked up on medical and blood supplies, mapped sites such as pedestrian underpasses that could be used as bomb shelters, made plans for maintaining water supply if power is cut, and worked out how the region could accommodate an influx of refugees.The city’s energetic response to the threat may be down to its unique identity in Ukraine.The region, annexed by the Soviet Union in 1945, is almost entirely Ukrainian-speaking, a rarity in a country where the Russian language is widespread. It is also known as a stronghold of patriotism and nationalism.In the city’s Jesuit Church, a middle-aged couple prayed in front of a large memorial to soldiers from Lviv killed in the ongoing war with Russian-backed separatists in the east. Photos of the dead hung on banners next to a shrine covered in shrapnel and pieces of bomb-damaged military kit.“Lviv was always a centre for dissidents,” said Vasyl Kmet, director of the library at Lviv’s Ivan Franko University. He described the city as having a long tradition of revolt, honed against the many powers that have ruled it over the centuries.When the Soviet bloc began to collapse, Lviv led the charge in removing statues of Vladimir Lenin — Kmet can recall helping to carry a plaster bust of the Communist leader from his school classroom. For many in Lviv, any encroachment by Russia is an unwelcome reminder of its Soviet past.During the 2014 Maidan protests, which ousted Ukraine’s former Moscow-backed president, Lviv residents were “very active, the most active,” Kmet said. An outsized proportion of the protesters killed in those demonstrations were from western Ukraine and Lviv. Many too have been killed fighting in the separatist war.As Ukraine’s sense of national identity hardens in the face of threats, many in Lviv feel their city is again playing an important role.Firearms training has been made mandatory for municipal employees, and workshops for the public are widespread too. Putsentela’s 15-year-old son will visit a shooting range next week for the first time, a trip organised via his school.The craftsman said he did not object, nor had he minded the effects that the war threats had imposed on his business. They were painful, as the currency fluctuated and imports became more expensive, but it was better, he explained, to “suffer a bit, again, but to have sovereignty”.
296  Western governments are steeled for a prolonged confrontation with Russia as Moscow continues to reinforce its military on Ukraine’s borders in a build-up many fear will lead to a full blown invasion or a new era of cold war-style aggression that is neither war nor peace.Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary-general, this week described the situation as Europe’s “new normal” in which “Moscow has made it clear that it is prepared to contest the fundamental principles that have underpinned our security for decades.by using force”.“We don’t know what will happen, but we know what has already happened,” Stoltenberg said, pointing to the up to 190,000 troops the US says Moscow has now massed. “That’s the reason why we need to also consider longer term adjustments of Nato’s posture,” including “potential new battle groups in the east.”Moscow has repeatedly denied that invasion is on the cards and has ridiculed western intelligence assessments warning that it plans a series of “false flag” operations to serve as a pretext for military intervention, calling them “provocations”.“What can we get out of invading?” said one former senior Kremlin official. “It’d be very unpopular domestically because so many people have relatives there, and you can’t hold the territory because of partisan warfare.Any realistic politician sees it is madness.”Yet Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, has been more cryptic as he continues to insist that Nato withdraws its forces from eastern Europe and the Baltics, and bar Ukraine from joining the military alliance.“As for how Russia will act — we’ll act according to plan,” Putin said on Tuesday. “What’s it going to develop from? The real situation on the ground. Who can say how the real situation will develop? Right now, nobody can. It doesn’t just depend on us.”Meanwhile, that “situation on the ground” has become ever-bleaker, even as western leaders pursue their diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions.This week Kyiv experienced what it called its biggest ever cyber attack and watched with dismay as Russian naval deployments in the Black Sea effectively blockaded its ports - the latest manifestations of the aggression Ukraine has faced since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.On Friday, Moscow-backed separatists in Ukraine’s breakaway Donbas region also announced a “mass evacuation” of civilians to Russia, heightening fears that Moscow is seeking to create a pretext for further aggression there.“Putin is putting pressure on all fronts, trying to exhaust Ukraine,” said Oleksandr Danylyuk, Ukraine’s former national security chief. “The population is getting tired. It’s very difficult to live feeling that war can start at any moment.”US president Joe Biden warned on Thursday that Russia was on the brink of invading Ukraine within “several days”. Buttressing that possibility is the fact that Putin cannot, for logistical reasons, indefinitely sustain Russia’s current level of military threat and needs to act soon while his demands for a radical overhaul of Europe’s security order have most leverage.“Putin has marched his troops to the top of the hill. So now what?” said Mark Galeotti, an expert on Russian security. “But Russia can keep this up for many more weeks. He can easily build more barracks and warehouses to house troops and military equipment. I think Putin can and will maintain the pressure for a while.”A senior German official agrees. “Putin can maintain his troops on the border for months. He can withdraw some and mass more again quickly. He can turn on a dime: he is more agile than his 30 [Nato] adversaries, who all have to co-ordinate their responses with each other.”Western analysts and officials also say Russia has in place an extensive network of secret agents who are primed to destabilise Ukraine from within.“If you sit down with Ukrainian counter intelligence, they give you a very detailed sense of the degree of infiltration,” said Jack Watling, research fellow for land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute in London and co-author of a new report about Russian spy networks in Ukraine.“For the moment, it is an open question in Moscow about whether Russia can undermine Ukraine solely using covert measures, or if there needs to be military action as well.”Whether there is an invasion or not, western officials and analysts say Europe faces a new era of cold war-style confrontation with Russia that it must prepare for.“Ukraine is under siege and we need to think about a plan B,” said Mathieu Boulègue, research fellow at the Chatham House think-tank in London. “If we really are talking about war in Europe, we need to act like there is one.”For Ukraine “that means more economic assistance,” added Orysia Lutsevych, head of Chatham House’s Ukraine Forum. “If Russia is seeking to destabilise Ukraine, then we need everything that can help stabilise it.”But the impact extends far beyond Ukraine. The west has prepared an “unprecedented” series of sanctions should Russia invade. While the EU has so far avoided defining the triggers for those sanctions, as that could guide Putin’s behaviour, it is prepared to pay what German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock called on Friday the “high economic price” if they are enacted.Putin said on Friday that sanctions against Russia were “inevitable” but added that he hoped they would collapse. “Sooner or later this boil will pop,” he said.After almost three decades of scrimping on defence spending, Nato is also beefing up its military presence on its eastern flank and France has called for a radical revamp of what it calls Europe’s “nearly obsolete” security framework.The consequences of Stoltenberg’s “new normal” may even extend to the European public’s mindset.“For a generation, many in Europe have not even had to engage with the speculative prospect of war on the eastern front,” said one senior western diplomat. “The possibility was literally unthinkable”.
297  Huawei may be in decline, but other leading Chinese handset makers — Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Realme and Honor — are becoming significant forces behind Apple and Samsung in smartphone shipments, with a major presence expected at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona at the end of the month.But according to the EU, they are enjoying huge cost advantages because of Chinese courts pricing patent licences at half the levels paid in the west.Andy Bounds reports from Brussels that the EU is taking China to the World Trade Organization for alleged patent infringements that are costing its companies billions of euros. Businesses, including Sweden’s Ericsson and Finland’s Nokia, have lost money after China’s supreme court banned them from protecting their patents by securing licensing deals in foreign courts.Instead, they must use Chinese courts to set licensing deals, or face huge fines. It means non-Chinese handset makers are at a competitive disadvantage when setting their prices and foreign suppliers of tech are losing out on licensing fees.The US and Japan have also expressed concerns and are expected to join the EU’s request for WTO consultations. China has 60 days to respond after which Brussels could ask for a dispute settlement panel to rule on the matter.Meanwhile, other Chinese tech companies are suffering from tighter regulation at home. Meituan, which has about 70 per cent of China’s food delivery market, shed $26bn in value on Friday after regulators said they would push to lower the fees food platforms can charge restaurants for delivery.The announcement by China’s state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission, and 13 other agencies came in a package of proposals to help the country’s struggling service industry. The body said it would “guide” delivery platforms to “take another step to lower the service fees charged to restaurants in order to lower their operating costs”.1.

298  Italy will spend €8bn to shield consumers, industry and local authorities from rising energy prices and support the auto industry, as spiralling electricity and gas bills threaten to undermine pandemic recovery.Mario Draghi, prime minister, also warned that any international sanctions targeting Russia’s energy industry — in response to aggression against Ukraine — would hit Italy particularly hard.“All sanctions that impact energy will impact Italy more than any other country because we are gas-dependent, unlike France and Germany,” Draghi said, while unveiling the energy package.“Sanctions must be effective but sustainable,” he added.Italy will spent roughly €6bn to help cut levies on energy bills, and try to shield the poorest households, its most energy intensive businesses and financially fragile local authorities from the full impact of the energy price surge.Rome will also allocate €800mn this year, and €1bn next year, to help Italy’s automotive industry transition to more energy efficient, less-polluting electric vehicles. Details will be decided later.The package is the latest attempt by Draghi’s government to ensure that the country’s rebound from a nearly 9 per cent, Covid-induced GDP contraction in 2020 is not derailed by surging energy bills.“The government wants to prevent rising energy prices from reducing households’ purchasing power and help businesses be competitive,” he said.Rome has already spent some €10bn since last July on trying to hold down consumer power bills. Despite that, Italy’s energy regulator, Arera, raised electricity prices by 55 per cent, and gas prices by 42 per cent at the start of this year.Without the government’s intervention, domestic electricity prices would have increased by 65 per cent in the first quarter of this year, energy analysts say.Industry groups warn that the energy price shock will result in lower corporate profits and higher consumer prices, acting as a drag on the recovery.Antonio Patuelli, president of the Italian banking association, warned at a public forum this month that Italy was facing “an energy crisis the likes of which we have not had so bad since 1973”. He flagged risks of “a new recession” without more active government intervention.Italian industries are expected to face €37bn in energy costs in 2022, up from €8bn in 2019, according to a publication by economists Massimo Beccarello and Ciro Rapacciuolo of the national business lobby Confindustria.“This is an unsustainable level for Italian companies and could lead to business closures in the absence of a meaningful public intervention,” the study said.Draghi said the package unveiled on Friday would not affect Rome’s ability to meet its planned fiscal deficit target of 5.6 per cent of GDP, nor add to public debt.An Italian official said the government has headroom as a result of better than projected fiscal performance last year.Italy depends on imports for nearly three-quarters of its energy needs, according to Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Commission.
299  Europe faces a moment of great peril. Hopes earlier this week that Vladimir Putin was backing away from a potential invasion of Ukraine quickly faded. After Moscow announced some of the troops it had amassed around its neighbour would return to base, satellite images showed the opposite. Russia’s president repeated baseless claims of “genocide” against Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine. By Friday, an upsurge in violence around Russian-occupied Donbas, followed by separatist leaders’ announcement of a mass evacuation of civilians, appeared ominously like a choreographed attempt by Moscow to create a pretext for military action.Western efforts to deter a Russian invasion through diplomatic engagement and warnings of severe economic sanctions may ultimately fail. Yet through their vigorous campaign to counter Russian disinformation, western allies have managed to strip away any surprise, save over the precise timing and form of any attack, and any possible subterfuge about its motives. If an assault occurs, few in the world’s advanced democracies, beyond the political fringes, will be in any doubt that this is aggression based on an artificial crisis stirred up by Moscow.This is a big change from 2014. After protests toppled Ukraine’s Russian-leaning president Viktor Yanukovych, the appearance of Russian troops in Crimea and then east Ukraine caught the world off-guard. Some western intellectuals and politicians were taken in by Russia’s fake narrative of a western-backed “neo-Nazi coup” in Kyiv, used to justify its military intervention to protect Russian-speakers.Today, the west is not playing catch-up with Russia, but is prepared for what may come. The US has shone a spotlight on Russia’s military build-up since at least November, sharing intelligence with allies. That has helped to cement solidarity among western allies, despite some wobbles, and forge consensus over punitive sanctions.This unity may have surprised the Kremlin. Putin clearly assumed that the US, after its ignominious withdrawal from Afghanistan, was weakened and careless with its allies. He calculated that a looming presidential election in France and a political transition in Germany would play to his advantage. But at the Munich Security Conference on Friday, Germany’s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock insisted her country — though it has seemed to waver in its readiness to confront Moscow — was ready to pay a “high economic price for unprecedented sanctions” on Russia, specifically naming the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline as a potential target.The west has been careful, too, to leave Putin an off-ramp, by offering to continue talks on European security. Though the west has made clear it cannot give the absolute guarantees Russia seeks that Ukraine would never join Nato, Moscow would, like its counterparts, have much to gain from revitalised agreements on conventional forces and nuclear arms.If Moscow chooses instead the military path, it will trigger a conflict in Europe on a scale that has long seemed unimaginable. Its human and economic costs are hard to contemplate. It would take the continent into a new phase in its history, in which much of Europe would be in an indirect conflict with Russia.Yet the west has in recent weeks significantly increased the price Russia would pay. It would be a pariah in the western community, facing sanctions that — despite its efforts to “sanction-proof” itself — would have an impact on its economy that could rebound on Putin politically. Russia’s president has in the past been seen as a shrewd tactician. Unleashing war in Europe might prove his biggest miscalculation.
300  Speaking before the UN Security Council, Antony Blinken distilled in just a few minutes Washington’s most dire warnings about Russia’s intentions towards Ukraine — ones that America and its allies fear could become true within days.The secretary of state ran through what he said was Vladimir Putin’s playbook: the misleading military pullback, the false pretexts for war and the manner of the potential attack on his neighbour, using tanks, troops, missiles and cyber attacks.Yet Blinken knew that in order to be credible in levelling such accusations, America had to deal with the legacy of Colin Powell and the George W Bush administration. Speaking to the very same body in February 2003, Blinken’s late predecessor gave a now infamous presentation about Iraq’s possession of weapons of mass destruction — an assessment that would later be roundly debunked.“I am mindful that some have called into question our information, recalling previous instances where intelligence ultimately did not bear out,” Blinken said on Thursday. “But let me be clear: I am here today not to start a war but to prevent one.”Blinken’s words were the latest salvo in a high-stakes information war between Moscow and Washington over the fate of Ukraine — one that Joe Biden’s administration has openly embraced. Having been blindsided by Russia’s 2014 invasion of Crimea and its 2015 intervention in Syria, Washington wants to dominate the narrative before any conflict breaks out.The US effort has included an almost unprecedented, methodical real-time declassification of sensitive information — in many cases, co-ordinated with western allies.Not only have US and western officials detailed the huge build-up of Russian military forces along Ukraine’s border, but they have also warned repeatedly of “false-flag” operations, plots to create a puppet government in Kyiv and the many ways that an assault might unfold.A senior Biden administration official told the FT that their purpose was to make an “invasion harder to execute, and then should it be executed, to make it harder to claim legitimacy”. But the US official added that it was also about openly countering Russia’s repeated use of misinformation over the past 15 years to gain strategic advantage.“We have learned a lot about how Russia uses the information space as part of the theatre of war. We have seen them run these kinds of plays before in Ukraine and Georgia, across Europe, in Syria,” the senior Biden administration official said. “We have not just learned from that and learned how to counter it, I think we have learned to take the fight to them”.If accurate, the published intelligence suggests that US officials have managed to get to the heart of Putin’s methods and reasoning in a way that they have struggled to do for decades.However, some in Europe and Ukraine fear that the US approach might exacerbate the risk of conflict by making diplomacy more complicated. US officials also know they face a strong tide of public mistrust — not least because of the intelligence used to justify the Iraq war.The western claims have been derided in Moscow as inaccurate, fanciful and provocative. Russian officials accuse Washington of stoking tensions and undermining any chance of a diplomatic solution to the stand-off. Russia has denied it has any plans for a full-blown invasion of Ukraine.“Please announce the schedule of our ‘invasions’ for the coming year. I’d like to plan my holiday,” quipped Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for Russia’s foreign ministry.The barrage of intelligence about Putin’s plans has been especially striking because it has become harder to spy on the Kremlin over the past three decades.One former US intelligence official says that in the early 1990s, the arrival of mobile phones and the “indiscreet” nature of Russia’s elite meant its government could be read “like an open book”.But Putin, a former KGB officer, is harder to analyse. Meetings with him are limited to a small circle of trusted advisers, which means the chances of getting information leaked from the heart of the Kremlin are slim.Putin’s circle has shrunk further still due to his extensive social distancing precautions. Even defence minister Sergei Shoigu was forced to sit at the other end of a comically long table from the president at a meeting on Monday.“Nowadays Russian politics is a lot more controlled.it’s not what it was in the 1990s, and we see a lot less of it,” says the former US intelligence official. “These people now are trained security operatives and so their discipline is much better.”Still, some developments have worked in the west’s favour. “We have good technology and we have good overhead capabilities, and we can get into other countries computer networks,” said the former intelligence official. There is also a growing abundance of so-called “open-source” intelligence — meaning it is available to anyone who knows where to look — which is increasingly used by intelligence agencies. Examples include social media postings, military publications, information made available on the Russian internet and even newspaper articles. “We have some very, very good [intelligence] collection on Russia,” the former US intelligence official said. “Often the problem is not so often getting the information, but processing the information.”“It’s piecing a puzzle together, and more often than not there are a lot of missing pieces and you can’t construct the puzzle. A lot of the time it’s judgment.”The US started ramping up its strategy of sharing and releasing intelligence on Russia’s plans for Ukraine back in October when the signs of a military build-up along the border became an increasing concern.According to the senior Biden administration official, the US began to hold a series of videoconferences and in-person meetings to share intelligence about Russia with other countries, moving beyond its traditional Five Eyes intelligence alliance and also involving the North Atlantic Council, Nato’s main decision-making body.“We wanted to have a shared understanding with allies and partners so that we could co-ordinate what our policy responses to these developments would be. It’s harder to keep allies together if people have different understanding of what the facts on the ground are,” the US official said.The next step was to share the information publicly, which began in December with the release of the first details of Russia’s troop build-up along the Ukrainian border. But this involved overcoming the intelligence community’s traditional reluctance to release their findings for fear of compromising sources and methods.“I remember being in meetings and learning things that I thought it would be useful to tell the American people about and to tell the world about,” says Michael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia. “And there were so many times that our intelligence community said, well, we can’t do that because that would expose the ways by which we acquired this intelligence,” he adds.John Sipher, who served as a former CIA agent based in Moscow, says there were periods when the US would routinely hold back intelligence in the hope of building a better relationship with Moscow. “We had a tremendous amount of information on Putin’s money and his efforts to murder people and so on,” says Sipher. “And the administration would not want to publish it and would say — ‘no, let’s give him a chance and mend relations.’”However, after a very tumultuous relationship between the White House and the intelligence community under Donald Trump, and a rough start under Joe Biden with the Taliban taking control of Afghanistan last year, Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence, and Bill Burns, the CIA director, appear to be working in lockstep with the rest of the administration.“To do this sort of thing quickly and seamlessly, they would all have to agree on the strategy and be a part of it. If people did not want to do this there would obviously be sniping and moaning, and you’re not seeing that,” says Anthony Vassalo, a former US intelligence officer now at Rand’s national security research division.The US drive to share intelligence has generally been supported by its European allies, though some worry the strategy could hurt the chances of dialogue with Moscow.“It’s a way of saying — we know what you’re up to. And that’s a way to put pressure on the Russians. [But] we believe you shouldn’t escalate in public,” says one German official.“Germany’s intelligence assessment is the same as the US and UK one. The Russians have everything in place for an invasion. But the question is: how do you interpret this information? The US and UK assume he’s going to act. But we see it slightly differently,” said another German official.In Ukraine, officials including Volodymyr Zelensky, the president, have played down and at times bristled at some of the intelligence disclosures, for fear that they would sow panic in the country. But others say they have been effective and necessary.“We would rather build a worst-case scenario because.it’s better that we prevent something from happening than to actually learn that it was true after that happens,” says Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian defence minister and current adviser to the Zelensky administration.“If you are reactive, you are already catching up with Russia, and Russia already has the initiative,” he says.“Undoubtedly the regular public release of intelligence is working as a massive deterrent,” adds Mychailo Wynnyckyj, a professor at Kyiv-Mohyla Business School in Kyiv and the author of the book Ukraine’s Maidan, Russia’s War. “Putin has been completely deprived of any element of surprise.”The senior Biden administration official concedes that intelligence is just a “series of reports and inputs” that can offer a “picture” but “almost never a perfect smoking gun”. Yet overall it showed a “remarkable consistency” about Putin’s plans, helping to push US allies and partners towards a more muscular stance that they hope has put the Russian leader off kilter and maybe even changed his calculations.“If one of Putin’s objectives was to divide the transatlantic alliance, or to create confusion.that has already demonstrably failed,” the administration official says, adding: “We would love nothing more than to be wrong about all of this. We can’t let the hope that we’re wrong about this block us or hinder us from telling the truth about what it is we are seeing”.But the strategy could have unintended consequences. Some in Washington question the tactics. “Every time [the US] pre-bunks information or exposes these plans, it runs the risk of looking like the boy who cried wolf. In always talking about the pretexts for the invasion, my fear is people tune out or that strategy loses its potency,” says Andrew Lohsen of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.In Moscow, Alexander Gabuev, senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center, says in Russia the intelligence leaks are already being portrayed as the west’s version of disinformation. “We don’t know whether the US has really good intelligence or not. I think a lot of the assessments could be worded a lot more carefully, and we know that Biden has a habit of slips of the tongue. But what I think the current flow of information really undermines is the belief in Russia in global media.they have become partisan, don’t check facts, and just basically believe everything the government tells them,” says Gabuev.The most damning critique of the US tactics comes from a Kremlin official who suggests they might be pointless.“This is all in one man’s head. Only he knows when and how to escalate or tone things down,” the Russian official says. “He has decided that this is the right place and time to make these demands. He worked in security for so many years — you and I can’t even imagine all the threat scenarios he sees in his head.”Additional reporting by Guy Chazan in Berlin and John-Paul Rathbone in London
301  The French government is set to pump more than €2bn into EDF in an effort to restore the state-controlled energy group’s finances, which are suffering due to nuclear reactor outages and production declines just as it gears up for investment in new plants.EDF, which on Friday reported a rise in profits and revenues for 2021, faces big setbacks this year. Its electricity production forecasts have dropped to their lowest point in three decades, with five of its 56 nuclear reactors offline as it inspects flaws in pipe weldings.The company will also shoulder some of the cost of government measures to cap electricity bills for households and businesses this year at 4 per cent — a move that senior managers had argued against, people familiar with the matter said.EDF estimated a net hit of some €13bn to its core profits this year from this double-whammy, as price rises offset part of the bleed. Core profits had advanced 11.3 per cent year on year in 2021 to reach €18bn, helped by a higher nuclear output and trading revenues.The government, which owns almost 84 per cent of EDF, said it would plunge €2.1bn into the group as part of a planned €2.5bn rights issue. The company also said it would offload €3bn worth of assets in the next two years.“EDF is going through a bad financial patch,” French finance minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters on a call. He said it was “vital” to inject fresh funds into the company as it gears up for investments in nuclear reactors and renewable energy projects, adding the state support was a “very strong signal aimed at private investors to say they can put their trust in EDF”.EDF shares were down 2.6 per cent in early afternoon trading in Paris.French president Emmanuel Macron last week announced the biggest nuclear power push in France for decades, going full tilt on atomic energy as part of a lower-carbon strategy as he heads towards an election in April.This will include building six next generation European Pressurized Reactors at an estimated cost of almost €52bn.Jean-Bernard Lévy, EDF chair, called Macron’s energy initiative “a turning point for the next three decades” and a moment of “refoundation”.“The current constraints must not prevent us from moving forward. Last week’s announcement[s].position us as a major player in France’s industrial recovery,” Lévy told analysts.Financing plans for the nuclear push could take several years to define, he said, adding that a broader overhaul of EDF’s structure, which has sparked EU antitrust concerns, could be reviewed after the French election.Part of the nuclear push will be funded by the state, but EDF is expected to have to borrow to finance the programme, as it also invests in extending the lifecycle of existing plants.The state-backed capital injection was partly aimed at avoiding further credit downgrades this year, a French government official said, adding that EDF had needed fresh funds and not nationalisation, because that would not provide new money.The stand-off between EDF and the government over energy price caps has fuelled questions over whether the group, which listed in 2005, should be returned to full state ownership.EDF is having to sell more of its nuclear power at reduced prices to rivals in order to help keep electricity bills low in France. The measure meant it was forced it to buy back some of the power it had already sold on wholesale markets at high prices, and sell it on at subsidised rates.Le Maire said the pain caused by the price caps was “anecdotal” compared with the estimated €11bn hit to core profits from reactor outages. EDF estimated it would miss out on €8bn in core profits due to the state measures and as it postpones tariffs increases.EDF’s net profit in 2021 rose almost eightfold to €5.1bn, helped by cost cuts and asset sales.
302  The EU is taking China to the World Trade Organization for alleged patent infringements that are costing companies billions of euros, as part of what officials in Brussels claim is a “power grab” by Beijing to set smartphone technology licensing rates.Businesses, including Sweden’s Ericsson, Finland’s Nokia and Sharp of Japan, have lost money after China’s supreme court banned them from protecting their patents by securing licensing deals in foreign courts, the European Commission said.Chinese courts set licence fees at around half the market rate previously agreed between western technology providers and manufacturers such as Oppo, Xiaomi, ZTE and Huawei, it added.The lower licensing fees set by Beijing deprive smartphone makers and other mobile telecommunications businesses of a crucial source of revenue to reinvest in research and development.“It is part of a global power grab by the Chinese government by legal means,” said a European Commission official. “It is a means to push Europe out.”Smartphone makers have agreed global standards for telecommunications networks. In return, technology manufacturers must license their patents to others. If they cannot agree on a price, they go to court to set it. Chinese courts generally set prices at half the level of those in the west, meaning their companies pay less for the technology from overseas providers.In August 2020, China’s Supreme People’s Court decided that Chinese courts can impose “anti-suit injunctions”, which forbid a company taking a case to a court outside the country. Those that do are liable for a €130,000 daily fine and the judgments of courts elsewhere are ignored.The policy of driving down licence costs has been backed by the People’s Congress, China’s national assembly, although it has not been put into legislation, the commission alleged.After Ericsson lost a court case, it said licensing revenues would fall by €100mn-€150mn a quarter. US technology R&D company InterDigital and EU research institutes such as the Fraunhofer network in Germany, which also license new technologies, have also suffered. Companies reinvested licensing fees in research, the commission said.Valdis Dombrovskis, EU trade commissioner, said: “We must protect the EU’s vibrant high-tech industry, an engine for innovation that ensures our leading role in developing future innovative technologies. EU companies have a right to seek justice on fair terms when their technology is used illegally. That is why we are launching WTO consultations today.” The EU believes China’s actions are inconsistent with the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (Trips).Liren Chen, president and chief executive of InterDigital, said: “In recent years, anti-suit injunctions have been abused by certain Chinese companies that are opposed to a level playing field for intellectual property disputes related to technologies such as 4G and 5G.“Brussels’ lead will safeguard the billions of euros that innovators invest in R&D in Europe and worldwide every year and we hope that other stakeholders follow this lead in enacting measures to protect innovation.”Huawei declined to comment. The Chinese foreign ministry, ZTE and Oppo did not respond to requests for comment.The US and Japan have also expressed concerns and are expected to join the EU’s request for consultations. China has 60 days to respond after which Brussels could ask for a dispute settlement panel to rule on the matter.It is the second case the commission has launched against Beijing at the WTO in a month, after China blocked all imports from Lithuania in a dispute over its relationship with Taiwan.Letter in response to this article:Companies face legal uncertainty over smartphone patents / From Ian Harvey, Former Chief Executive, British Technology Group, Former Chair, UK Government’s IP Advisory Committee, Fetcham, Surrey, UK
303  It has long been conventional wisdom in Washington political circles that American voters don’t care about foreign policy. So much so, in fact, that the last time I substituted for Ed Luce here at Swamp Notes, I predicted that a complete collapse of the Afghan government after a US pullout would probably not affect Joe Biden’s standing at home.I’m sure that you, dear reader, were as surprised as I was to find out that I was dead wrong on that. In fact, the collapse in Biden’s job-approval rating can be pegged almost to the date that the Taliban over-ran Kabul. The last time the president’s approval rating was above 50 per cent was the week before the US-backed Afghan government disappeared; he has been below 50 per cent ever since — and is now struggling to stay above the 40 per cent threshold.The fall of Kabul came at the same time that a lot was going wrong for Biden: the Delta surge was dashing hopes that mass vaccinations would bring a quick end to the pandemic; Democrats in Congress were fighting over Biden’s domestic spending plans; and fears that inflation was something more than transitory were beginning to grip average Americans.Taken together, these events punctured the image of competence that helped Biden defeat the slightly more mercurial Donald Trump. But given the centrality of the Afghan collapse to this litany of woes, I thought it was worth revisiting the assumption that foreign affairs have a limited impact on domestic political standing — particularly now, with a land war in Europe in the offing.This week, for the first time since Vladimir Putin began amassing troops on the Ukrainian border, there were signs the Russian president might blink. First, there was the Austin Powers-esque long table meeting with Sergei Lavrov, where Putin’s foreign minister seemed to suggest the US had made substantive diplomatic overtures that could preclude an invasion. That was followed by a Kremlin announcement that some Russian troops deployed to the border regions were heading back to barracks after a series of drills.By week’s end, those hopes were dashed by intelligence showing Russian troops actually increasing at the Ukrainian border and White House warnings that an attack was again “imminent”. Still, Biden has won rare bipartisan support for his ability to rally the west; to go toe-to-toe with the Kremlin in the information war; and to strike the proper balance between carrots offered (diplomatic negotiations) and sticks threatened (sanctions). If Putin does step back from the brink, could Biden reverse his political slide at home?I rang Jason McMann, the head of geopolitical risk analysis at Morning Consult, a Washington-based polling and research firm that recently released a detailed study of global opinion on the Ukraine conflict. Although the report showed Americans divided over Biden’s handling of the crisis (39 per cent approve, 40 per cent disapprove), they overwhelmingly support the policies he is pursuing. They back his troop deployments to eastern Europe, for instance, as well as his diplomatic engagement. Perhaps most hearteningly, they overwhelmingly support the right of Ukraine to join Nato.I asked McMann whether he thought foreign policy was becoming more central to voter opinion about US political leaders, and he pointed to an interesting data point in his Ukraine study: normally, when Americans are asked about an overseas event, the percentage who volunteer “don’t know” or “have no opinion” hovers between 20 and 25 per cent. But when they were asked whether they were concerned about a Russian invasion of Ukraine, only 9 per cent said they had no opinion — a clear sign that the vast majority of Americans are paying attention.“It goes to the fact that even a smallish country like Ukraine can now capture the attention of the American public,” McMann said.Like almost everything else in modern American politics, McMann thinks the trigger for this change was Donald Trump. He said that Trump’s trade war with China appeared to be a tipping point, a moment where Americans began to view the geopolitical as domestic. Trump’s “America First” nationalism also played a part, McMann added, putting the naked promotion of American interests abroad at the centre of what constitutes Trumpism at home.That thesis rang true to me, particularly when you consider Biden’s foreign policy team came into office touting the slightly mealy-mouthed principle of a “foreign policy for the middle class”. They were probably looking at the same polling data as McMann, and tried to meld what they wanted to do abroad with the new domestic awareness of its impact at home — particularly with regard to China.Still, McMann is not convinced that a Putin blink over Ukraine will significantly shift Biden’s fortunes in the longer term, and certainly not enough to change Democratic prospects in November’s midterm elections. Like most political victories, Biden could get a short-term boost in the polls, he suggested, but nothing more.With China, however, McMann sees a foreign policy issue with more staying power. “Until recently, you didn’t have major debates about China as a great power,” he said. “We now see it coming back time and again.” And if Biden didn’t get China right, he added, he would pay for it with American voters.My question for you, Rana, is whether you think pointy-headed foreign policy wonks like me have finally convinced the average American to pay attention to international affairs. You’ve written a lot about free trade and its impact on middle America, so I suspect you agree with McMann — that China is a singular case, where working-class voters see their stagnant wages and shrinking number of factory jobs as directly tied to China’s rise as a manufacturing power. But I can still hope, can’t I?Edward Luce is on book leave and will return in mid-March. Peter, thanks for joining me in the Swamp over the past two weeks. I’m fascinated by McMann’s take, which dovetails with a column that I’m planning to write for Monday entitled “It’s the geopolitics, stupid.”It’s fascinating to me that the usual economic statistics — unemployment rates, wage hikes, even GDP — have been so strong recently, and yet confidence is so low. A big chunk of that is how inflation bites at America’s kitchen table. But that connects to geopolitics — energy inflation is in part about Ukraine and Russia and Europe. I think this gets to the larger point you make about how middle America understands at some deep level that we are going through a paradigm shift.We are moving from a neoliberal world in which the markets knew best and all boats were rising, to one in which politics matter and things that happen in small, faraway countries can change the story on the ground at home. The world isn’t flat, after all. In fact it never was. As you know, this is one of the big topics of my upcoming book, Homecoming: The Path to Prosperity in a Post-Global World (hey, never miss an opportunity for book promo!) out in October. Americans understand that the world is changing, that we are in a new great power conflict with China (and its vassals, like Russia), that we will shift to either a bipolar or (more likely) a tripolar world (with Europe sitting in between and tugged both ways) and that this will bring conflict. I think that’s one reason savings rates have been elevated recently. My advice? Read less David Ricardo and more Carl von Clausewitz.Thanks again for joining Peter! Swamp readers, you can look forward to my colleagues Gideon Rachman and Richard Waters joining me in the coming weeks.And now a word from our Swampians.In response to ‘Dark money comes into the light’: “Thank you for your comments on private equity today. Even though I used to manage pension investments, I could hardly stomach some of the PE houses, their attitude and their false smiles. There is one particular global house where I would count my fingers after shaking hands with their consultants. I often asked myself how come a particular PE GP partner could retire at 40 to sunny climes with a young family if not for the carry interest paid by — you guessed it — us so-called sophisticated institutional investors!I do believe that far too many ESG commentators have concentrated their firepower on the publicly quoted equities and not enough comments have been made on the PE funds. I assume it is because they can’t obtain information publicly due to the deliberately managed opaque PE funds. Anything that the SEC can do to regulate the PE industry will get my support. I wish the UK government can get its fingers out and do likewise.” — Swamp Notes reader
304  The writer is director of the Carnegie Moscow CenterThe European security crisis is peaking off. The dates which, according to US president Joe Biden, were set for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have passed. The Russian-Belarusian military drills are going to end on February 20, and Russia’s naval exercises in the Black Sea are also going to end soon.Crucially, President Vladimir Putin authorised foreign minister Sergei Lavrov to continue negotiating with the US on European security issues — even though Moscow’s core demands have not been met. True, the Russian parliament has called for formal recognition of the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, but at this point it looks more like another instrument to pressure Kyiv into implementing the Minsk accords than a real prospect. If the war alert is receding, what are the takeaways?The Kremlin has not succeeded in getting the US and Nato to formally withdraw their invitation to Ukraine and Georgia to join the alliance, and to forswear any further enlargement. However, it has gained something else. Washington has demonstrated that it will not send US forces to Ukraine even if it were attacked and facing defeat and occupation. This is essentially the same as saying that Nato will not admit Ukraine as long as Russia views this as a casus belli.And not only for 10 years, as US officials suggest, but as long as Russia persists in its opposition, which may mean indefinitely. Thus, no Ukraine in Nato, and no Georgia either, unless Moscow changes its mind. Nothing in hand for the Kremlin, of course, but real security guarantees are provided by those seeking them, not granted by opponents.By contrast, another Russian demand — banning intermediate nuclear forces from Europe — appears to stand a chance of being codified in some form of written agreement. The US proposals handed to the Russians open a path to negotiations on that issue. When Putin made a similar proposal in 2019, he was ignored. Not this time.The reason was probably less the deployment of Russian forces along Ukraine’s borders than the successful testing of Russian hypersonic missiles, such as the Zircon, which could counterbalance any deployments of American INF systems in Europe. In addition, US proposals on mutual transparency may contribute to resolving the longstanding dispute about the capabilities of a Russian cruise missile suspected to have a longer range and the US Aegis Ashore missile defence system that might be converted for INF purposes.This, of course, does not add up to the west succumbing to the Kremlin’s “ultimatum”. But if Putin accepts it as an important first step towards reforming the European security architecture from its current US-dominated, Nato-heavy model to a structure supported by two pillars, one western and one Russian, and regulated by arrangements between the two, will the Kremlin be able to sell the outcome to the Russian people? Or will Russians see the whole exercise as a useless and dangerous adventure and, even worse, as a diplomatic defeat for Putin, who was confronted by the west’s joint forces, blinked and began withdrawing Russian forces from the Ukrainian border?One needs to keep in mind that most Russians, while fully exposed by the country’s state-run television to the west’s fears of war and accusations of Moscow’s misbehaviour, never believed in the possibility of a war with Ukraine. That same TV made no attempt to prepare the Russian population for some sort of “liberation of Ukraine”. If anything, some Russians feared a possible attempt by Kyiv to regain Donbas by force, on the model of Mikheil Saakashvili’s ill-fated 2008 strike in South Ossetia — a move to which Moscow would have to respond.Most serious Russian analysts did not think that Moscow would launch a major offensive against Ukraine. True, geopolitical tensions and the prospect of severe sanctions led to a substantial drop in the value of Russian stocks and depressed the rouble. Still, stock prices are not a useful measure of Russia’s economic health. As for rouble volatility, it came with a sharp rise in the oil price to $95 per barrel, the highest since autumn 2014. Finally, the story of grumbling, or worse, in the ranks of long-retired siloviki, or figures with a military and security background, has been blown out of proportion. To many members of that group, Putin has been too lenient on Ukraine and its western backers.The passing of the peak of the crisis does not mean it is over. At best, we will be on a plateau of high tension, where both sides will continue to use various means of hard power and the information war will carry on unabated. But — and this is an important but — diplomats will be negotiating on the issues where agreement is possible even now, making the worst scenarios less likely.Perhaps the most serious takeaway from the crisis concerns not Russia but Ukraine. It is now official: the US and Nato will not defend Ukraine in case of a major attack. It was true this past week, and it will remain true in the years ahead. Given this precious piece of intelligence, Kyiv will have to look for other ways of managing its security. The idea of neutrality for Ukraine, aired then played down by Vadym Prystaiko, its ambassador in London, is interesting. The US and Nato might not have to withdraw their membership promise to Ukraine if the bid itself were dropped.
305  The International Olympic Committee president has sharply criticised the team of Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva, describing their treatment of the teenager as “chilling” after she fell repeatedly in her final competition.Thomas Bach used uncharacteristically terse language towards her “entourage” in his final press conference of the Beijing Winter Games, after the 15-year-old finished fourth and was berated by her coach Eteri Tutberidze.“I must say I was very, very disturbed yesterday when I watched the competition on TV,” Bach said on Friday.Valieva fell and stumbled several times during her routine on Thursday and was reprimanded by Tutberidze after she left the ice. “Why did you stop fighting? Explain it to me,” she demanded, according to television footage cited by Bach.Several competitors in the women’s free skate ended the event in tears, including Valieva, the pre-Games favourite to win gold who failed a doping test last week.The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that Valieva would be allowed to compete pending an appeal against the positive test, prompting anger from rival athletes. The case has renewed criticism of the IOC’s handling of Russia, which was officially banned from sporting events in 2017 over a state-sponsored doping programme at the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014.Bach called Tutberidze’s treatment of Valieva “chilling” and pushed for investigations by the World Anti-Doping Agency and Russia’s anti-doping authorities into Valieva’s entourage to be concluded.Wada said on Monday that “there is a requirement to investigate that athlete’s support personnel” when the athlete is underage.“We are dealing with a minor, with a 15-year-old girl who obviously has a drug in her body that should not be in her body. Who has administered this drug in her body?” Bach said.Dmitry Peskov, Kremlin spokesman, responded to Bach’s criticism by saying “of course, we respect his opinion but disagree with him sometimes”. He continued: “He [Bach] is displeased with the harsh posture of our coaches, but everyone knows that a tough coach is a token of pupils’ victories in high-achievement sports.”Tutberidze has been under scrutiny for her tough treatment and coaching of young Russian skaters, who have enjoyed success by accomplishing difficult quadruple jumps before retiring. Neither of the two Russian women who won gold and silver at the 2018 Games and were coached by Tutberidze, who were teenagers at the time, are still competing.Katarina Witt, the two-time Olympic figure skating champion from the former East Germany, has described the Russian programme as a “throwaway society” for young athletes.Jon Solomon, editorial director of the sport and society programme at the Aspen Institute think-tank, wrote on Twitter that the women’s figure skating final “looked like child abuse on ice”.When asked why the IOC did not do more to intervene in Valieva’s case, Bach said “we have extremely limited means to address it, because we are not the police, we cannot interrogate”.The doping scandal has roiled the Olympics, overtaking other controversies such as the IOC’s relationship with China and Beijing’s human rights record in Xinjiang, where more than 1mn ethnic Uyghurs have been interned in forced labour camps.The IOC has also been criticised for its dealings with tennis player Peng Shuai, who last year made sexual assault allegations against a former top-ranking Chinese official before retracting them and largely disappearing from public view.At a press conference on Thursday, Yan Jiarong, a spokesperson for the Beijing Olympic organising committee (Bocog), referred to allegations about Xinjiang as “lies”, in a response to a question about the region. She also stated that Taiwan was an “undividable part of China”. Beijing claims sovereignty over Taiwan and has threatened to invade if Taipei refuses unification indefinitely.Bach said the IOC was in touch with the Bocog immediately following the press conference, after which both organisations “restated their unequivocal commitment to remain politically neutral”.
306  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.EU leaders meeting in Brussels yesterday managed to put up a united front on Russia, given that their discussion was kept brief and vague enough to avoid any disagreements over what type of aggression against Ukraine would trigger sanctions.It also helped that one of the Russia-friendly voices, Hungary’s Viktor Orban, wasn’t present for the Ukraine discussion. (He was busy receiving Brazil’s populist president Jair Bolsonaro instead, who was the only recent guest at the Kremlin not to be seated at the comically long table.)One idea being raised is for the European Commission to find ways of compensating the most hard-hit member states for the economic impact of the sanctions and Russia’s likely countermeasures. We’ll give you the rundown on what was discussed and what to expect in the near future.Meanwhile, the EU-African Union summit is likely to end today with a statement agreed by all delegations — after negotiators ironed out remaining issues over vaccine patent waivers and language on gas as a fossil fuel that can continue to be part of developing nations’ energy mix.Speaking of gas, Italy’s Mario Draghi left the summit early yesterday, even skipping a roundtable he was supposed to co-chair at the EU-African Union summit, as he rushed back to Rome to finalise details of a support package for Italian households hit by the rise in gas prices.With Nato defence ministers having met yesterday and restated their support for Ukraine and Georgia, we’ve caught up with Denmark’s minister — the only Scandinavian country both in Nato and the EU.We’ll also look into Greece’s latest trouble over alleged migrant pushbacks after an international investigation into the death of two African migrants washed up on Turkey’s shore.On their way out of yesterday’s informal council on Russia, EU leaders stressed how united they were in the face of a potential attack on Ukraine and how little credence they gave to Moscow’s alleged steps towards de-escalation, write Valentina Pop and Sam Fleming in Brussels.In a sign of their determination, said EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, the union has now prepared its sanctions package, saying that when the moment comes we will “act decisively”.But beneath the broad agreement over the need for robust sanctions against Russian finance, businesses and individuals lie a number of differences between member states on how to respond to the Ukraine crisis. Here’s a list of issues that remain contentious, even if leaders steered clear from tussling over them yesterday:Energy, pharmaceuticals and the car industry would be among the sectors most affected by an EU-Russia sanctions tit-for-tat, given that they are the most-traded products, according to Eurostat. (More here)In a sign of how Russian aggression has stiffened Nato resolve, Denmark’s defence minister said the country would reinforce its presence in the Baltic states and Greenland, writes Andy Bounds in Brussels.Morten Bodskov, who took the job only this month, told Europe Express that while Copenhagen backed dialogue it was boosting its defences. Denmark’s priority is increasing its military presence in the “far north”, where Russia is active in the Arctic Sea, and in the Baltics.“When it comes to the Baltic countries we have a lot of support in parliament for supporting them. We are a small country but we have a lot of capability,” he said.Denmark has committed to the Nato target of spending 2 per cent of gross domestic product on defence. Its level has been growing but is only about 1.4 per cent. “When we will reach it is a political question. It is a lot of money to find,” Bodskov said.The Greek government is in hot water again over migration, after an international media investigation alleged that two African asylum-seekers died after likely being pushed back by Greek authorities, writes Eleni Varvitsioti.The report published yesterday in the Guardian, Der Spiegel, LightHouse Reports and Mediapart investigates the case of a 36-year-old man from Ivory Coast and a 33-year-old Cameroonian who boarded a dinghy on the Turkish coast to cross over to a Greek island in September 2021.Although the two men did reach the northeastern shore of Samos, their bodies were found a few days later close to Turkey’s shore. The allegation is that they were apprehended by Greek authorities, put into a speedboat and then pushed into the water where they drowned.Athens in recent years has been heavily criticised by NGOs and human rights groups for systemically denying entry to asylum seekers coming mainly via Turkey.Last month, the UN refugee agency called for an urgent investigation after the death of 19 people in the Evros region who froze to death after Greek authorities allegedly left them without clothes in freezing temperatures on the Turkish side of the border.Greece’s ministry of migration and asylum denied the allegations and called yesterday’s report “Turkish-driven propaganda”, stressing that Greece has been protecting the external border of the European Union “in full compliance with international law and in full respect of the charter of fundamental rights”.According to the ministry’s data between 2015 and 2021, the Hellenic coast guard rescued more than 230,000 third-country nationals who were in danger at sea.
307  Joe Biden has warned that Russia is on the brink of invading Ukraine within “several days”, saying the US believes the Kremlin is engaged in “a false flag operation to have an excuse to go in”.The US president spoke as Kyiv and Moscow blamed each other for clashes in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region — incidents the west fears will be used as a pretext for a co-ordinated Russian military campaign.Russia reiterated its threat to take “measures of a military-technical nature” after it complained that the US had “twisted” draft proposals Moscow put forward to address its concerns about European security.Biden is set to discuss the crisis with transatlantic leaders on Friday. Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, invited his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to meet in Europe next week to prepare a possible summit of pivotal leaders to resolve “mutual security concerns”.Late on Thursday, Ned Price, the state department’s spokesperson, said Russia had responded with possible dates late next week for a meeting with Blinken, which the US accepted, conditional on Russia not having invaded Ukraine.“If they do invade in the coming days, it will make clear they were never serious about diplomacy,” Price wrote on Twitter.Speaking at the White House earlier on Thursday, Biden offered a bleak assessment of the situation, noting there was a “very high risk” of a Russian invasion. “Every indication we have is they’re prepared to go into Ukraine, attack Ukraine,” he said. “My sense is it will happen in the next several days.”While Biden said a diplomatic path to resolving the crisis remained open, his words reflected growing pessimism across western capitals and more bellicose rhetoric from Moscow.Global stocks dropped and traders took shelter in haven assets on Thursday as tensions ratcheted up. The S&P 500 fell 2.1 per cent and Nasdaq was down almost 3 per cent, while ultra-safe US government bonds rallied, with the 10-year Treasury yield falling 0.08 percentage points to 1.96 per cent.Asian equities continued the falls on Friday, with Japan’s Topix shedding as much as 1.3 per cent in morning trading and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng down as much as 1 per cent.The heightened tensions in eastern Ukraine came as Moscow and Washington exchanged barbs over the prospect of reaching a diplomatic solution.In a letter published on Thursday, Russia’s foreign ministry said the US had “not given a constructive response” to its core demands, which included calling on Nato to pledge never to admit Ukraine and to roll back its eastward expansion.Blinken said he was evaluating the letter but echoed Biden’s warnings over an imminent Russian attack on Ukraine, telling the UN Security Council it would be a concerted assault involving “ground troops, aircraft, ships” and cyber attacks on crucial institutions.Russia said it was willing to discuss other issues such as arms control, but only as part of its core grievances with Nato, which western leaders have said are unacceptable.Earlier on Thursday, the Ukrainian army claimed that “Russian occupation forces” controlling breakaway eastern regions had shelled more than 20 separate locations, including a kindergarten in a village in the Luhansk region, injuring two civilians.The Donbas flare-up was the latest development in a smouldering conflict that has claimed about 14,000 lives in the breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk since erupting in 2014 after Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula.Russia backs separatists in Donbas but denies — despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary — that it is a party to the conflict. Moscow blamed Ukraine for the escalation and Dmitry Peskov, Kremlin spokesperson, said the shelling “was a subject of very, very deep concern”.Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukrainian president, rejected the accusations, describing the incidents as “provocative shelling”. Liz Truss, UK foreign secretary, said the reports of “alleged abnormal military activity” by Ukraine in Donbas were a “blatant attempt by the Russian government to fabricate pretexts for invasion”.The increased fighting in Donbas comes as the US, UK and Nato continued to rebut Russia’s claims this week that it was pulling back some of its forces from the border with Ukraine.The White House has called “false” the Kremlin’s assertion that it was withdrawing forces from the border and accused Russia of increasing its troop presence in the region by about 7,000 in recent days.Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, said the west was fanning “hysteria” by accusing Moscow of not withdrawing its troops. “This is where the escalation is,” Lavrov said according to Interfax.Russia ordered Bart Gorman, deputy chief of the US mission in Moscow, to leave the country, an expulsion the US state department described as “unprovoked”.Additional reporting by Hudson Lockett in Hong Kong
308  Wall Street and European stocks sank on Thursday as the US said Russia was on the brink of invading Ukraine within several days.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index faced the brunt of the losses, sliding 2.9 per cent, while the blue-chip S&P 500 closed down 2.1 per cent. The market declines this year have wiped more than $3tn off the value of US stocks, with the S&P 500 down over 8 per cent.Linda Thomas-Greenfield, US ambassador to the UN, said in a tweet that “the evidence on the ground is that Russia is moving towards an imminent invasion”.Speaking at the White House later on Thursday, US President Joe Biden said there was a “very high risk” of a Russian invasion, adding he believed that Moscow was engaged in “a false flag operation to have an excuse to go in”.The selling in the US was broad-based, with 85 per cent of the stocks in the S&P 500 declining. Thursday’s slide ranked among the five worst trading days of the past year for the benchmark index.Market measures of volatility also jumped. The Cboe’s Vix volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, jumped to 28.1, above its long-term average.“The [stock] market was under pressure already, with geopolitical tensions now adding to that,” said Hani Redha, global multi-asset manager at PineBridge Investments. “It was already raining and now it’s pouring.”Russia’s Moex share index dropped 3.7 per cent, while the rouble lost 1.6 per cent against the dollar. Elsewhere in Europe, the region-wide Stoxx 600 index closed 0.7 per cent lower and London’s FTSE 100 dipped 0.9 per cent.Financial markets have whipsawed over the past week as the developments in Ukraine and threat of tighter monetary policy to tamp down surging inflation have weighed on investors.Oil has fluctuated this week as investors have speculated about possible western sanctions on Russia and their effect on fuel supplies. Brent crude, the international benchmark, settled at $92.97 a barrel, down 1.9 per cent from the previous day.“I think the Ukraine situation has a lot of people spooked and there has been a flight to safety.We don’t know what the sanctions are going to look like, but there is going to be an impact on energy,” said Michael Loukas, chief executive of TrueMark Investments.The market unease spurred investors to seek haven assets such as government debt and gold.The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note, which moves inversely to its price, fell 0.08 percentage points to 1.96 per cent, while the yield on the equivalent German Bund dropped 0.04 percentage points to 0.23 per cent.Gold neared $1,900 per troy ounce, rising 1.5 per cent.Money markets have priced in six quarter-point interest rate rises by the Federal Reserve this year after US inflation surged to a four-decade high in January.Minutes from the Fed’s policy meeting on Wednesday highlighted its officials’ determination to combat stubbornly high prices, although some warned about the risks posed to markets and the wider economy by tightening policy too quickly.In Asia, Japan’s Topix fell 0.8 per cent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng trimmed losses from earlier in the day to close 0.3 per cent higher.Additional reporting by Hudson Lockett
309  Philip Lane, chief economist of the European Central Bank, has shifted his position on eurozone inflation by saying it looks unlikely to drop below its 2 per cent target in the next two years.“Inflation is expected to settle around 2 per cent,” Lane said on Thursday, citing higher expectations of investors, analysts and consumers, and structural changes in the economy. “In terms of asset purchases it is a different path than if it was going to spend a period below 2 per cent.” The shift in Lane’s position matters because the expected level of inflation in 2023 and 2024 is the main factor governing whether the ECB will accelerate plans for removing the vast stimulus it has provided via bond purchases and negative interest rates during the pandemic.His comments mark a change from only three weeks ago when Lane said inflation was equally likely to drop below the ECB’s target and to stabilise at that level in the medium term. Since then, record eurozone inflation of 5.1 per cent prompted its president Christine Lagarde to say inflation risks were “tilted to the upside” while refusing to rule out raising rates this year.Lane is one of the most important influences over ECB monetary policy and his comments underline how a consensus is forming on its governing council about the need to withdraw its stimulus faster than planned when it meets in three weeks’ time.If policymakers judge that inflation is on track to hit its target over the next two years it clears a path for them to end net purchases in the ECB’s €4.8tn bond-buying programme and to prepare the ground for raising interest rates for the first time since 2011.Lane told a webinar organised by market news and data provider MNI that he did not want to prejudge next month’s meeting. He said the change in inflation expectations was not “staggeringly huge” so any change in policy would still be gradual.He also drew a distinction between a likely “normalisation of policy” — widely interpreted as ending asset purchases and raising its deposit rate to zero — and a more drastic “monetary tightening” to push up financing costs and slow growth that would be required if inflation was likely to remain well above its target for several years. “That is not what we see in front of us,” he said.“Impressive to see how fast a consensus at the ECB could be built on normalisation,” Carsten Brzeski, head of macro research at ING, said on Twitter. “Only unsolved questions are: when to hike the deposit rate and what to do when once the deposit rate is back at zero.”The ECB in December forecasted inflation would fall back below its 2 per cent target by the fourth quarter of this year and remain at 1.8 per cent for the next two years, justifying continued stimulus. But it is widely expected to raise these forecasts next month.Lane said: “There are several factors indicating that the excessively low-inflation environment that prevailed from 2014 to 2019 — a period over which inflation averaged just 0.9 per cent — might not re-emerge even after the pandemic cycle is over.”He said the factors lifting inflation expectations included the ECB’s massive fiscal and monetary stimulus in response to the pandemic and last year’s simplification of its inflation target from “below but close to 2 per cent”. Although Lane said digitalisation could reduce prices, he also cited structural shifts that may increase them including higher wages in emerging markets, China’s move from focusing on exports to domestic demand, a push to lower carbon emissions and ageing populations.
310  Spain’s main opposition People’s party has descended into fratricidal strife, as Isabel Díaz Ayuso, the charismatic leader of the Madrid region, accuses the PP’s leadership of seeking to “destroy” her through fabricated corruption claims.The split between Díaz Ayuso and Pablo Casado, the PP’s national leader, involves allegations of bribes for public contracts and could determine the future direction of the centre right party.“It is very painful when leaders of your own party, instead of supporting you, want to destroy you,” Díaz Ayuso told a press conference on Thursday. “There’s nothing more serious than accusing one of your own, with government responsibilities, of corruption and doing so without proof, putting my family in the middle.”She added that reports in the Spanish media earlier on Thursday detailing anonymous allegations about the national party’s suspicions concerning possible corruption in Madrid “come from Pablo Casado’s circle”. The spat could significantly damage one or both of the party’s two most high profile politicians just when the PP is seeking to regain political momentum and contend with the rise of Vox, its rival on the hard right, after disappointing results in Sunday’s regional elections in Castile-León region.“This is a massive battle,” said Pablo Simón, a professor of politics at Madrid’s Carlos III University. “If it goes on, it will be much more likely that the Socialists keep national power in the next election [due by the end of 2023], that Vox is strengthened and that the PP’s prospects are undermined.”The focus of the corruption claims is the suggestion — which Díaz Ayuso forcefully denied — that her brother Tomás charged a private company commission for a €1.5mn public contract for anti-Covid masks. Meanwhile, PP leaders denied reports that they or others on their behalf had asked private detectives to illegally spy on Tomás Díaz Ayuso.Díaz Ayuso said Casado had told her in September he knew about the mask transaction and considered it illegal. She added that while her brother “confirmed that he had commercial relations with the business [that won the contract] it was completely legal” and that her administration had not intervened in the contract.Tensions between Díaz Ayuso and Casado have already weakened the party’s poll standing, robbing the PP of the momentum it had gained from the Madrid leader’s triumph in a snap election in May.On Thursday, Teodoro García Egea, the PP’s number two, acknowledged that the party leadership had no proof against Díaz Ayuso, but said she had not co-operated with its inquiries. He linked her attack on Casado with a bid she is making to take control of Madrid’s party machinery as well as its regional government.“After acknowledging today that there have been payments, Isabel Díaz Ayuso has made very serious, almost criminal, accusations against the PP leader,” he said. “This has never happened before in our party.”The rift between the two leaders also has more fundamental implications.The PP’s failure to win an overall majority in its traditional redoubt of Castile-León has further undermined Casado, whom many rank and file supporters see as less effective than Diaz Ayuso.The party now has to decide what kind of relationship it will have with Vox, which more than tripled its vote in Sunday’s poll.While Casado insists his party must not form an administration with Vox in Castile-León, for fear of setting a precedent in other regions or the country as a whole, Díaz Ayuso has indicated she could favour such an arrangement.
311  Natalia Potanina’s $41.5mn divorce settlement, awarded by Russia’s courts, did “not even begin to meet [her] reasonable needs”. Having acquired a UK investor visa and some English property, she turned to London courts to secure a bigger share of assets from ex-spouse Vladimir Potanin. Reputed to have a $30bn fortune, he owns a controlling stake in Norilsk Nickel, one of the world’s largest producers of nickel and palladium.London lawyers do a roaring trade representing clients from Russia and Ukraine. A big slice of that would be in jeopardy if Russia invades its smaller neighbour and tough sanctions are imposed. Law is just one part of a high-end service industry for wealthy people from ex-Soviet nations that is now the subject of rueful discussion in the UK.In the 12 months to last March, Russians were the third biggest group of litigants in London’s commercial courts based on almost 300 judgments logged by PR consultancy Portland Communications. Ukraine was fourth, up from 11th the previous year. Taken together, Russia and former Soviet states Kazakhstan and Ukraine leapfrogged the US to the number two slot with 80 litigants.This highlights a vulnerability as Whitehall, galvanised by Russia’s moves on Ukraine, beefs up sanctions against Russian individuals and businesses. Oligarchs’ fondness for London extends to capital raising, trading, buying homes and dealmaking — all of which require legal services. Russian and Ukrainian tycoons value the UK’s relatively fair, uncorrupt and predictable legal system because their own courts are none of those things.It is also relatively easy to enforce rulings in a place where so many litigants have assets. That advantage would swiftly unravel if sanctions trigger a withdrawal of capital. Russians would likely choose another locale to litigate, as it could prove difficult to enforce claims or damages. Lawyers might be prevented from taking them on as clients in the first place.Imposing sanctions would jeopardise a rich and growing seam of UK legal business. But lawyers could hardly complain, given the military adventurism the penalties would be a response to.
312  RWE has raised its full-year earnings guidance as the German utility emerges as a big winner from the energy crisis that has driven the cost of power and gas to record highs and fuelled inflationary pressure across the continent.Citing a “dynamic market environment”, the company said it now expected to generate €3.6bn to €4bn of adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in 2022, up from an earlier forecast of €3.3bn to €3.6bn.“It all boils down to higher energy prices,” said Lueder Schumacher, analyst at Société Générale, referring to the new profit forecasts.He said the earnings upgrade had been driven by RWE’s often overlooked Dutch biomass business, which turns waste from the wood and paper industry into pellets that are burnt to generate electricity, plus its non-core nuclear and coal-fired power plants, which managed to secure higher generation margins.German baseload power prices surged last year, rising from about €50 per megawatt hour in January 2021 to a record €438 in December, before retreating this year to less than €200 MWh.RWE’s biomass business in the Netherlands benefits if market prices rise above a maximum level set by the government, which they did in December when power prices across Europe surged to record levels.RWE expects its gas, biomass and hydro power unit to deliver adjusted ebitda of €700mn to €900mn this year, up from an earlier estimate of €550mn to €650mn. In coal and nuclear, guidance has been revised to a range between €650mn and €750mn, up from €550mn to €650mn.Schumacher said it was good news that most of the upgrade was attributable to RWE’s biomass business, and that Germany’s biggest power producer could raise guidance further later in the year.About 30 per cent of RWE’s output from wind and solar farms is not contracted and should benefit from high prices when hedges are rolled over.RWE is one of several German power generators, notably Uniper, that sought extra financing in recent months based on expectations that gas prices would remain volatile into the next winter.Security of gas supplies remains a big concern in Europe, particularly with concerns over a Russian invasion of Ukraine still high. Germany, Europe’s largest gas importer, plans to pass measures in spring that would force energy companies to build up reserves.RWE shares rose 5.4 per cent to a near 11-year high of €38.90 on Thursday, extending gains of the past year to 20 per cent.“With our diverse portfolio, both from a technological and geographical point of view, RWE is a reliable generator of electricity,” said RWE’s chief financial officer Michael Müller. “In a dynamic market environment, we are able to secure higher generation margins.” RWE is due to publish its annual results on March 15.
313  France and its European and west African allies have announced they will shift the focus of their anti-terrorism campaign in the Sahel eastward to Niger and south to the Gulf of Guinea after being pushed out of Mali by an unco-operative military junta.“The two terrorist organisations al-Qaeda and Isis have chosen to make Africa — particularly the Sahel and now increasingly the Gulf of Guinea — a priority in their strategy of expansion,” French president Emmanuel Macron told a news conference in Paris on Thursday.France and European countries contributing to a combined special forces group called Takuba that helps Sahel governments fight Islamists have said they cannot work with Mali’s military rulers, who have rejected demands for a return to democracy and hired nearly 1,000 mercenaries from Russia’s Wagner group to protect themselves.A joint declaration by France and its European, African and Canadian partners in the Sahel military operations said they were ready to extend their support to “neighbouring countries in the Gulf of Guinea and west Africa”. Macron said they would withdraw from Mali, which has been at the heart of the French-led campaign since French forces recaptured northern towns such as Timbuktu from the Islamists in 2013, over the next four to six months and redeploy over the border in Niger.The French president was flanked by two west African allies, presidents Macky Sall of Senegal and Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana, whose countries’ northern regions fringe the Sahel. Both said they appreciated French and European military support for the region.French officials have said Paris has about 4,300 soldiers in the Sahel, of whom nearly 2,500 are in Mali. In all, there are 25,000 international military personnel in the region, including those with UN peacekeeping operations and an EU military training mission, both of which are expected to maintain a presence in Mali.Islamist militants — long active in the Sahel region on the southern fringes of the Sahara — have recently been targeting coastal states such as Nigeria and Benin. Nine people were killed in three bomb explosions in northern Benin earlier this month. France later announced that its forces in neighbouring Burkina Faso had killed 40 jihadis it said were responsible.Speaking after Thursday’s announcement, Akufo-Addo said terrorists could not be allowed to “find a permanent home in west Africa”, having been chased from the Middle East and Afghanistan.“All of west Africa, including the coastal states.[is] vulnerable to the penetration of terrorist outrages,” he said. “We are therefore re-examining with our friends and partners the manner in which we can respond.” Akufo-Addo is head of the Economic Community of West African States, which together with the EU has imposed sanctions on Mali.Sall, who is currently head of the African Union, said on Thursday: “We’re glad that commitments have been renewed to stay in the region and reorganise the forces. The struggle against terrorism in the Sahel cannot be a matter only for African countries.”Mali’s armed forces spokesman Souleymane Dembele shrugged off France’s announcement. “I think that there has been no military solution, because terrorism has engulfed the entire territory of Mali,” he said, according to Reuters.A former Malian diplomat said: “I understand the French reaction and I also understand the frustrations that Malians have based on the perceived failure of a French intervention that has been going on eight years.“It’s clear France saved Mali in 2013 when terrorists were heading down towards Bamako. But we’ve come a very long way since 2013,” the former diplomat added. “The French have exceeded their stay and their mandate. They have gone way beyond the military intervention they were asked and have interfered quite a lot in Malian politics.”Macron said he rejected the suggestion that French operations had failed, arguing that Mali would have collapsed or part of it been turned into a caliphate without the intervention nine years ago, while French forces had been successful in keeping terrorist groups at bay and killing their leaders.But he did lay out new ways of adapting the operations, including a focus on the Gulf of Guinea, more investment in government services such as schools and a reduced military footprint with mobile support for national armies rather than large fixed bases.Additional reporting by David Pilling in London
314  The White House has called the Kremlin’s claims that it is withdrawing forces from the Ukrainian border “false” and accused Russia of increasing its troop presence in the region by about 7,000 in recent days.“Yesterday, the Russian government said it was withdrawing troops from the border of Ukraine.we now know it was false,” a senior Biden administration official said on Wednesday.“In fact, we have now confirmed that in the last several days, Russia has increased its troop presence along the Ukrainian border by as many as 7,000 troops, with some arriving as recently as today.”US officials declined to provide more details to substantiate the claims, but said the intelligence was “fairly authoritative”. On Tuesday, President Joe Biden said Russia had concentrated about 150,000 troops on its border with Ukraine and in neighbouring Belarus.“Just as Russian claims about withdrawing troops were false, so will be whatever false pretext they invent to justify this war of choice. No one should take these claims at face value,” the official added.The UK offered a similar assessment. “Contrary to their claims, Russia continues to build up military capabilities near Ukraine,” said Jim Hockenhull, the UK’s defence intelligence chief. “This includes sightings of additional armoured vehicles, helicopters and a field hospital moving towards Ukraine’s borders. Russia has the military mass in place to conduct an invasion of Ukraine.”The comments are the latest in the war of words between western allies and the Kremlin over the increasingly tense situation in Ukraine. Russian officials maintain they are withdrawing some of the troops as they pursue a diplomatic solution, but western officials say those comments are at odds with signs of advancing military preparation for an assault.On Thursday Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary-general, repeated that Russian troops remained poised on the borders of Ukraine. “We have not seen any sign of withdrawal or de-escalation,” he told a Brussels meeting of the alliance and the defence ministers of Georgia and Ukraine, who are partners but not members of Nato.Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, has maintained that Russia is withdrawing some of its forces and accused Nato of having a “handicap” that prevented it from “soberly assessing the situation”.Vladimir Chizhov, Russia’s ambassador to the EU, told Die Welt newspaper there would be no escalation “next week or the week after, or next month”.The Nato defence ministers’ summit will be followed by the two-day Munich Security Conference in Germany, which will be attended by several western allies as well as Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukrainian president.Zelensky on Wednesday expressed scepticism over the Russian claims, telling the BBC: “To be honest, we react to the reality we have and we don’t see any withdrawal yet. We just heard about it.”Kamala Harris, US vice-president, will lead the American delegation to the conference in Munich, joining Antony Blinken, secretary of state, among other officials.Senior Biden administration officials said Harris was attending to send a “resounding signal that engagement with our allies and partners is an absolutely critical part of our overall diplomacy and approach”.The vice-president is expected to meet on Friday with Stoltenberg and leaders of the Baltic nations, before delivering a speech to the conference on Saturday. She will also speak with Zelensky and Olaf Scholz, German chancellor, US officials said.Additional reporting by Andy Bounds in Brussels and Max Seddon in Moscow
315  Air France-KLM wants to free itself from bans on acquisitions “as soon as possible” by repaying state aid as it plans to raise €4bn in fresh capital.Ben Smith, the Canadian executive in charge since 2018, told the Financial Times the Franco-Dutch group was also pursuing a “plan B” to industry consolidation, with a push to expand its low-cost routes.In addition, he aims to further integrate the airlines in the hunt for cost savings, overcoming some resistance from Netherlands-based carrier KLM.The plans were revealed as the group reported improved revenues and a lower-than-expected loss for 2021, with fourth-quarter operating income above pre-pandemic levels as long-haul flights pick up again.The airline said it was considering options for a capital raising of up to €4bn, including a rights issue and quasi equity debt issues, that would help repay state aid.“We want to have the flexibility to participate [in consolidation] where it makes sense,” Smith said, adding however that the group had “no gun to our heads” in terms of timing.Shares in Air France-KLM fell 5 per cent to €4.27 by mid-morning on Thursday in Europe in reaction to the capital-raising plans that would heavily dilute shareholders, analysts said.Air France-KLM received €10.4bn in support in 2020 when the coronavirus outbreak hit, including through direct French and Dutch state loans. A €4bn recapitalisation was backed by Paris last year, which included a ban on acquisitions.That is stifling expansion plans in areas such as cargo or maintenance and proving a hindrance at a time when German rival Lufthansa is circling Italy’s ITA Airways.Smith has sought to mend ties with French unions as part of efforts to restructure Air France, the struggling partner in the group formed by the merger with KLM in 2004 and which has cut close to 8,000 full-time jobs in the past two years. The group is aiming to return to profitability in its French market by 2024.Part of the overhaul has included shifting resources to low-cost carrier Transavia, which could form a greater part of an alternative plan if external moves remained off the table, Smith said. This would include building up connections between French cities outside Paris, such as Nice, and other European capitals.“We can’t stand these remedies and we’re doing everything we can to pay back the state aid as quickly as possible,” Smith said. “We are not totally hamstrung.”Air France-KLM could still potentially look at ITA, the former bailed-out Alitalia, or consider a commercial agreement that could lead to taking an equity stake in the company further down the line, Smith said.But the group would not “lose sleep” if one or two independent carriers, such as ITA, Norwegian or SAS, were picked up by competitors, he added, saying that he did not see a scenario of a larger or more threatening takeover of a group such as Ryanair materialising.Smith has been pushing for greater cost savings between Air France and KLM, against a politically charged backdrop. The French state holds almost 30 per cent of Air France-KLM, and the Netherlands 9 per cent.KLM’s chief executive, Pieter Elbers, long seen as a defender of more independence for the Dutch carrier, is now set to leave by the middle of next year at the latest.Smith, who aims to lift depressed margins at the group, said recent steps such as joint aircraft orders across the carriers were a start.“It’s so obvious that the true enemies of the group are Lufthansa Group and IAG [the owner of British Airways], and when you see opportunities like this and they’re presented properly, it’s a no brainer,” he said.Air traffic has begun to recover since the start of the pandemic but has yet to return to 2019 levels. Transatlantic capacity at Air France-KLM could exceed pre-pandemic levels by the third quarter of this year, Smith said.Air France-KLM posted a €127mn loss in the fourth quarter. That was lower than a year earlier, however, and less than expected by analysts. Operating income came in at €178mn, higher than in the fourth quarter of 2019.Asked whether rules that require airlines operating in the EU to be controlled by EU investors should be strictly applied following Brexit, Smith said the group would not be “holding back our efforts to make sure they are”.The rules could create challenges for the likes of IAG or Ryanair because of their ownership structure, according to some analysts, although UK-EU trade talks are still to be finalised.
316  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.The long-delayed summit with African leaders that starts today in Brussels was supposed to be an opportunity for the EU to repair relations damaged by decades of meagre investments, a patchy record on security assistance and a fixation with sending back migrants.But that exercise may now get overshadowed by an EU leaders’ informal council on Russia, called at the very last minute, which starts around noon and in which leaders are likely to ask Germany’s chancellor and France’s president about their recent trips to Moscow. I’ll run you through the timeline of events and what to expect from today’s meetings. Also, here’s the FT’s take on the rather sceptical stance of African leaders ahead of the summit.Across town, Nato defence ministers are meeting again today and will hear from their Ukrainian counterpart who tunes in from Kyiv via video link. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg yesterday said Russia continued to increase the number of troops it had massed on the Ukrainian border, despite Moscow’s insistence that it was withdrawing forces.Meanwhile, in what Brussels insiders will appreciate as a blast from the past, we’ll bring you a mini-profile of former eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who was briefly back in the news yesterday with his scathing criticism directed not at a southern eurozone government, but at his very own.And in digital regulatory news, we’ll explore why negotiations on the Digital Services Act are off to a rocky start, with red lines only getting brighter, as per a confidential document seen by Europe Express.The EU-African Union summit is set to disappoint anyone expecting large amounts of fresh EU money or vaccine donations. Those looking for clear semantics will also be underwhelmed, given differences over whether this is a partnership or an alliance.In addition, Russia-Ukraine tensions and Vladimir Putin risk absorbing much of European leaders’ attention — something that could not have come at a worse time for the bloc’s ambition to repair relations with Africa and offer a counterbalance to China’s investment strategy.As EU leaders prioritise a hastily planned informal meeting on Russia/Ukraine and keep their African counterparts waiting, several questions remain on the actual “deliverables” expected to emerge from the summit.One of the protagonists of the most recent euro crisis involving Greece, former Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, is back with the same abrasive tone that he espoused when chairing the eurogroup a few years back, writes Eleni Varvitsioti who wrote this book on the topic.In 2015, when Greece was heading towards default, Dijsselbloem’s direct manner was one of his strongest traits when he was called to broker a compromise. A few years later his bluntness irked southern nations when he implied in an interview that they had spent their money on “drinks and women” and then asked for solidarity from the countries of the North.This time, however, Dijsselbloem’s criticism is directed against his own government. As head of the Dutch safety board, an independent investigative body, he made a quick reappearance yesterday bashing the Rutte government (of which he used to be a member) on its unpreparedness to deal with a protracted national health crisis since the pandemic began two years ago.Dijsselbloem spoke of a “silent disaster” that hit nursing homes, with residents accounting for half of the country’s coronavirus-related deaths between March and September 2020.“The health crisis spilled over into the biggest social crisis we have seen in decades,” he said.The direct manner for which he was notorious during the last Greek crisis was easily recognisable. According to the report, the Dutch government was “fixated” on hospitals, giving “scant attention” to the elderly, as protective equipment was distributed primarily to hospitals. When the gravity of the situation became clear, the government issued a ban on visits to nursing homes, which had a psychological impact on the elderly in nursing homes.The board concluded that the government could have improved its response by seeking wider advice rather than just on the effects of acute care.Dijsselbloem’s bluntness and his lack of popularity in southern eurozone nations were among the reasons he lost the race to lead the IMF in 2019, when Christine Lagarde switched to the European Central Bank.The 55-year-old was first elected to the Dutch parliament in 2000 as a member of the Labour party and catapulted into frontline politics when appointed finance minister in 2012. Despite being still a relatively unknown politician in Europe, he emerged as the lead candidate for president of the eurogroup in 2013 in the midst of the euro crisis.A few months after he was appointed, he was heavily criticised when he oversaw a decision to impose a levy on Cypriot bank depositors — even those with less than €100,000, normally protected by EU law. The plan was withdrawn shortly thereafter.An agricultural economist by training, he is famously down-to-earth, having lived on a riverside farm and spending his free time raising chickens and pigs. During his stint at the eurogroup, his driver would always have shoe polish in the car, in case Dijsselbloem needed to clean mud from his shoes before heading to official meetings.Negotiators from the European parliament, member states and the European Commission are off to a bumpy start on upcoming tech regulation, as they disagree on how much responsibility businesses should have when policing the internet, writes Javier Espinoza in Brussels.Confidential notes from the second so-called trialogue meeting on the Digital Services Act seen by Europe Express show that the text (which the French EU presidency wants to finalise by June) is still riddled with bones of contention.Here are the main red lines:
317  Charles Michel, president of the European Council, calls it a “new alliance between Africa and Europe”. President Emmanuel Macron of France refers to a “New Deal with Africa”. Last week Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, promised €150bn of investments in the continent by 2027 as part of the EU’s Global Gateway, its counter-offer to China’s Belt and Road Initiative.Yet as leaders from both continents descend on Brussels on Thursday for the start of a much-delayed two-day EU-Africa Summit, some African delegates are wondering what the new alliance is all about.“I think there’s a bit more excitement from the European side than from the African side,” said Lidet Tadesse Shiferaw, associate director of the European Centre for Development Policy Management. “The EU is an important partner to the African continent, but it’s no longer the main or the most important partner,” she said. “The EU could be setting itself up for failure by announcing so many flagship projects to woo the African side.”The summit comes at a time of strained relations. France is preparing to pull troops out of Mali after Bamako’s military government hired Russian mercenaries to fight terrorists and expelled the French ambassador. Europe has watched nervously as generals in Mali, Burkina Faso and Guinea have toppled civilian governments and as offshoots of Isis and other jihadist groups gain ground from the Sahel to central Africa.A lot of goodwill has been lost over Covid vaccines, with Europe accused of helping to propagate “vaccine apartheid” by snapping up Covid jabs and opposing a waiver of intellectual property rights. Europe has also been criticised for allegedly discriminatory travel bans on countries such as Nigeria and South Africa, the latter of which alerted the world to the Omicron strain of Covid-19 in November.Many African leaders are also wary of Europe’s green agenda, which they see as an attempt to block hydrocarbons projects that they argue are needed to industrialise and to bring electricity to the 600mn Africans without it. In his inaugural speech as chair of the African Union, Macky Sall, president of Senegal, said ending the financing of gas projects would “thwart our efforts for social development.it is legitimate that our countries demand a fair and equitable energy transition”.European and African leaders spend much time talking past each other, said Aanu Adeoye, an analyst at Chatham House, a UK think-tank. “It feels like there’s a disconnect in terms of what the priorities for both sides are,” he says, citing as an example differing views on immigration where “the Europeans are mostly interested in stopping the flow of migrants, while African countries are interested in talking about growing their economies”.“The Europeans rightly or wrongly feel the need to talk about human rights.and the rule of law, but a lot of times leaders don’t want to be preached at,” said Adeoye, adding that the Europeans don’t always live up to their own moral standards. “In Libya, the EU is essentially paying for the Libyan coastguard to keep people in check and these guys are employing tactics that wouldn’t be acceptable on European soil.”Apart from concerns about flows of migrants from a continent whose population is expected to nearly double to 2.5bn by 2050, much of Europe’s attempt to recast the relationship is a reaction to China’s perceived success in cementing trade and investment ties. Trade between China and Africa rose in the first two decades of the century, hitting $176bn in 2020. Trade between EU states and Africa, though higher at about €225bn in 2020, has stagnated over the past decade.“I think the Europeans are very nervous about losing ground in Africa,” said Geert Laporte, director of the European Think Tanks Group, adding that not only China but also Russia, Turkey and others have made big inroads.Laporte voices European frustration at what he characterises as an essentially transactional relationship in spite of all the talk about shared values and alliances. “The two parties always say we want a partnership beyond finance and beyond aid,” he said. “But always it turns around money.”Yunnan Chen, senior research officer at the Overseas Development Institute, a UK think-tank, argues that Europe can compete with China “for economic and soft power” but only if it learns what China, which has no colonial baggage, has got right as well as where it has fallen short. “Africa should not simply be viewed as a venue for strategic competition, but one that holds intrinsic opportunity.”Michaël Tanchum, a policy fellow at the Africa programme of the European Council on Foreign Relations, also makes the case for a different lens on Africa, which he says has 100 cities with more than 1mn people. “When you look at the next 20 years, where is the supply of affordable labour and where are the markets?” he asked. “Any country that doesn’t have a constructive relationship with Africa is going to lose its relative position in the global economy.”Rémy Rioux, chief executive of the French Development Agency, said Europe was doing better at co-ordinating its financial offering across member states and institutions. “No other region has such a presence on the ground, so it’s really a question of organising ‘Team Europe’,” he said. “We are progressing very rapidly and this summit will only reinforce that.”Tadesse Shiferaw of the ECDPM said that the conversation had changed. The decolonisation movement and Black Lives Matter have shifted the balance between Africa and Europe, she argued. “There’s been a mental and attitudinal shift globally. Europe understands that, but it is struggling to keep up.”
318  In 1946, the Kremlin’s growing aggression was baffling Washington. In order to explain it, George Kennan, an American diplomat in Moscow, wrote his 5,400-word “Long Telegram”. A year later, he expanded his views in an anonymous article for the journal Foreign Affairs. His writings inspired the west’s policy of “containment” of the USSR, which held throughout the cold war, though Kennan often felt it became too aggressive and militarised. Late in life (he died aged 101 in 2005), he opposed Nato’s expansion into eastern Europe.A Russophile who always wanted to write a biography of Chekhov, Kennan took the long view of Russian thinking. In places, his writings eerily anticipate Vladimir Putin, who, as a career KGB officer, is a child of the Soviet system. Kennan can still help us read Russia, in the current crisis and beyond.The Kremlin’s core belief, he explained then, was that a hostile west would collapse under its own contradictions. Russian rulers, he wrote, saw the “outside world as.bearing within itself germs of creeping disease and destined to be wracked with growing internal convulsions”. One day the USSR would deliver the west’s “final coup de grâce”.Putin inherited this worldview, and his life experiences perversely reinforced it. In 1989, stationed in Dresden, he watched East Germany collapse under its own contradictions. In 1991, his own state followed. So he can easily imagine western societies collapsing, too.To hasten their collapse, Kennan warned, Russia would “stimulate all forms of disunity” in the west. “Poor will be set against rich, black against white, young against old, newcomers against established residents, etc.” Much of this would be done on the “subterranean plane.by agencies for which Soviet Government does not admit responsibility”, he wrote, anticipating today’s Russian troll farms.Kennan also warned about the Kremlin’s attempts to split western alliances, which helps explain Putin’s five hours of talks with France’s Emmanuel Macron. And he said Moscow encouraged “western elements”, mostly communists, whose views coincided with Soviet interests. Today’s generation of pro-Kremlin or anti-Nato fellow travellers include Donald Trump, Tucker Carlson, Gerhard Schröder, Marine Le Pen and Jeremy Corbyn.Russia fights the west with untruths, warned Kennan: “The leadership is at liberty to put forward for tactical purpose any particular thesis which it finds useful to the cause at any particular moment.” So Russian officials today deny threatening Ukraine, while saying that western “provocations” could prompt an invasion.Kennan was much warmer towards “the Russian people”. They were, “by and large, friendly to the outside world.eager to measure against it talents they are conscious of possessing, eager above all to live in peace”. By 1946, he added, ordinary Russians were growing disillusioned: “Never since termination of civil war have mass of Russian people been emotionally farther removed from doctrines of Communist Party.”Today’s Russians are similarly disaffected. Putin used to be untouchable. From 1999 to 2013, Russian GDP per capita jumped twelvefold to $15,974, estimates the World Bank. Then came Putin’s crowd-pleasing annexation of Crimea. But from 2014 to 2020, GDP per capita dropped 37 per cent, while corruption became ever more blatant. Now, Putin has mismanaged the pandemic. Russia’s population decline of over 1mn last year was the worst since the USSR collapsed.Like Soviet rulers of Kennan’s day, Putin mobilises popular support by warning against western invasion. But the foreign threat is illusory. No western democracy has attacked Russia or its neighbours in a century. Russia, sole perpetrator of invasions in its region since 1945, is claiming the mantle of victim.What will Putin do in Ukraine? Kennan emphasised that Russian rulers were cautious. They were in no hurry to bring about the west’s inevitable collapse. This meant western powers could deter them by “firm containment” short of war. I’m guessing Kennan would see the west’s arming of Ukraine as a canny way to raise Russia’s price of invasion. His analysis implies that Putin might take another bite out of Ukraine, but not attempt long-term occupation.Kennan cautioned Washington against seeking to humiliate the Kremlin. The west ought to be able to stand firm, he wrote. After all, its stake in the USSR was “remarkably small. We have here no investments to guard, no trade to lose.” That is less true today. German dependence on Russian gas pipelines and London’s role as laundromat of the Putinist elite’s money create cracks in the west’s alliance.That said, Kennan’s central reassurance still holds: “Gauged against Western World as a whole, Soviets are still by far the weaker force.” He also noted the difficulty of a transfer of power from a long-established autocrat — in his day, Stalin. Kennan turned the Kremlin’s worldview on its head. He agreed that a society was going to collapse, but it wasn’t the west.
319  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.

322  France has called for a revamp of Europe’s security framework, warning that it has become “nearly obsolete” and risks allowing Russia to become a permanent threat on the continent even if Vladimir Putin does not invade Ukraine.Jean-Yves Le Drian, France’s foreign minister, said in an interview that there were “no more rules” governing European security and stability because arms control pacts covering everything from intermediate-range nuclear missiles to transparency on military force movements had become “nearly obsolete or irrelevant”.He said that Russia had to recognise that the EU had its own security concerns, given that Putin wanted to exercise an unacceptable form of “partial sovereignty” over its neighbours, and that agreement was needed to restore long-term stability.Putin “can choose to make Russia a destabilising power.which could mean a permanent strategy of tension over the long term, or he can choose to become the actor, the partner, in a new security and stability order in Europe”, he told the Financial Times. “It’s his choice. It is indeed him who has to decide.”Russia has amassed more than 135,000 Russian troops on Ukraine’s borders, sparking the biggest threat of conflict in Europe in decades, although Moscow insists that it has no plans to invade.In diplomatic exchanges to try to defuse tension, Putin has demanded that Nato pull its forces out of eastern Europe and pledge never to admit Ukraine. The west has said these demands are unacceptable, arguing that Kyiv has the right to make its own decisions, but is trying to find common ground with Moscow on issues such as arms control.“While there is a demand from Russia for stability, for guarantees, there is also a demand for stability and for guarantees from our side,” Le Drian said. “Europe needs guarantees of security and stability. We’re ready to talk about it, about everything.”Le Drian, foreign minister since the start of Emmanuel Macron’s presidency in 2017 and previously defence minister under President François Hollande, insisted that there was no divergence with the US on the assessment of the Russian threat.He outlined a three-phase approach to defuse the crisis: the verified withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine’s borders; a resumption of talks on the Minsk accords to resolve war between Moscow-backed separatists and Kyiv in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region; and a new European security framework.Le Drian said he cautiously welcomed “encouraging words” of troop withdrawals and diplomatic overtures from the Kremlin. But he said he remained “vigilant” about the Russian military build-up and whether more troops would return to base after drills.“If those signs are verified, it’s a small beginning. But we’ll need to see how the manoeuvres in Belarus end, for example, how the manoeuvres in the Black Sea and near the Ukrainian borders end. All of that is part of de-escalation,” he said.“I am like Saint Thomas, I would like to believe, but we need to see real action.We need to be sure that these are not troop rotations but withdrawals.”Le Drian said no one disputed the importance of the Minsk accords and the so-called Normandy negotiation format — involving France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine — to try to end the Donbas war.After years of stalling by Moscow and Kyiv, Le Drian said there was “political will on both sides to resolve this situation”. He said: “There was a meeting [in Berlin] with diplomatic advisers that didn’t progress a lot, but they decided to meet again. So this process is still there, and we need to restore its full strength.”If Putin were to approve the independence of the two Donbas statelets, following a Russian parliamentary resolution to that effect this week, it would be akin to “a weaponless aggression” on Ukraine and would “breach the Minsk accords”, Le Drian said, adding that Putin gave Macron assurances that he did not intend to act on the resolution. Le Drian refused to be drawn on whether such a move by Russia would trigger western economic sanctions.Macron has played an important part in recent western diplomatic efforts to persuade Putin to step back from the brink of war. The two met in Moscow for talks so long that Putin said the French president had “tortured” him for nearly six hours.Since his election in 2017 Macron has courted Putin, declaring that Russia is a great European power with “legitimate” security concerns, and has been accused by some European partners of being too accommodating towards the Russian leader.Le Drian insisted that Macron’s approach had been vindicated because he had sought to establish a combination of firmness and dialogue with Putin while maintaining the unity of European and US allies. He conceded that there had “perhaps been doubt” in Europe, including the Baltic states, over the merits of Macron’s initially uncoordinated launch of strategic dialogue with Putin in 2019.“But it was very shortlived,” Le Drian insisted. “Now everyone is talking to Putin.”Macron showed “we needed to talk to Russia, even if it’s difficult, very demanding, exhausting.because it’s a neighbour, a big one, and it doesn’t intend to move out”.Nato, which embarked on a strategic review after Macron accused it of being “brain-dead” in 2019, has emerged stronger from the crisis as it united in the face of the Russian threat. “It’s a bit of a paradox, because [Putin] has tried to divide us.That failed and didn’t happen.” France is dealing with other Russia-related problems in the west African state of Mali, where the ruling military junta has hired the Russian mercenary group Wagner and is pushing out French troops deployed since 2013 to fight against Islamist insurgents in the Sahel. Le Drian dismissed Putin’s assertions that the Kremlin had no knowledge of the Wagner operations.“I cannot understand how President Putin can be unaware of this situation since they are former Russian soldiers, transported by Russian planes and using Russian weapons,” he said. “Given the amount of intelligence available to President Putin and his closeness to the Wagner chief.one must conclude he knows. He says he doesn’t but I don’t believe him.”
323  The UK is preparing to abolish its so-called “golden visa” regime within weeks, as Russian actions over Ukraine spurred renewed calls to tackle “dirty money” flooding into the UK.The Tier 1 “investor visa” route has in the past attracted wealthy Russian and other international investors, who have resettled in the UK under the scheme.The visas have been under review since the UK’s relations with Russia deteriorated after the poisoning of former Russian agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018.The rules to qualify for investor visas — under which people must show they have at least £2mn to invest in the UK — were tightened up in 2015 and checks on how applicants obtained their money were introduced. Since 2019, applicants must also have proof of a UK bank account.However, allies of home secretary Priti Patel said she was keen to scrap the whole regime due to concerns the system could be exploited by those laundering illicit funds. Government officials confirmed plans were being drawn up to scrap the visas within weeks.Parliament’s intelligence and security committee warned in 2020 that “the exploitation of the UK’s investor visa scheme” was a draw for many Russians. It said the UK had provided “ideal mechanisms” for the recycling of illicit finance, adding it had become a “laundromat” for offshore wealth.The government issued 798 investor visas in the 12 months to September 2021, 82 of which were awarded to Russians. Over the same period, 210 visas were issued to Chinese nationals.“These Tier 1 visas have been a gold-plated invite to launder money in the UK,” said Chris Bryant, a Labour MP who sits on the Commons foreign affairs select committee.“The government has to come clean about how they’ve been abused and the UK has got to stop its addiction to dodgy money. I can’t understand why the home secretary didn’t get rid of them ages ago. She was even on the foreign affairs committee when we recommended it.”In 2018, former home secretary Amber Rudd asked officials to review the basis on which more than 700 wealthy Russians were allowed to settle in the UK under the scheme. After years of delay, the government has committed to publishing its findings before April.The Home Office said: “We reformed the Tier 1 visa route in 2015 and in 2019 to crack down on dirty money and we have not ruled out making further changes.“As part of our work to prevent this route from corruption we are reviewing all Tier 1 investor visas granted before these reforms were made, and will report on our findings in due course.”
324  The EU has for too long lacked a proper toolbox for dealing with backsliding on the rule of law by the likes of Poland and Hungary. Legal action over infringements at the EU’s top court resulted in fines at most; the “nuclear” option of suspending a member state’s voting rights proved impossible to use as it requires unanimous backing. Finally, the bloc is developing new weapons. The European Court of Justice has cleared the way for EU institutions to withhold lucrative funding over violations of the rule of law, throwing out a legal challenge by Warsaw and Budapest. Brussels should use this power, with due care.The bloc adopted its “conditionality” mechanism in December 2020, allowing funding from the EU budget to be withheld from countries where rule of law problems could adversely affect how taxpayers’ money is spent. Hungary and Poland argued it overstepped the EU’s founding treaty. The court’s rejection of their challenge puts funding from the bloc’s cohesion funds into question for Hungary, which is due up to €22.5bn in the 2021-27 budget, and Poland, due €75bn. The EU has already frozen about €36bn for Poland and €7.2bn for Hungary from its separate €750bn post-Covid recovery fund because of their democratic record.Hungary’s nationalist premier Viktor Orban and his Polish counterpart Mateusz Morawiecki have suggested the ruling points to creeping EU “federalisation”. Orban says the bloc is using rule of law as a tool to “mould us in their image”. Such claims are disingenuous. EU taxpayers are entitled to know there are safeguards on how their money is spent, at home and abroad. Enforcing the rule of law is also vital to the single market; individuals and companies need to be sure of impartial justice wherever they do business.The ruling’s timing is problematic, though. It gives Orban a campaign weapon against Brussels ahead of a parliamentary election on April 3 in which, for the first time, he faces a joint opposition coalition. The Hungarian premier is cynically conflating the rule of law issue with a separate dispute with Brussels over his government’s anti-LGBT+ law which, among other things, bans the portrayal of homosexuality or transgender people in sex education. A referendum on that law will be held alongside the election. Orban is set to argue, falsely, that Brussels wants to deny Hungarians funds they are entitled to because the government is banning LGBT “propaganda” in schools.In fact, Brussels’ rule of law case against Hungary centres on inadequate safeguards on awarding EU-funded contracts, from which Orban cronies are alleged to have made fortunes. Brussels alleges Hungary’s prosecutors do not properly investigate misallocations of funds and the independent media is now too weak to be able to.Poland, where concerns focus on judicial independence and a disciplinary chamber for judges that the ECJ found illegal, has made at least some overtures to the European Commission about potential changes. Brussels should allow some time to see if these come to fruition. The need to spend time analysing Wednesday’s ECJ court ruling and ensuring any case against Hungary is legally watertight also gives the Commission cover to avoid acting in the middle of the election campaign.Ultimately, however, Brussels should be ready to use the new tools at its disposal, despite inevitable further legal challenges. Belonging to a club that hands you billions of dollars every year must entail respecting its rules. This is, moreover, not about defending abstract values, but about ensuring courts are independent and tax euros are not misspent. That should concern everyone — in Poland, Hungary, or any EU state.
325  Russia continues to increase the number of troops it has massed on the Ukrainian border, Nato’s secretary-general warned on Wednesday, even though Moscow insisted that it was withdrawing forces.Jens Stoltenberg said the western security alliance was “prepared for the worst” as tension persisted over Ukraine, despite continuing diplomatic efforts to avert conflict even after Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, announced a partial troop withdrawal on Tuesday.“We have not seen any de-escalation,” Stoltenberg said on arriving at a two-day summit of Nato defence ministers in Brussels. “We see they have increased the number of troops and more troops are on their way . . We are prepared for the worst.”His assessment was denied by Moscow on a day when hopes for diplomacy were clouded by conflicting claims over the status of the Russian forces deployed within striking distance of Ukraine’s border.Dmitry Peskov, Kremlin spokesman, said Russia was withdrawing some of its forces. He said Nato had “a handicap” that prevented it from “soberly assessing the situation”.Vladimir Chizhov, Russia’s ambassador to the EU, told Die Welt that “there will be no attack this coming Wednesday”. He added: “Nor will there be any escalation next week or the week after, or next month.”Russia’s defence ministry published footage on Wednesday of what it said were tanks, armoured personnel carriers and mobile artillery leaving the Crimean peninsula — which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014 — and returning to their bases. “Not a single Russian serviceman and not a single piece of Russian military hardware will remain” after the exercises, Vladimir Makei, the Belarusian foreign minister, said on Wednesday.Asked about the Russian footage, Stoltenberg said Russia had often moved troops around but its overall strength in the region was growing. He said there was room for “cautious optimism” after comments from Moscow on Tuesday that there was still time for diplomacy to work.“We are ready for diplomatic talks,” Stoltenberg said, although Moscow had not replied to a letter outlining what the alliance could discuss.Russia’s willingness to draw down its troops on the border has been cast by western diplomats as a key test of whether Putin was serious about a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine crisis.While stressing his openness to discussions with Moscow, Joe Biden, US president, said on Tuesday evening that Russia had concentrated 150,000 troops on its border with Ukraine and in neighbouring Belarus for exercises that are set to end later this week.The US state department has not yet seen signs of de-escalation, spokesman Ned Price said Wednesday. “In recent weeks, and even in recent days, more Russian forces, not fewer, are at the border, and they’re moving concerningly into fighting positions,” he said.Stoltenberg said Russia had moved troops back to base before but left the heavy artillery and other equipment in place. “They can very quickly send personnel back again and they have all the capabilities in place. We need to see a real withdrawal of forces.”Nato is deploying more troops and aircraft to members bordering Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, with 8,500 US troops also on high alert.Nato defence ministers also said they were developing options to deploy new battle groups in central, eastern and south-eastern Europe, adding to similar forces in place in the Baltics.Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary, said the country would come to the defence of any member attacked by Russia. The US had a “rock solid” commitment to collective security, he said.Stoltenberg said ministers would discuss how to combat increasing cyber attacks on Ukraine and the Baltic states. Ukraine and Georgia, which are partners of the alliance but not members, will meet Nato ministers on Thursday morning.“There is a strong military presence at the border of Ukraine but we also see a message from Moscow that they will give diplomacy a chance. We are ready to meet them to talk and find a diplomatic solution but we are prepared for the worst,” Stoltenberg said.“Russia retains the capability of a full-fledged invasion of Ukraine without any warning.”The US state department also noted stories in Russian media outlets that could serve as a pretext for an invasion, including claims of Ukrainian military activity in the Donbas region and Nato incursions into Russian territory, as well as allegations from Russian officials that genocide was being carried out in Donbas. “There is no basis or truth to any of these allegations,” said Price.Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, has voiced scepticism about the reports of de-escalation. Speaking to the BBC at a military training ground in western Ukraine, Zelensky said: “To be honest we react to the reality we have and we don’t see any withdrawal yet. We just heard about it.”Additional reporting by John Paul Rathbone in London
326  Thirty-something years ago, as a rookie reporter in the Soviet Union, I spent a considerable amount of time sitting in various far-flung cities as the communist empire collapsed, either waiting for war to break out or reporting on conflicts. Which is why last week, as the news about Ukraine became increasingly frenzied, I was gripped by an investigative documentary published on YouTube last year by Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader.The film in question, Putin’s Palace, reveals detailed blueprints of a huge, luxurious mansion on the Black Sea coast, complete with helipad, casino, pole-dancing stage and cinema — all built, it claims, for the Russian president at a cost of more than $1bn. At the same time, the film tries to lift the lid on the shadowy network of financiers and oligarchs that surround Putin, allegedly helping make him one of the richest men in the world.While Putin has unsurprisingly dismissed the accusations as lies, the material seems well researched, accurate and distinctly relevant as western governments ponder the merits of sanctions against the individuals and Kremlin-linked businesses that have apparently channelled this money.However, for me, the most startling detail about the film is that while it has a clear anti-Putin agenda, it went viral in the Russian-speaking world. It has received an estimated 150mn views on YouTube, making it the most-watched piece of Russian content on the platform in 2021. A survey by the independent Russian pollster Levada last year found that one-quarter of Russian adults had seen it.As someone who once lived in the Soviet Union, I find this cheering. For one thing, it suggests that Putin’s aura of omnipotence may not be quite as impregnable as it usually seems to westerners. Yes, he has crushed numerous protests, including some sparked by the release of Putin’s Palace. And Navalny is now in jail after surviving an assassination attempt in 2020, and faces a new tribunal this week.But maybe his message cannot be so easily silenced, given this 21st-century form of samizdat (the dissident pamphlets circulated in Soviet times) has reached a far wider audience than the originals ever did. So, it will be interesting to see if fresh variants of cyber samizdat emerge this year, and if this creates new challenges to Putin, particularly if the Russian economy weakens or a Ukrainian war results in mass casualties.The emergence of films such as Putin’s Palace also reveals something uplifting about modern information flows. In some ways, my experience back in the Soviet era carries echoes of what has been unfolding in Ukraine. In Baku, Dushanbe, Riga and Moscow, as in Kyiv today, there was a sense of dread and confusion as people tried to work out what might happen.But what was so different was that everyone, including journalists, lived in a profound information fog. To get “news” — ie to do my job — I would frantically listen to shortwave radio, talk to anyone I could find and offer local telephone operators cigarettes as gifts to secure a line to call my contacts.Sometimes I clambered on to the roofs of tall buildings to scour the skyline, or made my way to the local TV tower, in a bid to get more news. But whatever perspective I had was invariably limited and local.Today a veritable army of citizen journalists is producing and sharing texts, pictures and videos from Ukraine and the surrounding regions. Satellites are beaming details about troop movements on to websites that ordinary citizens can access.Western governments are trying to turbocharge this information flow in a bid to counter Russian misinformation. Transparency has become not just the norm but a weapon of war, in a way that was inconceivable three decades ago.Yet increased transparency does not always produce the results that we might like. One consequence of this tsunami of information and misinformation is a rise in distrust and cynicism. As a recent survey by the public relations group Edelman shows, trust in governments and media has collapsed in many countries over recent years. And citizens are often good at ignoring what they do not want to see or hear.When the Levada pollsters asked Russians last year if their view of Putin had worsened after watching the film, less than one-fifth said it had. The majority appeared to have treated it as confirmation of their existing views (and some supported him nonetheless). Levada’s Denis Volkov recently told the FT that aggressively anti-Ukraine propaganda on state TV had done its job: “Society is ready for war, in that it has absorbed the Kremlin and Russian state media’s depiction of the situation.” Transparency alone is not a magic wand.Yet even if we live in an age marred by misinformation and cynicism, it is still better than the information fog that existed three decades ago. After all, it was the power of social media and transparency that helped to spark the Ukrainian uprising in the first place. So let’s hope that tweets, photos, films and videos continue to pour out of both Russia and Ukraine in the coming weeks, along with enough crowdsourcing to determine their accuracy. And let’s also hope that the internet keeps working, even amid cyber hacks. It truly is a modern miracle.This article has been amended since publication to reflect the fact that Alexei Navalny was poisoned in 2020, not last year
327  The EU’s top court has dismissed the legal challenge of Poland and Hungary to the bloc’s rules, opening the way for Brussels to withhold funding from member states for violations of the rule of law.The European Court of Justice found that the new rule of law conditionality mechanism, which seeks to protect the EU budget from violations by member states, was legally solid and compatible with the union’s treaties. The decision will allow the European Commission to begin procedures within weeks, leading to the imposition of penalties.Wednesday’s ruling is the latest development in an increasingly fraught stand-off over the rule of law. The EU is mired in multiple disputes with member states over respect for its founding principles including judicial independence.The conditionality mechanism was agreed by the EU in 2020 as part of the budget deal that brought in the bloc’s €800bn coronavirus recovery fund. Poland and Hungary challenged the legislation in the EU court, demanding the rules be annulled on the basis that they were not compatible with the treaty and breached principles of legal certainty.The mechanism allows the commission to hold back EU funding where necessary to protect it from misuse resulting from rule of law violations. EU officials have examined cases against a number of member states in the past year, but Hungary and Poland are seen as the most likely initial targets.The ECJ said on Wednesday it “dismisses the actions brought by Hungary and Poland in their entirety”. The new law, it found, “respects in particular the limits of the powers conferred on the European Union and the principle of legal certainty”.Ursula von der Leyen, the commission president, said officials would analyse the court decision before adopting guidelines in the coming weeks covering how to apply the mechanism in practice. The commission, she added, was assessing certain cases “in depth” and would “act with determination” when the conditions in the regulation were fulfilled.Roberta Metsola, president of the European parliament, said the chamber expects the commission to apply the rules “swiftly”.Zbigniew Ziobro, Poland’s hawkish justice minister, called the ECJ’s ruling “a historic moment of change in the EU from an area of freedom into an area in which it will be possible to apply illegal force to take away those freedoms from member states.and to limit their sovereignty”.He also used the ruling to lash out at his rival, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, accusing him of a “very serious political, historic mistake” for accepting the introduction of the mechanism.Morawiecki said that “centralisation, federalisation [of the EU].is a dangerous process”, but that the ruling did not come as a surprise to the Polish government.“The ECJ has become a political actor,” said Judit Varga, Hungary’s justice minister. “We have had long debates with Brussels but this is a new level.”Hungary is considered in Brussels as presenting the most clear-cut case for action. Budapest is in the line of fire because of weaknesses in the country’s procurement rules that have stoked concern over corruption linked to the dispersal of EU funds.The key concern regarding Poland revolves around judicial independence and on its disciplinary chamber for judges, which the ECJ has found to be illegal. The Polish constitutional court in October intensified the dispute with the EU over judicial values after finding that parts of EU law were not compatible with the country’s constitution.The commission laid out its concerns in informal letters to Budapest and Warsaw in November, in a preliminary step that pointed the way to formal action once the ECJ ruling was given.Any commission action would come at a delicate time. Hungary holds elections in April, and Brussels is wary of opening a public battle over funding with Prime Minister Viktor Orban as campaigning ramps up.Orban said in a speech on Saturday that Brussels was using the rule of law as “a tool with which they can mould us in their image”. He added: “They are now fighting.a rule of law jihad.”Poland has been making overtures aimed at settling its dispute with the EU over judicial independence. President Andrzej Duda this month put forward a bill to overhaul the disciplinary system for judges, and the ruling Law and Justice party later put forward its own ideas.“This court decision is crystal clear: the rule of law mechanism is lawful and stands ready to be applied by the European Commission,” said Katalin Cseh, a Hungarian MEP from the liberal Renew Europe group. “The commission should waste no second more, and apply the mechanism.”Additional reporting from Marton Dunai in Budapest and James Shotter
328  In December, a month after Russia first began building up its military forces on the Ukrainian border, the withdrawal of 10,000 soldiers from the frontline led to a temporary easing of tensions.Yet within weeks troop numbers were rising again, part of what is now one of the biggest military build-ups in Europe since the end of the cold war — large enough for Washington to warn that Russia had the means to invade Ukraine at any moment.So analysts and western military planners have reacted with caution to talk emanating from Moscow this week of a de-escalation on the border — with some suggesting the opposite was true and that numbers were increasing.Russia’s defence ministry said on Tuesday that some units of its southern and western military districts bordering Ukraine had completed drills and would be pulling back to base, a day after Sergei Shoigu, defence minister, said some military drills were wrapping up.Vladimir Putin spoke on Tuesday of a decision “to partially withdraw forces” from the border region and said he was ready for talks with the west.Videos released by the Russian defence ministry showed tanks crossing snow-covered fields and being loaded on to railway cars, with the ministry saying the troops would return to their bases “as they always do” after the completion of planned exercises.Jens Stoltenberg, Nato secretary-general, said on Tuesday he viewed the developments with “cautious optimism” but needed to see “a significant and enduring withdrawal”. Yet by Wednesday he had hardened his stance. “We see they have increased the number of troops and more troops are on their way,” Stoltenberg said at the start of a two-day summit of defence ministers of the 30-country military alliance. “We’re prepared for the worst.”For analysts, December’s temporary withdrawal underscored the dangers of reading too much into drawdowns. “Last year, when they were withdrawing troops, it was as if they accidentally forgot about a couple of armies, leaving them behind,” said Ruslan Leviev of the Conflict Intelligence Team, which uses open sources to monitor Russian military activities.“Some of the troops actually left for permanent bases, while some of the troops ended up staying on the border. So there’s always the option to.turn around again and go back on the attack,” he said.Ruslan Pukhov, director of the Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, a Moscow think-tank, called the withdrawal “open de-escalation”, but also said it did not mean the tensions would necessarily subside.“It hasn’t solved any of the Russians’ fundamental goals. Ukraine is even more hostile than it was and nobody has met any of Russia’s demands,” he said.For some analysts and officials, rather than seeing signs of withdrawal on the ground, the opposite was true: some forces went in, some were moved out, but on balance the numbers were rising. This kind of action could continue as Russia seeks to keep the west guessing and maintain pressure on Ukraine, they said.“I hope my scepticism is proved wrong, but we’ve seen this pattern before, during the build-up that began last year,” said Henry Boyd, military analyst at IISS in London.Speaking at a meeting with German chancellor Olaf Scholz, Putin said a decision had been taken “to partially withdraw forces” following what Moscow claims were exercises involving more than 130,000 troops near the border with Ukraine and in neighbouring Belarus.But he said future negotiations would hang on the situation on the ground, which could change at any moment — suggesting any drawdowns could be rapidly reversed. “Who can say what the situation will be like. Nobody, for now. And it doesn’t depend only on us,” the Russian president said.Both the Conflict Intelligence Team and open-source monitors at Rochan Consulting, a military analysis group, noted signs of fresh deployments to the border regions.“Over the past few days, there was again an influx of videos which showed new equipment arriving to the border with Ukraine, or near the border,” said Konrad Muzyka, Rochan Consulting’s director.“So we have to verify [Russia’s statements],” Muzyka said. “The most recent troop deployments suggest it is not genuine.”It was also significant, said Leviev, that the statement about troops returning to their bases did not mention units from the Far Eastern Military District, which have been deployed from locations thousands of miles away.Their absence “raises doubts about de-escalation intentions”, he said.The far east units were largely deployed in January as part of joint military exercises Russia is holding with Belarus.These exercises, which have led to at least 30,000 troops being deployed to Belarus, according to US intelligence reports, are due to finish on February 20. Russian officials have said the troops in Belarus would return once the exercises are over.
329  The writer is Fritz Stern Chair at the Brookings InstitutionWould he, like President Emmanuel Macron of France, be lied to by Vladimir Putin? Would he be humiliated, like UK foreign secretary Liz Truss at the hands of her counterpart Sergei Lavrov? Worse, would the Russian president ensnare him in a bogus peacemaker role, setting him up as a 21st century Neville Chamberlain?Many western diplomats were holding their collective breath as Olaf Scholz, Germany’s new chancellor, flew into Moscow on Tuesday for the latest last-ditch diplomatic effort to stave off war in eastern Europe.In the end, none of these three scenarios unfolded. At the post-meeting news conference, the tone was crisp — no smiles, no first names. Putin slipped in a falsehood about “genocide” in Ukraine’s breakaway Donbas region. But he indicated that he was open to talking about intermediate-range missiles and the scope of military exercises, provided the west was willing to discuss his grievances. Just before Scholz’s plane landed, the Russian government announced a partial withdrawal of the troops encircling Ukraine.Scholz held his ground. It was their “damned duty and job” to “prevent a warlike escalation”, he remarked. He repeated the threat of dire consequences in case of Russian aggression; troop withdrawals were good, but more would have to follow. He listed western concerns about human rights in Russia and the incarceration of opposition leader Alexei Navalny.On Ukraine’s bid for Nato membership — which the west refuses to exclude and the Kremlin refuses to accept — Scholz said: “That is not an issue we will likely encounter while we are in office.” Then, with a slow grin, he added: “I don’t know how long the president intends to stay in office. I’ve got a feeling it will be a long time, but not forever.” Later, there was speculation on social media that the remark on Ukraine was a concession of principle. In reality, it was a shrewd deflection of the issue. In essence, Scholz is proposing a way to put the dispute in the freezer: membership not now, but also not “never”. But when was the last time Putin was implicitly called a dictator to his face — and reminded that even his grip on power must end some time? It must have irritated the Kremlin that the person sliding this lethal quip in so neatly was a German chancellor, and a Social Democrat to boot.Indeed, it seems Putin has performed a miracle and forced Scholz’s SPD, not previously known for looking too severely on the Kremlin, to educate itself. The last straw was the announcement — just days before Scholz’s first trip to Washington — that Gerhard Schröder, Germany’s SPD chancellor in 1998-2005 and the original Putinversteher, would join the board of the state-controlled energy giant Gazprom. This was preceded by such a cacophony of reality-denying statements from Berlin that Scholz’s US visit turned into a damage limitation exercise.After his return, the SPD parliamentary group held an emergency meeting to impose a more critical line. Jessica Rosenthal, leader of the SPD’s youth group, showed more courage than most of her party elders by calling Russia “the aggressor” and Schröder a “representative of Russian interests”. Last Sunday, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier — a former close associate of Schröder who had accused Ukraine of “sabre-rattling” in the past — swung into line with a forceful speech after his re-election as head of state. “Do not underestimate the strength of democracy!” he warned. “I call on President Putin: loosen the noose around Ukraine’s neck!” Scholz himself underwent a transformation. Wooden and thin-lipped in the afternoon standing next to President Joe Biden, by dinnertime he convinced a gaggle of US senators that he would be reliable. He made a point of going to Kyiv, visiting the memorial to the fallen of the 2014 Maidan revolution, and promising more financial support for Ukraine, before heading to Moscow.Are we witnessing not just the education of a chancellor, but his emancipation from his party? Possibly. But the SPD’s pacifist leftwing remains a force to be reckoned with. Nato records no de-escalation or withdrawal of Russian troops. The Duma is asking Putin to recognise the Kremlin-backed Donbas statelets. Belarus is all but integrated into Russia. Moscow has not given up on subverting Ukraine’s westward path.In fact, its goals are much greater: the rollback of eastern Europe’s democratic transformation, the neutralisation of western Europe and the departure of the US from the continent. That is the extent of the challenge. It is what the SPD, and Scholz, have yet to admit.
330  The chief executive of one of Australia’s largest liquefied natural gas producers has said that just a small fraction of his company’s LNG could be made available to Europe in the event of a conflict with Russia.Kevin Gallagher, chief executive of Santos, said the vast majority of his company’s LNG was sold through long-term contracts to Asia, with only about 16 per cent of production earmarked for sale on the spot market.Gallagher said LNG produced in Darwin on the northern coast of Australia could theoretically go to Europe but warned: “I’m not sure that would be enough for them.”Last month, Australia’s resources minister Keith Pitt and energy minister Angus Taylor announced that the country was ready to help supply Europe with gas. In early February, Japan also offered to direct some LNG supplies to Europe.Gallagher’s comments come as the prospect of a Russian invasion of Ukraine threatens to destabilise gas supplies in Europe. Almost 40 per cent of Europe’s gas comes from Russia.Santos produced 92.1mn barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe) of LNG last year, with about 15 mmboe sold on the spot market. Similar volumes are expected to be sold on spot markets this year.Gallagher said funnelling all of that output to Europe would probably “require government intervention or direction”, adding that he had not received such a request to redirect supply.Given the high costs and time needed to ship LNG from Darwin to European ports, Gallagher said a more likely solution would be supply swaps.“Some LNG cargos that are coming from the Middle East, instead of bringing them to Asia, they go to Europe, and you just do cargo swaps. I can see something like that happening in terms of the mechanisms of getting [LNG] to Europe,” he said.Australia is the world’s biggest exporter of LNG, exportingabout 80mn tonnes a year almost exclusively to Asian markets, according to Australian government figures.Graeme Bethune, an energy analyst with EnergyQuest, said that even with spot prices as high as they currently are, it was not economic to ship LNG all the way to Europe.“We track every cargo that leaves Australia, and they’ve just gone to all the usual suspects in Asia [in January],” he said.Bethune said there needed to be “a big differential” in European and Asian prices for it to make economic sense to export LNG to Europe from Australia. “You need European prices to be significantly higher than Asian prices, and typically it’s around the other way.”Santos reported record profits on Wednesday on the back of surging LNG prices. Gallagher said prices were driven by a “supply crunch” and called for an urgent increase in production, telling analysts on Wednesday that booming demand meant Santos was keeping very little in reserves.He said 2021 had “brought global energy security into the spotlight with higher prices and a supply crunch in the wake of rapidly recovering demand and a lack of investment supply”, adding it was “vitally important that investment in new supply occurs”.
331  Good morning on what hopefully is not the day Russia invades Ukraine.The US earlier had warned Moscow could make a move as soon as today, but Vladimir Putin yesterday indicated he is willing to talk some more and that he will pull back some of the troops — a statement met with “cautious optimism” by Nato, whose defence ministers are meeting today in Brussels.Our main focus is the European parliament, where European Council president Charles Michel is due to address the plenary on Ukraine, along with the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell.Group leaders in the parliament are aiming to issue a statement of support for Ukraine — but the strong words hide mixed views among MEPs over how to handle Russia and on whether it is the right moment to have the Ukraine’s president in Strasbourg (even via video link).Later tonight, Michel and Borrell will join other EU and African leaders in Paris at a meeting on the security situation in the Sahel region. Officials expect a decision on the possible withdrawal of the French-led counter-terrorism mission in Mali, given the military government’s involvement with a Russian group of mercenaries. (More here)Speaking of EU-Africa initiatives, some diplomats are bemused by the European Commission’s calculations when it comes to investment pledges. How €20bn in existing yearly investments can be leveraged to €150bn — as European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen announced recently — remains a mystery. Meanwhile, EU officials seek to divert attention away from the numbers and more towards a set of ‘flagship projects’ to be endorsed at the upcoming EU-African Union summit.In corporate governance news, a group of executives of large companies are writing to the commission today to request rules on tying bonuses to sustainability targets.The European parliament’s group leaders (most of them, at least) are expected to issue a statement of support for Ukraine today, after a complicated spell of political wrangling, write Eleni Varvitsioti in Strasbourg and Sam Fleming and Valentina Pop in Brussels.The draft statement, which politicians hope will be signed off by the parliament’s conference of presidents, hits all the right notes. It condemns Russia for its military build-up and for threatening Ukraine and Europe as a whole.It adopts a maximalist view on sanctions — including cutting Russia from the international payments system Swift and halting the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project in case of an attack.Group leaders will also ask Russia to withdraw its forces and stop its attempts to destabilise Ukraine, according to the draft, seen by Europe Express. They support Kyiv in its sovereign right to choose its alliances. That includes calling for European institutions to maintain a “long-term perspective” on Ukraine joining the EU.But the draft had a complex genesis. Had it gone through other channels and been formulated as a resolution put to a vote in the plenary, there was a risk that it would have provoked a small but loud minority of dissenting MEPs who espouse more Russia-friendly views. “It’s easier this way,” said one MEP.It also comes after days of discussion over whether Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky should be asked to address the parliament either in person or by video link from Kyiv.Parliament officials say there had been an open invitation from MEPs who went to Ukraine two weeks ago “to address the European parliament at your convenience.” Then the parliament’s president, Roberta Metsola, had a phone call last week with Zelensky and the address was on their agenda, but they did not settle on a specific date.Metsola stated two days ago that “we are with Ukraine” and stressed that the parliament will show its solidarity this week — including by voting today on a €1.2bn EU macro-financial assistance package.But in the end Zelensky is not expected to speak to MEPs — or at least not today. After all, on Monday he declared today to be a “day of national unity” amid warnings by the US of an imminent attack — meaning it was not an obvious moment for him to be speaking to Strasbourg.Some MEPs also privately admit to mixed feelings about the idea of Zelensky addressing politicians at a moment of intense uncertainty over the course of the Ukraine crisis and over Russia’s intentions. While no one would go on the record, several MEPs wondered if it would be “provocative” having Ukraine’s president speaking to the European parliament today.The European Central Bank must consider the “unprecedented” rise in house prices when assessing the high level of inflation and deciding how fast to tighten monetary policy, ECB board member Isabel Schnabel told the Financial Times. (More here)Executives of large companies should have their bonuses tied to sustainability targets, according to a letter signed by about 40 chief executives to be sent to the European Commission today, writes Alice Hancock in London.“Sustainability objectives reflect the long term while financial results are monitored quarterly and stock prices are monitored daily,” the letter, seen by Europe Express, says. It argues sustainability should be integrated into short-term governance through “the variable part of the executive remuneration package”.Pascal Canfin, a French MEP who heads the European parliament’s environment committee and who spearheaded the letter, told Europe Express that it would be remiss of the commission to miss an opportunity to tie environmental targets to executive pay.Companies could, for example, make between 10 and 20 per cent of bonuses attributable to sustainability goals, Canfin suggested. Some more ambitious businesses such as the insurer Axa have already set similar targets affecting 30 per cent of bonuses.A similar measure was mooted by the commission in earlier discussions but, the letter says, “it seems to have disappeared during the internal negotiations at the commission, even though it is an important part of translating the European Green Deal into the daily governance of large European companies”.The letter had been signed by 36 executives yesterday, including the bosses of Engie, Veolia and former Unilever CEO Paul Polman, with Canfin’s office expecting more to add their names before it is sent to the commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, and to Frans Timmermans, the commissioner in charge of the EU Green Deal.The intervention comes ahead of the publication next week of the commission’s delayed sustainable corporate governance proposals, which aim to push companies into thinking more about long-term societal benefits than short-term shareholder gains as well as increase scrutiny of supply chains for environmental and human rights abuses.The size of companies that could fall under the remit of the proposals is still up for grabs. The letter said that all “large” European companies should be within its reach. EU officials suggested that businesses with 250 or more employees would be a good place to start.
332  The European Medicines Agency is unlikely to grant conditional marketing authorisation to Merck’s Covid-19 antiviral pill this month as it grapples with “problematic” data, according to people familiar with the approval process.It is “possible” that the oral Covid drug molnupiravir will not receive approval at all, one of the people said. The EMA declined to comment on its ongoing review.Merck’s drug raised fresh hopes and sent shares in the company rallying late last year after early data from a late-stage trial suggested that it cut in half the risk of death and hospitalisation.But a subsequent analysis revealed its efficacy to be lower than previously thought, at 30 per cent. The US Food and Drug Administration has given its approval but restricted its use. France cancelled its order for the drug amid efficacy concerns.A person familiar with the EMA approval process said at the time that the drug had been “a bit of a disappointment” and that 30 per cent efficacy “started to be on the limits of [what is considered] benefit”.In response to questions, the regulator pointed to a statement in November in which it said that it “could issue an opinion [an approval] within weeks if the data submitted are sufficiently robust and complete”.According to European officials, national healthcare systems in Europe are favouring Pfizer’s Paxlovid, another Covid antiviral pill, whose efficacy in reducing death and hospitalisation has been confirmed at 89 per cent.Merck, which developed molnupiravir with partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, said it was in active discussions with regulators with the aim of bringing the drug to patients in Europe as quickly as possible.The US company said it was “very confident” in the clinical profile of molnupiravir and believed that a range of medicines and vaccines were needed to tackle the pandemic.“Molnupiravir has a low propensity for drug-drug interactions, which makes it a meaningful and important option for appropriate patients with Covid-19 who are receiving treatments for underlying conditions such as heart disease, hypertension, diabetes and. impaired liver or kidney function,” Merck said.The UK, which has procured 2.23mn courses of the drug, is deploying it in clinical trials. It remains a third-line option, meaning its use is recommended after other drugs have failed or are not deemed suitable.The EMA had given it a preliminary nod last year on the back of the initial, positive data, allowing member states to prescribe it. A review of the entire data set had been expected to wrap up last month, Emer Cooke, executive director of the EMA, told the Financial Times late last year.In the US, where 1.5mn courses of Merck’s antiviral pill have been distributed to pharmacies and health centres since late December, patient demand has been weak, according to doctors and pharmacists, who cited its “striking difference” in efficacy compared with Paxlovid and concerns about possible side effects.Delays in diagnosis of Covid had also complicated the rollout, because the drug should be taken within five days of infection, they said.US health officials last week warned that some pharmacies were running out of storage space for the drug just weeks after distribution began because of tepid demand.“Unless we are forced to use molnupiravir we would much rather use Paxlovid or sotrovimab — so it is somewhat sitting on our shelves,’ said Christian Ramers, an infectious disease specialist at the Family Health Centres of San Diego.He said Merck’s antiviral pill tended to be an option considered for people who had significant drug-to-drug interactions and therefore could not use Paxlovid.Analysts said the slow uptake of molnupiravir in the US was unlikely to dent near-term revenues for Merck, which has forecast $5bn to $6bn in sales in 2022 based on signed deals. But future demand would suffer unless Merck was able to provide better clinical data.“Given the current clinical outcomes data there are several therapies preferred before molnupiravir,” said Daina Graybosch, analyst at SVB Leerink, citing Paxlovid, Gilead Sciences’ remdesivir — an antiviral administered via injection — and monoclonal antibody therapy sotrovimab from GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology, and Eli Lilly’s bebtelovimab.Merck said it expected to report results on a global study evaluating molnupiravir’s ability to prevent Covid by the middle of the year. The company is continuing to share data with the regulator on its clinical trial in non-hospitalised adults and is participating in a UK trial with more than 8,500 participants.
333  In a chilly supermarket car park near the Polish town of Hrubieszow stand a handful of Ukrainian vans — evidence of cross-border shoppers hunting for cheap goods. But the 17,500 people in this town 5km inside Poland’s border would face the prospect of much more traffic heading west if Russia invades Ukraine.The Kremlin has repeatedly denied it is planning an invasion. But it has massed more than 100,000 troops on the borders of Ukraine, and in recent weeks there has been a drumbeat of warnings from western officials that an attack is imminent and could trigger an exodus of refugees. In recent days, western embassies in Kyiv have stepped up evacuations of staff.Many in Hrubieszow — close to one of the EU’s eastern boundaries — are unsure how to interpret the blizzard of claim and counterclaim about Russia’s intentions. But, as elsewhere in Poland, officials are sizing up the implications.“If [there was a wave of] refugees and it was necessary to ensure those families’ livelihoods and housing, it would be difficult,” said Pawel Wojciechowski, the town’s deputy mayor. “We don’t have enough [social housing] for our compatriots, so it would be hard to find spaces for others.”Poland’s conservative-nationalist government vehemently opposed EU efforts to make member states accept quotas of asylum seekers during the 2015-16 crisis sparked by the war in Syria. But in the event of a serious escalation of the conflict in Ukraine, Poland is likely to be one of the main destinations for those fleeing.Although Poland and Ukraine share a complicated and sometimes painful history, they have close linguistic and cultural ties. Poland is also already home to a sizeable Ukrainian community, having taken in more than a million since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and fuelled a separatist war in Donbas.“We have to be prepared for the worst-case scenario, andfor some time [we] have been taking actions to ensure that we are prepared for the arrival of a wave of up to a million people,” Poland’s deputy interior minister, Maciej Wasik, said last month.However, others question whether the central European nation could cope with such a large number of refugees, particularly if they arrived over a short period of time.“The capacity of Poland to absorb people coming from Ukraine is quite high because of the community of Ukrainians who are already here,” said Agnieszka Kosowicz, president of the Polish Migration Forum.“But as far as the state system is concerned, I am quite sceptical about whether we can call Poland prepared.We have very inadequate integration procedures, and the integration institutions have not been given more resources or capacity or staff.”In Hrubieszow, which until the second world war was home to a mix of Jewish, Catholic and Orthodox populations, locals are generally open to the idea of Poland taking in Ukrainians, not least because it would help plug gaps in the country’s labour market.But they expect that, rather than seeking work in Hrubieszow, or on the farms that dot the rolling countryside around it, most would head further west to Poland’s big cities such as Lublin, Warsaw and Wroclaw, or even seek higher wages in Germany.“My sister [who works in a supermarket] said that they had a problem with finding Poles, but the Ukrainians want to work there, and for them it is very good,” said Kamil Rodzik, from Zamosc, a town 50km west of Hrubieszow.“Maybe we will hear Ukrainian more on the street, but we have got used to that. It is also hard to use Ukrainians politically as a card to scare people.We treat them as our partners, we want to help them.”Wary of being accused of double standards given their resistance to quotas in the 2015-16 migrant crisis, Polish officials shy away from suggesting a similar way of sharing out the refugee burden in the event of a crisis in Ukraine. But they argue that the EU and other member states have a duty to help.“It was our choice — a European choice — to support Ukraine, offering them [a free trade deal], offering them an association agreement with the EU, offering them free visa programmes. It was not only a Polish decision,” said Marcin Przydacz, Poland’s deputy foreign minister.“And now when there is a price to be paid.I think that the responsibility should be shared among all member states, but we are already in the front line and we are ready to be in the first row to offer this assistance.”In Hrubieszow, however, people are still hoping that the worst-case scenarios will yet prove wide of the mark. “Of course there is a possibility that Ukrainians will come, but Poland will not be their only destination,” said Lukasz Koszyniuk, who works in customer services.“I don’t think that 60- or 70-year-olds will come to a new country because you don’t pull up your roots when you are old. Maybe some younger people will come, but I don’t think that the whole country will come.I think we can manage. But we cannot take all of them.”
334  The first visitors to the top of the 2,877-metre Pic du Midi de Bigorre didn’t come to ski. Nor, of course, did they arrive by cable car. From a distance this steep and unforgiving mountain in the French Pyrenees doesn’t look a likely prospect, either up or down. But goat herders and adventurers reached the summit many centuries ago and scientists have come since the early 18th century, studying the botany, weather, geology and, latterly, the night skies.The snow-covered winter surroundings make for a particularly stable atmosphere, which, in combination with frequently crystal clear skies, led to the development of an observatory on the peak. Building started in 1878, with materials hauled up by mule, and continued throughout the 20th century with the addition of ever more powerful telescopes. A cable car was added by 1955 and in the early 1960s Nasa funded a new telescope used to survey the moon in preparation for the Apollo landings.Even for non-astronomers, the Pic is well worth a visit. Daytime tourists come just for the view over the Pyrenees (cyclists will probably be familiar with the mountain pass just below the peak — the Col du Tourmalet, one the Tour de France’s most hallowed sites). A lucky few stay the night to experience the inky, star-studded skies; and skiers make the trip to tackle the descent. Best of all is to do the lot: ascend in late afternoon, stay overnight and ski down after a leisurely breakfast, while skiers from the resort of La Mongie are still queueing for the first lift up.The observatory has 15 bedrooms in what were the scientists’ quarters — sleek and minimal, dominated by a triple-glazed window, there are even fluffy slippers in which to pad to the shared bathroom. Guests are taken into the depths of the observatory and as well as dinner, there’s an in-depth planetarium-style exploration of the cosmos in one of the domes, to be followed by stargazing through a number of the telescopes manned by helpful experts.From our room, my wife and I walked via rough concrete passages towards the vast Lyot dome, perched on the west side of the peak, where astronomers probe stellar magnetic fields. Climbing endless rickety steel steps between the inner and outer skins of the dome, we finally reached the business end: a vast yoke supporting a telescope with a mirror two meters in diameter. Strange to think that the infinite lightness of cosmic rays needs such mammoth structures to intercept them. Even stranger that they can’t get a bit of heating organised — the cold was bitter, but apparently that’s just how they like it for optimal image quality.The following morning, when it was time to depart, we did so via another concrete tunnel, followed by a clattery steel stairway then a door that looked like a prop from Ice Station Zebra. Finally, an awkward snowy-icy scramble to reach a safe point where our guide, Claude Etchelecou, watched as we clicked into our skis while trying not to drop anything down the steep, featureless face beneath us. That was to be the day’s big skiing challenge, with no warm-up. In deep snow conditions this slope alone would be the reason you’re advised to come with a guide, to negotiate the safest line with minimal avalanche risk. When it’s firm to icy, it’s hard to imagine how anyone could help if you started to fall.We focused on Claude’s languorous turns — he’d done this many times before — and made it to the bottom of the critical section intact. Even though we were just a fraction of the way down from the peak you could sense that everything to follow would be plain sailing, a feeling confirmed by a leisurely traverse of a high plateau, passing snow-blown vestiges of buildings from where, before the installation of the cable car, a funicular once climbed straight up the face we’ve just skied.Heading east past the Roche Noir and into the Arizes valley, the way on was effortless skiing over rolling slopes, with long ridges towering above us, then down into a river valley to glide gently over pastures. The sting in the tail was a twisty trail through forest; I wondered just how much lower we’d be going, not just because my thighs were threatening to boil over but because it was obvious we were a long way — and the wrong side of a ridge — from La Mongie, where we were staying. But Claude had thought of everything: we emerged from trees on to a road, right by a handy bus to take us back to the pistes of La Mongie, the observatory just visible far above.
335  The chair of the world’s most powerful financial watchdog has called on global leaders to “think twice” before imposing crippling sanctions on Russia, warning that the most punishing penalties run the risk of undermining global financial stability.Klaas Knot, chair of the Financial Stability Board, told the Financial Times that suspending Russia’s access to the Swift international payments system, which underpins trillions of dollars of transactions a year, could result in a “severe disruption in payment flows”.“When applying severe measures, one should always think twice and also be aware of the consequences,” said Knot, who is also head of the Dutch central bank.Knot’s remarks came as Joe Biden, US president, used a speech at the White House on Tuesday to repeat warnings that the west would impose financial sanctions to exert “intense pressure on [Russia’s] largest, most significant financial institutions” if the country invades Ukraine.Hopes of a diplomatic resolution to the crisis were bolstered earlier on Tuesday when Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, said the country’s military would draw down some troops on the Ukrainian border to enable dialogue with the West.Biden responded by saying there was “plenty of room for diplomacy” but insisted that sanctions were “ready to go as soon [as] and if Russia moves”.Cutting off Russia’s access to Swift, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is one of the potential sanctions being pushed by the US should the country attack its neighbour. EU officials say it is under discussion but unlikely to be included in the first round of measures.Europe’s initial steps are more likely to be targeted sanctions on some of Russia’s biggest financial institutions, among them Sberbank, VTB, Gazprombank, Alfa-Bank and The Russian Direct Investment Fund.Knot, who was speaking before flying to Jakarta for this week’s meetings of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors, acknowledged that “the ultimate decision” of what sanctions to deploy would be “taken on different grounds” than the risk to the global financial system.“But it is clear that they might have some financial ramifications and I would urge policymakers to take those into account,” he added.Removing access to Swift would create severe operational problems for banks that are cut off from the network, but it would not in itself prevent them from dealing with other lenders around the world.Such a move might spur Russia to step up efforts to develop alternative systems. It has already formed an alternative messaging system called SPFS, although this is far less capable than the Swift network.In a wide-ranging interview, Knot said financial regulators around the world had already started trying to estimate the impact of a Ukraine invasion on global banks but that it was “very, very hard to predict” the indirect effects.He said that the scale of the fallout would determine “how much loss of confidence we will see in the market, how much increase in risk aversion takes place, how many investors will start to run from certain markets, et cetera”.But Knot said that the economic damage might not be as bad as some feared. “Let’s see first how it develops. We’ve also had military conflicts in the past that at the end of the day had very little ramification on financial institutions. It all depends on the breadth and the scale of the conflict.”Meanwhile, Knot said global banks were prepared for any shocks emanating from the Ukraine crisis.He said: “A well-capitalised banking sector has proven its value over the last few years. I think if you look at the main difference between the pandemic shock and the global financial crisis, it was that this time around, the banks were absorbing rather than amplifying the shock.”Additional reporting by Sam Fleming in Brussels
336  A new soap opera has been a big hit in France this winter, but it’s not on Netflix or the country’s biggest television network TF1. The spectacle, which one might call The Billionaire Parade, is available direct on the website of the French Senate.A parliamentary investigative commission on concentration in the media sector has summoned the wealthy industrialists who own many of France’s most influential news outlets and entertainment channels. It has subjected them to questioning under oath about why they invest in what are often small, money-losing operations unrelated to their core businesses.Corporate raider Vincent Bolloré (who controls Vivendi and is seeking to buy Lagardère), Bernard Arnault (newspapers Les Echos and Le Parisien), and telecoms tycoon Patrick Drahi (BFM news channel) have already appeared. On Friday will come their fellow billionaires and business rivals, Xavier Niel (Le Monde newspaper) and Martin Bouygues (TF1 broadcaster, which is seeking to buy smaller rival M6).The process has given the senators a rare chance to publicly interrogate the billionaires on questions that have long obsessed the Parisian elite. Do they intervene in the coverage? Does their media ownership buy them influence, power and protection? And should citizens be worried about how the billionaires’ hold on the media can warp the public debate?With presidential elections set for April and far-right candidates polling at historically high levels, the senators trained particular attention on Vincent Bolloré, the conservative billionaire who controls Vivendi and its Fox News-inspired opinion channel CNews. Any appearance by the 69-year-old is extraordinary as he speaks in public so infrequently. His testimony has racked up some 350,000 views online.Bolloré was quizzed on how CNews had promoted its controversial star Eric Zemmour so effectively that it had launched him as a presidential candidate. He also defended Vivendi against criticism that it overhauled the positioning of its news organisations, and was questioned over the company’s pending acquisition of rival Lagardère. If approved, that deal would make it one of the biggest book publishers in the world.The Breton played down Vivendi’s influence by arguing that it was tiny compared with its US or Asian competitors or Silicon Valley tech giants. “Our interests are not political and not ideological, it is always and only economic,” said Bolloré, adding that Vivendi put out all types of content and news was a small part of the business. He told his questioners: “I think you are taking tiny little incidents and turning them into some convenient narrative.”Of course none of the billionaires compelled to show up would ever admit publicly what seems obvious to many outsiders — that ownership matters and influences coverage in France. It is very difficult for a newspaper or TV station to cover the business interests of their billionaire owners in the same way an independent media organisation would.The senate commission is looking at whether there is undue influence and whether reforms to media ownership rules and a separate financial support scheme are needed.The issues are not straightforward. A 1986 law was intended to ensure pluralism by limiting ownership to certain percentages and banning ownership across different types of media. However, critics say the law has not been effective and needs updating for the internet era.The news and entertainment landscape has been upended by mobile phones, social media and streaming. Print circulation and advertising have declined while the audience for traditional live television has shrunk. France’s billionaire owners are propping up some media outlets — as is the French state.Certain print and online news outlets considered necessary to the public interest receive almost €2bn in annual direct and indirect subsidies from the government in the form of lower value added tax, cheap postage and other aid. Last year, this accounted for 23 per cent of the sector’s revenue, up from 13 per cent in 2008, according to one independent analysis, with the nine biggest groups absorbing almost two-thirds of the aid, including those with billionaire owners.Real change looks unlikely because the commission can only issue a report and recommendations if all the members agree, which is not assured. But the parade of billionaires has provided one thing — a reminder of the need for them to be held to account for the influence that comes along with media ownership.
337  US and European shares rallied on Tuesday, while oil prices fell after Russia said it had begun pulling some troops back to their bases, easing concerns that an attack against Ukraine was imminent.The S&P 500 index advanced 1.6 per cent following a statement from Russia’s defence ministry that units from the country’s southern and western military districts were returning to base after the completion of drills.The Nasdaq Composite index, which has heavy weightings of technology stocks that are sensitive to swings in market sentiment, rose 2.5 per cent.The Stoxx Europe 600 share index, which fell nearly 2 per cent on Monday, closed 1.4 per cent higher on Tuesday, while the FTSE 100 rose by a little over 1 per cent. Germany’s Dax index gained 2 per cent.The Stoxx is down 4.1 per cent this year while the S&P has lost 6.2 per cent.In Asia on Wednesday, shares followed Wall Street higher, with Japan’s Topix rising 1.4 per cent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index up 0.9 per cent.Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, fell another 0.4 per cent on Wednesday to $92.88 a barrel, adding to a more than 3 per cent fall from the previous session. Brent had risen to as high as $96.78 on Monday, its steepest level in seven years.Russia is estimated to have maintained a force of more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine in recent weeks. But on Tuesday afternoon, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was ready to hold “dialogue” with the west on core security issues.Nato had earlier said there were no signs of de-escalation, but also reason for cautious optimism that Russia would continue with diplomacy.“Up until now the momentum has been towards more escalation, more troops at the border, diplomatic stalemate,” said Tiffany Wilding, US economist at Pimco. “Today was the first sign that the situation may be de-escalating and that is important for markets.”Tensions over Ukraine, which have been building for more than two months, have dominated global markets since the US warned last Friday of an immediate threat that Russia would invade its neighbour.The potential for western sanctions against Russia, an important supplier of oil, gas and metals to global supply chains already snarled by Covid-19-related disruptions, has added volatility to markets that have in recent weeks been jolted by high inflation and expectations of central bank action.“We’re dealing with a fearful market,” said Kevin Rendino, chief executive of 180 Degree Capital, noting last week’s hot inflation print and the prospect of more aggressive interest rate rises in addition to tensions between Ukraine and Russia.Government bonds, which are often sought out in periods of geopolitical turmoil, slipped in value on Tuesday. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note rose 0.06 percentage points to 2.05 per cent, close to its highest level since late 2019.The yield on Germany’s 10-year Bund, which moves inversely to the price of the security, rose 0.03 percentage points to 0.30 per cent.“The Russia-Ukraine situation is coming at an inopportune time when markets were already fragile,” said Olivier Marciot, cross-asset fund manager at Unigestion, referring to expectations the US Federal Reserve would raise interest rates up to seven times this year after pinning borrowing costs close to zero in March 2020.“Markets are therefore being very reactive to any incremental piece of news that comes out.”Additional reporting by Hudson Lockett in Hong Kong
338  Joe Biden has said there is “plenty of room for diplomacy” to resolve the Ukraine crisis, bolstering hopes that time is available for talks that would lead to Russia stepping back from an invasion of its neighbour.Speaking from the White House on Tuesday, the US president said Russia had amassed about 150,000 troops along the Ukrainian border and remained “very much in a threatening position” — with an attack being “distinctly possible”.But Biden shied away from the most strident warnings of an “immediate” assault described by some of his top officials in recent days.“We should give diplomacy every chance to succeed,” Biden said. “And I believe there are real ways to address our respective security concerns.”He said the US had not yet “verified” whether Russian military units were “returning to their home bases” as Moscow had announced earlier in the day, which had fuelled expectations that a detente was at hand.The UK’s defence secretary said Russia would “overwhelm” Ukraine if its forces were deployed.“From a Ukrainian point of view they’re fairly surrounded by a very large force of ready troops,” Ben Wallace told Sky News on Wednesday. “It’s a very significant force; it’s a force that would overwhelm Ukraine should it be deployed.Biden’s comments on Tuesday suggested the US was ready to seize any chance that Russia was prepared to back away from a conflict over Ukraine.“As long as there is hope in a diplomatic resolution to prevent the use of force and avoids the incredible human suffering that will follow, we will pursue it,” he said.Biden’s speech came towards the end of another day of intensive international diplomacy aimed at heading off a potential invasion.After three hours of talks with German chancellor Olaf Scholz, Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, said Moscow was drawing down some troops from border areas to enable “dialogue” with the west, while still keeping the threat of invasion hanging over its neighbour.Putin said he was prepared to hold negotiations on intermediate nuclear missile forces and confidence-building measures if the US and Nato agreed to discuss Moscow’s grievances with the transatlantic alliance — including its chief demand that it pledge to never admit Ukraine.Speaking alongside Putin, Scholz said diplomatic options were “not by any means exhausted”.“The fact that we’re now hearing that some troops are being withdrawn is a good sign, and we hope that more will follow,” the German chancellor said.The US and Nato have suggested that they were open to talks on arms control, missile deployment and transparency on military exercises. They have rejected Moscow’s call to ditch the alliance’s open-door policy on membership.Both Scholz and Biden suggested that an acceptable compromise to all countries with a stake in Europe’s security, including Ukraine, was possible.“There’s a fact and this fact is that all participants know that Ukraine’s Nato membership isn’t on the agenda. So everyone should take a step back and be clear that we can’t have a situation where there might be a military conflict over an issue that isn’t even on the agenda,” Scholz told German journalists after the meeting with Putin.Biden said: “We will not sacrifice basic principles. Nations have a right to sovereignty and territorial integrity and the freedom to set their own course and choose with whom they will associate. But that still leaves plenty of room for diplomacy and for de-escalation as the best way forward for all parties, in our view”.Although Biden emphasised diplomacy, he said the US and allies would respond forcefully to any Russian attack through economic sanctions on crucial Russian financial institutions and sectors as well as renewed export controls.He noted in particular that Washington would react if US citizens in Ukraine were attacked or if Russia launched cyber attacks against US companies and critical infrastructure.In addition, Moscow would face widespread international condemnation, he said. “The world will not forget that Russia chose needless death and destruction,” Biden said.The US president, whose approval ratings have fallen sharply since last summer, also spoke to a domestic audience concerned by the lingering pandemic and high inflation, warning them that a conflict in Ukraine could have negative repercussions in America as well, particularly if it led to soaring energy prices.“Defending democracy and liberty is never without cost,” he said.As Biden delivered his comments, senior US lawmakers from both parties issued a joint statement “of solidarity and resolve to the people of Ukraine, and an equally clear warning to Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin”.Even though Republicans and Democrats have been unable to agree on their own sanctions legislation in Congress against Russia, they said they would back the White House’s efforts in the event of an invasion.“We are prepared to fully support the immediate imposition of strong, robust and effective sanctions on Russia, as well as tough restrictions and controls on exports to Russia, and we will urge our allies and partners in Europe and around the world to join us,” the statement read.
339  The European Central Bank must consider the “unprecedented” rise in house prices when assessing the high level of inflation and deciding how fast to tighten monetary policy, said one of its senior executives.In the most “hawkish” comments by an ECB executive board member ahead of next month’s meeting at which it will decide when to withdraw its stimulus in response to record inflation in the eurozone, Isabel Schnabel told the Financial Times: “We cannot ignore this.”“If this [rise in the costs of home ownership] were included, it would have a substantial effect on measured inflation, in particular on core inflation, where the weight of owner-occupied housing is larger,” she said. “It has to be part of our general considerations.”She said including the costs of owning a home in the eurozone’s benchmark pricing figure would have added 0.6 percentage points to third-quarter core inflation of 1.4 per cent, excluding energy and food, taking it up to the ECB’s target of 2 per cent.Unlike the US, the eurozone does not include the costs of owning a house in its inflation data. But the ECB said last year it would start a multiyear process of incorporating owner-occupied housing costs into its targeted inflation measure. Until then it would consider price indicators such as an owner-occupied housing price index to show its effect.Even without the recent 8.8 per cent annual surge in eurozone house prices, Schnabel said January’s rise in consumer inflation to a new high of 5.1 per cent and the fall of unemployment to an all-time low of 7 per cent meant “the risk of acting too late has increased and therefore we need a careful reassessment of the inflation outlook”.When the ECB governing council meets next month, it is expected to raise its inflation forecast for the next two years close enough to its target to justify ending its net asset purchases faster than planned and to prepare for its first interest rate rise in more than a decade.Schnabel is one of the most influential voices on the ECB board and her comments are likely to shift the debate in favour of the increasingly vocal minority of hawks on its governing council who want to withdraw its stimulus more quickly.While wage growth remains subdued in Europe, compared with the US or UK, Schnabel said the ECB needed to anticipate whether it was likely to pick up, as indicated by recent survey data, and act before it did. “Because once it’s there, it’s relatively costly to fight,” she said.“We also have to ensure that current high inflation does not become entrenched in expectations because that could then give rise to a wage-price spiral,” she warned.The German economics professor, who joined the ECB board just over two years ago, also cited three factors that made its policymakers more worried about the impact of inflation: the Omicron wave of coronavirus infections was milder than feared; the labour market had rebounded swiftly from the pandemic; and a 26 per cent annual rise in industrial producer prices indicated “quite a bit of pipeline pressure”.“We are getting to a point where in light of the inflation outlook, the benefits of further net asset purchases may not justify the additional costs,” she said. “There is an argument for ending net asset purchases.”The ECB is monitoring tensions between Russia and Ukraine for their impact on energy prices and the wider economy, she said, adding that a potential conflict was unlikely to speed up the ECB’s withdrawal of stimulus because of “the likely negative effects of an escalation of the crisis on growth and confidence, including through potential sanctions”.Rising market expectations of a “hawkish” shift in ECB policy have already led to a fall in eurozone government bond prices and increased the spread between the borrowing costs of Germany and those of more indebted countries such as Italy.Schnabel said the ECB was “ready to counter severe market dislocations that lead to fragmentation”, while adding that bond yields remained low by historical standards.“Even if current bond yields adjust upwards, average interest rates on the countries’ debt will stay low for an extended period of time,” she said, pointing out that the eurozone was still expected to grow strongly. “In a growing economy, rising yields are not a major concern.”This story has been amended since publication to clarify that while the UK does include the costs of owning a home in its inflation data, it does not include it in the consumer price index that the Bank of England uses to set its target.
340  Russian dissident Alexei Navalny, President Vladimir Putin’s most prominent opponent, could face another 15 years in prison after a new trial against him began on Tuesday.Prosecutors allege that Navalny — jailed last year for parole violations after recovering from nerve agent poisoning that he accuses Putin of ordering — stole Rbs356mn ($4.7mn) worth of donations to his Anti-Corruption Foundation, which Russia banned last year.In an almost unprecedented move, the trial is being held in the notoriously harsh IK-2 prison colony east of Moscow where Navalny is serving his two-and-a-half-year sentence.The hearing is being held in conjunction with separate charges of insulting a judge during misdemeanour proceedings after his arrest last year.Navalny’s supporters said the combined charges could add up to another 15 years in prison on top of his existing sentence, with more proceedings yet to come to court.The 45-year-old anti-corruption activist was forced to attend the trial in prison uniform, while reporters and his lawyers were not allowed to bring phones or laptops into the makeshift courtroom.Navalny denies the charges, which he claims are revenge for surviving the poisoning attempt in Siberia in 2020 with the nerve agent novichok and exposing a chemical weapons hit squad from Russian secret services that he says tracked him for years.“The only crime that I could have committed was to be afraid. I’m not scared of you and I call on [everyone] on camera not to be afraid,” Navalny said during the trial, according to Russian media reports. “Otherwise, we’ll spend our whole lives in poverty and servility, waiting for a future that will never come.”“They want to hide him from everyone, from his supporters, from journalists. They really want to hide this new criminal case they’ve stitched up. It’s such a joke that they’re scared to hold the trial in Moscow,” Navalny’s wife Yulia wrote on Instagram.A visibly gaunt Navalny, sporting a buzz cut, hugged his wife at the start of the trial and smiled and joked with reporters, according to video footage.Navalny’s team, most of whom fled the country after a sweeping crackdown on dissent following his arrest, have said they fear the highly unusual proceedings could allow the Kremlin to hold him behind bars indefinitely while the west is focused on the threat of a renewed Russian invasion of Ukraine.US and EU leaders have condemned Navalny’s imprisonment and vowed extensive sanctions against Russia if he dies in prison. Speaking alongside Putin after talks in Moscow on Tuesday, German chancellor Olaf Scholz said “his conviction is not compatible with the principle of the rule of law”.
341  The European Commission has approved plans for a €6bn satellite internet system to compete with the likes of Amazon and SpaceX despite previous objections from its internal watchdog.Brussels’ initiative to provide encrypted broadband coverage was twice rejected by the European Commission’s Regulatory Scrutiny Board. The board, which vets impact assessments for proposals put forward by the commission, believed the scheme would waste money and compete with commercial services.The Secured Connectivity regulation is the brainchild of Thierry Breton, the internal market commissioner, who wants the EU to build a third satellite system in lower earth orbit (LEO) for secured communications and access to the internet. The EU already has Galileo, a global navigation system, and Copernicus, which is used for earth observation.The signals from the new system would be encrypted and offered to Europe as well as Africa to give that continent an alternative to Chinese-built infrastructure. It would also provide a back-up in case of cyber attacks on broadband networks.Breton told a press conference in Strasbourg on Tuesday: “This is of central importance in terms of our strategic and technical sovereignty.”He added that it would be connected to other unnamed satellite constellations to save money. Regarding obtaining the spectrum to broadcast the signals, he said: “We know where to find this frequency. It is not an issue.”The commission’s scrutiny board rejected the impact assessment for the project twice on the basis that other options had not been fully considered. This in effect ruled out cheaper options such as renting space on a commercial provider’s network or using an earth-based system.Some amendments were made following the rejections, with commitments to involve small companies in the design and building of the system to boost the EU’s space industry. The commission has earmarked €2.4bn from its budget, with the rest coming from member states and industry in a public-private partnership. Brussels will ask consortiums to bid to build and run the system as a concession.It is rare for a project to be rebuffed twice by the commission’s internal watchdog and a scheme would usually then be blocked. But Maros Sefcovic, vice-president of the commission for interinstitutional relations, agreed to take it forward with some amendments, citing the need for urgent action.The plan still needs approval from the European parliament and EU member states. One diplomat said although several countries had reservations, they would not block it.The commission contracted companies, including Airbus, SES and Eutelsat, to carry out a technical study for the project. The running costs are significant, with LEO satellites needing to be replaced roughly every five to seven years.The EU conceived the idea after the UK bought a stake in OneWeb, the satellite operator, in 2020. Last year Eutelsat, in which the French government has a stake, invested in OneWeb, causing Breton to question whether Eutelsat could take part in the EU project.SpaceX, owned by Tesla co-founder Elon Musk, has launched close to 2,000 satellites under the Starlink name and has applied for licences to fly more than 40,000.Amazon’s Project Kuiper will comprise more than 3,000 satellites.The EU intends to offer services to consumers in remote places without broadband. But Starlink heavily subsidises the hardware needed to receive it, charging $499 against a cost of at least four times that. Satellite broadband costs $99 a month in the US, around double the price of a fibre-optic service.
342  Tom Tugendhat long ago sounded the alarm about the influence of dirty Russian money in London. Back in 2018, the House of Commons’ foreign affairs select committee, which he chairs, warned that the UK “is not serious about confronting the full spectrum of President Vladimir Putin’s offensive measures”. Since then, not enough has changed.With Russia on the brink of invading Ukraine, Tugendhat is hopeful that his fears about Putin’s influence at home will now be tackled. “Dirty money has been an issue for decades but its poison is seeping deeper into our system,” he says. “We’ve done nothing to stop it. Instead we’ve threatened vague sanctions on individuals whose assets are hidden and have more than enough to accept losing some now and again.” His own prescriptions are tough: closing British markets to Russian firms; expelling families linked to the Putin regime; investing in reducing Europe’s dependence on Russian gas; funding free media in Russia; offering more assistance to those threatened by Putin; plus swiftly dealing with dirty money and corruption in London. The last is the most critical — if the Russian laundromat is not shutdown, any future UK economic sanctions risk being undermined.Disquiet about Russia’s influence in London is rising among some senior Tories. Last year, the government extended Magnitsky sanctions to tackle money laundering. But the present crisis has underscored why several MPs feel more needs to be done. One minister likens the mood to the party’s shifting stance on China: “Five years ago, we were too soft on China and realised the error of our ways. The same is happening now with Russia.” Bob Seely, a Conservative MP and member of the foreign affairs committee, calls on the government to produce a longer-term plan for Russia. “We need to understand how neo-authoritarian states use the full spectrum of state power.”Foreign secretary Liz Truss has adopted a more strident tone towards the country since she took over the Foreign Office, even if some seasoned diplomats questioned her “Instagram diplomacy” trip to Moscow. She has told oligarchs that they will have “nowhere to hide” if Ukraine is invaded and the UK’s sanctions package would be the “toughest sanction regime against Russia we have ever had”.Yet such tough talk must be set against the long delay in the publication of the House of Commons Intelligence and Security Committee’s report on Russia. And since Boris Johnson became prime minister in July 2019, the Conservative party has received substantial donations from individuals with Russia ties. Labour has questioned “the adequacy of the processes” with which these donors are vetted.Lubov Chernukhin, the wife of a former Russian minister, for example has given the party £1.7mn over the past decade (her lawyer says donations have “never been tainted by Kremlin or any other influence”).Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the former foreign and defence secretary, thinks there is no Russian influence on British policymaking through donations, noting “all donors have to be British citizens”. But he adds, “any donors should still, in my view, be refused if they have a dodgy reputation — Russian or not. Otherwise, the Conservative party faces real reputational damage”. Rifkind agrees that dirty money laundering in London is the biggest issue to be tackled. “It’s not whether there’s a desire to control it, it’s whether it’s technically possible. We’re dealing with some pretty smart people who know how to fiddle the system.” The Conservative party insists that all donations comply fully with the law. “It would be wrong to suggest malign motive on behalf of individuals simply because of the country of their birth,” a spokesperson says.Whether the party shifts who funds it or not, it is clear that it must be squeaky clean if it wants to do the same to London. Tugendhat is hopeful that his party and country are waking up. “Whether it’s sanctions or finally clamping down on property ownership, this is the perfect opportunity to clean up our own act,” he says. “The tensions are going to keep simmering and Russia will try and make us look weak. We have to show we’re not.”
343  When wildly differing outcomes appear equally likely, investors use the shares of businesses close to the action for proxy betting. Raiffeisen is a striking example. The Austrian bank is exposed to Russia, which the west will hit with sanctions if it invades Ukraine. Its shares led European stocks sharply lower on Monday amid chatter of imminent military action. They featured in a small rally on Tuesday after signs of Russian de-escalation.Vaguely dovish cooing between premiers Vladimir Putin and Olaf Scholz of Germany does not amount to a rapprochement. Meanwhile, any blow would come indirectly, via steeper energy prices. Raiffeisen is unusual in operating directly in Russia, rightly regarded as a disreputable market by most western businesses. Société Générale and UniCredit are the biggest European banks that ply a trade there. But loans and deposits in the country are less than 3 per cent of the total at each lender.In contrast, about 12 per cent of Raiffeisen’s assets and 20 per cent of its equity are in the region. It has been lending to customers there for more than two decades. The incentives are high interest rates, good profits and low debt levels.Returns on equity are astonishing, measured by the wretched standards of European banking. The figure for the eastern Europe division, which includes Ukraine and Belarus, were 27 per cent last year. Dividends taken out of the region of €1.3bn over the past five years equate to a yield of roughly 10 per cent.But it still faces steep political risks. Raiffeisen suffered in 2014 when Russia invaded and then annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea. Its shares lost more than 60 per cent of their value and the bank made a loss.Good returns on equity mean that even after recent declines, its shares remain 55 per cent higher over 12 months, outperforming the sector. Yet the shares trade at a 30 per cent discount to book value. Local peer Erste Bank focuses on eastern Europe but avoids Russia. It makes similar returns but trades at a 10 per cent premium to book.Sunk costs and good profits keep Raiffeisen in Russia. But the implicit discount in its share price — and premium on its cost of capital — makes one thing abundantly clear. Western businesses active in Russia are already subject to sanctions, albeit imposed by the market rather than the US and EU.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

344  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
345  Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz is the latest western leader to visit Moscow to explore whether two ceasefire accords brokered seven years ago between Kyiv and Moscow could defuse military tensions and end the war in eastern Ukraine.Brokered by France and Germany in 2014 and 2015 after Russian-backed separatists attacked and occupied territory in the Ukrainian Donbas region, Minsk I and II are being hailed as one way of avoiding a new conflict in Europe.Speaking to the press after his meeting with Scholz on Tuesday, Vladimir Putin himself said the agreements should be the “basis” for finding a solution to current tensions.The Russian president echoed his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron, who last week in Moscow said the accords were “the only way” to build peace, and US secretary of state Antony Blinken, who said the US and Ukraine stood “united” in supporting the agreements as the best way forward.But those talks under the so-called Normandy format — Russia, Ukraine, France, Germany — have stalled. The accords were written under conditions Kyiv now views as duress and Ukrainian interpretation differs from that of Moscow, analysts say. For Kyiv, they mean restoring territorial integrity; for Moscow, they mean the possibility of exercising a veto over Ukraine’s future.“The Minsk process is not so much a red herring as a dead duck,” said Nigel Gould-Davies, senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.Kyiv says it signed the Minsk agreements after Russian forces intervened in the Donbas war in support of Ukrainian separatists, imposing heavy military losses on Ukrainian troops at Ilovaisk in 2014 and Debaltseve in 2015. Moscow denies any involvement.Signed in September 2014 — six months after Russia annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea — Minsk I is a 12-point ceasefire deal that never held: Kyiv estimates 14,000 people have died since fighting broke out.Struck in February 2015, Minsk II laid out a formula designed to reintegrate the Russian-backed separatist regions into Ukraine by giving Moscow some say over Ukrainian politics. Critics note that then-president Petro Poroshenko signed it because Kyiv’s forces were facing defeat.It was signed by representatives of Russia, Ukraine, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the leaders of the two pro-Russian separatist regions. It was also endorsed by the UN Security Council. But it has never been fully implemented by either side. Minsk II is where diplomatic efforts are now focused.The main terms of Minsk II include an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of heavy weapons; monitoring by the OSCE; and resumption of full economic and social links between the two sides, such as pensions.To the extent that the OSCE still monitors the area and the pace of casualties has slowed, these parts of the accord have been partially met.More contentious, and variously interpreted by both sides, are the provisions that require Ukrainian government control restored over the border with Russia; withdrawal of all foreign armed formations, military equipment and mercenaries; and Ukrainian reforms that would provide a degree of self-rule to the eastern Donbas region.One is sequencing. Ukraine wants control of its international border before local elections are held in the Russian-supported breakaway regions. It also wants Russian forces — which Russia denies are present — to leave.By contrast, Moscow wants elections before Ukraine regains control over the border. Analysts say this would bar Ukraine from ever joining Nato, because Russian-backed elected MPs from the Donbas would be able to block such membership plans in Ukraine’s parliament.“You may like it, you may not like it — but deal with it, my gorgeous,” Putin said during his press conference with Macron last week, in a pointed comment to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.Kyiv takes a different view of what Donbas’s autonomous status would mean. Ukraine’s foreign minister last week said: “Among our red lines: no concessions on sovereignty, territorial integrity within internationally recognised borders; no ‘direct dialogue’ with Russian occupation administrations.and only the people of Ukraine have the right to define foreign policy course.”“Essentially, Russia wants to control the circumstances under which the elections take place,” Gould-Davies said. “I don’t see [how] any democratically elected leader of Ukraine could implement the Russian version.”Another issue is Moscow’s decision to issue more than 600,000 Russian passports to Donbas separatists — even though the Ukrainian constitution does not allow dual-nationality. Moreover, on Tuesday, Russia’s parliament adopted a resolution appealing Putin to recognise the independence of the would-be Donetsk and Luhansk statelets in the Donbas — a recognition western officials said would mean the death of Minsk. Asked about the resolution, Putin said that Russia would first aim for “the unrealised possibilities of fulfilling the Minsk accords”.Judging from Putin’s recent statements, no. “Everyone can see that the current government in Kyiv is moving to sabotage the Minsk agreements,” he said last week. “There’s no movement on principal issues like constitutional reform, amnesty, local elections, and legal aspects of Donbas special status.”Ukraine fears that the west will force a deal on Kyiv but has hinted at a compromise. On Monday in Kyiv, Scholz said Zelensky had assured him he would outline draft laws on Donbas’s special status, the constitutional amendment and the electoral law for Minsk talks.“Ukraine is making a very big contribution here,” Scholz said.Even so, simply meeting the Minsk accords is viewed by many Ukrainians as a concession to Russian military aggression. The prospect of Kyiv negotiating directly with the separatists, which Zelensky has ruled out, would also spell his political death, western diplomats say.That might provoke the kind of rupture that would then give Putin an excuse to intervene militarily. The last time Ukraine tabled constitutional changes that seemed to cater to the Moscow line in 2015, riots in the capital left three security officials dead.Conversely, as under Ukraine’s interpretation Donbas would not have sway over Kyiv via parliament, Russia’s supposed ploy of using Donbas to win control over Ukraine’s politics and foreign policy would have failed.“That would be a defeat for Russia.and its security demands that go far beyond Minsk,” said Gould-Davies.Additional reporting by Victor Mallet in Paris, Guy Chazan in Berlin
346  Vladimir Putin eased tensions in the Ukraine crisis on Tuesday, drawing down some Russian troops from border areas to enable “dialogue” with the west while keeping the threat of invasion hanging over his neighbour.Russia’s president said he was prepared to hold negotiations on intermediate nuclear missile forces and confidence-building measures with the west if the US and Nato agreed to discuss Moscow’s grievances with the transatlantic alliance — including its chief demand that it pledge to never admit Ukraine.The comments, made after three hours of talks with German chancellor Olaf Scholz, were Putin’s strongest indication yet that Russia was ready to de-escalate despite western warnings of Moscow’s plans for a renewed invasion of Ukraine.Speaking alongside Putin, Scholz said diplomatic options were “not by any means exhausted”.“The fact that we’re now hearing that some troops are being withdrawn is a good sign, and we hope that more will follow,” the chancellor said.Putin said “a decision has been taken to partially withdraw forces” following what Russia claims were exercises involving more than 130,000 troops near the border with Ukraine and in neighbouring Belarus.But he said future negotiations would hang on the “real situation on the ground”, which he said was unpredictable and “does not only depend on us”.Putin said Nato countries told him they would not admit Ukraine tomorrow but “only when they’ve got it ready”.“That might be too late for us. So we want to solve this issue right now.as part of a peaceful negotiating process,” he added.Addressing one of Russia’s crucial demands, Scholz said Ukraine’s Nato membership was “not on the agenda”.“That is not an issue that’s going to come up again while we’re in office. I don’t know how long the president intends to stay in office, I have the feeling that it will be a long time, but not forever,” Scholz said.The talks between Scholz and Putin were the latest in a series of last-ditch efforts by western leaders to talk the Russian president out of invading Ukraine.Speaking in Brussels, Nato’s secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said he had not seen “any sign of de-escalation” by Russian troops near Ukraine, but added there was reason for “cautious optimism” in signs that Russia wished to continue with diplomacy.He warned that the security alliance had not seen indications of a reduced military presence and that Moscow still had the means to mount an attack.“What we need to see is a significant and enduring withdrawal of forces, troops and not least the heavy equipment,” Stoltenberg said.In a call with Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, said Washington remained committed to “pursu[ing] a diplomatic solution to the crisis Moscow has precipitated” and believed “that a window remains to resolve the crisis peacefully”. Blinken said the US hoped for a written response from Moscow on “concrete areas for discussion regarding European security” sent by the US and Nato to Russia last month, according to the state department’s account of the conversation.While Lavrov complained about the “aggressive rhetoric spread by Washington and its allies”, he “stressed the importance of ongoing work” on draft security guarantees, according to Russia’s foreign ministry.Earlier, Russia’s defence ministry said units from the country’s southern and western military districts were heading back to base following the completion of drills. “The units.have already started loading on to rail and road transport and will start moving to their military garrisons today,” said Igor Konashenkov, a ministry spokesperson.European and US equities rose on Tuesday in the wake of the Russian announcement, while the oil price fell.Russia has threatened “the most unpredictable and grave consequences” if the west did not agree to two draft security protocols that would roll back Nato’s presence in eastern Europe.In a sign of continuing tensions, Russia’s lower house of parliament asked Putin to sign a resolution recognising two Moscow-backed separatist states in eastern Ukraine.The Kremlin has given no indication as to whether Putin would back the measure, which would probably put an end to the fraught Minsk peace process governing the conflict in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region.Additional reporting by James Politi in Washington
347  The writer is former director of the US National Security Agency and founding commander of United States Cyber Command. He currently serves as chair and co-CEO of IronNetRight now, the world has a front-row seat to what could possibly be the first full-scale cyber war in the making. With some 130,000 Russian troops arrayed around Ukraine’s borders, the risk of invasion is high, and there can be little doubt that such a modern military campaign would almost certainly include an extensive cyber attack component. Even if there is ultimately no attempt to invade Ukraine with conventional forces, there is widespread consensus that President Vladimir Putin has put himself in a position where he must do something. A cyber attack — which is easy and comparatively cheap — is likely to top that list. As Russia showed during the 2008 Georgia conflict, hacking government systems as well as financial and energy sectors can cause chaos.Though some in the west may believe this isn’t their problem, that attitude reflects a disregard for history. It was less than five years ago that Russia conducted NotPetya, a cyber attack targeting Ukrainian power, transportation, and financial systems in an attempt to further destabilise the country. But rather than being the cyber equivalent of a precision smart bomb, NotPetya spread rapidly across the globe.The attack caused companies around the world — including in the US, UK, France, Germany, and India — to suffer massive operational disruptions. With ripple effects hitting nearly every corner of the global economy, total worldwide costs were estimated by the White House to exceed $10bn.Today, not only is the threat of a cyber attack higher, but the risk of damage is far greater. Microsoft has already warned that it has detected destructive malware recently placed within Ukrainian computer networks, spanning multiple government, non-profit and information technology organisations. The lesson learned from NotPetya is that once activated, this malware could spread far beyond its intended targets.The US Department of Homeland Security has warned that even if a cyber attack targeted against Ukraine did not spread beyond its borders, Russian disruptive or destructive cyber attacks directly against the US are possible. This is a real risk for all Nato members.Finding an escape from this particular crisis is beyond the power of any individual organisation, company or executive. But what is within our own control are the often woefully inadequate cyber defences we deploy. While there is no silver bullet, it is clear that a foundational element of securing our systems is the concept of collective defence. This connects companies and other organisations — especially in critical infrastructure — with each other and with government, in order to share anonymised data about attempted cyber intrusions and attacks at the speed of modern networks. Most recently, collective defence helped detect adversaries trying to exploit the Log4j vulnerability, which infiltrated the Belgian ministry of defence, among other targets.Today, most cyber attacks are directed against multiple targets simultaneously, but the victims — and the government agencies charged with protecting us — are currently unable to see when and where those attacks are taking place. No one has time to draft a memo or send a warning email when data is disappearing off the screen before their eyes.A collective defence approach creates a radar-like picture of cyber space, enabling multiple teams to take on adversaries immediately. Imagine a group of 100 midsize companies with 10 network security operators each. Collective defence changes their entire dynamic: instead of 10 people fighting on their own against Russian-backed cybercriminal groups, there are 1,000 security professionals rallying together the instant any of them comes under threat. I like those odds a lot better.The company I co-founded after leaving the military, IronNet, focuses on collective defence. But this global vision for a more secure future is shared by many other cyber leaders. General Paul Nakasone, the current commander of US Cyber Command, recently wrote that “cyber security is a team sport: the scope and scale of the problem are too large for any single organisation to tackle alone,” while the Office of the National Cyber Director at the White House stated that “shared defence is an imperative, not a choice”.Cyber security remains the exposed underbelly of democracies around the world. Ukraine is already facing the cyber-equivalent of a howitzer. We will all be faced with a 9/11-scale threat in cyber space — the question is simply when. Banding together is a must if we are to protect ourselves against one of the greatest risks to a prosperous and peaceful future.
348  Soaring energy prices have taken a toll on the eurozone economy, combining with a jump in Chinese imports to drive the bloc’s trade deficit in goods to a 13-year high in December.Imports of goods into the eurozone rose 36.7 per cent in value in December, compared with the same month a year earlier, mainly driven by higher energy prices, Eurostat said on Tuesday. The eurozone relies on imports for most of its oil and gas supplies. The value of goods exports from the bloc rose 14.1 per cent over the same period.Its monthly trade balance was also hit by a 53 per cent year-on-year rise in imports from China. As a result, the 19-country single currency bloc’s seasonally adjusted trade deficit in goods rose to €9.7bn in the final month of last year, its highest level since August 2008.Over the whole of last year, the bloc’s long-running trade surplus with the rest of the world fell to €128.4bn, down 45 per cent from the previous year.“The eurozone trade surplus has suffered a violent reversal in the past six months,” said Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “Higher costs of energy imports are part of the explanation, but the driver is a blowout deficit with China.”Figures for the EU showed an even larger seasonally adjusted trade deficit in goods of €17.2bn in December. For the full year, the EU increased its trade surplus in goods slightly with the US and the UK, but this was more than offset by its equivalent deficit with China widening 36 per cent from 2020 to €248.9bn.Trade between the EU and UK continued to show signs of disruption after the Brexit transition period expired at the end of 2020, leading to the introduction of tariffs on many goods traded between the two for the first time last year.EU goods exports to the UK rose 1.9 per cent last year — significantly smaller than increases to its other main trading partners — but EU imports of goods from the UK fell 13.6 per cent, in contrast to increased imports from most other countries.Eurostat said Brexit meant “data on trade with the UK are not fully comparable with data on trade with other extra-EU trade partners, and for reference periods before and after the end of 2020”.Europe’s heavy reliance on Russia, which supplies about 40 per cent of the EU’s natural gas imports and a third of its crude oil imports, has been exposed in recent months by the tensions over Ukraine that have driven up energy prices.The value of EU imports from Russia rose two-thirds last year, more than quadrupling the EU’s trade deficit in goods with Russia to €69.2bn.Separately, the European Central Bank on Tuesday published estimates showing that if natural gas prices remained high it would reduce gross domestic product in the euro area by 0.2 per cent this year.A “gas rationing shock”, where supplies to eurozone companies fell 10 per cent, would lower GDP by 0.7 per cent, the ECB added.
349  France is to reorganise its counter-terrorism operation in west Africa, according to foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, in the wake of a coup d’état in Mali and the arrival of Russian mercenaries to support the junta.“We are going to reorganise to ensure the continuation of the fight against terrorism,” he told the France 5 television channel late on Monday, adding that President Emmanuel Macron wanted forces to be redeployed but to remain in the west African Sahel region.“If the conditions are no longer there for us to operate in Mali — and that is clearly the case — we’ll continue to fight terrorism next door with the Sahel countries which definitely want us to do so,” Le Drian said, although he stopped short of announcing an immediate full withdrawal.Macron will host a dinner at the Elysée Palace on Wednesday — on the eve of an EU-Africa summit in Brussels — for France’s African and European military partners in the Sahel after consultations in recent days led by Le Drian and defence minister Florence Parly, French officials said.“The aim of the dinner discussions will be to work out how to operate effectively in Mali.to see if the conditions are right to continue,” said one official.Isis and al-Qaeda-linked groups control large parts of central and northern Mali, which jihadis briefly captured in late 2012, prompting a French military intervention that has become increasingly unpopular as violence has spread across the country and into neighbouring Niger and Burkina Faso. Thousands have been killed and millions displaced across the Sahel.Relations between Paris and Bamako have deteriorated sharply since Assimi Goita led a coup that overthrew the democratically elected government in August 2020 and then seized complete control in a second coup in May 2021, ousting interim civilian leaders who were seen as close to France.Macron announced in July last year that France would halve its 5,000-strong force fighting Islamists in the Sahel as part of his attempt to avoid “infinite war” in the region.Mali’s rulers have criticised the French drawdown as “abandonment” but at the same time been highly critical of France and a multinational special forces group called the Takuba Task Force — set up by Paris to pursue the war against insurgents — for infringing its sovereignty.Mali’s west African neighbours and the EU imposed severe economic sanctions on the country after the interim government proposed holding on to power until elections in 2025.Denmark began withdrawing its special forces last month after being ordered to do so by Mali, and all western military operations in Mali are now in doubt.Le Drian said there were now 1,000 mercenaries from Russia’s Wagner group in Mali, a country “run today by five colonels who have taken power”. He said: “It’s the junta that has cut itself off and lost the plot and which must accept the consequences.” Wagner mercenaries have been accused by the UN of gross human rights abuses and possible war crimes in Libya and the Central African Republic.Mali’s August coup was the first in a string of putsches across west and central Africa as soldiers seized power in Chad, Guinea and Burkina Faso.Additional reporting by Neil Munshi in Lagos
350  One thing to start:Welcome back to another Energy Source.Soaring energy prices remain a big theme for us today. The US government’s claim of an imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine (which has been denied by Moscow) are one source of bullish sentiment. And for good reason, given that a conflict involving two major commodity producers would feed into fears of wider global shortages.But it isn’t just a supply matter. Demand is ripping higher, especially in the US, where petroleum consumption has soared in recent weeks. For more on this see our first note.We also have another round-up of developments across the Atlantic. Data Drill breaks down Americans’ top concerns about owning an electric vehicle. Addressing these worries could help spur EV adoption.America’s thirst for fossil fuels has never been greater.Last week, the Energy Information Administration, the US government’s energy forecaster and data shop, said the four-week average for total petroleum product demand — which includes petrol, diesel, jet fuel and others — was running at 21.9mn barrels a day. That’s a record high — and 12 per cent higher than this time last year.It is both an extraordinary reversal from the pandemic-driven collapse in fuel demand and a worrying data point about fossil fuels’ stickiness in the energy transition.We took a closer look at the demand numbers to see what drove the record consumption (frigid weather across the north-east US was a big factor), the fuels recovering fastest from the downturn — and what it all tells us about the coming months as surging demand threatens to bring about $100-plus oil prices.Here is a chart on the change in US demand for major fuels compared to February 2020, just before the start of the pandemic.First, diesel, propane and other so-called heavier fuels spiked in January and early February as winter storms blanketed the north-east. Many generators and homes turned to these products to stay warm and keep the lights on as demand surged.The EIA noted that at one point, oil-fired electricity generation — usually seen as a relic of a dirtier energy past — was delivering more than 20 per cent of the north-east’s power to top up insufficient gas and renewables supply.This surge is largely responsible for pushing consumption to the record highs seen over the past month and are likely to fade with warmer temperatures.Still, there appears to be plenty of room for demand for other fuels to continue to march higher and push overall consumption to fresh records. That is especially so as the Omicron outbreak fades and, as Dr Anthony Fauci put it to the Financial Times, the “full blown” phase of the pandemic comes to an end.Take petrol demand. After falling around 40 per cent in the first months of the pandemic, drivers are now burning nearly as much petrol as they were before Covid-19 hit the US, even as prices at the pump have risen to seven-year highs.As the Omicron variant recedes, will a more widespread return to offices and other activities drive petrol demand back to 2019 levels and higher? It seems likely. If it does, it could provide another boost for prices.Jet fuel demand, which was hardest hit by the pandemic, is also still playing catch-up and will benefit from a wider reopening of the economy.Expectations that demand will continue to recover at the same time that inventories are low and suppliers are struggling to keep up is fuelling oil’s bulls. (Derek Brower)Oil prices continue to edge towards the triple digits as the prospect of an imminent war in Ukraine looms large over energy and financial markets.Brent crude, the international oil marker, yesterday pushed past $96 a barrel for the first time since 2014. It later dropped back slightly after Russia’s foreign minister suggested diplomacy could yet avert full-blown conflict.The price volatility underlines fears of a hit to oil flows should Moscow proceed with an invasion of Ukraine. Russia exports 4.5mn barrels of crude a day.But for now, Bhushan added, oil traders were still treating the prospect of a serious disruption to Russian exports as “highly unlikely”. Stock markets were also skittish yesterday.Elsewhere, regulators in Brussels halted an antitrust probe into QatarEnergy amid concerns that gas supplies from Russia to Europe could be disrupted in the case of an invasion.Still, diplomatic efforts to avert conflict are persisting. An hour-long call between US president Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin at the weekend appeared to go nowhere. But Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, said yesterday the Kremlin was prepared to keep talking to the west about its security concerns.US officials said last night, however, that Lavrov’s comments were at odds with Russian military preparations for an assault, which had continued to advance in recent days.Much now rests on the shoulders of Germany’s new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, who visited Kyiv yesterday, emphasising that Ukrainian membership of Nato was “not on the agenda” — a message that could be seen as an attempt to address Russia’s security concerns.Scholz heads to Moscow today for talks with Putin. For an insight into the Russian leader’s thinking, this piece is worth a few minutes of your time. (Myles McCormick)Americans thinking about buying electric vehicles after the plethora of EV advertisements on Super Bowl Sunday may soon find more public chargers available. Last Thursday, President Biden laid out plans to distribute $5bn in funds from the bipartisan infrastructure law to build electric vehicle chargers. The funding will be distributed over five years to all 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico.The $5bn is the most significant federal investment in EV charging to date, but nowhere near the amount necessary to achieve Biden’s plan of 500,000 charging stations by 2030. Atlas Public Policy, a DC think-tank, estimates it will cost $39bn to build out this charging network. AlixPartners, a financial consultancy, estimates a cost of $30-$50bn. “The money is not going to be all that needs to be done by government,” said Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas. “It’s certainly going to require a considerably.larger role for electric utilities and the private sector if the country’s going to achieve the goal that the administration’s laid out.” State-led funding for public chargers so far stands at less than $1bn, according to Atlas. The think-tank estimated last year that public charging commitments from utilities, states and charging service providers amounted to less than $4.5bn.Currently, the US has approximately 47,138 public charging stations, according to US Department of Energy data. Nearly half of all stations are concentrated in just four states: California, New York, Florida, and Texas. These are also among the top in EV registrations.Having a robust charging network is key to encouraging EV adoption. About 40 per cent of Americans cite insufficient places to charge as their biggest concern about owning or leasing an EV, according to an AlixPartners survey. (Amanda Chu)
351  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.The EU’s record on Africa is patchy at best and the pandemic hasn’t exactly improved its reputation, given the slow pace of vaccine donations and bloc’s opposition to a patent waiver on Covid-19 vaccines.Negotiators are meeting later today to iron out the final statement of the EU-African Union summit starting on Thursday in Brussels. Meanwhile, Poland has threatened not to sign up to the statement because of its rule of law dispute with Brussels. (It won’t have a real impact, the EU can still adopt it without Warsaw.) I’ll run you through the outstanding differences and why organisers opted for a wedding reception style gathering with large round tables on different topics.Meanwhile, EU officials yesterday acknowledged that its leaders could be summoned on Thursday morning for an emergency meeting on Ukraine if the security situation worsens. A decision in this regard could potentially be taken after Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz returns from his meeting with Russia’s president Vladimir Putin later today.Several European airlines have started to avoid the Ukrainian airspace, and we’ll look at the guidance and concerns this industry has in respect to a renewed conflict in the country.The long-delayed summit between EU and African Union leaders will aim to restore trust between the two continents (and their institutions) with extra funding, more vaccine production in Africa, and a diluted focus on migration.Fitting 80 delegations with sometimes clashing agendas into one room was a near-impossible task from the outset, so organisers have broken down discussions in groups of countries seated around tables with different topics and co-chaired by a European and an African leader.Germany and South Africa, for instance, will co-chair the discussion on “health systems and vaccine production”.Talks on migration, meanwhile, will be part of a broader set of topics, with a senior EU official confirming that one of the roundtables at the summit will be dedicated to migration, mobility, training and skills.If the EU wants to make progress on the issue of returns and readmissions of migrants, it will be necessary to engage in a “broader partnership” with the Africans, and particularly with priority countries where the issue is most relevant.“We have for the first time in many years the occasion to have direct dialogue with African leaders on this topic,” said the official. “I do not exclude that this will be an intense debate, but this is not a problem.”As a quick reminder, the EU took the AU by surprise when it decided at a summit in 2018 to set up “disembarkation platforms” in African countries where they would deport migrants who reach Europe. The plan was quietly shelved amid outrage from the AU itself.The language on migration in the draft statement differs considerably between what the EU suggests and what the AU is willing to accept. The AU objects to the expression “irregular migration”, and instead is referring to “the root causes of forced displacement, notably those induced by climate change”.On vaccines, the AU would have liked a commitment from the EU for 700mn Covid-19 vaccine doses by mid-2022 to benefit Africa, while the bloc is only willing to commit to its existing goal of providing 700mn doses to developing countries, of which 450mn will benefit Africa.European governments, the European Commission and EU financial institutions (so-called Team Europe) also pledge a yet undecided billion-euro amount as an “Africa-Europe investment package” for the continent’s energy, transport and digital infrastructure.But the AU’s request to include a reference to the World Trade Organization process aimed at obtaining a patent waiver for Covid vaccines is likely to be rejected — and it hasn’t been included in the current draft statement.European stocks fell yesterday to the second-lowest point this year, while natural gas contracts for next-month delivery jumped 10 per cent and the international oil benchmark Brent crude rose at the highest level in more than seven years, after US warnings that an attack by Russia against Ukraine could begin “any day now”. (More here)How long will people still be able to catch a flight out of Ukraine?A handful of airlines including Norwegian and KLM have decided to stay clear of Ukrainian airspace following the increased tensions with Russia, and airlines bosses were joined yesterday by EU and member-state officials on crisis calls to try to chart a path forward, writes Philip Georgiadis in London.On the surface, not much has changed. Airlines have taken advice from their own in-house security teams, and for now the majority are still willing to fly into and over Ukrainian airspace, said a person briefed on the discussions.But behind the scenes many are taking action, including shorter turnround times on the ground, daylight-only operations and carrying extra fuel to allow them to rapidly respond to any changes to the security situation, according to trade body Airlines for Europe.Some airline bosses are also expecting clearer guidance from the EU’s Aviation Safety Agency imminently, which has said it is “monitoring the situation closely”.The situation is particularly fraught given the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine in 2014, which killed 298 people and led air safety officials to declare a “no-fly zone” over a swath of eastern Ukraine and Crimea.
352  While Oleg Tsaryov said he spent last weekend in the Crimean foothills searching for his lost dog, western intelligence assessed the former Ukrainian lawmaker could be lined up for something more sinister: heading up a Kremlin plot to lead a puppet government in Kyiv in the event of a Russian invasion.Moscow “might position Oleg Tsaryov, and others, in leadership roles as part of this effort”, a western intelligence official told the Financial Times at the weekend.Tsaryov’s name as Putin’s possible choice to lead regime change in Ukraine came from US intelligence, which made it available to the Five Eyes intelligence alliance made up of the US, UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, according to the official who requested anonymity.The warning was the latest in a series of detailed intelligence disclosures from the US and its European allies about Russian president Vladimir Putin’s intentions to crush Ukraine’s army and install a pro-Moscow government.But the western claims have struck people in Russian and Ukrainian political circles as alternately chilling and far-fetched — not least of all Tsaryov, who abandoned his political career in 2015 and now runs three Soviet-style wellness clinics on the Black Sea.“This is a pretty funny situation,” Tsaryov told the FT by telephone on Monday. “Look at me. I’m not even invited to speak on [Russian] state TV because I’m not important enough. I’m a sanatorium director in Yalta.”The US and its allies have become increasingly vocal in their attempts to outflank Putin in the battle for global public opinion over Russia’s threat to Ukraine — and to try to deter him from launching another attack on its territory.In January, the US alleged that exiled allies of Viktor Medvedchuk, a pro-Moscow politician who counts Putin as godfather to one of his daughters, were on a Russian shortlist to rule Ukraine.The UK then said Yevhen Murayev, a former MP who runs a Russian-language TV channel in Ukraine that authorities banned over the weekend, was being considered to lead the puppet government.The Kremlin and Murayev dismissed the accusations. Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesperson, did not respond to a request for comment about the alleged plans to install Tsaryov.Analysts said Tsaryov made even less sense than the previous names floated by US and UK intelligence — raising questions over the west’s quality of insight into the Kremlin’s plans for Ukraine or Moscow’s difficulty finding credible candidates to install in Kyiv.“Tsaryov is a discredited clown. He and Murayev are toxic anti-Ukrainian politicians. Their only support in Ukraine is at the point of a gun barrel,” said Brian Mefford, a US political consultant based in Ukraine.Mefford said he believed the US was “preemptively releasing intelligence in real time in order to both warn Ukrainians as well as shock the Ukrainian people into a realisation just how bad the situation really is”.A native of Dnipro in eastern Ukraine, Tsaryov served in the pro-Moscow Party of Regions led by Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia in 2014 following a pro-western revolution.After Russia’s annexation of Crimea the same year and the beginning of a Moscow-backed separatist conflict in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, Tsaryov ran for president on a pro-Russian ticket that was so unpopular he was chased out of a Kyiv TV studio and beaten up by an angry mob.“They ripped all my clothes off. I was totally naked,” the 51-year-old said. He fled to the Donbas, where he headed up a prospective lawmaking body dubbed the “parliament of Novorossia” to unite the two Russian-backed separatist statelets in a manner styled after the European parliament.He then moved to Crimea after Ukraine charged him with supporting the separatists in 2015. There was “obviously barely any chance” of him leading a coup, Tsaryov said.The disclosure of western intelligence about Putin’s plans towards Ukraine has intensified even as officials in Kyiv have rebuked it as too strident and even counterproductive. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said on Saturday that there was “too much information in the information space”.But officials in US president Joe Biden’s administration have defended the strategy on the grounds that they do not want Putin to create a justification for the conflict and set the narrative of the crisis — given Russia’s history of disinformation campaigns.Jake Sullivan, White House national security adviser, on Friday rejected comparisons with the US release of intelligence about Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction, which was later debunked, in the run-up to the 2003 Iraq war.“In Iraq, intelligence was used and deployed from this very podium to start a war. We’re trying to stop a war,” Sullivan told reporters from the White House briefing room. “All we can do is come here before you in good faith and share everything we know to the best of our ability, while protecting sources and methods so we continue to get the access to intelligence we need.”In addition to the claims about Moscow’s plans for a puppet regime in Kyiv, the US and its allies have openly spoken about the build-up of more than 130,000 Russian troops on Ukraine’s border. They have also alleged Putin was planning to engineer a pretext for war via a “false-flag” operation in which Russia would fake a Ukrainian attack.“The Russians are playing a lot of games and flooding the environment with all sorts of rumours and exaggerations [to] better understand how Ukrainian society is thinking and how its psychology is evolving under the current stress,” a former senior western intelligence official said.“Creating chaos is a traditional tactic. If Putin wants to create the appearance of a civil war with riots on the streets. Tsaryov might be a useful marionette until a long-term candidate can be groomed.”Andrea Kendall-Taylor, director of the transatlantic security programme at the Center for a New American Security, said she did not see “a lot of downside risk” in western warnings about Russia’s plans.“Having missed the [Crimea] incursion of 2014, having not been prepared and caught flat-footed when Russia intervened in Syria, not having really warned about the threats of Russia’s attacks on [the US] election in 2016, why would we not warn?” she asked. “If it doesn’t come to fruition, we should all be glad and relieved.”Additional reporting by John Paul Rathbone in London
353  Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik says he remains determined to defy the west and win greater autonomy for ethnic Serbs in Bosnia, reversing years of gradual centralisation he insists outsiders have forced on the country since the postwar settlement of the 1990s.Such a move could destabilise the entire western Balkans and risk plunging it back into violence, according to regional and western leaders.Asked if he was prepared to make good on his threat to withdraw the Serb Republic — one of two ethnically based entities that make up Bosnia — from national-level institutions, Dodik told the Financial Times in an interview: “Of course. I don’t think we should be taken lightly. We are fully convinced we are right.”But Dodik, a former centre-left politician who has become increasingly nationalistic, said he would stop short of risking violence in pursuit of his goals. “I don’t want a war. That is not our agenda,” Dodik said. “I will not sacrifice peace for the status of Republika Srpska.”Bosnia’s entities, the Serb Republic and the Bosniak-Croat Federation, were established by the 1995 Dayton Agreement that ended the wars of the 1990s after the break-up of Yugoslavia. In December, lawmakers in the Serb regional parliament in Banja Luka alarmed western powers by voting to separate the Serb Republic’s tax authority, judiciary and armed forces from Bosnia.While the vote was non-binding, opponents saw it as advancing Dodik’s agenda for secession from Sarajevo — reigniting fears among regional leaders and diplomats of a collapse of the Dayton deal and a domino effect, with violence spreading across the western Balkans.In response, the US imposed sanctions on Dodik. “Dodik’s actions threaten Bosnia’s stability, sovereignty and territorial integrity and undermine the Dayton Peace Accords, thereby risking wider regional instability,” the US Treasury Department said as it announced the move last month.Dodik rejected accusations that his ambitions undermined Bosnia’s stability. He envisaged Bosnia as a loose federation with wide regional autonomy, and insisted secession was not among his goals.“If there is no agreement that will satisfy all stakeholders, a question arises of what happens to Bosnia then,” he said. “But there is no secession plan.”Dodik insisted Bosnia must maintain the ethnic boundaries established by Dayton, and the wide autonomy he said it granted to the country’s three main groups: Muslim Bosniaks, Catholic Croats and Orthodox Serbs. Later changes had tipped the power balance away from the separate entities to the federal level and so given Bosniaks — the largest group in Bosnia — greater influence, he argued.“Constitutional competences have been changed. The state level of Bosnia was given undue powers,” he said. “We are not enthusiastic about Bosnia. Bosnia was imposed on us.”He added: “Westerners came to me saying: never mind [the original Dayton deal], let’s do something that will appeal to generations in a century. And I tell them: well, never mind your idealism. Bosnia will be realistic.[foreign politicians] should not take sides.”He contended that under Dayton, Banja Luka also had the right to control public assets such as land and that the original accord had not given Sarajevo powers over military, judiciary or fiscal matters.“How come, then, that I am being called out for trying to make sure the [original Dayton] agreement is honoured?” he said.Dodik was initially backed by the west as he confronted war crimes and sought to move forward from the divisions of the past. He served two terms as the Serb Republic’s premier between 1998 and 2010, when he became the entity’s president. Since 2018 he has been the Serb representative in Bosnia’s national three-person presidency.However, his growing nationalism, ties to Russia and allegations of corruption, which Dodik denies, have soured relations with Nato and western capitals.Dodik denied his agenda was linked to Moscow’s and said Bosnia should “stay neutral” as fears grow of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.While the west ignored Bosnian Serb opinions on the perceived dangers of multi-ethnic societies and limiting external influence, hardline leaders such as Russian President Vladimir Putin and Hungarian premier Viktor Orban embraced them, he said.Like Russia, Serbs everywhere were suspicious about the role of Nato in Europe, Dodik acknowledged.“I have sympathy for Russia believing its security is inviolable and that it should protect its security,” he said. “Nato twice bombed Serbs without [UN] Security Council backing.That has shaped Serbs’ collective sentiment. It is unfair to expect us to sympathise with those who dropped bombs on us.”Dodik visited the Kremlin in December. “Putin never told me I should do anything[and] always said he respected the Dayton Agreement,” the Bosnian Serb leader said.In his state of the nation address at the weekend, Orban criticised “superpower arrogance” in the western Balkans and said Hungary would not support the EU if it moved to impose sanctions against the Bosnian Serbs.“We will not accept decisions in Brussels that are against Hungary’s interests,” he said. “Since Hungary has an interest in peace, economic development and the inclusion of the region in the EU, there can be no question of sanctions and punitive policies.”The west had sought to nudge Bosnia toward a western-style liberal democracy, Dodik argued. Last year, he ordered Serb lawmakers to boycott work in the Sarajevo parliament in protest over a genocide denial ban imposed by the then high representative Valentin Inzko.Dodik singled out the UK for criticism after foreign secretary Liz Truss endorsed the US sanctions in January. “Britain returns here.telling us stories about integration just as they left the EU. They have the right to their position, and we don’t?”Sanctions would only strengthen him and his party ahead of national and regional elections in October, he said.“We will pull off a landslide,” he said. “Somewhere else, American sanctions might help take down politicians. Here, if foreigners.want to punish or disqualify someone, [that person] will gain in popularity.I enjoyed less support before the [US] sanctions than now.”
354  If all had gone to plan, Pablo Casado would have burnished his credentials as Spain’s prime minister-in-waiting this week, restored electoral impetus to his centre-right People’s party and seen off his internal rivals.Instead, the big winner of a snap election the PP triggered in Casado’s native region of Castile-León was the party’s hard-right rival Vox, which more than tripled its vote to a record 18 per cent.Sunday’s poll result cast a spotlight on the PP’s predicament as a party that, like many of its European counterparts, is struggling to retain voters attracted to the more clear-cut message of the far right and which, if it is to return to national power, may have to do so in coalition with Vox.“You can’t have a party that gives the impression it doesn’t like its own voters: Casado doesn’t seem to register that they are defecting en masse to Vox,” Ana Palacio, a former PP foreign minister, told the Financial Times, suggesting the party had lost touch with former supporters. “It’s hard to think of an issue where the party has a clear position.It can’t go on just reacting to events.”The PP was seeking an absolute majority in Castile-León, the Spanish heartland it has governed for 35 years, and to bounce back from the last such contest, held three years ago when the party was at its lowest ebb.The election took on added significance as the PP tried to regain the initiative after months of internal feuding — principally between Casado and Isabel Díaz Ayuso, the head of the Madrid regional government — took a toll on the party’s standing in the polls.With Spain’s next general election due by the end of 2023, Casado’s lieutenants made clear he was keen for an electoral success to underline his chances of taking power from the country’s Socialist-radical left coalition — and one, which unlike the PP’s previous triumph, in a Madrid regional contest last year, would owe nothing to Díaz Ayuso.In the event, the PP failed to improve on its 31 per cent share of support it received in 2019. Its 31 seats in the 81-member regional assembly represented an increase of just two and left it at the mercy of Vox, which is demanding a place in Castile-León’s government.“Calling the elections was a mistake and the PP knows it.Vox has become unmanageable for the PP,” said Lucía Méndez, a leading Spanish journalist. “This is about much more than Castile-León: there’s a serious risk for the PP that Vox will equal it in national elections.Casado’s leadership is becoming weaker and weaker.”The Socialists of prime minister Pedro Sánchez, which had come first in the previous Castile-León election but failed to form an administration, endured an even worse night, losing five percentage points, seven seats and more than 100,000 votes. In line with a string of disastrous results over the past three years, the PP’s former coalition partner, the centrist Ciudadanos, was almost wiped out completely, forfeiting all but one of their 12 seats.But the votes the PP gained from Ciudadanos did not make up for those it lost to Vox, as its support declined by over 50,000 votes.Narciso Michavila, a prominent pollster who has advised Casado, noted that, because Castile-León does not have as extensive local media as other regions, national issues played an outsized role in the election. He said the PP fell back as much as three percentage points when one of the party’s national MPs mistakenly cast the decisive vote to approve the Socialist-led government’s signature labour reform.Vox’s 13 seats are enough to provide the PP with its only route to a majority unless the Socialists abstain in an investiture vote. The remaining alternative — the PP banding together with smaller regional parties — would still command less than half of the Castile-León assembly.“The chess board has changed,” said Michavila, who suggested he was revising his opinion that the PP could score a big enough victory in a general election to govern without depending on Vox. “In the current context, it doesn’t seem that Vox is going to weaken.”In the days before the poll, an increasingly confident Vox attacked the “rancid and sectarian” left and the “cowardly” traditional right, while alleging that Spain’s streets had been made unsafe by a “real migrant invasion”.On election night in Castile-León, Vox’s Santiago Abascal was the only national party leader to address the cameras, as he declared victory and proclaimed the hard-right’s force’s “right and duty” to enter a regional government for the first time. Up until now Vox has supported PP-led administrations from outside.Such a prospect is anathema to Casado, who has denounced Vox’s “anti-liberal populism” and “isolationism” and is aware that if the hard-right party gains a coalition place in Castile-León it will be still harder to shut out of other regional administrations or a national government.“We are beginning a dialogue with all the parties,” said Pablo Montesinos, a leading PP official. “The objective is an [exclusively] PP government.” But as the Socialists rejected the idea of helping the PP into office and Vox stepped up its demands for a coalition, that objective looked all but out of reach.“The PP doesn’t seem to have a way out,” said Méndez. “It’s the latest sign that politics in Spain are becoming ever more unstable.”
355  The Russian military menace against Ukraine is forcing EU capitals to close ranks — and not just on how to respond if Moscow proceeds with fresh aggression against Ukraine. It has also spurred neighbouring Poland, which has watched Moscow deploy over 30,000 troops to its neighbour Belarus, to begin mending fences with Washington and Brussels over its judicial reforms and clampdown on independent media.Earlier this month, President Andrzej Duda put forward a bill to scrap a disciplinary chamber for judges, one of a number of reforms introduced since 2015 by the ultraconservative Law and Justice government which critics say amount to exerting political control over the judiciary. The disciplinary chamber was also the main bone of contention in a bitter legal and political row between Brussels and Poland over the rule of law and the power of the EU to uphold it in member states.“We don’t need this fight,” Duda said.It was a climbdown from the rhetoric the Polish leadership has deployed in recent months to defend its sovereignty against what it sees as a liberal-left EU establishment. It comes after Duda in December vetoed a law that would have allowed Warsaw to take over an independent TV channel which has been critical of the government. The law had been criticised by Washington, whose unequivocal support Warsaw now needs.Poland has also settled a case about a polluting coal mine on the border with the Czech Republic. It had defied a European court order to halt operations at the mine — earning a fine of €500,000 a day. It will now pay Prague €45mn in compensation.There had been some speculation that Law and Justice would not support Duda’s move and that the president, an ally of the party, had gone out on a limb. But the party last week tabled its own bill to overhaul the disciplinary regime.So is this a white flag from Warsaw? Not exactly. It is unclear whether the government will follow through with the necessary legislation. Zbigniew Ziobro, the justice minister, who leads a hardline junior party in the coalition government, may not support it, imperilling the government’s slender majority.“If we accept [Duda’s] bill it will allow the EU to interfere in our judicial system directly,” said Sebastian Kaleta, deputy justice minister. The ministry is working on other reforms that would raise a red flag with Brussels.“On one side the ring is Duda and on the other is Ziobro. The rest is just collateral [damage],” said Tadeusz Koscinski, a technocrat who was ousted as finance minister last week.The second caveat is whether the proposed legislative changes really address the underlying problem.Adam Bodnar, Poland’s official ombudsman who has defended purged judges, said Warsaw’s proposed concessions would not solve the problems of the politically controlled appointments body — the National Council of the Judiciary — or of the status of the many judges loyal to the ruling party that the NCJ has installed.“If the EU accepts this arrangement, it won’t have any arguments for continuing the fight,” Bodnar said.The European Commission may conclude Poland has moved enough to cut a deal, including approval of its bid for €36bn in EU recovery funds. But the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice will keep up the pressure on Warsaw.Even if there is a truce on rule of law issues, Warsaw is preparing for other fights, especially EU-mandated reductions in carbon emissions which will be tough on coal-dependent Poland.“The cost of climate policy will be the beginning of the process of Polexit,” said Janusz Kowalski, an MP from Ziobro’s party. Kaleta said the government was drawing up legal arguments to veto parts of the emissions cut plan.For now, though, Warsaw is focused on Russian aggression. “We need to concentrate on security issues. Better relations within the EU will serve all of us,” Marcin Przydacz, deputy foreign minister, told the FT.“The fewer divisions and front lines we have open the better. This is an olive branch. Let’s sit down and find a way to deal with that.”
356  US and European stocks fell in volatile trading on Monday as investors were spooked by fears of an imminent Russian attack on Ukraine.The FTSE All World index slid 1 per cent as global equities lurched lower. The declines were most significant in Europe, where the benchmark Stoxx 600 index fell 1.8 per cent as the geopolitical crisis intensified.Germany’s Xetra Dax fell 2 per cent while the CAC 40 in Paris shed 2.3 per cent. The pain was also felt in the US, with the benchmark S&P 500 closing 0.4 per cent lower.Monday’s market moves came after Jake Sullivan, US national security adviser, said on Sunday that an attack by Russia against Ukraine could begin “any day now”, including “this coming week before the end of the Olympics”. Stocks whipsawed on various news reports related to the crisis. European equities had bounced off their lows after Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, told President Vladimir Putin in a televised meeting on Monday that diplomatic engagement with the west should continue.“There’s always a chance,” Lavrov said, when asked by Putin whether there was any likelihood that an agreement with the west could be reached in the flurry of negotiations between Moscow and western capitals aimed at defusing tensions on the border with Ukraine.US stocks lurched lower after Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukrainian president, warned that “the date of the military invasion is being set again”, before recovering some of their losses later in the afternoon. A Ukrainian official had subsequently sought to clarify the president’s comments.They had already been hit late last week after the White House issued its first warning of an “immediate threat” of invasion, with the S&P dropping almost 2 per cent on Friday.The pace of falls slowed on Tuesday in Asian trading, with Japan’s benchmark Topix index off just 0.3 per cent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng down 0.7 per cent. Futures markets tipped the FTSE 100 to open flat while the S&P 500 was expected to rise 0.2 per cent.Western nations are continuing to withdraw diplomatic and military personnel from Ukraine, and airlines have cancelled flights to the country.The tensions have exacerbated what was already a weak start to the year for stock markets driven by changing monetary policy.With global supply chains snarled up from Covid-19, all major commodity markets are in a “state of severe depletion”, said Jeff Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs. “Such depleted systems are highly vulnerable to even the smallest shocks, even [with just] a few days of disruption.”European natural gas contracts for next-month delivery jumped 7 per cent on Monday to €79.40 per megawatt hour. International oil benchmark Brent crude advanced more than 2 per cent to $96.48 a barrel, hitting its highest level in seven years.“If western claims of [a] Russian invasion of Ukraine turned out to be unsubstantiated [or] Russia withdrew its troops from its western borders, oil prices will come crashing,” said Tamas Varga at PVM Oil Associates, a broker. “For the time being all eyes are on Ukraine and on the $100-a-barrel level.”The situation between Russia and Ukraine did not push investors into haven securities, including sovereign debt. Germany’s benchmark 10-year Bund yield was flat for the day at 0.28 per cent. The equivalent 10-year US government bond yield rose 0.05 percentage points to 1.99 per cent.In Asia, Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng fell 1.4 per cent, while Japan’s Topix and South Korea’s Kospi both closed 1.6 per cent lower.Additional reporting by Tommy Stubbington and Hudson Lockett
357  The US damped hopes that Moscow wanted to find a diplomatic route out of the Ukraine crisis as officials warned that Russia’s military had in the past two days continued to ramp up plans for an invasion of its neighbour.Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, raised expectations on Monday that the stand-off might be resolved peacefully when he said Moscow was prepared to keep talking to the west about its security concerns and that there could still be a “way forward” in negotiations.But officials in Washington said Lavrov’s comments, which were made in a televised meeting with Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, were at odds with advancing military preparations for an assault.“We have taken note of his comments. What we have not taken note of is any indication of de-escalation. We have not seen any tangible, any real sign of de-escalation,” said Ned Price, US state department spokesperson, on Monday.“It remains unclear to us whether Russia is interested in pursuing a diplomatic path as opposed to the use of force,” Price added.The cautious tone on a possible diplomatic breakthrough came as Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, held talks with Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, in Kyiv, ahead of a visit to Moscow and a meeting with Putin on Tuesday.Zelensky shook markets temporarily after declaring that he had been warned that February 16 would be the date of Russia’s invasion, as he pronounced Wednesday a day of national unity in the face of the threat to the country.But Ukrainian officials clarified that the comment was intended as a sarcastic quip. Zelensky’s spokesperson, Serhiy Nykyforov, said the president was commenting on unsubstantiated reports in the news media and on social media suggesting the invasion could start on that date, not responding to direct warnings from world leaders.“Of course, this is irony, sarcasm,” added Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser in Zelensky’s office.The S&P and tech-heavy Nasdaq fell to session lows on Monday as investors ditched riskier assets for safe havens such as US government debt following Zelensky’s remarks, but those moves had largely reversed by the closing bell in New York.Meanwhile, the US continued to prepare for a possible invasion, saying it would temporarily shift its embassy in Ukraine from Kyiv to Lviv, in the west of the country, “due to the dramatic acceleration in the build-up of Russian forces”.John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, declined to comment on a CBS report that Russian units had moved to “attack positions” near the Ukrainian border but said Putin had continued to bolster “his readiness” over the past 24 to 48 hours and “could move with little to no warning”.“He is doing all the things you would expect him to do to make sure he’s ready for that option,” Kirby said. But he noted that Lavrov’s comments “seem to indicate that [Putin] still thinks there’s oxygen here for diplomacy” and the US would “welcome a pursuit of that path by the Russians”.Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, said late on Monday that Washington would boost its financial assistance to Ukraine by offering a “sovereign loan guarantee of up to $1bn”.Joe Biden, US president, held a call with Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, to discuss diplomatic efforts and an allied response to a possible invasion. Earlier in the day, Johnson had urged Putin to turn away from the “edge of the precipice” as he warned that the “evidence is pretty clear” that Moscow was planning an invasion of Ukraine. “There is still time for President Putin to step back,” Johnson added.US and Nato members have failed to reach a breakthrough with Russia after repeated exchanges over the future of Europe’s security architecture. Moscow has been urging the transatlantic alliance to drop its “open door” policy towards membership, particularly with regards to Ukraine, but the US and Nato have resisted that demand.While the US has described the threat of a Russian attack as “immediate”, Washington has not yet concluded that Putin has made a final decision to launch military action.“The path for diplomacy remains available if Russia chooses to engage constructively. However, we are clear-eyed about the prospect of that, given the steps Russia is taking on the ground in plain sight,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, deputy White House press secretary.
358  Russia has indicated that it is prepared to keep talking to the west about its security concerns, raising hopes it wants to de-escalate a crisis over Ukraine that has raised the prospect of a new war in Europe.During a one-on-one televised meeting with President Vladimir Putin, Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, said diplomatic engagement with the west should continue and that he could see a way to move forward with talks.Asked by Putin about the likelihood of a security agreement with the west over Ukraine and Nato, Lavrov said: “There’s always a chance.”John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said Lavrov’s comments “seem to indicate that [Putin] still thinks there’s oxygen here for diplomacy, we would welcome a pursuit of that path by the Russians”. But he said that Putin was continuing to “advance his readiness” and “could move with little to no warning.”Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor who is due to meet Putin for talks in Tuesday in Moscow, also stressed on Monday that Ukrainian membership of Nato was “not on the agenda” — a message that could be seen as an attempt to address Russia’s security concerns.“Alliance membership [for Ukraine] is practically not an issue,” Scholz said after talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv. “And that’s why it’s a bit bizarre that the Russian government is turning something that’s really not on the agenda into a big political problem.”Lavrov’s comments, in a carefully managed Kremlin setting, came after a number of western capitals warned that Russia could launch a full-blown invasion of Ukraine within days and urged their citizens to leave the country. Russia has denied it has any plans to invade.US secretary of state Antony Blinken on Monday said the operations of the US embassy in Kyiv would be temporarily shifted to the western Ukrainian city of Lviv “due to the dramatic acceleration in the build-up of Russian forces.”“My team and I constantly review the security situation to determine when prudence dictates a change in posture,” he said, adding: “The embassy will remain engaged with the Ukrainian government, coordinating diplomatic engagement in Ukraine. We are also continuing our intensive diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the crisis.”UK prime minister Boris Johnson urged Putin to step back from the “edge of the precipice” as he warned the “evidence is pretty clear” Moscow is planning an invasion of Ukraine. “There is still time for President Putin to step back,” he added.Lavrov said in the meeting with Putin that the US had put forward concrete proposals on reducing military risks, and urged the Russian president to continue talks. However, some key Russian demands remained unaddressed.Lavrov suggested that the diplomatic activity of the past months had produced some results for Russia. Moscow’s demands, first outlined in December, had succeeded in “shaking up” western governments, Lavrov said, creating “a willingness to enter into serious negotiations” and progress on issues that Russia had long sought to discuss.“So I think that we can now consider a way forward,” he said.Lavrov’s comments follow a weekend of intense diplomacy designed to de-escalate military tensions between Moscow and the west, including a call between Putin and US president Joe Biden and another on Saturday between Putin and French president Emmanuel Macron.During his trip to Kyiv, Scholz stressed the principle that every country was free to join whatever alliance it chose “is not up for discussion” and there “are no such things as spheres of interest in Europe”. “But we should look reality in the face,” he added.Scholz insisted that Germany stood “shoulder to shoulder” with Ukraine. He said Germany had decided to speed up the release of €150mn in loans to Kyiv along with a new credit worth another €150mn. Germany had given Ukraine more than $2bn in economic aid since 2014, he added.Lavrov said Russia had prepared a 10-page letter outlining its reaction to the US and Nato response to Russia’s security requests, first laid out in a letter in December.Russia’s demands include a rollback of Nato’s eastward expansion and a ban on Ukraine joining the military transatlantic alliance in future. It has massed about 130,000 troops on Ukraine’s eastern flank.Russia is holding joint military exercises in Belarus, and has held smaller drills on the border with Ukraine, raising fears that such actions were preparations for military action.Scholz said Russia’s military activities on the Ukrainian border were “incomprehensible to us”.“There are no sensible reasons for such a military build-up,” he said, adding that Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity were “non-negotiable” for Germany.But Zelensky acknowledged that the two had disagreed on some issues during their talks, in particular the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would increase the volume of Russian gas travelling directly to Germany via the Baltic Sea.“We see NS2 exclusively through the prism of energy and security risks for us and the region,” said Zelensky. “We clearly understand that this is a geopolitical weapon.”In London, Johnson said European countries needed to “get Nord Stream [2] out of the bloodstream.yank out that hypodermic drip feed of Russian hydrocarbons that is keeping so many European economies going.” He stressed a need to find “alternative sources of energy” to reduce European reliance on Russian gas, adding that the continent had to “get ready to impose some very, very severe economic consequences” on Moscow.
359  Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in the United Arab Emirates on Monday for his first official visit in nine years, building on a rapprochement between the two countries after a decade-long feud in the wake of the Arab uprising.Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the UAE’s de facto ruler, met Erdogan in the capital Abu Dhabi ahead of further talks in Dubai on Tuesday at the site of the Expo 2020 world fair, which aim to double bilateral trade flows.On the first day of the president’s visit, the two nations signed 13 co-operation agreements, official media reported. One of the deals was an intention to launch negotiations over a free trade agreement.Thani Al Zeyoudi, a UAE economy minister, told the Financial Times the target was for a bilateral comprehensive economic partnership agreement to be sealed within six months to a year, seeking to increase trade from $13.7bn last year to $30bn within five years. Even without such a deal, two-way trade is forecast to reach $20bn over the same timeframe.“We are very optimistic that the agreement will create a lot of added value for both sides,” the minister said. “Food, medical and industry is very strong over there — and we will capitalise on sectors such as logistics and technology.” The negotiations could be completed in six to 12 months, he added.Turkey and the UAE also signed another 12 co-operation agreements, spanning sectors such as agriculture, transport, healthcare and climate change. They agreed a protocol on media and communications, and determined to start defence co-operation talks.Sheikh Mohammed said the UAE was keen “to strengthen this partnership and push it forward during the coming period to double the volume of trade exchanges between the two nations”, according to the Emirati official news agency.Erdogan said the two countries would seek to develop trade and opportunities in “the complementary structures” of their economies.Relations between Turkey and the UAE deteriorated as they competed for influence across the region after the popular uprisings that rocked the Arab world in 2011. Their bitter rivalry reverberated from the oil-rich Gulf through the Horn of Africa to the conflict in Libya, where Abu Dhabi and Ankara backed opposing sides.But Erdogan’s visit this week consolidates a recent diplomatic thaw between the Middle Eastern powers. Sheikh Mohammed travelled to Ankara in November and pledged $10bn of Emirati investment, a welcome boost for the Turkish economy that has been plunged into turmoil amid soaring inflation.As the Gulf monarchy plots a path out of the pandemic, it has been refocusing on economic development through partnership agreements that aim to boost trade and investment. Turkey, which has fraught relations with western powers, has also been keen to ease tensions with its regional neighbours.The UAE has been conducting trade talks with a host of countries, including India, Israel and Indonesia. Free trade talks with the UK have been conducted under the umbrella of the six-member Gulf Co-operation Council. Bilateral negotiations have also recently opened with the Philippines and Georgia.The UAE is expected to sign a trade pact with India later this week, while deals Israel and Indonesia could follow before the end of March.Additional reporting by Laura Pitel in AnkaraLetter in response to this article:Turkey and UAE enjoy a ‘guns and butter’ moment /  From Ambassador Anil Trigunayat, Former Indian Ambassador to Jordan (2014-16) and Libya (2012-14), New Delhi, India
360  Two Greeks have been shot dead and another two seriously wounded by Ukrainian soldiers during an incident in the east of the country, as Athens joined a number of other western nations in urging its nationals to leave Ukraine.In a statement, the Greek foreign ministry said three Ukrainian soldiers were “responsible” for the deaths and injuries of the four Greeks. The incident occurred after midnight early on Monday at a café in the village of Hranitne, in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region.Hranitne is on the front line of the conflict in Donbas, where Ukraine’s army has been battling Russian-led separatists since 2014. The conflict, which erupted shortly after Moscow occupied Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula, has claimed the lives of some 14,000 combatants and civilians.A Greek foreign ministry official said those killed in the incident were Greek expatriates and added that the incident appeared to be unrelated to the ongoing conflict.“According to the available evidence, the perpetrators of the double homicide are three soldiers of the Ukrainian army, who got into a fight with the diaspora Greeks over a trivial matter,” said the statement of the Greek foreign ministry.A Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesperson confirmed to the Financial Times that the victims were members of Ukraine’s ethnic Greek community living in the southern part of Donbas, near Mariupol, a strategic port. Local police said those responsible had been detained.The police statement did not clearly identify the shooters as soldiers but said special army investigators and prosecutors were investigating the incident.Nikos Dendias, the Greek foreign minister, requested a telephone call with his Ukrainian counterpart to stress the need to protect the Greek community in Ukraine, which comprises about 120,000 people.Earlier on Monday, Greece issued an advisory urging its nationals to avoid travelling to Ukraine and calling on any Greek visitors to leave “immediately”.A number of western nations have warned their citizens to leave Ukraine, with intelligence reports that Moscow could be ready to launch an attack within days.
361  Evgeni Utkin welcomes me to his basement cultural centre in central Kyiv, opposite the fortified embassy of Belarus, Ukraine’s neighbour where tens of thousands of Russian troops have recently been deployed. He is wearing an ochre yellow hoodie that matches the striking modern art on the walls. Utkin doesn’t just laud the vibrancy of the Ukrainian capital, he radiates it, even in today’s gloom.Utkin is a celebrated entrepreneur, the godfather of Russia’s tech sector following the chaotic transition from communism in the 1990s. While still an active tech investor, he is also a philanthropist and a big figure in Kyiv’s art and music scene. Although Russian-born and Russian-speaking, he is a strong supporter of Ukraine’s western orientation and was an activist in the 2014 Maidan revolution against Russian meddling.This rich life story is not just a testament to how Russia and Ukraine’s destinies are intertwined, but an expression of faith in Ukraine’s future. “I am Russian with a Russian soul,” Utkin says. “But my heart is here in Kyiv.” Like Utkin, many other native-Russian speakers now feel a strong sense of Ukrainian identity, although some also feel they are discriminated against.Utkin was born in Soviet Russia, just across the border from the Luhansk region of Ukraine, now controlled by pro-Russian separatists with the full support of Moscow.He studied electronic engineering in Moscow and built a successful IT services company that he then sold to Sistema, the Russian conglomerate. He floated Sistema’s technology division on the London Stock Exchange in 2007, making it the most valuable tech company in eastern Europe. After leaving Sistema, he became a serial entrepreneur and investor in Russia and Ukraine.Utkin, who had supported the 2004 Orange revolution when Ukrainians demanded a rerun of the presidential election that had been fraudulently won by a pro-Kremlin president, said he decided to leave Russia after its invasion of Georgia in 2008.He joined the 2014 Maidan protests in Kyiv, playing the piano on the street amid the tumult. After Moscow annexed Crimea and instigated a separatist war in the Donbas, Utkin set up a tech cluster to support Ukraine’s armed forces. His prominent role cost him his Russian businesses, which were expropriated. But his mother and sister still live in Russia, as do many of his friends.Like many in Kyiv, Utkin struggles to believe that Moscow could launch a full-blown offensive against Ukraine. But he does think Russian president Vladimir Putin is on a mission to recreate an empire. “The Russian empire cannot exist without Kyiv. It used to be the mother of Russian cities. It is so important for the Russian people.”Moscow also cannot afford Ukraine to succeed economically or politically, Utkin says, because it would show Russians an alternative to authoritarianism is possible. “I think they are afraid about the success of Ukraine because it could change the parameters of values. It would put people at the top of the pyramid, not a tsar or a general secretary.”Utkin was inspired by people power in the Maidan protests, when as many as 1mn Ukrainians demonstrated against Viktor Yanukovych, the country’s pro-Russian president. Moscow has depicted the Maidan movement as a fascist-led coup. Utkin believes Ukrainians are less deferential to authority than Russians. He recalls that, when managing businesses in Russia, his employees would “treat me like a tsar and put the responsibility on me”. But in modern Ukraine, “nobody expects anything good from the top”.Even if there is no large-scale invasion, Russia’s military build-up is already hurting Ukraine’s economy, frightening off foreign investors and visitors. The Dutch airline KLM this week stopped flights to Ukraine. Foreign investments in three of Utkin’s companies, including Ukraine’s leading cloud computing provider, had stalled simply because of warnings of war, he said. It would only add to the brain drain of Ukrainian talent.Russia’s military build-up along the borders is all about undermining confidence in Ukraine’s potential, he believes. “The main war is here,” he says, tapping his head. “It is propaganda.”
362  Many people hope for a quiet, settling-in period when they start a big new job. That privilege has not been granted to Olaf Scholz. The German chancellor was sworn into office on December 8 and now finds himself in the midst of the biggest European security crisis in decades.On Tuesday, Scholz will face his biggest challenge yet — when he meets Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin. With the US warning that Russia could invade Ukraine at any moment, the stakes could not be higher.Throughout this crisis, Russia has attempted to sow division within the western alliance and has seen Germany as a possible weak link. So Scholz should go into the Putin meeting with some clear goals and messages. He needs to stress the unity of the Nato alliance and to underscore that Russia will be hit with severe economic sanctions — if it attacks Ukraine. Western unity and firmness remain the best way to deter Russian aggression.There are some specifically German issues that Scholz has to deal with. The fate of the unopened Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline that runs from Russia to Germany, bypassing Ukraine, has become a test of western and German resolve. Scholz has equivocated in public about Nord Stream-2 and has refused to say that a Russian attack on Ukraine will doom the project.It would be best if the German chancellor now said openly that Nord Stream-2 will close the day that war begins. Scholz may be unwilling to say this publicly, for fear of leaving the German government open to a costly lawsuit. If so, the message to Putin should be delivered firmly, but privately. Nord Stream-2 is a highly symbolic project and any equivocation will be dangerously open to misinterpretation by Moscow.More broadly, the entire crisis has made it clear that Germany needs to rethink its relationship with Russia. As a new chancellor, facing a new set of circumstances, Scholz has an opportunity for a reset.The German leader has four main priorities when it comes to Russia: energy, deterrence, strategy and public education.On energy, it is now clearer than ever that decades of ill-thought out policy have left Germany dangerously dependent on Russian gas. In an ideal world, Germany would reverse its ban on nuclear energy. Even if that is politically impossible for now, Germany needs to make urgent efforts to diversify its sources of energy supply and to accelerate the move to renewables.As a country that is strongly committed to both the EU and Nato, Germany is critical to the western alliance. Scholz has to show that legitimate efforts to build up the EU’s diplomatic and military capabilities will not come at the expense of close ties to the US. Any hint of an effort to ease the US out of Europe will split the EU — as well as the broader western alliance. It would also encourage Russian aggression.The German chancellor should also be more willing to speak openly about the importance of deterrence. German public opinion has a strong pacifist streak. But, now more than ever, peace in Europe requires a willingness to invest in military strength and alliance unity.That points to the biggest long-term challenge facing Germany’s new chancellor — public education. However the crisis in Ukraine plays out, it has already underlined that Russia is now a dangerous neighbour. Commerce and cultural exchange are not enough to handle the challenge from Moscow. This is an uncomfortable message for the German public. But it is one that Scholz will have to explain.
363  The cost of cover is being driven up because of rising claims, combined with falling capacity. Some insurance companies have decided to stop writing cyber insurance altogether.Their caution is understandable. The threats have been rammed home by their own vulnerability. Last year US-based CNA and Paris’s Axa were targeted. Ransomware attacks occurred every 11 seconds in 2021, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. Their ubiquity is linked to the emergence of ransomware-as-a-service. Criminals with little technical knowhow can locate ransomware programs on the dark web and lease them for as little as $40 a month. They can then extort large sums, using cryptocurrency to help evade detection.Many insurers have too little data to be confident in their pricing. They are particularly uneasy about the liabilities accumulated when an attack snowballs to affect huge numbers of businesses at once. The resulting claims can break the mutualisation principle at the heart of the insurance model. Not everyone is pulling back. In mid-2021, London-based insurance provider CFC launched a new insurance syndicate that will focus on cyber and other emerging risks. Last week, Beazley, also based in London, said it was excited about the opportunities. It put its ability to swim against the tide down to expertise and ability to help clients improve their resilience.Working with clients to improve controls is crucial but may not be enough to prevent a deluge of claims. Advances in quantum computing that allow hordes of stolen encrypted data to be unlocked is just one nightmarish scenario. Ultimately, some kind of public-private partnership might be needed to provide a backstop. In the meantime, businesses should expect insurance, if they can get it, to be increasingly costly.

364  Fifteen-year-old Kamila Valieva marked her Olympic debut last week by becoming the first female figure skater to land a hugely demanding quadruple jump as the Russian and her compatriots leapt into first place in the team event.Two days later Valieva was told that she had tested positive for a banned drug, thrusting the young star into the centre of an international dispute that has disrupted two medal events and refocused scrutiny on the International Olympic Committee’s relations with Russia — already under a national ban for state-sponsored doping.The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled on Monday that Valieva could compete in this week’s individual skating event while appealing her positive drugs test. The decision sparked anger from athletes’ groups and western competitors who placed the blame on the ineffectiveness of the IOC’s sanctions against Russia.“It is blatantly clear that Valieva would have never been placed in this position if the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) had done their jobs and banned Russia from global sport,” said Global Athlete, an advocacy group that aims to address power imbalances between sports administrators and competitors.“Russia has never been incentivised to reform because sport leaders favoured politics over principle and rebranding over banning,” the group added.Western Olympic officials, including from the US, Germany and Canada, expressed regret at the CAS decision, with US Olympic and Paralympic Committee chief executive Sarah Hirshland calling the Valieva case “another chapter in the systemic and pervasive disregard for clean sport by Russia”.Russia has been officially banned from international sporting events since December 2017 as punishment for its state-sponsored doping programme at the 2014 Winter Olympics held in Sochi.The ban, which is set to expire at the end of the year after the CAS approved an appeal to halve its duration, restricts Russia from sporting its own flag or playing its national anthem at the Olympics, but has not prevented hundreds of its athletes, including Valieva, from competing under the Russian Olympic Committee banner.Thomas Weikert, president of Germany’s Olympic federation, said on Monday that it was “clear that allowing the ban against Russian sports to expire at the end of 2022 does not take sufficient account of the differences between the individual sports”. He continued: “A case-by-case approach to each sport might be more appropriate in terms of a consistent anti-doping fight.” The IOC has faced persistent criticism over its handling of Russian doping, including this week in Beijing after Valieva’s positive test came to light.Asked if the IOC was “tough enough with Russia in the first place” and whether its athletes should even be in Beijing, spokesperson Mark Adams said the Olympic body had taken “tough action but appropriate action” in its sanctions.“We don’t have mass justice against groups of people; we take out individuals who are proven guilty,” he said. “The central principle of the IOC is that we have to be politically neutral, that we don’t bow to either side.”In the case of Valieva, her positive test for the banned heart medicine trimetazidine came at the Russian national figure skating championships in December and was therefore under the jurisdiction of Russian anti-doping authorities, known as Rusada, rather than the IOC.Olympic officials were disappointed with the CAS ruling, according to a person familiar with the matter. In a gesture of its frustration, the IOC took the unusual step of preemptively cancelling the medal ceremony for the women’s figure skating competition, which begins on Tuesday, in the event that Valieva finished in the top three.In strained language, the IOC said it had to “follow the rule of law and will therefore have to allow her to compete”.Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, said on Monday that he hoped the IOC would eventually award Russia’s figure skaters the gold they won in the team event, adding that “the whole country wants Kamila to win the Olympics”.Amid the furore, Valieva has continued to train in Beijing. Due to her age, she is considered a “protected person” by international anti-doping rules. Both Rusada and Wada have said they would investigate Valieva’s support staff to the extent they may be responsible for the doping matter.Valieva is the brightest talent to emerge from the stable of young figure skaters trained by Eteri Tutberidze, a renowned but controversial coach. She trained the women’s gold and silver medallists at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics four years ago, both of whom have since disappeared from the top ranks.All of the female Russian figure skating competitors in Beijing are Tutberidze protégés, under the age of 18 and trained to complete demanding quadruple jumps that critics say may be pushing the sport too far.The banned substance trimetazidine improves blood flow in the body and can be used by athletes to train harder.“There is the fundamental question of what kind of competitive sports we actually want,” said Weikert. “Young athletes must be given time. A humane competitive sport must not demand too much too early.”Tara Lipinski, who won the figure skating gold for the US at the 1998 Olympics at the age of 15, wrote on Twitter that regardless of Valieva’s age, she should not be allowed to compete in Beijing. “I believe this will leave a permanent scar on our sport,” she said.Additional reporting by Max Seddon in Moscow
365  Trade isn’t exactly top of everyone’s mind at the moment, let’s be honest, what with the warnings of an imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine and all. As a reminder, here are my thoughts from a couple of weeks ago on how EU trade policy inadvertently contributed to that unfortunate situation. It’s worth remembering that for all the talk of Ukraine joining Nato, its decisive move into the EU sphere of economic and trade influence is clearly also a big factor in Russian president Vladimir Putin’s thinking. On a barely cheerier note, today’s main piece is about the attempts to restrict the sales of goods made with forced labour, and what role border measures might play. Charted waters is about the rise in the costs of shipping furniture, and how some companies are now bringing its production closer to home.You’d think that stopping products made with forced labour being sold in your market was a) a bit of a no-brainer and b) something any ambitious policymaker would elbow others aside to take credit for.But this is trade, in fact it’s the EU and trade, so it’s not that simple. Just as last week’s European Chips Act on semiconductor subsidies had European commissioners squabbling with days to go before launch, the task of who deals with forced labour is being punted from one part of the Brussels machine to another.This might seem odd, given how much it goes on about transmitting European values such as labour standards in its trade policy, but the EU is actually lagging behind a bit on this issue. The US has had a ban on imports made with forced labour since 1930 and toughened it considerably last year to restrict imports from Xinjiang, with Canada also passing legislation. You might expect the cuddly employee-friendly Europeans to be keener than the free-market Americans, but then you’ve underestimated the superior firepower of US labour unions on the trade policy process. There’s also some resistance from corporate Europe to import bans, which I’ll go into later.We wrote about this in Trade Secrets last year, since when there have been some developments. But the central dilemma remains. The debate is about whether blocking the sale of forced-labour goods in the EU is better done with an import ban or a “due diligence” initiative that makes companies legally responsible for broader environmental and human rights abuses in their supply chains. (You can also do this via the “trade and sustainable development” chapters of preferential trade agreements, which are currently being reviewed, but that’s not a very powerful tool, not least because the EU has already signed PTAs with most of the large economies which are likely to sign one in the foreseeable future.)Forced labour has now been taken up as a personal initiative of European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, as emphasised in her State of the Union speech last year. But von der Leyen being enthusiastic about something trade-related is not always a good sign, as her support for utterly futile trade talks with India suggests. And it’s not an issue that the commission’s directorates are exactly fighting each other to own.In an act of turf-vacating rarely seen in Brussels, the commission trade directorate and its commissioner say this is best dealt with not as a border measure but as part of the “due diligence” legislation as mentioned above. Sabine Weyand, head of the EU’s directorate, recently told the European Parliament (really worth a watch if you’re trying to get your head round the issue), that the US has encountered problems with imposing broad blocks on imports, including setting up new companies to circumvent restrictions. The US system involves shifting the burden of proof on to companies to show they aren’t made with forced labour and risks cutting off developing regions from trade altogether.An EU import measure would also run the risk of breaking WTO law if Brussels imposes a forced labour ban at the border but not inside its Single Market. (Rather embarrassingly the International Labour Organization estimates there are about 1mn forced-labour workers in the EU itself, out of a global total of 25mn.)What of the domestic lobbying pressures in the EU, especially given the change of government in Germany? Last year Trade Secrets wondered whether big companies were likely to oppose a far-reaching due diligence law. In fact, they’ve now got one in Germany they can evidently live with, not least because it doesn’t go very deep into the tiers of suppliers in the value chain. (There are a lot of stages in the supply chain between cotton picked by Uyghurs in Xinjiang and shirts turning up in EU clothing stores.)It’s the import ban the companies don’t like. Roland Busch, chief executive of Siemens, tried the environmentalist argument to make a blanket case against border measures, telling the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper in December that export bans would mean no more solar cells from China and the energy transition coming to an end. Late last year, Herbert Diess, the Volkswagen chief, also weighed in on the inadvisability of decoupling from China, though he did not repeat his extraordinary claim from 2019 that he was unaware of the existence of re-education camps in Xinjiang.Working out which way the EU is going to jump is one for the specialist Brussels bubble-watchers, one of the very best of whom is sadly just departing. I’d emphasise, though, that forced labour is a big deal and some very clever technocrats are working hard on it, but no one knows yet how to fix it. In other words, it’s trade. In fact, it’s the EU and trade, so it’s not that simple. I’ll keep watching.Furniture prices have been rising, as sofas, tables and chairs have become casualties of the global shipping and supply chain crisis. This is due largely to their size, with container costs rising by as much as 1,200 per cent since the start of the pandemic.European and US retailers have long imported these kinds of items from China, with furniture imports from China to the UK growing from $50mn in 1993 to $4.3bn in 2020, according to UN trade data.However, the recent rise in transport costs has prompted some European and US retailers to move manufacturing operations to domestic factories, or those nearer home. A number of European retailers have relocated production to countries such as Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, which also benefit from lower labour costs and access to raw materials such as wood.The Joe Biden administration has announced a rather vague Indo-Pacific strategy of which the trade part is supposed to compensate for the US abandoning the Trans-Pacific Partnership it came up with in the first place. Few think it will.The UK foreign secretary Liz Truss is preparing another capitulation to the EU over the Northern Ireland Protocol, in what is now a venerated British tradition of talking tough to Brussels before meekly knuckling under.A very detailed long read on the UK’s attempts to build the lucrative battery stage of the electric vehicle supply chain at home.China purchased literally none of the $200bn additional exports from the US it agreed to buy in a deal with former president Donald Trump in January 2020, a pact that the Biden administration has nonetheless quixotically decided to pursue.China is escalating the trade coercion of Lithuania by putting blocks on beef exports from the Baltic country. Financial Times journalists go into depth on the issue here.
366  Good morning on this rather gloomy Valentine’s Day.There is very little love lost between Russian president Vladimir Putin and his western counterparts, as the FT writes today. Given the apparent intransigence of the Russian leader, there is a sinking feeling in the west that all diplomatic efforts to resolve the Ukraine crisis may prove to be for naught — including an effort by the German chancellor who travels to Ukraine today before meeting Putin at the Kremlin tomorrow.EU leaders and Nato defence ministers are in Brussels later this week, and I’ll run you the choreography of meetings and what to expect in the event that the US intelligence turns out to be accurate and Russia does attack Ukraine in the coming days.In the EU, the European Court of Justice is set to rule on Wednesday on the legality of new rules allowing Brussels to withhold funds when there are rule of law breaches. A few hours later the European parliament is expected to pile pressure on the European Commission to start using this mechanism against Poland and Hungary. (The FT wrote here about Poland’s latest olive branch.)As for the EU’s defence ambitions, beyond the immediate crisis with Russia, we’ll explore a new idea set to be put forward by the commission, which involves creating a satellite system that could serve both for civilian and military use (courtesy of the French commissioner, Thierry Breton).EU preparations for the economic and social impact of a Russian attack on Ukraine are running at full speed. As part of that work, the bloc is examining the potential countermeasures Moscow could take if western sanctions are imposed. (On sanctions, the US and the EU are “nearly there” in readying a joint package, as the FT wrote on Friday.)If an attack on Ukraine occurs, both the contingency measures and the actual sanctions package would likely require a green light from EU leaders, who just happen to be meeting in Brussels on Thursday and Friday for a long-planned summit with the African Union.As of late last night, no emergency summit had been scheduled yet, several diplomats told Europe Express, but such a meeting could be called at short notice if needed. European Council chief Charles Michel spoke to several central and eastern European and Nordic leaders about the Ukrainian situation yesterday, with the Lithuanian president tweeting that he is ready to discuss the issue at the summit later this week.On the other side of town, at Nato, defence ministers are gathering on Wednesday and Thursday — so Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg could also easily join EU leaders for an emergency meeting, if need be.Planning for potential waves of refugees is already under way in EU countries bordering Ukraine (including Poland and Romania) and most western European nations have advised their nationals to leave Ukraine immediately.As for economic contingencies, the biggest concern is the potential disruption of gas supplies from Russia (about 40 per cent of Europe’s gas imports come from Russia). Talks to secure alternative gas supplies are continuing.But some worries also exist for the airline industry. One question is whether Russia would be tempted to ban European companies from flying through its airspace if it is hit by a massive wave of US and EU sanctions.Finnair told Europe Express that the shortcut between Asia and Europe (over Russia) “is important for many reasons” and expressed confidence that the company would be able to retain overflight rights. “Geopolitical tensions have caused speculation also before, but we have continued to operate our traffic,” the Finnish airline said.Russia is one of Europe’s main suppliers of critical raw materials, such as palladium, which is needed in the catalytic converters used in vehicles to limit harmful emissions, and titanium, which is crucial for the aerospace industry. (More here)The EU is struggling to forge a joint defence force on earth. That has not stopped the European Commission attempting to build one in space, writes Andy Bounds in Brussels.The Defence and Space package should be endorsed by the college of commissioners tomorrow as part of planning for the “strategic compass” which will map out how the EU can bring its 27 members’ armed forces closer together.It suggests increasing the role of the European Defence Fund, worth €8bn over seven years, and levering in money for the military from Horizon Europe, the €95.5bn, multiyear science research programme.The space ideas are the boldest yet, as Breton sees a chance to put rocket boosters on the European space industry — fuelled with taxpayers’ cash.The EU already has Galileo, a global positioning system, and Copernicus, which is used for earth observation. Breton wants to build a third satellite system in lower orbit for secured communications and access to the internet.The signal would be encrypted and offered to Europe and Africa to give that continent an alternative to Chinese-built cable infrastructure. “If satellites are closer to earth and with improved technology this can be competitive to terrestrial broadband,” said an official working on the programme.It would also provide a back-up if excessive demand or a cyber attack disrupted the internet. Breton believes the EU has played too nice with powers such as Russia, China and the US and needs independent space defence capabilities. “Space at European level is only civilian,” the official added. “This time we will dare to say it also has a defence dimension.”The paper will not state how much this new satellite constellation might cost, though it will be a public-private partnership and some seed money is likely to come from the EU budgetand later this week
367  In a not-so-distant future, France is an industrial powerhouse to rival Germany, with thriving manufacturers, robust growth rates and a narrow deficit. For the moment, however, that is fiction — an economic recovery imagined by best-selling French author Michel Houellebecq in his new novel Anéantir for the end of the second term of an unnamed president with an uncanny resemblance to the real one, Emmanuel Macron.If he is to have any chance of turning fantasy into a reality, Macron will have to win re-election in April and finish the work he has started to overhaul France’s economy.As he gears up to declare his candidacy, the 44-year-old president together with his finance minister Bruno Le Maire — the finance minister in Houellebecq’s book is also called Bruno — have been trumpeting new factory openings and investment pledges as proof that the “re-industrialisation” of France is under way and that the business-friendly reforms his government has enacted since 2017 have begun to bear fruit.“It is a work of fiction, of course,” says Le Maire, who was shadowed for a year by his friend Houellebecq as he researched the novel, “but we are certainly working to ensure that the scenario he describes turns into reality.”In January, Le Maire took the message to Dieppe in northern France, where he toured a Renault factory, which manufactures its high-end Alpine sports car brand, with the group’s chief executive Luca de Meo. The plant was threatened with closure a few years ago, but has been given a new lease of life with a deal to manufacture an electric version of the Alpine as part of Renault-Nissan’s €23bn global electric push. “We can again become one of the great industrial powers of the world,” Le Maire told workers.Some smaller businesses are also heeding the government’s call to think local and invest in French industry rather than looking to Asia for industrial imports. In Orléans, south of Paris, break-resistant glassware-maker Duralex has teetered on the brink of failure over the past 20 years under a series of different owners. Yet the company has so far proved as indestructible as its distinctively shaped glassware, familiar to generations of schoolchildren.Last year, the factory and its 250 employees were rescued by France’s International Cookware, owner of the Pyrex brand, which acquired the group with a promise to invest €17mn over three years and double Duralex sales after years of under-investment. Project manager Eric Denis says the new owner saw value in the employees’ manufacturing knowhow and in the plant’s local supply chains, with the sand for the glass and most other inputs coming from less than 200km away. “We’re proud to produce in France,” he adds.While Macron’s rivals have focused on crime and what they say is uncontrolled immigration, as well as on recent rises in the cost of living, his allies believe his economic record is one of the strongest cards he has to play as he seeks re-election.Macron’s reforms — begun before the eruption in 2018 of anti-government “gilets jaunes” protests and largely enacted before the Covid-19 pandemic — have made it easier to hire and fire workers, have cut taxes on capital and income for both corporations and households, and trimmed unemployment benefits.France has already enjoyed a remarkable post-pandemic comeback, with gross domestic product reaching pre-crisis levels last autumn — quicker than elsewhere in Europe. In a strategy Macron dubbed “whatever it costs”, the government spent heavily during the crisis to help businesses stay afloat and keep employees in their jobs, and then rolled out an EU-backed €100bn recovery plan to turbocharge activity in sectors from construction to cars.Unemployment, perennially higher than in the US, the UK or Germany, is also back where it was before coronavirus at less than 8 per cent of the workforce, the lowest level in more than a decade. The government says 1mn private sector jobs have been created since 2017.“The strategic choices we have made to transform the French economy are the right ones, and at the end of our term, you can see the results,” Le Maire says. On the pandemic, he adds: “Everyone criticised the state before the crisis but was very happy to see it swing into action during the crisis.” Supporters argue that a second term for Macron, the frontrunner in the election race, would open the way for France to shed its reputation for industrial sclerosis and hostility to free markets. And even perhaps boost growth to levels enjoyed in Germany and other northern European neighbours.The president’s political opponents are naturally more sceptical. On the left, Macron will probably lose votes from former supporters who now dismiss him as an arrogant “president of the rich”, notorious for abolishing the wealth tax in 2018.The conservative candidate Valérie Pécresse — who is given a chance by opinion polls of becoming France’s first woman president — says Macron has “ruined” the country and “raided the till” for emergency pandemic spending that is burdening France with mountains of public debt which came close to 116 per cent of GDP in 2021.With a large bureaucracy and generous social security benefits, France’s government spending — at over 55 per cent of GDP — remains higher than in any industrialised country other than Austria.Ordinary voters, furthermore, do not feel as if they have grown richer under Macron — whose first round poll ratings remain stubbornly around 25 per cent — despite government data showing that consumer purchasing power grew 8 per cent during his tenure, faster than under any of his recent predecessors.“Many French are still poor, especially workers in some sectors like retail, cleaning, restaurants or agriculture,” says Patrick Artus, chief economist at Natixis. Rising energy and fuel prices are also hurting consumers, despite the government spending more than €15bn to soften the blow of recent price spikes.Agathe Lyon, a 34-year-old mother of two in Calais, recently started shopping at discounter Lidl instead of the nearby Intermarché hypermarket to save money. “Biscuits for the kids, cheese for my husband, toothpaste — it’s all cheaper here,” she says, adding that higher petrol bills for her car are a particular worry.Le Maire says that one reason the government reacted “so strongly” on energy prices was to protect people such as Lyon and ensure that its economic record was not “eclipsed by an external shock”. Macron’s rivals for the presidency slammed the spending as a gambit to boost his re-election bid.Macron’s bet is that a French industrial revival — although it will take years to bear fruit — will boost long-term prosperity by creating more skilled jobs and will also reduce Europe’s dependence on foreign suppliers, a vulnerability cruelly exposed by shortages of masks and other medical supplies at the start of the pandemic.During the 2017 election campaign, Macron promised a “Marshall Plan for the re-industrialisation of areas where the economy has collapsed”. Last week he returned to the industrial north to announce support for former mining communities hit by high unemployment and poverty — including the opening of a “gigafactory” for electric batteries from a French start-up called Verkor that is set to create up to 1,200 jobs.Le Maire calls the process of “industrial reconquest” a political as well as an economic necessity to keep workers out of the clutches of extremists — the two far-right candidates have a combined 30 per cent support in the polls — and to avoid the kind of popular, post-industrial anger that helped power the rise of Donald Trump in the US and Brexit in the UK.“When a factory closes, you see the opening of an office of the Rassemblement National because people feel neglected, despised,” says Le Maire, referring to the far-right party of Marine Le Pen, who came second to Macron in 2017, and who the polls show to be one of his main rivals again.Macron and Le Maire have already announced multibillion-euro plans for green hydrogen production and other projects and boasted of a rise in foreign industrial investment into France.“The government made a lot of progress in improving the rules to make things more favourable for industrial investment,” says Mark Costa, chief executive of Eastman, which plans to spend as much as $1bn in France on what would be the US group’s biggest polyester recycling operation.Le Maire has repeatedly boasted that France began creating industrial jobs for the first time in 30 years in the period between 2017 and 2019, before the pandemic dented output. His ambitious goal is to increase the French manufacturing industry’s share of GDP from 10.5 per cent today to 15 per cent and ultimately 20 per cent.Some economists question how realistic that is given that industry’s contribution to the French economy halved between 1970 and 2020. France’s trade deficit in goods rose by a third to a record €84.7bn in 2021 as manufacturers lost market share in exports, creating what even Le Maire has admitted was “a black mark” over the economy that showed the need to boost industry as quickly as possible.“There are some foreign companies that are coming in, of course,” says Natixis’s Artus. “But we continue to lose industrial jobs and the trade deficit is still deteriorating.There has been absolutely no re-industrialisation of France. It’s pure propaganda.” Le Maire likens the economic reforms introduced since 2017 to an unfinished multistorey edifice that began on the ground floor with cutting taxes on capital — including the abandonment of the wealth tax — and reducing corporate tax by eight percentage points to 25 per cent.The next stage was the all-encompassing “Loi Pacte” — a package of initiatives designed to deregulate the private sector, especially small and medium-sized companies where France lags badly behind its neighbours in Germany and northern Italy. The government has also relaxed labour market rules to encourage businesses to hire new staff.“On the right we championed these kinds of measures for years without putting them into practice,” says Franck Riester, a former politician in the conservative Les Républicains who is now a minister in the Macron government responsible for foreign trade and inward investment. “But he’s actually done it.”Investors report a big change in the official attitude towards business and say the government seems to want to help the country’s entrepreneurs. From a low base in 2017, France now counts more than 25 tech start-ups each with a market value of more than $1bn among its ranks, including Ledger, a crypto wallet maker, Doctolib, an online medical appointment app and Exotec, which develops robots for warehouses.“The atmosphere for start-ups is like night and day since Macron came in,” says the chief executive of one French industrial company who is supporting his re-election campaign. Another company boss, in consumer goods, adds: “I think he’s really changed things. He’s given a sense of regulatory stability, and simplified the rules.” The results of such reforms, some of them begun under Macron’s predecessors, were starting to show in France before the pandemic, in the form of falling unemployment. And after Covid-19 struck, Macron convinced former German chancellor Angela Merkel and other European leaders of the need for a €750bn EU pandemic recovery plan, financed by common EU debt, that has also boosted European economies.The government knows much more needs to be done to reform the French economy and close the gap with Germany’s industrial performance. The next target — the top floor of Le Maire’s reform structure — is full employment, which means a profound modernisation of the education system, more investment in training, and increased labour mobility.Pension reform — raising the retirement age from 62 to at least 64 — is one big unfinished item on Macron’s agenda. The pandemic killed off his ambitious attempt to merge 42 separate pension schemes into a single, fairer system, but even before Covid it had been stalled by disruptive protests from workers in the most generous schemes. He is expected to try again with a less ambitious and as yet undefined plan for pension reform if re-elected. Pécresse has also vowed a reform that would eventually extend the retirement age to 65.Other structural problems persist. The Macron government has stripped €10bn out of the €70bn of “production taxes” that hit companies hardest, especially small manufacturers. These taxes, levied on land, turnover or staff regardless of profit, make up a quarter of the French state’s tax revenues from business and are higher than in any major EU economy except Sweden. Most of Macron’s presidential rivals also support cutting these taxes further.But financing further tax cuts will not be easy. Le Maire concedes that restoring order to the public finances must be the government’s main priority alongside industrialisation if Macron is re-elected, while the surge in energy prices this winter is a painful reminder of how easily the best laid plans can be knocked off course.At the Duralex factory in Orléans, Denis says spikes in the price of the gas needed to fuel the plant’s glassmaking oven have forced it to cut production rather than increase it as planned and to rely on stockpiles to maintain sales. “We’ve frozen certain investments,” he says. “It’s extremely worrying.” A broader concern is whether the rush of pandemic spending on high-profile projects might go to waste, especially if France and its European neighbours fail in their multibillion-euro efforts to produce electric vehicles and the batteries to power them at low enough prices to compete against Asian and American manufacturers.Eric Trappier, head of the metals industry employers’ federation and chief executive of aircraft maker Dassault Aviation, says the pandemic has galvanised attempts to re-industrialise in France and reduce dependence on imports, but warns that continued progress is not guaranteed.“We must recognise that there has been lots of government aid that helps this recovery,” he says, “How do we ensure that French industry continues to recover and does not start declining again?”Data and visual journalism by Eir Nolsoe
368  A comically large table separated Vladimir Putin and Emmanuel Macron after the French president flew to Moscow last week for crisis talks aimed at averting a war in Ukraine.The official explanation for the yawning distance was that Macron declined to take a Russian-administered coronavirus test, but the image underscored the gulf between Putin and the west as Moscow continues to build up troop deployments on the Ukraine border.Macron’s advisers and officials were struck at how Putin had changed in recent years, saying he had become preoccupied by the loss of Russian influence since the Soviet Union collapsed and the need to be tougher with the US and Nato, even if that meant cosying up to China.“Putin has got much harder even in private since 2014,” one French official said. “He’s obsessed by re-examining what happened in the past 30 years. This is a Putin who no longer believes in the west.He wants to be feared by the west.”Weeks of intense diplomatic effort to convince Putin to de-escalate appear not to have changed the Russian leader’s thinking.A senior US official admitted that a call between President Joe Biden and Putin on Saturday brought “no fundamental change in the dynamic” that has been unfolding since Russia began building up its troops at the Ukrainian border last year, adding Moscow “may decide to pursue military action anyway”, even as diplomacy continued.But the frenetic atmosphere around the deployments and the increasingly frequent airing of security grievances with the west may have already brought significant dividends for Putin, according to two people close to the Kremlin.Biden in his call “did not put his emphasis” on possible US sanctions that could follow if Ukraine was attacked, said Yuri Ushakov, Putin’s foreign policy adviser. Instead, according to his account, Biden came up with “a whole number of ideas that he thinks take many of Russia’s concerns into account”.Macron said before heading to Moscow for more than five hours of talks that it was “legitimate for Russia to raise the issue of its own security concerns”. He also claimed Putin had signalled a willingness to de-escalate even as troop movements suggested otherwise.“They [the west] have read the signals.Putin has showed you can use this situation to get the results we want,” said a senior Kremlin official, adding to the idea that Moscow’s strategy was paying off. “They need to start thinking about our demands more, and they are.”People close to the Kremlin say Putin’s increasingly hardline stance is partly owing to the extensive efforts he takes to avoid falling sick with Covid-19.Putin makes most of his Russian visitors self-isolate for two weeks before meeting him, according to people familiar with the Kremlin’s quarantine protocols. Foreign dignitaries such as John Kerry, US climate envoy, have travelled to Moscow just to speak to him on the phone.Since the pandemic began, Putin has only made a handful of foreign trips, holds most of his cabinet meetings via video, and has sharply cut the number of events he attends.The public appearances he does make are often notable by the absence of other people. Last month he attended an Orthodox Christmas service in a chapel empty except for the priests and a cameraman.The restrictions have made Putin, 69, increasingly reliant on a small group of security advisers, said a former senior Kremlin official. “His circle of contacts is getting smaller. It affects his mind,” the former official said. “He used to see things in 360 degrees — now it’s more like 60.”Many of his key advisers — such as security council secretary Nikolai Patrushev, foreign intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin and Alexander Bortnikov, head of the FSB, Russia’s main security service — share Putin’s background in the KGB and a deep-rooted scepticism of the west that borders on the conspiratorial.The comparatively liberal economic officials in Putin’s cabinet and administration, meanwhile, are increasingly loath to challenge him, the former official said. “If you value your place you won’t argue with him. The Kremlin has become a besieged fortress,” he said.In a sign of his narrowing worldview, Putin’s public comments and conversations with western leaders have become increasingly preoccupied with a litany of grievances against the US and Nato dating back decades.The anti-Nato rhetoric increased following Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014 and its subsequent annexation, and has been prolonged by the slow-burning proxy war in the eastern Donbas border region.Yet the current crisis over Ukraine is the first time that Moscow has felt the west is listening to its demands, the people close to the Kremlin said.“This antagonism might be bad in the long term, but it’s good for us in the short term,” the Kremlin official said. “They [the west] may not start off by saying yes, 100 per cent, but this is a longer process.”Macron and his advisers hope there is a chance that Putin will avoid war if he is given a face-saving exit so that he can declare success and also back down.“He remains in a state of mind that is simultaneously pushy and provocative through these military exercises, while nevertheless taking care to keep all options open for dialogue,” said another senior official after Macron and Putin spoke for nearly two hours on Saturday.But Putin’s ultimate plans remain a mystery to all but his closest advisers. “It’s just four guys at the end of the day,” said a western diplomat in Moscow, referring to Putin and his inner circle. “They have some tea, go over some papers, and decide everything. He’s not someone who enjoys a lot of company.”

370  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
371  Europe’s largest telecoms providers have called on EU lawmakers to compel Big Tech groups to contribute more to the cost of expanding internet infrastructure, as streaming and other entertainment services take up an ever-increasing share of bandwidth.The chief executives of Deutsche Telekom, Orange, Telefónica and Vodafone accused video streaming, gaming and social media groups of piggybacking on billions of euros of investment in internet infrastructure, saying that the “burden must be shared in a more proportionate way”, in an open letter published in the Financial Times.“We now urgently call upon legislators to introduce rules at EU level to make this principle a reality,” said the letter, which was signed by José María Álvarez-Pallete, chair and chief executive of Telefónica; Tim Höttges, chief executive of Deutsche Telekom; Nick Read, Vodafone chief executive; and Stéphane Richard, outgoing chair and chief executive of Orange.Most telecoms groups are investing heavily to expand or upgrade services from copper to fibre and on 5G deployment, but have for years struggled with weak margins and falling valuations.Although carriers have made similar requests to European lawmakers in the past, the companies said they were encouraged by a European Commission proposal that “all market actors benefiting from the digital transformation. make a fair and proportionate contribution to the costs of public goods, services and infrastructures”, made in a declaration on digital rights last month.“I suspect we’ll see more positioning like this, particularly during the French presidency of the Council of the EU given they have been fairly critical of Big Tech in the past,” said Matthew Howett, an analyst at Assembly Research.In their letter, the chiefs note that video streaming, gaming and social media from just a handful of digital platforms accounts for more than 70 per cent of all traffic on networks.Their plea echoes a recent spat in South Korea over who should contribute to maintenance costs incurred by broadband providers — a move that was sparked by the surge in online traffic from the successful Netflix series Squid Game. Such was the popularity of the dystopian show that South Korea’s SK Broadband, owned by the country’s largest mobile carrier SK Telecom, last year sued Netflix to cover the cost of the surge in traffic, saying that it had been forced to upgrade its network.The quartet warned that their sector’s retail markets “are in perpetual decline in terms of profitability”, and cautioned that “network operators are in no position to negotiate fair terms with these giant platforms due to their strong market positions, asymmetric bargaining power and the lack of a level regulatory playing field”.“Consequently, we cannot make a viable return on our very significant investments, putting further infrastructure development at risk,” they said. “If we don’t fix this unbalanced situation Europe will fall behind other world regions, ultimately degrading the quality of experience for all consumers.”Video streaming companies have countered that they should not be singled out to pay more for a network, citing the concept of ‘net neutrality’ — the idea that network providers should not be allowed to discriminate or charge companies differently based on use or content.They also argue that they invest heavily in their own servers to ensure they can get content to consumers without clogging up the network.Although Deutsche Telekom’s share price has risen 12 per cent over the past five years, Orange’s has slipped 25 per cent, Telefónica’s is down more than 50 per cent and Vodafone’s is down nearly 30 per cent.
372  Spain’s hard-right Vox party has marked up big gains in a vote that could serve as a template for general elections next year, as the group planned to enter a regional government for the first time.The hardline party, which says it wants to “repopulate Spain with Spaniards” instead of immigrants, more than tripled its share of the vote to 18 per cent in polls for the Castile-León region, with more than 99 per cent of ballots counted.The centre-right People’s party, which has ruled Castile-León for 35 years, called the elections a year ahead of schedule in the hope of securing an outright victory, but will instead depend on Vox to form a government.In a triumphant speech, Vox leader Santiago Abascal made clear his party would demand a place in a PP-led coalition in Castile-León — a move that suggests that any future PP-led national administration may also need to include Vox ministers to attain a majority. Until now, Vox has supported PP-led regional administrations from outside the government.“Vox has the right and duty to [help] form a government in Castile-León,” Abascal said.Pablo Casado, the PP’s leader who has sought to emphasise his distance from Vox, had been desperate to avoid such an outcome. Alfonso Fernández Mañueco, PP leader in Castile-León, said he would begin discussions with all the region’s political groupings for support in forming an administration. But, apart from the Socialists, Vox’s 13 deputies are the only grouping big enough to provide the PP with a majority.“If the PP forms a regional coalition with Vox, it is going to be very difficult for Casado not to include them in a national government,” said José Ignacio Torreblanca at the European Council on Foreign Relations. But he added that while the PP’s bet on early elections had failed, Vox’s advance had helped the right as a whole to outpace the left in the Castile-León election.With Spain’s next general election due by the end of 2023, the PP had sought to use the Castile-León race to regain political momentum after months of debilitating internal feuds.But although it won 31 seats in the 81-member regional assembly — two more than in the last vote in 2019 — it fell far short of the absolute majority it had hoped for at the onset of the campaign. The party’s 31 per cent of the vote was unchanged over the two contests.Castile-León is Spain’s biggest region, occupying an area larger than Belgium and the Netherlands combined, although it is thinly populated, with just 2.4mn inhabitants.Pollsters said the PP had been badly hit during the campaign when one of the party’s national MPs accidentally backed a crucial government initiative on labour reform, which only passed thanks to his vote.Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez’s Socialists, which had come first in the previous Castile-León poll but failed to form a regional coalition, lost seven seats in the assembly, pushed into second place by the PP.Confirmation a trend over the past three years in which Vox has gained ground at the same time that the country’s liberal party has almost disappeared from contention, the centrist Ciudadanos party, which previously formed a regional coalition with the PP, lost more than two-thirds of its vote and all but one of its 12 deputies.Ciudadanos said the election had brought about a “very dangerous situation” because of Vox’s plans to enter the regional government. The Socialists said the PP had “opened the door to Vox”. Pablo Iglesias, the former leader of the radical-left Podemos grouping, wrote on Twitter: “This is Weimar.”Various formations that represent sparsely populated local areas also markedly increased their support but did not make enough headway to hold the balance of power in the region’s assembly.
373  Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, is preparing to launch a fresh attempt to deter Vladimir Putin from further invading Ukraine, as US officials warned that Russia was on the brink of launching an attack on its western neighbour.His actions came as western nations continued to withdraw diplomatic and military personnel from Ukraine and airlines cancelled flights to the country. Some European countries are preparing to receive a flood of refugees in the event of military action.Scholz will travel to Kyiv on Monday before arriving in Moscow on Tuesday. The German leader is expected to urge Putin to de-escalate the situation on the Ukraine border, a senior government official said. He will also convey “how grave the consequences of an attack would be” in terms of sanctions on Russia, and stress “that one should not underestimate the unity of the EU, US and UK”.Scholz’s aides said he had not given up hope that diplomacy could avert a war, although they played down expectations of a breakthrough. “I don’t assume that we’ll come out of this with some kind of concrete result,” said the official. But they insisted that “now is not the time for resignation”. The big goal for Scholz was to “get a better understanding of Russia’s goals, and to try to figure out if there are any ways back to direct dialogue”.Joe Biden spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday, with the White House saying the US president had made clear Washington would respond to Russian military action “swiftly and aggressively”.“The two leaders agreed on the importance of continuing to pursue diplomacy and deterrence in response to Russia’s military build-up on Ukraine’s borders,” US officials said in a statement. Zelensky said they discussed “security, economy, existing risks, sanctions and Russian aggression”.The Ukrainian president asked Biden on the call to visit Kyiv soon in a show of solidarity. “I am convinced that your arrival in Kyiv in the coming days, which are crucial for stabilising the situation, will be a powerful signal and contribute to de-escalation,” Zelensky said.Biden spoke to Putin for more than an hour on Saturday, but failed to change the Kremlin’s position, the White House said. US intelligence assessments estimate that Russia could launch a full-scale invasion in the coming days. Though the White House believes Putin has not made a final decision on whether to invade, Russia has built up more than 130,000 troops along its border with Ukraine and in neighbouring Belarus, as well as weaponry that could be used for an assault on Kyiv.Jake Sullivan, US national security adviser, told CNN on Sunday that an invasion could begin “any day now”, including” this coming week before the end of the Olympics”.He added: “Russia could choose the diplomatic path. But the way they have built up their forces, the way they have manoeuvred things in place, makes it a distinct possibility that there will be major military action very soon.”According to the senior German official, the talks with Putin were designed to explore the opportunities for “direct dialogue” between Russia and the west and seek progress on implementing the Minsk agreement, which is aimed at resolving the conflict in the east Ukraine regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, parts of which are controlled by Russia-backed separatists.Given Russia’s failure to respond to requests to explain its military build-up, Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter on Sunday evening that Kyiv would request a meeting with Moscow and other signatories to the Vienna Document — a European security agreement — within 48 hours.Earlier in the day, the UK and the US said they were withdrawing their citizens from the monitoring mission of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova called on the OSCE to avoid being “manipulated” and “dragged into sordid political games”.Flight mapping software appeared to show several airlines, including British Airways, avoiding Ukrainian airspace. BA declined to comment.Germany’s Lufthansa said it was considering a “suspension of air traffic”. Dutch airline KLM said it was cancelling Ukraine flights and would avoid the country’s airspace. Low-cost carrier Wizz Air said that it was monitoring the situation. Ryanair, which also operates flights to Ukraine, declined to comment.Israel said its national carrier El Al would schedule additional flights to bring home its 15,000 citizens in Ukraine.Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser at Zelensky’s office, told the Financial Times that the airlines’ actions were “nonsense” and “resembles a kind of partial blockade”.Ukraine’s government on Sunday evening approved a “guarantee” fund of $600mn to maintain air service to and from the country, after foreign insurers stopped covering flights, citing security risks.Countries neighbouring Ukraine have been preparing to receive refugees in the event of a full-scale Russian invasion. The European Commission has said it was working on the issue of potential refugee flows. Washington has predicted up to 5mn people could cross Ukraine’s western border.Additional reporting by Sebastian Payne in London, Andy Bounds in Brussels and Mehul Srivastava in Tel Aviv
374  While many western leaders stayed away from last week’s opening of the Beijing Winter Olympics, China’s president Xi Jinping still managed to attract a star guest: Russia’s Vladimir Putin. After talks and dinner, a more than 5,000-word joint statement by the two leaders denounced American interference in their affairs and opposed further enlargement of Nato — Russia’s number one bugbear with the west.The meeting showed how the growing threat of war over Ukraine is accelerating a major realignment in geopolitics, pushing Moscow and Beijing into a closer embrace. Russia will look to China to alleviate the impact of western sanctions that might follow an assault on Ukraine. China will now demand Russian support for its own regional ambitions over Taiwan and elsewhere.One crucial glue in the relationship is hydrocarbons. Russia has abundant oil, gas and coal, and — for now at least — some military technologies that China lacks. Beijing has capital, machinery and other sorts of technology that Moscow needs.Beijing still buys only a fraction of the Russian gas that Europe does. But the fact that pipelines now exist, after mutual suspicion for years blocked progress on such links, is symbolic of how broader ties have solidified. It is hardly coincidental that a 30-year, $400bn gas supply agreement, paving the way to construct the Power of Siberia gas pipeline between the two countries, was signed just weeks after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea provoked a rift with the west.The deepening partnership since then reflects a convergence of interests between Beijing and Moscow. Both are authoritarian states that chafe at a “unipolar” US-dominated world and western efforts to spread liberal democracy. Both believe America is intent on undermining them: Moscow sees Washington’s hand in Ukraine’s pro-western revolution in 2014, and Beijing accuses “foreign forces” of orchestrating Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests in 2019. Both crave a global order that better reflects their own interests.Both, too, are more boldly pushing back against US influence. China has long opposed expansion of military alliances. But Xi’s joint statement with Putin that the two countries “oppose further enlargement of Nato” was more specific than China’s leadership has been before. Showing unusual assertiveness on an issue beyond China’s vicinity, it also said Beijing was “sympathetic to and supports” Russia’s proposals for legally-binding security guarantees in Europe.Yet here the friendship bumps up against its constraints. Though Russia reaffirmed its stance that Taiwan is part of China, the statement made no direct mention of Ukraine. Beijing, which has long made respect for territorial integrity a foreign policy principle and has pursued trade and political links with Ukraine, may have little interest in a Russian military invasion that would provoke a global crisis and galvanise Nato and the US. The current stand-off, by contrast, arguably suits China well by tying Russia and the west up in protracted diplomatic wrangling.Moreover, while they are now clearly geopolitical partners, the likelihood of China and Russia becoming full military allies — and concluding a mutual defence pact — remains slim. The two still vie for influence in former Soviet central Asia. Beijing maintains an obsessive secrecy around its own security interests. Moscow is wary of being a distinctly junior partner to a country with a population and an economy 10 times the size of its own. The Sino-Russian rapprochement is far-reaching, and one to which the rest of the world should pay close attention. But it is not, despite both countries’ recent assertion, “without limits”.
375  I came across someone out of his mind with anger on the streets of Berlin last week. A tall, agitated man was hurling his bike around and screaming into the night air. The theme of his discourse seemed to be that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is the only trustworthy world leader and that the Americans are once again trying to trick Germany into a war.It is tempting — but too sanguine — to dismiss scenes like that as meaningless. For the Ukraine crisis is taking place in a period when conspiracy theories are rife across the western world. The leaders who are struggling to frame an effective and united response to Russia know that public opinion is critical. For every bike-throwing lunatic, there are many more citizens who are quietly mistrustful of their governments.Public opinion in the west has rarely shown lower levels of trust in political leaders. The annual Edelman Trust Barometer reported in January a “collapse of trust in developed democracies” — with only 46 per cent of Germans, 44 per cent of Britons and 43 per cent of Americans trusting their governments.The struggle over Ukraine is unfolding while the streets of Ottawa, Canada’s capital, are choked with anti-vaxxers — with copycat demonstrations taking place in Paris and planned for other western capitals. In the US, President Joe Biden still has to contend with conspiracy theories about his son’s past business dealings with Ukraine. In Britain, Boris Johnson, the prime minister has dabbled in conspiracy theories himself.The question of trust is now central to the international struggle over Ukraine. The Russian government is expert at “hybrid warfare” — where information and opinion are all part of the battle. Putin is a former spy.Western governments are acutely aware that they have been wrongfooted by Russian information warfare in the past, not least during the 2016 US presidential election. That is partly why the White House is now giving intelligence briefings not just to the president — but to the world at large.Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, took to the White House podium on Friday to tell the world about the Russian troop build-up in Ukraine — and to warn of a possible impending invasion. The goal was not simply to give Americans time to get out of Ukraine. It was an effort by the US to gain control of the narrative, before Russia does.But any US effort to use intelligence to shape world opinion has to contend with the shadow of the Iraq war. America’s successful effort to build a “coalition of the willing” in 2003 was based on the publication of intelligence claims that Saddam Hussein was in possession of “weapons of mass destruction”. The failure to find any WMD dealt American credibility a blow from which it has never fully recovered.However, there is an important difference between the kind of intelligence used in Ukraine and Iraq. The existence of WMD was always disputed. The fact that 130,000 Russian troops are currently massing on Ukraine’s borders is not — not even by Moscow.The propaganda war is currently being waged around the question of intent. Russia denies that it is poised to invade and has accused the west of deliberately hyping the threat. The Russian line is that their troops will only move if they are provoked by Ukraine. The west’s frequent suggestions that Russia is planning a “false flag” operation, to manufacture just such a provocation, is crucial to this battle of narratives.It might be complacently assumed by some western governments that winning a propaganda war with the Kremlin should not be hard. After all, how much credibility can Putin have — after first denying sending “little green men” to annex Crimea in 2014 and then later admitting it? Or after sending assassins to kill a former Russian agent in Salisbury in England; and then putting the assassins on television to claim that they had visited the city twice — but only because they wanted to see its famous cathedral? However success for the Russians does not require convincing western voters that the Kremlin is telling the truth. It can be almost as helpful to suggest that the White House is also lying.Unlike Iraq in 2003, western governments seem largely in agreement over what is happening on the ground in Ukraine. France and Germany opposed the Iraq war. Their leaders even shared a platform with Putin, to express that opposition. This time around, the major governments are united in their opposition to Russia’s threats. The differences that exist between Washington, Berlin, Paris and London are mainly about diplomatic strategy.But western public opinion remains a weak link. Recent polls suggest that 26 per cent of Americans agree that “Joe Biden is a puppet president” controlled by a Deep State; while 31 per cent of Americans, 28 per cent of French people and 23 per cent of Germans think it is definitely or probably true that there is a “single group of people who secretly control events.and run the world together”.That kind of extreme, irrational scepticism is a weak base on which to build a consensus for a western policy response that is likely to be expensive and dangerous. Unfortunately Putin has plenty to work with, as he tries to exploit the weaknesses of the west.
376  Regulators in Brussels have halted an antitrust probe into QatarEnergy, according to two people briefed on the matter, three years after the European Commission opened an investigation into the company’s 20-year gas contracts.The decision comes amid concerns that gas supplies from Russia to Europe could be disrupted if the Kremlin decides to invade Ukraine. Talk of a Russian attack has increased scrutiny on Europe’s energy security and its dependence on Russia, which supplies about 40 per cent of the continent’s gas.The people said the move was not connected to the tensions. One person briefed on the discussions said the EU first considered dismissing the case last year as “the EU and the UK realised that they were facing energy poverty” when a gas shortage sent prices rocketing. This was prior to the Russian crisis.The US has in recent weeks asked Qatar, the world’s largest exporter of LNG, if it would be able to help fill any shortfall if supplies to Europe are disrupted. Qatar is one of the few gas producers that has the capacity to help if supplies are disrupted. But it would need the consent of its Asian clients, the biggest buyers of Qatari LNG, to divert gas to Europe.In 2018, the commission opened an investigation to investigate whether supply agreements between Qatar Petroleum — now QatarEnergy — and European importers “have hindered the free flow of gas within the European Economic Area, in breach of EU antitrust rules”.Since then, Brussels has engaged in “extensive fact-finding” to find out if certain clauses contained in those deals may prevent or limit the resale of LNG within the internal market, in breach of EU law, said a spokesperson for the commission.The probe into its contracts had frustrated QatarEnergy, which prefers long-term fixed contracts, and caused it to delay projects in France and Belgium.Late last year when a global shortage of gas sent prices soaring, Saad al-Kaabi, Qatar’s energy minister, told the Financial Times that Europe needed to “give a clear signal” about whether “they want more investment in gas and additional supply from Qatar or not”.The minister, who had a virtual meeting with the EU’s energy commissioner this month, said the case had “no basis”. “We have mixed signals from Europe,” he added. “We need to understand if we are welcome in Europe, or not welcome.”Asked about a Reuters report that the probe had been dropped, an official at the commission said: “The in-depth investigation is ongoing. We cannot prejudge its timing or outcome.”
377  Viktor Zhora proudly showed off the new facilities at one of Ukraine’s cyber security agencies, where opposing teams stage mock battles to prepare for the real thing.The training is paying off, said Zhora, deputy chair of the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection, the country’s security and intelligence service. An attack last month that targeted government websites was quickly contained by his staff with the help of IT companies including Microsoft, he said.“We need to align our activities with risk and threats that have been increasing in past years.We should always be ready for the worst.” Zhora said.Ukraine said “all evidence” pointed to Russian responsibility, with officials and analysts saying this was just the tip of the iceberg.The country has been under constant attack from Russian and Kremlin-backed hackers since Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea. Cyber espionage, damage to databases and servers, disruption to power and communications and disinformation are all part of the playbook.With Russia massing more than 100,000 troops on the Ukraine border and western powers accusing Moscow of planning a full-blown invasion, the Kyiv government and independent experts expect hostile cyber activity to increase in an effort to destabilise the country before or during any attack.“We register more and more attacks on our system and we see some are successful, unfortunately”, said Zhora, a former private-sector cyber security executive. “Something more serious can be expected for us, but we don’t know when.”Andrei Soldatov, a Russian security expert and senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said Russian hackers were “getting ever more skilful”.“They’ve had eight years of experience since 2014, and Ukraine is often where they try out things first,” he said.Russian cyber attackers accessed Ukraine’s vote-counting system on the eve of general elections in 2014, destroying electronic records and leaving ballots to be counted by hand. The following year, a cyber attack caused blackouts lasting several hours in western Ukraine and part of Kyiv. The disruption, attributed to a group linked with Russian military intelligence, was the first known power outage caused by a cyber attack.The NotPetya malware attack by the same group in 2017 infected 10 per cent of all Ukrainian computer systems before spreading across the globe. It was one of the most destructive cyber attacks in history, costing companies worldwide $10bn, according to a US estimate.Last week, Microsoft said a group it called Actinium, which the Ukrainian government has linked to Russia’s security services, had targeted Ukrainian government and military offices with the “purpose of intelligence collection” since October 2021.“There are bound to have been many many, more attacks over the years that we don’t know about and that have left malware embedded in systems ready to be activated,” said V S Subrahmanian, professor of computer science at Northwestern University in the US. “It’s a bit like a bomb being planted in your house — it’s benign until someone sets it off.”Russia has fewer financial resources to invest in cyber capabilities than the US or China. But evidence suggests it boosts its capacity by using proxy groups such as Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear that it can deny knowledge of, said Subrahmanian. They carry out attacks without big consequences for the Russian state but are believed by western officials and cyber experts to act for Moscow, Subrahmanian said.Ukraine, meanwhile, suffers from a deficit of public-sector cyber security expertise, weak regulation, limited response capability and a lack of co-ordination between various agencies, all of which Kyiv is trying to fix, say officials.A particular vulnerability is the prevalence of older, unlicensed software that gives hackers a lot of holes to access. Zhora acknowledged the situation was “rather dangerous” but said the problem was no longer as bad as in the mid-2000s.A priority for his agency was raising awareness among operators of critical infrastructure and connecting them to cyber information centres, so that attacks could be quickly analysed and countered, he said.Subrahmanian said there were “always vulnerabilities in every system and attackers always have the advantage,” adding that the Ukrainian efforts to patch the holes, “doesn’t mean they’ve managed to find them all”.The US has sent experts and funds to shore up Ukrainian cyber defences, but the administration sees it as a long-term effort. “Significant achievements don’t happen in weeks so we’re realistic,” Anne Neuberger, deputy US national security adviser for cyber, said on a recent visit to Europe.It is unclear how far Russia would go in using cyber attacks against Ukraine’s military. Greg Austin, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, pointed out that Russia had never deployed a military-level cyber attack to disable an enemy’s command and control systems — as Israel did in 2007.In Operation Orchard, the Israelis disabled Syria’s air defence systems and fed it false radar information, allowing its fighter jets to bomb their Syrian targets and return to base undetected. “An attack on a military system is very different from an attack on civilian infrastructure,” said Austin. He continued: “Past evidence supports the idea that Russia will not launch a wide-ranging cyber sabotage attack on Ukraine as part of any invasion.Fear of retaliation is likely one reason.”Indeed US president Joe Biden last month warned of consequences for Russia over cyber attacks, saying that “if they continue to use cyber efforts, well, we can respond the same way.”
378  European printing companies have warned that industries such as food and consumer goods could suffer significant disruption to their supply chains because of a growing shortage of paper.Strikes by thousands of workers at mills owned by forestry group UPM-Kymmene in Finland have exacerbated paper shortages that started with an unexpectedly strong rebound in demand after lockdowns eased.“You’ve got paper prices spiking and everyone chasing too few tonnes,” said Iwan Le Moine, director of EMGE, a consultancy. “It’s an absolute mess.”Finat, which represents more than 1,000 European label producers, has warned of supply disruptions because of shortages in specialised paper types.Jules Lejeune, managing director of Finat, said: “I’m receiving daily calls and emails from members expressing extreme concern as they have to put people on hold as they cannot produce. Labels are used in all sectors — food, beverage, pharmaceutical, health, personal care, automotive, electronics. What is of most concern is the [consumer goods] side.”Publishers, newspaper groups and other businesses are already feeling the effect of paper shortages and a quadrupling of some prices in the second half of last year. Asset manager Abrdn was recently forced to delay a vote on a £1.5bn deal, after it struggled to produce the printed documents it is required to send out to shareholders.UPM supplies Europe with about 40 per cent of the backing sheets for labels, according to Cees Schouten, chief operating officer of Geostick. The Dutch group’s monthly production of labels is likely to fall from 2.5mn to 1.5mn square metres in March.“We must decide where to prioritise delivery of labels. It could cause disruption for the food, logistics and fast-moving consumer goods industries,” he said.Francesc Egea, director-general of Spain’s IPE Industria Gráfica, said that fresh food was particularly at risk of not making it to the shelves without labels.Consumer goods and logistics companies pointed to alternatives such as temporarily switching to plastic and printing directly on packaging but these might not be achieved easily with other supply chains stretched.The UPM strikes, which began on January 1 and have been extended to March 12, relate to the company’s plans to make division-by-division deals with unions instead of a company-wide arrangement. A planned strike by workers at Finnish ports from Monday could make matters worse.UPM declined to comment.The high paper prices and shortages are a stark reversal for an industry that has suffered from oversupply due to falling demand since the 2000s with ever-advancing digitalisation.One industry executive said they were turning down a “surge” of new buyers looking for alternative supplies. “Can we increase production? The answer is simply no. Everyone in the industry is running flat out,” he said.Paper companies have been shutting down or converting mills to supply the packaging industry that has benefited from the boom in ecommerce and shift away from plastics.Tony Smurfit, chief executive of Smurfit Kappa, Europe’s largest cardboard box maker, said on Wednesday that further price rises would follow a 20 per cent annual increase.“We’ve been sold out through the last six months of last year. I would suspect without something popping out of the woodwork we will be in a sold out position this year. We’re adding capacity but it’s already being eaten up,” he said.Jesper Jungersen, managing director of Aller Tryk, the largest publisher of weekly magazines in the Nordic region, said it has cut production 10 per cent because of paper shortages — with potentially lasting effects on demand.“We fear that people will go digital — it’s not caused by the fact that prices are going up but the fact we cannot get enough paper,” he said.Harry Dempsey, Hannah Kuchler, Jyoti Mann and Adrienne Klasa
379  French presidential contender Valérie Pécresse has said people will have to work harder and the government spend less if she wins the April election and deprives Emmanuel Macron of a second term.Pécresse, candidate of the conservative Les Républicains party, said in an interview that if she won she would impose stricter controls on immigration and immediately enact reforms to the economy, including to France’s costly pensions system. She also sharply criticised “French-bashing” by Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister.Pécresse’s manifesto includes a pledge to start extending the retirement age from 62 to 65, and to cut the 5.6m strong civil service by losing a net 150,000 jobs in a public sector she called “bureaucratic and tentacular”. “People are going to have to work more, and we’re going to have to spend less — and spend better,” said Pécresse, who has described herself as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher. “I am the only one who perhaps has the courage to say it — and I do say it.”Macron spearheaded his own reforms to liberalise the economy and help reduce high unemployment after he was elected in 2017. But the following year the president’s reformist drive was interrupted by anti-government gilets jaunes protests and then in 2020 by the Covid-19 pandemic. He has yet to declare his candidacy but remains a favourite in opinion polls, which currently suggest that he would attract about 25 per cent of the vote in the first round on April 10 and defeat any contender in a run-off on April 24.Behind him, three rivals are vying for the other place in the final round of voting: Pécresse, Marine Le Pen of the far-right Rassemblement National party, and Eric Zemmour, another far-right contender who rose to prominence for his diatribes against Muslim immigration and appearances on television talk shows.A budget minister under Nicolas Sarkozy when he was president, Pécresse has tacked to the right as immigration and crime rose near the top of the agenda in the campaign, while support for leftwing and green candidates has been dwindling.“We must bring back popular sovereignty,” said Pécresse. The 54-year-old chair of the Ile-de-France region, which oversees investments in education and transport in Paris and its suburbs, lamented what she portrayed as overly liberal government and judicial authorities. She promised a referendum on immigration policies, the introduction of quotas on migrants allowed to enter France and a crackdown on crime.But she said she would not back a policy of zero migration and had a more optimistic vision for France than some of her rivals such as Zemmour, who has depicted a country in steep cultural and economic decline. “I don’t consider that everything is complete disaster. I leave that discourse to others. But it’s time for a jolt,” Pécresse said.She said limits on migrants and a tougher stance on asylum seekers would also help lower the state’s welfare bill — part of a broader plan to find savings that would direct more money to health, education and crime. That would help chip away at France’s debt, which has reached 114 per cent of gross domestic product and is nearly double the EU’s pre-pandemic limit of 60 per cent.Pécresse is the first woman to lead the LR — a party descended from the movement of Charles de Gaulle, Jacques Chirac and Sarkozy — and would become France’s first woman president if elected.Although her market-friendly, supply-side policies are not dissimilar to those of Macron, she was critical of his record as president. He had “fractured” and “divided” France, had not been a team player and had scorned members of parliament and other elected officials, she said.Pécresse accused him of “raiding the till” with pandemic relief and with pre-election spending to curry favour with voters hit by high energy prices. She said he had “zigzagged” on policy, for example by ordering the premature closure of nuclear power stations to meet environmentalists’ demands before reversing course on Thursday and announcing at least six new reactors.Turning to the EU, Pécresse said she herself was treading a “third way” as both a French patriot and a European, while she depicted Macron as a federalist and Le Pen as a nationalist.On the UK after Brexit, Pécresse accused Johnson of frequent “French-bashing” and petty provocations over everything from fishing rights to cross-Channel migrants. He did this, she said, for domestic political reasons — “to try to unite the British people behind him” — despite the risk of damaging ties with one of his country’s most important allies.Asked if Macron had a difficult relationship with Johnson, Pécresse, who speaks English (she also speaks Russian) and describes herself as an Anglophile, responded: “Isn’t it rather Boris Johnson who has a very difficult relationship with France?“What I don’t understand is why Boris Johnson takes the risk of sacrificing a long-term relationship between Great Britain and France that is extremely rich and extremely deep.”
380  When Emmanuel Macron was poised to launch his bid for the French presidency back in 2016, it was in Orleans and with the help of its medieval heroine Joan of Arc that he cannily made what we now recognise as an early campaign speech.Like an arrow finding its mark, Joan had overthrown the old system, fought injustice and the English, and brought together a “France that was torn apart, cut in two and shaken by an endless war”, the future president said at the annual festival for the teenage saint.At the time, Macron was still finance minister in the Socialist government, but the unifying, patriotic and above all victorious campaign of the Maid of Orleans to raise the English siege was irresistible for a politician who wanted to be “neither right nor left” and to shatter the old politics of France.“It was an important symbolic gesture,” says Valérie Toureille, biographer of Joan.Ahead of the presidential election in April, Macron, who is set to seek re-election, and his political rivals are once more criss-crossing the country to court voters in the “real France” of villages, towns and industrial estates outside the Paris ring road.Orleans is again a good place to start to understand the concerns of contemporary France. Once a great city dominating the River Loire, Orleans is neither north nor south, neither exceptionally poor nor unusually prosperous.Serge Grouard, mayor for 15 of the past 20 years, is scathing about Macron’s record in office. A member of the conservative Les Républicains party that has picked Valérie Pécresse to beat Macron and become the first woman head of state, Grouard accuses the president of dashing the hopes of the French that he would transform and modernise the country.“He was like a surfer on a huge, magnificent wave — and he helped to make this wave — but he fell in the middle of it,” says Grouard. France, adds the mayor, remains “a little Soviet Union” throttled by regulation and hurt by immigration.The streets of Orleans show that these problems used by the right and far right to cudgel Macron, the liberal internationalist, are not entirely imaginary: homeless people live on the pavement, African migrants whose asylum applications have been rejected say they have no intention of leaving, and the needy queue for food at the local Restos du Coeur (“canteens of the heart” established in the 1980s by the comedian Coluche). Joan of Arc’s very Frenchness is one reason why nationalist politicians on the French right continue to lay claim to her image 600 years after she was burnt at the stake for turning the tide against the English in the Hundred Years War.When Pécresse wanted to present herself in a primary contest as a future commander-in-chief she tweeted: “Joan of Arc represents for me the image of France that stands tall, that resists the invader.We are not condemned to decline and chaos. #Elysée 2022”.Eric Zemmour, the anti-immigration television polemicist who emerged from rightwing talk shows to mount his own bid for the presidency, declared himself a candidate in a video of nostalgic longing for France’s past, for “the land of Joan of Arc and of Louis XIV, the land of Bonaparte and General de Gaulle, the land of knights and noblewomen”. Curiously, the original French far-right party of Jean-Marie Le Pen, now run as the Rassemblement National by his less antagonistic daughter Marine, has slightly cooled its ardour for St Joan since the days when Le Pen père gathered thousands for an annual homage at her gilded equestrian statue in Paris.But she still has something for every politician — whether royalists or supporters of the republican left who rehabilitated her in the 19th century as a “daughter of the people,” persecuted in her short lifetime by the Catholic church.Toureille says Joan was adopted not just by the French but also by American feminists, British suffragettes and now by LGBTQ activists because she wore men’s armour and challenged gender stereotypes.In France, her star shows no sign of waning. Joan of Arc’s feats in the Middle Ages crystallised the idea of the French nation and “in the political campaign, history comes back into all the debates”, says Toureille. “She’s still a very strong political symbol today.”
381  The head of Ireland’s central bank has said investors are wrong to bet on eurozone interest rates rising in June, predicting policymakers will be careful to avoid “killing off the recovery”.Gabriel Makhlouf told the Financial Times that “the path to normalisation” of eurozone monetary policy had become clearer, after inflation hit a record high in the bloc while unemployment dropped to an all-time low.The European Central Bank could stop its net bond purchases in June or a few months later, and would only raise rates after that, said Makhlouf, who is a member of the Frankfurt-based bank’s governing council.“The idea that we could hike interest rates in June looks very unrealistic to me,” said Makhlouf. “I certainly think there’s a bit of difference between the calendar we’re working to and the one some market participants may have in mind.”“I’m reasonably confident net asset purchases will end this year,” he added, referring to the ECB’s bond-buying programme, which has hoovered up €4.8tn of assets since it started in 2015. “The question is what is the pace at which my foot sits on the accelerator, and am I talking about June or am I talking about the third quarter.”The Irish central bank governor is widely seen as a moderate between the “hawks” pushing for a rapid end to bond purchases and negative interest rates and the “doves” arguing in favour of continued stimulus.His comments, in an interview with the Financial Times last week, are the latest indication that most ECB rate-setters want to avoid rushing to exit its ultra-loose monetary policy. Christine Lagarde, the bank’s president, last week played down the chances of a “measurable tightening” of policy and said any normalisation would be “gradual”.Investors have priced in a June rate rise by the ECB since Lagarde triggered a sell-off in eurozone bond markets this month by saying inflation risks were “tilted to the upside” and there was “unanimous concern” about rising prices on its governing council.The last time the ECB raised interest rates, in 2011, it was widely seen as a mistake, coming just as the eurozone debt crisis erupted. The increase had to be reversed with a rate cut later that year.The 2011 rate rise was prompted by misplaced fears at the ECB that surging energy prices would have “second-round effects”, the process by which rising costs cause businesses to raise prices and workers to demand higher wages, feeding an inflationary spiral.“There are similarities between where we are today and 2011, but there are also differences and we need to make sure that our assessment is putting the current high headline numbers [of inflation] into a broader context,” said Makhlouf, who was a finance ministry official in the UK and New Zealand before joining Ireland’s central bank in 2019.ECB policymakers need to judge how “durable” the recent price pressures would prove, he said, adding that this was likely to hinge on whether wages start rising faster as workers respond to the rising cost of living.“When I talk to businesses based in Ireland and multinationals, one of the top subjects that comes up every time is the dearth of talent and a tightness of the labour market for talent,” he said. “There is a bit of discussion about wage pressures, but not to the extent that I can say I have now got strong evidence of things moving.”Wages are likely to start rising as labour markets rebound across Europe — Ireland’s unemployment rate fell from 7.7 per cent last March to 5.3 per cent in January — but Makhlouf said: “I certainly want to see fresh evidence.”Record inflation was “impacting on households and businesses in ways they don’t want, and no one wants,” he said, adding: “We also don’t want to kill off the recovery.”
382  The name of a small office at the top of a drab skyscraper in the centre of Vilnius has set off a geopolitical firestorm that threatens billions of dollars in trade.This is the Taiwanese Representative Office in Lithuania, a diplomatic outpost so new that the chief of mission’s business cards still carry the address of his previous posting in Latvia.At issue is the fact that the name of the mission explicitly refers to the disputed island of Taiwan — and not, as is more common, its capital city of Taipei. To Eric Huang, who heads up the office, this makes complete sense. “We are representing Taiwan, not the city of Taipei,” he says.But for the Chinese, the opening in Lithuania of what amounts to a de facto embassy represents a big step towards formal recognition of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of its territory. And it has retaliated furiously to this perceived provocation, not just by stopping direct imports from the Baltic country but by taking aim at global supply chains — stopping German companies, for instance, from using Lithuanian components in China.For many policymakers in Europe, Asia and the US, the tactics that China is deploying in the dispute with Lithuania mark a watershed moment for the global economy. Although China has long used various types of economic coercion in political disputes with countries from Canada to Australia, this represents the first time the Chinese government has tried to prescribe where companies can, or in this case cannot, source parts for goods they make in and sell to China.The precedent being set by China should send shockwaves, say officials in the Baltic country. “It is Lithuania today,” says economy minister Ausrine Armonaite. “It may be any other country tomorrow.”The stakes are particularly high for the EU. It is the first time China has unleashed the full power of its economic coercion toolkit against an EU country, testing the bloc’s ability to prioritise its joint strategic interest over individual countries’ or companies’ short-term gains. Seeing the workings of its single market threatened, the EU has filed a case against China at the World Trade Organization, which the US, Australia, Japan, UK, Canada and Taiwan are all seeking to join.“It is a test for how far China will go with its punishments, how far Taiwan will go in trying to make up for the economic damage, how far the EU will go in standing together, how far the US will go in shielding Lithuania from the fallout,” says Jakub Jakobowski, a senior fellow with the China programme at the Eastern Studies Centre (OSW) in Warsaw.Lithuanian businesses may not wait around to see the results of that test. Kristijonas Vizbaras, a Lithuanian entrepreneur who has co-founded a series of companies, is already examining whether to move manufacturing for his family’s new sensor venture from his home country to Belgium.“It hit like a bomb. Everybody was completely flat-footed,” says Vizbaras, explaining that in Lithuania’s laser sector about one in two parts sold end up in China eventually.“We fully support Taiwan as a democratic country. But we are extremely angry at our government and how they acted,” he adds. “We have to de-risk and divert our future expansion plans out of Lithuania. This is what we are doing, and what a lot of other businesses are doing.”Long known as perhaps the most vocal critic of Russia and its increasingly aggressive stance, Lithuania has developed growing sympathy for Taiwan and its efforts to resist being pulled into the orbit of another authoritarian state, China.But officials in Lithuania’s former government, in power in Vilnius until October of 2020, say their initial discussions focused only on a mission named after Taipei. A new government changed tack, unveiling the new name last July even as Lithuania confronted not just the Covid-19 pandemic but a hybrid attack from Belarus forcing migrants over the border as well as Russian sabre-rattling in nearby Ukraine.“It was a bit surprising. I still don’t know why they did it. We should save our ammunition, and not fight on several fronts at the same time,” says one former senior official.Foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis says it was never Lithuania’s intention to cause a diplomatic fuss. “We didn’t pick a fight; a big country decided to teach the world a lesson,” he says.Landsbergis presents the move as part of Lithuania’s values-based foreign policy, which aims to support democracy and freedom around the world. Lithuania, which only regained independence in 1990 after almost half a century of annexation by the Soviet Union, sets stock in standing up to authoritarian states, adding China to a list that includes neighbouring Russia and Belarus as well. “Sometimes those principles and values are not very much liked by our neighbours or some other countries. But we cannot just choose to go another way. It is our way. We understand very well it is not the way that is easiest,” President Gitanas Nauseda told the Financial Times last summer. An EU official scoffs: “They see themselves as leaders of the free world.”But the name change also came after a number of moves had already antagonised Beijing last year, including Lithuania withdrawing from the 17+1 format China used to deal with countries from central and eastern Europe, a ban on using Huawei equipment to build 5G networks, and a parliamentary motion calling China’s actions against Uyghurs in Xinjiang “genocide”.Landsbergis insists that Lithuania did not take the decision in the hope of receiving some form of compensation from the Taiwanese. “We are not selling the name of the representative office,” he says.Still, support has come. Taiwan set up a $200mn fund to invest in Lithuania; it is also offering $1bn in loans to joint projects between the two countries. Armonaite says Lithuania is looking to boost investments in semiconductors, IT, and biotech using the funds.The US, in turn, has given Lithuania $600mn in export credits that Vilnius can use to buy technology or goods as well as support its companies, recognition for its action on what is Washington’s main foreign policy goal of containing China. “US support has been steadfast. The US and many other countries clearly see this as a challenge not just for Lithuania or the EU, but for the world,” a state department official says.China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and threatens to invade if Taipei resists submitting to its control indefinitely. Beijing pressures all third countries, international organisations and companies to treat Taiwan as part of China. As a result, all but 14 countries have cut official diplomatic ties with Taiwan and the country is frozen out of international organisations.China’s retaliation against Lithuania has been far from subtle, even if Beijing has refused to acknowledge it even exists. “The claim of so-called ‘coercion’ against Lithuania is fabricated out of nothing,” a foreign ministry spokesman said last week. Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said: “Lithuania should stop confusing right and wrong and maliciously hyping things, let alone trying to gang up with other countries against China.”The Baltic country suddenly disappeared from the list of countries in China’s customs code while multiple companies — from Lithuania, Germany and elsewhere — reported difficulties getting components labelled as made in Lithuania into China.“Right now, China is blocking all parts. They are looking through all German auto parts and saying ‘this LED strip was glued in Lithuania, send it back’. You can’t do business that is interlinked to global supply chains from Lithuania,” says one Lithuanian-based supplier.The measures fit into a long history of China leveraging its big and growing market to punish foreign countries or companies over political disagreements. Partial trade bans have been imposed on Japan, Norway, Australia, and Canada while Beijing has throttled the flow of Chinese tourists to countries it has had acute disputes with. China has even permitted public demonstrations calling for boycotts of Japanese cars and goods.But analysts have noted a sharp increase in Beijing’s use of such punitive measures over the past four years, as well as more signs of European countries and companies being targeted. “The trajectory is really worrying,” says Jonathan Hackenbroich, a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin.Companies in Lithuania are developing workarounds, according to officials and business executives in Vilnius, including disguising the origin of parts and treating work in Lithuania as a service that does not have to be declared.“The priority is to ensure that the products that end up in China do not contain unique Lithuanian parts, meaning those that are labelled and distinguishable,” says a supply chain expert at an international consultancy with knowledge of German companies’ operations.A far bigger question is how the dispute could change investment and supply chain decisions not just for Lithuania but more broadly multinational companies. “If China succeeds in weaponising European value chains now, it will be encouraged to do this in the future, and it might influence decisions about new investments,” says Jakobowski.He sees China’s new coercion technique as part of a broader policy of getting big foreign companies to locate ever bigger parts of their supply chains in China. “This is part of the bigger decoupling game,” he adds.In Lithuania, there is a hope that companies can readjust and find other partners just as they have when neighbouring Russia has thrown its weight around. Businesses, however, are trying to view it from both sides. “We can’t avoid the world’s second-biggest economy. We moved towards China for the past 30 years and can’t jump away in a day,” says Vidmantas Janulevicius, president of the Lithuanian confederation of industrialists. “But we can’t be dependent on one country. It’s a very good wake-up call for Europe that we need to have diversified supply chains.”The EU has tried to respond swiftly, launching the WTO case against Beijing. But it is struggling to balance the need to defend the single market with the reality of business dependence on China.In December, the EU unveiled plans to allow it to take swift retaliation against economic coercion — especially from China and Russia — through 12 possible countermeasures, including levying tariffs and banning chemical imports. France has made adopting the anti-coercion instrument one of the key parts of its current six months leading the council of EU member states. Thierry Breton, the EU internal market commissioner, is set to visit Vilnius in the coming days.“When it was felt that the single market was the target then the attitude [in the EU] changed,” says Landsbergis. He adds that thanks to the WTO case “we are entering a much more stable situation”.But not all EU states have appreciated Lithuania’s approach, with some accusing it of acting unilaterally against such a big power just as the continent deals with Russia amassing more than 100,000 troops on its border with Ukraine and in neighbouring Belarus. “I don’t really see what was to be gained by forcing an issue that the Chinese are so sensitive about,” says one official in a EU member state.China is trying to exploit the unease in some EU capitals about Lithuania’s move, says Hackenbroich. “Given that division and the lack of tools to respond on the European side, and the capability and willingness to exploit dependency on the Chinese side, China is in a better position.”Some officials believe that the EU needs to dramatically up its game in responding. “If China now leverages their market to use our companies for sanctions against other countries, we have a big problem,” says an EU diplomat in Asia. “This is something the US does already, so EU companies will be on the receiving end of such secondary measures from the world’s two economic superpowers.”The US frequently uses economic sanctions that apply extraterritorially. For example, its ban on semiconductor supplies to Huawei that use US equipment bars TSMC of Taiwan, the world’s biggest contract chipmaker, from producing chips for the Chinese technology group because it uses US tools.The EU has a law designed to counter such pressure but it is largely dormant. The so-called Blocking Statute was devised in response to US sanctions against Cuba and Iran, which also apply to non-US companies. Analysts say it needs to be broadened for use against China. “This is going to be a much bigger challenge for the EU in the future because EU companies will, when in doubt, always prioritise market access to China,” Hackenbroich says.The position of Germany is particularly crucial, and the country itself seems divided. Its main business lobby group, the BDI, called Beijing’s move against Lithuania “a devastating own goal.” But the German-Baltic chamber of commerce told the Lithuanian government that some companies would have “no other choice than to shut down production in Lithuania.”Tobias Lindner, state secretary at the German foreign ministry, set out his government’s position at an event earlier this month: “Trade policy is a matter for the EU. Period. And whoever imposes sanctions on Lithuania is imposing sanctions on the whole of the EU.”But diplomats say others in Berlin have privately tried to push a softer line. “What we have had, especially from the German government, calling up people in Brussels to try to tone down the response, has been very unhelpful,” says one EU diplomat.A German executive in the Baltics argues that the EU desperately needs to come up with a proper strategy for dealing with China, but questions whether the name of the Taiwanese office in Lithuania is the right case to force the issue. “We have much bigger stakes than this,” he says. “We should not fight over minor things [when] we have challenges 100 times bigger.”Lithuania is putting on a brave face for now. Armonaite, the economy minister, says that for all the furore, no company has yet left, and that Lithuania’s economy is still expected to grow strongly this year.But there is also a sense that unless a compromise is reached with Beijing, there is a danger that companies avoid Lithuania for future investments while the WTO case drags on for years. Janulevicius says it is likely to be a difficult two to three years. “The result, we will see only in 5-7 years’ time. It’s a big reputational issue,” says one Lithuanian automotive supplier.Huang is in no doubt what will happen if there is no pushback against China’s new coercion tactics. “If we cave to pressure this time, they will pursue it again,” the Taiwanese representative says. “Then China will rule the world.”Additional reporting by Guy Chazan in Berlin
383  After months of rising inflation in the major advanced economies, a narrative is taking hold. It goes that the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve have (better late than never) woken up to the inflation danger and are finally moving to make up for lost ground, while the European Central Bank runs a greater risk every day of falling behind the curve.This is why bond traders read a “hawkish pivot” into an ever-so-slight change of tone from the ECB, which has expressed “unanimous concern” over inflation, and accordingly sold off euro bonds, especially of high-debt governments. Surely, markets seem to think, the ECB must soon correct course — even overcorrect. Mustn’t it?One thing is true: the contrast between the eurozone and the large anglophone economies is striking. In the US and the UK, the employment rate remains more than 1 per cent below the pre-pandemic level and some 3 per cent below the pre-pandemic trend. Yet both the Fed and the BoE are beginning to press the brakes on aggregate demand. In the eurozone, conversely, the share of people in work is the highest, and the unemployment rate the lowest, on record. Yet the ECB seems relaxed about labour market pressures.This looks, on the face of it, the wrong way round. It would be more natural to worry about overheating in a labour market that has fully recovered from a downturn and to want to keep a foot on the accelerator in an economy still well short of jobs. Central bankers are doing exactly the opposite. But, as well as suggesting the ECB is behind the curve, this could equally indicate that the Fed and the BoE might be jumping the gun.One way to make sense of this topsy-turvy monetary policy messaging is to suppose that the missing American and British jobs are gone forever — that today’s situation is as good as it gets — while continental Europe has been spared any permanent scarring from the pandemic and so can expect the economy to take continued loose monetary policy in its stride.That is not implausible. Continental-style short-term work and temporary unemployment schemes did a much better job of keeping people attached to the workplace than the American temporary boost to unemployment benefits and ill-targeted “paycheck protection” spending. For its part, the UK deployed a European-style furlough, but from the standing start of a system that had traditionally hewed closer to US-style flexibility. That, plus the departure of European workers after Brexit, could explain today’s disappointing employment rate.Two big caveats pertain to this analysis. The first is just how surprising it would be, if true. The conventional wisdom, after all, is that continental Europe, while more protective of workers, is worse at getting them jobs than the tough-love Anglo-American model, especially in post-recession recoveries. If that has now changed, it is cause for a victory lap for the continental and Nordic traditions of social protection.The second caveat concerns the fact that economic output numbers tell a different story than labour market numbers. US GDP is currently well above its pre-pandemic level and closing in on its pre-pandemic trend. The eurozone, while it recovered its pre-Covid GDP level late last year, remains far below where it should be on the growth path. (By this measure, the UK looks distinctly continental.)This means the US has achieved remarkably better productivity growth. That justifies tolerating higher wage growth, too, without fearing a wage-price spiral. And Europe’s relatively weak output growth means it, too, may still have spare capacity to make up.The febrile narrative dominating today’s debate insists on emphasising signs of overheating and ignoring those of spare capacity — in particular the economy’s potential to expand the labour force in response to strong demand. That is precisely the reflex that recent strategy reviews by both the Fed and the ECB were intended to forestall.Both central banks have heeded lessons from the previous decade, when fears of excessive monetary stimulus foundered (or should have done) when supposed limits on jobs growth failed to materialise. The ECB has even formally endorsed temporary inflation above its target to secure the economy’s potential.Far sooner than expected, these principles are facing exactly the pressures they were adopted to resist. But it is in times like this that monetary policymakers show their mettle. Far from falling behind the curve, it is Frankfurt’s central bankers who are demonstrating how to hold their nerve. For now.
384  Russian forces remain on the brink of invading Ukraine, US officials warned, after Joe Biden failed to make a breakthrough during an hour-long phone call with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.The US president made a last-ditch attempt to persuade Putin not to attack Ukraine as governments began to withdraw diplomatic and military personnel from the country.Biden warned Putin that western countries would respond to an invasion with “severe” economic sanctions but the White House said that his efforts had not changed the Kremlin’s position and an imminent attack remained a “distinct possibility”.US officials warned on Friday that Russia could launch a full-scale invasion as early as next week.A senior administration official said on Saturday: “The call between the two presidents was professional and substantive, and lasted a bit over an hour. But there was no fundamental change in the dynamic which has been unfolding now for several weeks.”The official added: “The presidents agreed their teams will stay engaged in the days ahead. Russia may decide to pursue military action anyway, we view that as a distinct possibility.”Yuri Ushakov, Putin’s foreign policy adviser, said the call was “balanced and businesslike” but accused the US and its western allies of “unprecedented hysteria” in claiming Russia was planning to invade Ukraine, which he said was “absurd”.Putin agreed to consider some of Biden’s suggestions which the US hopes will satisfy Russia’s security grievances with Nato, Ushakov added. But he complained that Ukraine’s western backers were increasing the chance of open conflict by supplying it with sophisticated weaponry and modernising its armed forces.Biden told Putin that the US and Russia needed to put their differences aside to “support peace and security” and find a way to avoid “the worst scenario” in Ukraine, Ushakov said.The call between Biden and Putin was part of a flurry of diplomatic activity on Saturday as western leaders attempted to persuade Moscow to withdraw military forces from around Ukraine’s borders.Emmanuel Macron, the French president, also called Putin, telling him that “a sincere dialogue was not compatible with an escalation”, according to the Elysée. Macron was “trying step by step to lower the pressure”, the official said, adding that the Russian president did not appear to have changed his position.Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, spoke to his counterpart Sergei Lavrov, and Liz Truss, UK foreign secretary. German chancellor Olaf Scholz plans to visit Kyiv on Monday before meeting Putin in Moscow on Tuesday.Putin discussed Russia’s security demands and “certain bilateral issues” with Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko, the Kremlin said.The US state department said most of its staff would leave its embassy in Kyiv, while American citizens would be offered emergency assistance from the western city of Lviv.Maria Zakharova, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, said Moscow had decided to “optimise” its staff at its Kyiv embassy and three consulates in Ukraine “out of caution over possible provocations from the Kyiv regime or third countries”.Germany and Spain called on their citizens to leave Ukraine. The German foreign ministry said it was relocating a consulate in the eastern city of Dnipro to Lviv. Its embassy in Kyiv will remain open.The US and UK also said they would withdraw the limited numbers of troops who were training Ukrainian forces.Melinda Simmons, UK ambassador to Ukraine, said she would stay in Kyiv, while UK defence secretary Ben Wallace criticised the diplomatic efforts, telling the Sunday Times newspaper that it amounted to appeasement and there was “a whiff of Munich” in the air.Dutch airline KLM announced it was cancelling its Ukraine flights and would not enter the country’s airspace.Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, called for calm.“Today, the best friend for enemies is panic in our country, and all this information, which only helps panic, does not help us,” he said, speaking from the southern region of Kherson, bordering Russian-occupied Crimea.Viktor Orban, Hungary’s leader, warned of the likelihood of a refugee crisis in Europe if Russia were to invade Ukraine but warned European leaders that threatening Moscow with sanctions was “a dead end”. Though the White House believes Putin has not made a final decision, Russia has built up more than 130,000 troops along its border with Ukraine and in neighbouring Belarus, as well as weaponry that could be used for an assault on Kyiv.Additional reporting by Guy Chazan in Berlin, Victor Mallet in Paris and Marton Dunai in Budapest
385  Poland’s ruling party has proposed a bill to change a contested disciplinary chamber for judges, in an attempt to defuse a long-running feud with Brussels over the rule of law.The chamber has been ruled illegal by the EU’s top court, and has become a flashpoint in a dispute that has led to Brussels withholding billions of euros in funding to Warsaw.However, amid mounting tension in neighbouring Ukraine, there have been hints that Poland is looking for ways to ease its stand-off with Brussels. Last week, president Andrzej Duda put forward his own plan to amend the disciplinary system for judges, warning that Poland did “not need this fight” in light of the “shocks on the international scene”.Under the proposal put forward by MPs from the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) on Friday, the disciplinary chamber would continue to exist, but would no longer handle cases involving judges, and instead deal only with those affecting other legal professionals.Disciplinary cases involving judges would be dealt with by three or seven-judge panels selected by lot from members of the Supreme Court.The law would prevent judges from being disciplined for the content of their rulings and provide for those already suspended for this reason to be reinstated, except in cases where rulings were the result of “serious and totally inexcusable forms of conduct on the part of the judge”.The stand-off between Brussels and Warsaw over the rule of law has led to an impasse over Poland’s bid for a €36bn slice of the EU’s NextGenerationEU recovery package. European officials have said Poland should scrap the disciplinary chamber, change its rules and reinstate dismissed judges as conditions for approving Warsaw’s request for pandemic recovery funding.The recent overture from Duda was welcomed in Brussels as step forward, following the breakdown of efforts to address EU complaints about judicial independence in Poland, but it was not seen as enough to unlock the frozen funding.Officials are likely to take a similar view of the latest offer, which could lay the ground for more intensive dialogue over the Polish recovery plan even if it is not enough to fulfil the conditions set out by the commission.Daniel Freund, a Green MEP from Germany, said the latest offer was “a step in the right direction,” but he warned there remained a long way to go.He said: “The conditions are clear. The independence of the judiciary needs to be re-established, unduly dismissed judges to be reinstated and the ECJ rulings fully implemented. Only then can the RRF funds be released.”Jakub Jaraczewski, a legal expert at Democracy Reporting International, said that while the proposal addressed European concerns “narrowly” related to the disciplinary chamber, it did not address wider criticisms of Poland’s judicial changes.“It does nothing about the National Council of the Judiciary, it does nothing about the other problematic chamber of the Supreme Court. and it does nothing about the issue with all the new judges who have been appointed with a motion from the NCJ. and whose status is being increasingly challenged before the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights,” he said.To become law, the bill would need to be approved by Poland’s parliament. However, it is not clear whether it would be supported by PiS’s more hardline junior coalition partner, United Poland, which is led by hawkish justice minister Zbigniew Ziobro.Ziobro has pushed for a more confrontational approach to Brussels, and been working on his own bill amending the disciplinary chamber. Without United Poland’s votes, PiS would need the support of opposition lawmakers to pass the bill.An EU official said the proposal represented “a step to address the issues surrounding the independence of the justice system” and as such was a positive development.But the official added: “it’s too soon to say if this satisfactorily addresses the three main issues we have identified. And of course none of this means much unless and until there is an adoption by the Polish legislature.”
386  Estonia’s president has warned that the Baltic states should prepare for Russia’s use of hybrid warfare tactics, saying they must be ready for cyber attacks and migrant flows to be employed against them.Alar Karis said that although there was no direct threat to Estonia, he was worried about the thousands of Russian troops being sent to Belarus for snap military exercises. Belarus last year deliberately funnelled large numbers of migrants to its borders with Poland, Lithuania and Latvia in an effort to unsettle the EU countries.“We need to be ready.hybrid attacks, cyber attacks: these things can happen,” Karis told the Financial Times. The crisis on the Belarus-EU border last year, when migrants were trapped in often freezing conditions, “was definitely not orchestrated by the migrants themselves, but by Belarus — and even Russia itself. This is what we have to be prepared for”.The Baltic states have raised their military readiness and called for increased Nato presence in their region as Russia continues to gather its forces on Ukraine’s border close to the eastern flank of the military alliance.The UK this week confirmed that it would double its presence in Estonia, where it leads a 1,000-strong multinational battlegroup. Germany said it would send more troops to Lithuania and Canada is considering increasing its troop numbers in Latvia.“Deterrence is something that works if we deal with Russians. The more troops we have over here the better,” Karis said. “For a small country like Estonia, it’s important that we feel secure.”The Baltic countries are particularly concerned about the more than 30,000 Russian troops on an unannounced exercise in Belarus, which has strong ties with Moscow. “If these troops stay there, of course it’s a problem because [Belarus] is not going to be independent any more,” he said.The Belarusian border with Lithuania and Poland is just 100km from the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, a stretch known as the Suwalki Gap that is considered one of Nato’s biggest vulnerabilities.“I don’t think Russia is going to challenge Nato at the moment. But of course, there’s a problem with migration later on if something happens,” Karis said.Lithuania accused Belarus of “weaponising” migrants last summer by pushing them to its border. Minsk later deployed the same tactic against neighbouring Poland and Latvia with suspicions in all three countries that Moscow had played a part.Karis, who took over in October as Estonia’s president having been head of the national museum and the country’s auditor-general, revealed that Estonia suffered 150 attempted cyber attacks per day and that “the attempts are so many it’s difficult to follow”.He also warned of the dangers of leaders such as France’s Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz of Germany having one-on-one talks with Russia’s Vladimir Putin, after Nato hitherto presented a unified front to Moscow.“People are getting worried of these bilateral contacts of different politicians, and getting worried things are going to be decided behind their backs or over their heads. It’s something you have to watch as well and be concerned,” Karis said.He added: “Putin didn’t expect this kind of unity in Nato or Europe. This is why he started this kind of bilateral discussions with different leaders, either with friends or not so friends.”Baltic politicians are particularly concerned that a western leader could try to offer a compromise, such as stopping military exercises in countries bordering Russia.“The sayings from the Russia side are that they don’t want war. But they probably want some sphere of influence, especially over Ukraine and Belarus, and maybe all over the eastern part of Europe,” Karis said.Karis said countries in eastern Europe viewed things differently to those in the west of the continent because of their histories. The Soviet Union occupied and then annexed Estonia and the other Baltic countries in the 1940s.He described Russia’s demand for Nato’s borders to be returned to their 1997 state — before Estonia or 13 other countries joined — as “unimaginable” but said there were some things that could be discussed, such as greater transparency over military exercises.
387  Fitch downgraded Turkey’s sovereign debt and issued a scathing verdict on president Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s plan to tackle soaring inflation.The international rating agency pushed the long-term debt rating deeper into junk territory, lowering it from BB- to B+ — putting G20 country on a par with Benin, Egypt, Turkmenistan, Rwanda and Kenya.Fitch issued a negative outlook for Turkey’s debt, meaning that it could face further downgrades, and said that the financial system had been made more vulnerable by frequent and intense episodes of financial stress that it said were driven by policymakers.It said that the centrepiece of Erdogan’s plan to stabilise the country’s crisis prone economy — a series of exchange rate linked savings schemes — would not “sustainably ease macroeconomic and financial stability risks”.The Turkish lira lost more than 40 per cent of its value against the dollar in 2021 after Erdogan ordered the country’s central bank to cut interest rates four times in the final months of the year, despite soaring inflation and a shift towards rate rises by global central banks.The Turkish president, who has consolidated his grip over the country’s institutions in recent years, rejects the economic orthodoxy that raising interest rates helps to restore price stability.He has argued that he is presiding over a “new economic model” that he says will address the country’s structural economic imbalances by capitalising on a weaker, more competitive lira to boost exports, investments and employment.Turkish officials say that a set of state-backed deposits schemes, which seek to lure Turks to save in lira by promising to protect them against exchange rate loses, will reverse a long-term trend of “dollarisation” and help to bring down inflation by stabilising the local currency. They argue that, in a country that is heavily reliant on imports, price instability is largely driven by lira weakness.Turkey’s finance minister has predicted that inflation will fall to single digits by May next year. But Fitch said that it forecast average inflation of 41 per cent in 2022 and 28 per cent in 2023 — a rate that it said was the second highest level of any country in its coverage.The rating agency said that the country’s expansionary policy mix — including real interest rates that currently stand at almost -35 per cent — “could entrench inflation at high levels, increase the exposure of public finances to exchange rate depreciation and inflation”. That could eventually hit domestic confidence and reignite pressures on the country’s already low foreign currency reserves, it said.Fitch said that the capacity of the new savings schemes to “sustainably improve confidence” was limited. It warned that, if the measures failed to curb domestic demand for foreign currency, authorities could be forced to resort either to burning through more of the country’s central bank reserves or further capital controls. “This policy response could in turn have a negative effect on domestic confidence,” it said.Turkey lost its investment grade status from Fitch in January 2017, and has been further downgraded three times since then. The latest downgrade will further raise the cost of international borrowing for the country, which is heavily reliant on foreign financing to fund its economy.
388  It has now dawned on EU authorities that the union’s agonising dependence on Russian natural gas will be compounded by Russian companies’ market power over fertiliser. As one Eurocrat told me this week, “You do not get a Nobel Prize for seeing this fertiliser situation as a threat to Europe’s food security.”Now there is strong sentiment among some in Brussels to respond to such a threat, perhaps through legal challenges and competition proceedings. This comes after the announcement this month that the EuroChem Group has made a binding offer to buy the nitrogen fertiliser and chemical assets of Borealis, now owned by OMV, the Austrian oil and petrochemicals company.As a European fertiliser industry executive pointed out: “This will make EuroChem the second-largest fertiliser company in Europe, after Yara [of Norway].” The home country of EuroChem’s management and the core ownership group are in Russia, which, by the way, just imposed a two-month ban on its own fertiliser exports that ends April 1.It does not help the European food industry that Yara International and other incumbent producers are now increasingly dependent on Russian gas or imported LNG that is several times more expensive than what the Russian fertiliser industry pays for the same input. Natural gas accounts for about 80 per cent of the cost of European nitrogen fertiliser. Yara was forced to curtail production last year because of rising gas prices.In the year to last December, EU farmers saw the cost of their natural gas rise by 549 per cent, and nitrogen fertilisers’ cost increase by 263 per cent. Not surprisingly, many of the farmers have held off on buying enough fertiliser to maintain their crop yields this year. As one German MEP said: “Some of us are worried about a 10 per cent decline in food production, though the optimistic view is that there will only be a 5 per cent decline.”Conditions have been in place for a good harvest in Europe this year. However, while the “first dressing” of fertiliser on fields is mostly being completed this month, agriculture and industry people worry about the “second dressing”, particularly for grain crops, that will be carried out (or not, or on a reduced scale) in May and June.The hesitant farmers are putting the supply risk (and the price risk) on the fertiliser producers, who are concerned about the “logistical crunch” that could choke roads, warehouses and manufacturing facilities forced beyond their design capacity.Easing the immediate pressure on European food supplies by importing cheap foreign grain will be a challenge. In recent years Russia moved from a communist-era grain importer to one of the two most important grain exporters in the world, along with Ukraine. To maintain plentiful domestic supplies, however, Russia has also restricted grain exports for several months.Given that prices of wheat and other cereals in the EU were already up between 38 and 59 per cent on the year, that is not good news for Europeans.Europe may lack fertiliser, but it has plenty of trade lawyers and experts who know how to manage official trade proceedings. There have been murmurs in Brussels about challenging Russia’s fertiliser export restrictions at the World Trade Organization, but as one European official admits: “That would take four or five years, and for what?”Another possibility is to launch an EC “competition” proceeding to block EuroChem’s takeover of Borealis. Most of the discussion so far has been among European agricultural specialists, but as one of those said: “We work in a collegiate manner and we would expect our counterparts in the DG [directorate-general] for competition are aware and are concerned about the risks.”Of course Russians have lawyers too. And the truth is that it’s not EuroChem that caused Europe’s gas and fertiliser crunch. The member states decided among themselves that they did not want to drill for more gas on their own territory. The carbon impact of European gas use was just shifted to politicised Russian wells and pipelines and expensive LNG imports from America or Qatar.Oh, and before the deep green people in the room suggest a virtuous switch to “organic” fertiliser, variously defined, they should keep in mind that grain crop yields per hectare decline by nearly half when dressed organically.Europe has great technology strengths, but gas and fertiliser do not come from a virtual reality headset. Russians had a strategy, and they have executed it.
389  The US has warned of an “immediate” threat that Russia will invade Ukraine after President Joe Biden summoned transatlantic leaders to a meeting to discuss the crisis and embassies stepped up warnings for their citizens to leave the country.“The risk is now high enough and the threat is now immediate enough,” said Jake Sullivan, White House national security adviser, as he urged Americans to leave Ukraine within the next 24 to 48 hours. There was a “credible prospect” of Russia launching an attack before the end of the Winter Olympics in Beijing on February 20, he added.While the US does not believe that Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, has yet made a “final decision”, Washington said the country had built up sufficient military capability, including troops and equipment, to make a move as early as next week.Sullivan said an invasion could take several forms, including a “rapid assault” on Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. He added that an invasion is “likely to begin with aerial bombing and missile attacks that could obviously kill civilians without regard to their nationality”.“A subsequent ground invasion would involve the onslaught of a massive force with virtually no notice,” added Sullivan.He said Russia would face a stronger and more determined Nato alliance, “massive pressure” on its economy and a wave of “condemnation” from around the world if it went ahead with an attack.In Washington, foreign policy experts said that while it was unclear whether the White House’s warnings would be heeded by Putin and trigger second thoughts in the Kremlin, they would at least help signal that the west may soon have to shift away from deterring a possible Russian invasion to responding to one.“The point for the White House to do this is to further reinforce the urgency.so that we are prepared to react when [an invasion] happens, if it happens,” said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, director of the transatlantic security programme at the Center for a New American Security. “I think it’s first and foremost about getting the allies on board and getting people ready to implement a response,” she said.Although US officials have said the diplomatic path is still open to Putin, the gap between Russian demands and what the west is willing to concede still appears too wide for any quick resolution, they say.“Western leaders are coming to terms with the fact that there would have to be major concessions by Putin or the west [to avoid an invasion],” said Rachel Rizzo, a senior fellow at the Europe Center of the Atlantic Council.Russia is increasing its military capability along Ukraine’s border, sending additional troops and equipment to the region, and has also started a large-scale military exercise in areas in Belarus. However, Moscow has repeatedly rejected accusations that it plans to invade.Lloyd Austin, US defence secretary, on Friday ordered an extra 3,000 troops be deployed to Poland at the direction of the president, a Pentagon official said.The troops are expected to leave their base in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, over the next few days and arrive in Poland early next week, the official said. They join an existing tranche of 1,700 soldiers already ordered to Poland by Washington.International oil benchmark Brent jumped 4.3 per cent to $95.25 a barrel in afternoon trading in New York. US marker West Texas Intermediate rose 5 per cent to $94.36. The Russian rouble fell 3.2 per cent against the dollar, reaching the weakest level since early February. Traders sought shelter in haven assets, sending yields on US government bonds tumbling.Sullivan spoke after Biden held a call with his counterparts, including the leaders of Germany, France and the UK, to discuss their strategy towards Russia.On Friday evening, a White House official said Biden and Putin would be speaking on Saturday morning. Russia proposed a call on Monday and Washington counter-proposed Saturday, which Moscow accepted, the official added.An ally of Boris Johnson, UK prime minister, said the call was “very sobering”. On the call Johnson said he “feared for the security of Europe”, according to a Downing Street account.The UK on Friday urged its citizens to leave Ukraine and said it would withdraw some embassy staff. Japan, the Netherlands and Latvia also advised nationals to leave as soon as possible. The US reiterated warnings to its citizens to evacuate.The new US warning follows a flurry of high-level diplomatic activity in an effort to defuse the crisis, led this week by French president Emmanuel Macron, who met Putin in Moscow.In Ukraine, the government stepped up defence preparations. President Volodymyr Zelensky urged officials to support efforts to bring 1.5mn to 2mn civilians into a newly formed territorial defence force under military command.“This is a reliable rear for a professional and well-equipped army, which together form the basis of our state, a strong state,” Zelensky said after meeting regional governors.Valeriy Zaluzhny, commander-in-chief of the country’s armed forces, said: “This is a force that can restrain the enemy and prevent them from thinking about setting foot on our land.the purpose of all this is to resist in every city, every village, on every street and in every house.”
390  The UK has signalled it could accept customs controls on goods destined only for sale in Northern Ireland, its first significant concession during months of talks with Brussels over post-Brexit trading arrangements.Liz Truss, foreign secretary, wants to resolve the dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol — part of the EU-UK withdrawal agreement — which has soured relations between London and Brussels as well as convulsing politics in the region ahead of elections on May 5.Truss, who travelled to Moscow on Thursday for talks on Ukraine, believes Europe needs to work together to tackle the geopolitical crisis in the east. “Liz thinks western democracies need to work together,” said one ally.London has so far insisted that suppliers of products shipped from Great Britain intended for sale in Northern Ireland only should no longer have to fill in customs forms as dictated by the protocol.But British negotiators on Friday told their EU counterparts they could accept controls — though far fewer than under existing arrangements or reforms proposed by Brussels.The verbal offer was considered so sensitive it has not yet been provided in written form.The proposal came during Truss’s third in-person meeting with European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic, held in London. British officials said there was “a constructive atmosphere” at the talks.After the meeting the pair issued a joint statement, saying they agreed “on the need for progress in their talks in the interest of people in Northern Ireland, to stay in close touch and that officials will continue intensive discussions in the coming days”.Truss’s team declined to comment but one ally said she had “put forward a series of constructive proposals to address problems created by the protocol” and to bring the two sides closer together. There was no single “offer” and the UK’s fundamental negotiating position had not shifted, they added.Under the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol, all goods going from Great Britain to the region must follow EU customs and health rules to avoid a trade border on the island of Ireland itself. But this “Irish Sea border” has offended the Unionist community in the north, which favours remaining in the UK.The commission in October had offered to create “red and green channels”, in which goods that were clearly destined to remain inside Northern Ireland, such as supermarket deliveries, would only need to provide a single customs form per load. London has now agreed to discuss this idea, but wants declarations to be even less detailed.The two sides have yet to make progress on the trickier issue of health checks on animals and food entering the region. The commission claimed its offer would reduce them by 80 per cent but the UK is unconvinced.Any customs agreement could be ratified by a meeting on February 21 of the Joint Committee, which manages the post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland. The talks are then expected to be paused during the election campaign.EU diplomats gave a cautious welcome to the UK proposal. “It’s a positive move but we are not rolling out the red carpet yet,” said one. “There is still a long way between the two sides.”Any concessions made during the talks with Brussels could anger Eurosceptic Conservative MPs, who dislike the protocol negotiated by Boris Johnson, the prime minister, because it puts a trade border in the Irish Sea — within the UK’s internal boundaries.
391  There’s no doubt the crunch is coming; the only question is what to do about it. As Britons brace for the prospect of crippling energy bills, the left want a windfall tax on oil and gas majors, and the right want the government to soft-pedal on net zero. Neither feels like the right response to a problem exacerbated by decades of failure to prioritise energy stability.The global fuel system powers the global economy. Yet energy policy experts often seem to occupy a dusty outpost of government, rarely consulted until crises hit. Then, the complex interactions they describe between capacity markets, spot prices, investment and geopolitics make eyes water. It’s easier to focus on short-term politics, or wax lyrical about hydrogen, than grip the realities of insulating homes or licensing new nuclear plants.It’s not clear that building fewer wind farms or stinging BP for a share of its profits will make the current problems go away. Europe is facing soaring international gas prices due to rising Asian demand, Russian supply problems, a cold winter in 2020 and a windless summer in 2021. The costs of decarbonising have also raised fuel bills, but the current crisis stems from our lack of energy security.There is nothing much the UK government could have done about turbulent international gas prices, but short-sighted policies have significantly increased our exposure. While the UK’s offshore wind stations are an undoubted success, decades of dither over nuclear power have deprived us of a reliable clean supply, with almost half of current capacity to be closed by 2025.Despite endless promises, successive governments have failed to insulate the UK’s draughty Victorian homes. The cack-handed liberalisation of the energy market has exposed 4mn customers to the effects of supplier bankruptcy because regulators prioritised competition over stability. Meanwhile, the bizarre 2017 decision to let Centrica close its huge Yorkshire gas storage facility has left the UK with negligible gas storage compared with France and Germany, and even more tied to bidding in the spot market.The business department believed at the time of the Centrica closure that Britain could afford to give up its storage capacity because there were so many international suppliers. They seem to have forgotten about price, and what would happen if we had to bid against China for liquefied natural gas.There has also been a determined effort to play down the real costs of decarbonisation. The green transition was always going to be bumpy and expensive: there is no nirvana in which renewables wipe out our need for gas any time soon. We can’t just switch off fossil fuels, because we need more baseload back-up power to compensate for windless days. If the government is to meet its target of decarbonising electricity generation by 2035 it will also need to fit gas stations with carbon-capture technology, which could further increase prices.Britain is not alone in these dilemmas: Germany’s preoccupation with phasing out nuclear — which used to provide 29 per cent of its power — in order to placate environmental groups, has left it burning more coal and at the mercy of Vladimir Putin. It is also increasingly under pressure from the US over its reliance on Russian gas.The answer is not to abandon our net-zero ambitions, which would leave us even more reliant on the petrostates, and do nothing to tackle climate change. The only way to protect against volatile prices is to improve energy stability and security. That means doing many of the same things that will help achieve net zero: insulating draughty homes, constructing new nuclear facilities, accelerating renewables, building more baseload power, and researching ways to store renewable power. All will require huge investment from the private sector, and that is why a windfall tax is the wrong idea: it would raise the cost of capital for the same companies we are relying on to transform our future supply.This is not to say that a windfall tax isn’t tempting. At a time when families are struggling with 7 per cent inflation and fuel bills rising by half, the £5bn gains from this levy, according to the Liberal Democrats’ estimates, are an attractive prospect. Certainly, Shell and BP are easy villains. They have been sluggish in their renewables investments, with Shell’s net-zero strategy especially timid. But they are still really the main game in town.Many politicians love the idea of what can seem like a free hit on excess profits. But I can’t help feeling that windfall taxes are little more than a retrospective tax on good luck. Imposing one now would further erode the government’s fraught relations with the business community. What Britain absolutely does not need is anything that might unsettle already jittery investors.More fundamentally, high gas prices are unlikely to be a temporary blip which can be mitigated with a one-off tax. The current crisis shows we are not yet facing the real environmental costs of the energy we use. Governments must protect the poorest from that reality, but eventually someone will have to pay, whether through higher bills or higher taxes.Addressing the UN last year, Boris Johnson invoked Kermit the frog, insisting it was “easy, lucrative and right” being green. But net zero is not a free lunch, and a windfall tax would probably not be a free hit. Until ministers prioritise security of supply, Putin will take us all for Muppets.
392  The author is writing a biography of Zbigniew BrzezinskiHistory repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce, said Karl Marx. But sometimes, as Mark Twain rejoined, it simply rhymes. The 1980 amassing of Soviet divisions on Poland’s border threatened to become a lethal escalation of the cold war. America warned Moscow that an invasion of Poland would kill US-Soviet detente — and probably much worse. Today’s Russian build-up on Ukraine’s border, which Jake Sullivan, Joe Biden’s national security adviser, says could produce an invasion “any day”, is arguably as ominous. But Washington has a useful handbook available.Almost everyone thought the Soviets would invade Poland. In August 1980, Lech Walesa led a workers’ occupation of the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk that expanded into strikes across Poland. A weak government caved in to pressure to permit an independent trade union, Solidarity — an alarming precedent for Moscow and its other satellite regimes. As in Hungary in 1956, and Czechoslovakia in 1968, Moscow gave the wobbly Polish communists a window in which to crack down or risk an invasion. Warsaw continued to prevaricate.Much like Russian forces in Belarus today, Moscow reinforced its point by conducting military exercises on Poland’s borders. By December 1980, as many as 45 Soviet divisions, or more than 400,000 troops, were on Poland’s eastern flank. A handful of East German and Czechoslovak divisions were primed on Poland’s western borders. The spectre of a third invasion of an east European satellite in 25 years sowed division in western Europe. In this case, history offers useful lessons.In May 1980, Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, France’s president, went to Warsaw for talks with Leonid Brezhnev, the ailing Soviet leader. Giscard did not warn his allies of his plans. The parallels to Emmanuel Macron’s freelancing are hard to miss. More troubling to Washington was the response of Helmut Schmidt, West Germany’s chancellor, who argued that a Soviet invasion would not endanger detente. Nor would it derail German plans to provide the USSR with loans to build a gas pipeline from Siberia to West Germany. Some things stay the same. Today’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has still not committed to halting the Nord Stream 2 pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine.But perhaps the closest parallel is between the Biden and Jimmy Carter administrations. At 37 per cent in the polls, and facing a tough election battle with Ronald Reagan, Carter was seen as indecisive and wobbly. Much of this was unfair. But America’s nightly broadcasts were dominated by images of the US hostages in revolutionary Iran, about which Carter could do little. Biden is more than two years from the next election. But his ratings are little better than Carter’s — and his political obituary has become a media staple.Carter’s trump card was Zbigniew Brzezinski, his hawkish national security adviser, who was a native-born fluent Polish speaker and naturalised American, and who drew on a secret weapon — Ryszard Kuklinski, a senior Polish military official and spy for the CIA. Kuklinski was also a Polish liaison to the Soviet military. His reports were so tightly held that only Carter, Brzezinski and Walter Mondale, the vice-president, were permitted to read them.Assets this valuable are extremely rare. It would be remarkable were the CIA to have an equivalent mole on Putin’s staff. Biden’s White House has nevertheless leaked apparently strong intelligence about Putin’s plans for a Ukrainian puppet government. Whether Biden is hyping these findings to whip allies into line remains to be seen. With the benefit of hindsight — and the minutes of Soviet politburo meetings — we know plans were drawn up for an invasion of Poland in December 1980. How did Carter stave it off?This is where history sounds more cacophonous. Unlike Putin, Brezhnev was in a weak position. In December 1979 the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. They were suffering losses at the hands of the US-backed mujahideen. Now the Afghanistan shoe is on the other foot. One reason Putin sees Biden as weak is because of the hasty US exit from Afghanistan after 20 fruitless years.Moreover, China is in a radically different place than in 1980. A year earlier, Carter had normalised US-China relations, which cemented Beijing’s move into the anti-Soviet camp. This was a strategic coup. Brzezinski and Deng Xiaoping, China’s leader, even toasted “death to the Soviet Union!” (with Russian vodka, to rub salt into the wound). Today China and Russia are aligned. Last week Xi Jinping and Putin issued a statement opposing Nato’s expansion.But the similarities are compelling. The USSR stood down from invading Poland in 1980 because it judged the costs could be prohibitive. The US warned of arms sales to China, a total Soviet trade boycott and a grain embargo. The Poles, like Ukrainians today, were bitterly hostile to Moscow. The more Biden can convince Putin he would risk another “bleeding wound” — as Mikhail Gorbachev later described the Soviet war in Afghanistan — the less attractive invading Ukraine will seem. George Santayana said: “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” For Biden that could read: “Those who study history may be fortunate to repeat it.”
393  The US and its European allies are getting “pretty close” to agreeing a far-reaching package of potential sanctions aimed at deterring Russia from attacking Ukraine, a senior US state department official has said, as he warned that Vladimir Putin could act any time.Derek Chollet, counsellor at the state department, said the Russian president would suffer a “major strategic setback” if he invaded Ukraine given the scale of the penalties being lined up by the west. Any sanctions ultimately agreed would be “dynamic”, meaning the allies could “evolve and innovate” after the imposition of the initial tranche as they seek to maintain pressure on Moscow.“We are progressing apace — and if the contingency arises where Russia moves we are going to be ready,” Chollet said in an interview with the Financial Times following talks with EU counterparts in Brussels on Thursday.Some EU member states have in recent days expressed private concerns about the impact further Russian sanctions will have on their domestic economies, while broadly standing by the west’s pledge for swift and severe penalties in response to a Russian invasion of Ukraine.Officials however insist they remain confident that the EU will respond quickly alongside the US and other allies if Putin moves in the coming days or weeks. The EU’s goal has been to tee up a package of sanctions in co-ordination with the US, UK and others to be ready well ahead of any action by Russia, in contrast to 2014 when the west was caught off-guard by Putin’s move on Crimea.Chollet said the advanced state of sanctions planning meant the situation was “night and day” compared with 2014, when it took months for the west to settle on sectoral sanctions following Putin’s annexation of Crimea.“Putin should not question in any way the credibility of what the US and the Europeans have said about this,” he said.The European Commission has been consulting with EU capitals to gauge their views over differing sanctions options, while keeping the full details of its plans private — in contrast to the US which has been more public about its intentions.Any sanctions package would need to be agreed in detail and unanimously signed off by all 27 EU member states, most likely after an emergency summit of leaders.Italy’s ambassador to the EU warned of the economic impact of sanctions on Italian businesses, during a private meeting of diplomats last week, according to multiple people familiar with the discussion. The ambassador supported the EU-US work on the sanctions package while stressing the costs needed to be evenly shared between member states.Brussels is determined to minimise the extent to which member states negotiate carve-outs from the sanctions package in order to dull the impact on industries with big exposure to Russia.Nevertheless, diplomats expect unity to hold. “The response would be a quick and good one; we have never seen this kind of unity and appetite to act,” said one.Chollet insisted the “door to diplomacy is open” but warned the deployment of Russian troops in Belarus was worrying because it “suggests optionality in terms of what they may be thinking of doing in Ukraine”. The Russian naval presence in the Black Sea was similarly “very concerning”, he said.“They are in the window where they could do anything,” he said.However, he added that the “perverse reality” was that Putin’s moves had only strengthened Nato. “They have meant more military capability along the eastern flank. They have brought Ukraine closer to the EU and the United States. And they have strengthened the transatlantic bond. That is the reality we are dealing with today.”
394  Britain’s new “Brexit opportunities minister” is crowdsourcing ideas for possible wins. True, arcane insurance regulations seem unlikely to feature on the public’s list of red tape gripes. But the repercussions of reforming Solvency II could well dwarf the impact of other proposals.Ministers are close to agreeing a deal with City watchdogs over reforms to the six-year-old rules, which determine how much capital insurers must hold. The case for reform is clear, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said on Thursday. A one-size-fits-all regime does not suit the idiosyncrasies of individual markets.The two sides do have some overlap. Both insurers and regulators agree that the risk margin — aimed at ensuring liabilities are transferable to another insurer if required — is too large and too volatile.The bigger, and more controversial, reform concerns the “matching adjustment”. This allows writers of long-term business such as annuities to match predictable cash flows from assets against their liabilities. Reforming that accounts for nearly two-thirds of the £95bn of capital that the Association of British Insurers reckons could be freed up by Solvency II reform.Understandably the insurance industry would like to see a lot more assets qualify for this treatment. It says reform will support transition to a net-zero economy and the government’s levelling-up agenda. Moreover, it notes that Brussels has proposed its own reforms of Solvency II, designed to create a short-term €90bn capital boost for Europe’s insurers. Unless the UK embraces ambitious reform (to compete), there will be a “Brexit penalty”, not a Brexit dividend, insurers moan.Regulators may put a brake on lawmakers’ ambition in the EU. As in the UK, officials are cautious about weakening policyholder protections to benefit shareholders. Yet in both cases, there is room for manoeuvre. Enough prudence is already built into the capital regime to allow insurers more investment flexibility. If done sensibly, reform could yield long-term benefits for the sector and economy alike.
395  Europe’s financial regulators are warning the region’s housing market has “decoupled” from the rest of the economy since the pandemic hit, increasing risks for banks due to soaring property prices, loosening lending standards and rising household debt levels.The European Systemic Risk Board, the authority responsible for monitoring and preventing dangers to the European financial system, signalled its concern on Friday by calling on seven of the 30 countries it oversees to take action to curb the risks created by surging house prices.Fuelled by low interest rates, residential property prices in the EU rose 9.2 per cent in the year to September 2021 — the fastest growth since just before the 2008 financial crisis and well ahead of growth in both European wages and gross domestic product.Yet when the pandemic began in 2020, most European financial regulators removed measures designed to increase banks’ resilience to a potential correction in housing markets by building up extra capital in good times so they can absorb losses in a crisis.As the European Central Bank prepares to tighten monetary policy in response to multi-decade high levels of inflation, borrowing costs are set to rise for housebuyers, which could depress prices and make it harder for some households to keep up with payments on variable-rate mortgages.On Friday, the ESRB called on Germany and Austria to introduce more safeguards — such as capping borrowers’ debt at a set multiple of their income and forcing lenders to have more capital. It also warned Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Slovakia and Liechtenstein about increasing housing market risks.The “key vulnerabilities” it identified included “rapid house price growth and possible overvaluation of residential real estate, the level and dynamics of household indebtedness, the growth of housing credit and signs of a loosening of lending standards”. Decisions by the ESRB, chaired by ECB president Christine Lagarde, are not binding. It can only issue warnings and recommendations to countries about the need to act over housing market risks, as it has done since 2016.EU households increased their debt as a proportion of incomes to 107.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2021, up from 101.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2019.The ESRB said housing market risks were also elevated in Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark and Luxembourg — where household debt levels were the highest — exceeding 180 per cent of income in all five countries. But it issued recommendations to four of those countries in 2019 and thinks Norway has taken sufficient measures already.Both Germany and Austria have already received the ESRB findings and responded with plans to introduce some of the measures it recommended. German banks will need to have €22bn of extra capital buffers by next year based on the size of their domestic assets and their residential mortgage exposure — though most already meet the requirements.Austrian authorities plan to introduce legally binding rules limiting the mortgages people can borrow in relation to their income and the value of a property as well as how long they have to pay it back, after many banks ignored non-binding “sustainable lending standards”.Neither country went as far as recommended by the ESRB. Germany did not introduce limits on mortgage lending, while Austria decided against requiring banks to build up extra capital, known as a countercyclical buffer.Claudia Buch, vice-president of Germany’s central bank, told the Financial Times last month that if the country’s banks did not “think twice” about the recent trend for some to provide mortgages for the entire value of a property with little or no deposit, they could face legally binding limits on how much they can lend against a property.
396  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
397  Russia’s central bank has raised its key interest rate by 100 basis points to a five-year high of 9.5 per cent and said it was leaving scope for further increases in the short term as geopolitical risks and a tight labour market put pressure on inflation.“Inflation is far above the Bank of Russia October forecast,” the bank said on Friday.Elvira Nabiullina, the bank’s governor, said at a press conference that there had been no “U-turn” to allow the bank to see a sustained inflation slowdown. “We expect such a slowdown by the end of the first quarter [or in] the second quarter. But we will not be able to call it a trend until later.”The bank’s decision to raise rates for the eighth time since last March comes against a backdrop of growing tension between the west and Russia over Ukraine. The US and its allies have threatened sanctions against Russia, which has amassed troops at the border with its southwestern neighbour, in case of an escalation of threats towards Kyiv.Nabiullina noted “increased geopolitical risks” and said other external factors included a continued rise in prices of energy and other commodities including food.The bank also said rapid economic growth and labour shortages were increasing inflationary pressures.“If we do not take steps to return [the economy] to balanced growth, its overheating will strengthen and will lead to uncontrolled inflation acceleration and a subsequent economic growth slowdown,” Nabiullina said.Russia’s gross domestic product is expected to grow between 2 per cent and 3 per cent this year, and a further 1.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent next year.Russia’s central bank has been one of the world’s most aggressive in raising rates to try to curb inflation, which is stoking mounting concern for monetary policy worldwide.The bank allowed for a potential further rate increase at its next meeting, scheduled for March 18.Its policy aim remains to return inflation to 4 per cent next year. This year, the bank forecasts annual inflation of 5 per cent to 6 per cent. In January inflation hit 8.7 per cent, and rose further in early February, it said.Russia’s central bank was “far closer to completing the rate hike cycle than most regulators in the world”, said Konstantin Svyatny, chief portfolio manager at Aton brokerage.The rouble traded at about 75 to the dollar on Friday, having strengthened from close to 80/$ since late January, when Ukraine tensions hit the market.Analysts at BCS Global Markets said the latest rate increase was priced in and should not have an impact on the rouble.The central bank “seems to be inclined to keep the rate relatively high for longer, as some advanced economies have already entered the rate hike cycle, which implies a weakening of emerging market currencies, including the rouble”, the analysts said.
398  Don’t mention the word “Finlandisation” to a Finn.I learnt this the hard way shortly after Russia had annexed Crimea in 2014, when I (with tongue planted firmly in cheek) suggested on social media that a meeting of Finland’s prime minister Alex Stubb and Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko was a sign of the creeping Finlandisation of Ukraine. That triggered a mini Twitter firestorm from Finnish colleagues and a bilateral tongue-lashing from Stubb himself when I ran into him at an EU summit.Finlandisation is back on the lips of diplomats after France’s Emmanuel Macron, on a flight back from Moscow, suggested to reporters that the Finlandisation of Ukraine was one of the models he discussed with Vladimir Putin to convince the Russian president to end his brinkmanship along the Ukrainian border.Macron has since backed away from that idea. However, I decided to give Stubb a call to revisit our dust-up because the tempest-in-a-teapot over the French president’s remarks is a warning sign that, for all the talk of Nato unity over Putin’s aggression, there are dangerous signs of allied divergence over how best to end the stand-off. And Finlandisation is a useful window into those alliance cracks.For most non-Finns, Finlandisation has lost most of its pejorative baggage, becoming shorthand for how a small country (Finland) manages to fend off an overweening superpower next door (the Soviet Union) through a mix of military neutrality and diplomatic jujutsu, without giving up its national identity or political values. It was that version, stripped of its derogatory connotations, that I had been referring to back in 2014.Stubb’s annoyance is rooted in the term’s origins in German foreign policy circles, where Stubb (and other Finns) believe it was tarred by two mistaken assumptions: first, that Finland’s postwar neutrality (it never joined Nato) meant it somehow gave up its western orientation. And, perhaps more importantly, that Finland’s postwar foreign policy was imposed upon it by outside powers rather than decided by Helsinki’s leaders.Stubb, who has long been an advocate for Finnish membership of Nato, argued that while Helsinki never joined the transatlantic military alliance, it also never ruled it out — which kept the Soviets at bay. “What Finland did very well is to flag the Nato option,” he said from Florence, where he is setting up a school of transnational governance at the European University Institute.Stubb is reluctant to offer any Finnish advice to Ukrainian leaders, insisting that the comparison between the two countries is not only flawed, but harks back to cold war-era rhetoric that only exacerbates an already tense situation. “There’s a lot of ‘big power politics’ in the air right now,” Stubb said derisively. “A lot of foreign policy analysts are trying to describe the current situation with old cold war concepts — and, to a certain extent, that’s what Putin wants.”But at the risk of provoking Stubb yet again, I’m going to take a stab at it anyway. And here’s why: the things that Finns object to about the concept of Finlandisation — the failure to recognise Finland’s long-term western orientation, and the failure to acknowledge Helsinki had agency during the Soviet period — are at risk of being repeated in Ukraine.Ukraine, like Finland, has made its choice: its future is with the west. This was the case even before the Maidan revolution, when successive Ukrainian governments attempted to negotiate association agreements with the EU and align more closely with Nato. When a Russian-backed president reversed tack, Ukrainian citizens took to the streets and overthrew him. It is sad that this needs repeating, but any suggestion that the current stand-off could be resolved by pushing Ukraine into a nebulous unaligned status is a betrayal of Ukraine’s sovereign choice.Similarly, Ukraine, like cold war-era Finland, has agency. The sight of one of Europe’s most prominent leaders beating a path to the Kremlin’s door gives the appearance that the future of Ukraine will be decided without Ukrainian input. This violates the basic principle of international law and undermines the foundations upon which the modern international system is built. It’s also worth noting that every post-Soviet security agreement signed by the Kremlin with the west has acknowledged Ukraine as an independent actor. Even if Putin wants to renege on this, Nato leaders must not.To its credit, the Biden administration has held true to both principles: it has insisted that the Ukrainian government participate in all talks on a resolution and that its choice of joining European and transatlantic security organisations — if it continues to pursue that path — be respected. But Macron’s language and actions risk creating the kind of daylight between allies that will benefit Putin and betray Kyiv. If that’s the kind of Finlandisation the Finns object to, then I’m in full agreement.My question for you, Rana, is whether I’m overreacting. We’ve been through “Mars and Venus” periods in US-European relations within very recent memory, and maybe I’m just suffering a bit of PTSD from those spats. Nobody wants a war, but a hot conflict would have far more of an impact on Europe’s economy and security than on America’s. Should we worry that the White House could end up losing European allies, who may be more willing to compromise for peace, the longer this Ukraine crisis persists? Or do you agree with those who believe Putin, if nothing else, has given Nato the gift of relevance again?Edward Luce is on book leave and will return in mid-March.Peter, welcome back to the Swamp! I hope you brought your Wellies.The part of the Finlandisation story that most interests me is the question of how small countries will survive and thrive in a new era of Great Power politics. It’s not only Ukraine, but countries from Taiwan to the United Kingdom that are grappling with this issue. If you are outside the core of one of the three main geopolitical poles — the US, the EU and China — the future feels uncertain. In Europe, it’s particularly so, since the continent is being pulled between the China-Russia axis and the US (not only in economic terms, but now, in security).To answer one of your direct questions, I don’t think that transatlantic relations are going to reset to the 90s, nor should they. I think we are heading towards a tri-polar world in which the US, Europe and China will make some fundamentally different decisions about the balance of power between companies and the state, surveillance capitalism and civil rights, efficiency and resiliency, and so on. You can see the tri-polar world developing most clearly in the regionalisation of chip production, for example. But I am hopeful that Europe is starting to realise that it has more to gain from strengthening its long-term partnership with the US than in cutting quick and easy trade deals with China (witness the freeze on that last year), or in letting Russia control gas supply to the continent (Nord Stream 2 is one of Germany’s more cynical and ill-advised economic decisions in recent years). The Ukraine situation certainly brings to the fore the flaws in Europe’s security and economic positions. I’m not crazy about the way in which Macron has tried to play both sides of the fence with Nato and Russia. But I can see the logic in the “Finlandisation” of Ukraine argument, given that there is an internal divide between loyalty to and identification with Russia versus the west. I don’t think that such an arrangement will become official, but my best guess is that as you lay out, all sides will eventually realise that a hot conflict is just too devastating (indeed, it has the potential to become Europe’s Vietnam, in which Russia would suffer most — and Putin knows this).My bet: Ukraine won’t join Nato but it and other countries will still be allowed to apply as a sort of diplomatic posture, and things will go back to the way they’ve been for the past several years.Not great, but not terrible. Still, to me, Ukraine is a harbinger of more big regional battles, in which existing poles of power are reorganised. As when icebergs break apart, there will be splinters of border nations up for grabs. We have clearly entered what the historian Arthur Schlesinger would have called “a crisis of the old order.” The new one has yet to be built.And now a word from our Swampians.In response to ‘When will the music stop?’: “You are right that holders of reserve status should think over a longer term, but boy would that require patience across presidencies! And when regulatory agencies act as though indifferent to political changes, they get howled at to excess. Of course, the Chinese model is a counterpoint to short-termism but has nothing else to recommend for itself (nor do I think Rana suggests as much). How do we then deal effectively with the yo-yo nature of a democratic republic? Probably by picking better political leaders and having more skilled people in politics generally.” — J. Sterling, Levels, West Virginia“We are surely too late for a new Paul Volcker at the Federal Reserve. And politics is not going to embrace a Volcker-as-president without an almighty economic shock which will make the great financial crisis look like the overture to the tragic opera proper. The odds of avoiding that shock are low. Central banks have been joyfully topping up the punch bowl as capitalism supped, not removing it. Can we get some of Ed’s helpful policy suggestions into law? I’m not that hopeful, until central banks make it clear to governments that politics is risk management writ large. And that central banks deal with financial risks, only. The societal ones are down to government to manage.” — Mike Clark, Oxfordshire
399  The star of Russia’s women’s figure skating team has tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug, Beijing Winter Olympics officials disclosed on Friday, upending one of the leading competitions at the games and implicating Moscow in another high-profile sports cheating scandal.Kamila Valieva, 15, who this week became the first woman to land a quadruple jump in Olympic competition, tested positive for the banned heart medicine trimetazidine in a sample collected in December, according to the International Testing Agency, the anti-doping watchdog.Trimetazidine improves blood flow and is used to treat heart conditions. But it can also be used by athletes to train harder, enabling their bodies to recover more quickly by sending more oxygen to sore muscles.The positive test and Valieva’s deferred suspension from competition constituted the most significant sporting scandal at the Beijing Games that began last Friday. It drew a sharp defence from Moscow and requests by the US for “accountability”, underscoring the charged political nature of the Olympics.Valieva’s positive test came from a sample taken in St Petersburg on December 25 under the jurisdiction of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada), processed by a World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) laboratory.The appeals process has pitted Rusada against the International Olympic Committee, centring on whether Valieva will be allowed to compete in the individual event that begins on Tuesday. Her quadruple jump helped the Russians win the team figure skating event, although the medal ceremony has since been delayed indefinitely.According to the Russian Olympic Committee, Valieva appealed and was granted a reprieve from a provisional suspension from her positive test. The ITA, on behalf of the IOC, said it would appeal against the Russian decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which handles international legal matters for athletic events.Stanislav Pozdnyakov, head of the ROC, said Moscow suspected Wada had deliberately delayed processing Valieva’s test until after the team event at the Beijing Games was over.Her other doping tests before and after the December competition were all negative, the ROC said, adding it was “taking comprehensive measures to protect the rights and interests of the ROC Team members and to keep the Olympic gold medal won in fair competition”.The row over her result exacerbates an ongoing rift between the Russians and the IOC, which since 2017 has officially banned the nation from competing at the Olympics due to Russia’s state-run doping programme at the 2014 Sochi Winter Games.But athletes declared to be “clean” have been allowed to compete under the ROC moniker, swapping national symbols such as the Russian flag and anthem for Olympic insignia and a passage from a Tchaikovsky concerto.The Valieva case renewed questions about the efficacy of the sanctions programme. Mark Adams, IOC spokesperson, said the organisation took “tough but appropriate action” against Russia when asked if the measures were sufficient while stressing that the Olympics movement had a mandate to remain “politically neutral”.The Games have been a focal point of wider geopolitical tensions. Western countries including the US and UK have staged a diplomatic boycott over Beijing’s human rights abuses in Xinjiang, where it has interned more than 1mn Muslim Uyghurs.China’s President Xi Jinping has used the occasion to signal his strengthening ties with Vladimir Putin, his Russian counterpart, as Moscow is engaged in a diplomatic stand-off with the west over Ukraine.Valieva, meanwhile, is the brightest star in a deep field of Russian teenage figure skating talent.Led by coach Eteri Tutberidze, who has trained many of the sport’s champions over the past decade and ushered in the era of quadruple jumps in women’s skating, the Russian programme is both renowned and controversial for performing physically demanding jumps years before their international peers. Two teenage Tutberidze protégés won gold and silver for ROC in the women’s individual figure skating event at the 2018 Olympics. In Beijing, each of the three Russian entries in the women’s figure skating event are teenagers coached by Tutberidze: Valieva, reigning world champion Anna Shcherbakova, and world bronze medallist Alexandra Trusova. Asked about the Valieva case by Russian outlet Sport24, Tutberidze replied: “I don’t do rumours”.Speaking to reporters on Friday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called Valieva’s positive test a “misunderstanding” and said: “We say, ‘Kamila, don’t hide your face. You are Russian! Go everywhere with pride, and most importantly — beat everyone’.”A spokesperson for the US Olympic Committee, who finished second in the event behind Russia, said: “This is about more than medals at this point. This is about protecting the sanctity of fair and clean sport, the integrity of our Olympic values and the accountability of the movement overall.”Additional reporting by Thomas Hale in Beijing, Nastassia Astrasheuskaya in Moscow and William Langley in Hong Kong
400  Surging oil prices and the global economic recovery propelled Rosneft, Russia’s leading oil producer, to record profits last year, offsetting cuts in production because of Opec+ restrictions.Like other oil producers around the world, the company benefited from recovering demand in 2021 after the Covid-19 pandemic hit consumption in 2020.Rosneft, which accounts for about 40 per cent of Russia’s total crude oil output, said its net profit increased nearly seven-fold year on year in rouble terms to Rbs883bn and nearly six fold-in dollar terms to $11.9bn.“Against the background of the recovery of the global economy, the company achieved new financial records in 2021,” chief executive Igor Sechin said in a statement, adding that production costs hit the lowest level in five years, down 3.6 per cent to $2.7 per barrel of oil equivalent.Rosneft was helped by increases of 60-70 per cent in the price of the main crude blends that it exports, and by a weakening of the rouble. The company’s costs are paid in roubles, while revenues from exports are in dollars.The company’s record profit came in spite of a drop in oil production last year because of countrywide production restrictions under the Opec+ agreements. Rosneft’s production of crude and condensate fell 6 per cent year on year to 3.9mn barrels per day.Analysts expect production to recover this year.“We anticipate the company will easily lead all of its Russian peers in oil production growth,” said Ron Smith, senior oil and gas analyst at BCS Global Markets. He expects Rosneft’s production to rise 9 per cent in 2022, against a 5 per cent increase for the company as a whole.Analysts at Aton expect the Vostok oil project to bolster Rosneft’s production for the rest of the decade.Rosneft’s gas output rose 3 per cent year on year to nearly 65bn cubic metres last year. The company is Russia’s second-largest gas producer, and has been seeking the right to break Gazprom’s monopoly on exports via pipelines. Rosneft is awaiting the government’s decision to supply 10bn cubic metres of gas via the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Europe.
401  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.Google’s run-ins with European competition authorities are far from over. Its lucrative adtech business is now the focus of a new complaint by major media publishers, lodged today with the European Commission. We’ll look at what the publishers’ grievances are and why the adtech sector is the subject of increased regulatory attention.Russia began massive military exercises in Belarus and naval drills in the Black Sea yesterday and there was little progress to report on the diplomatic front after a UK-Russia meeting in Moscow described as “a dialogue of a mute person with a deaf person”.Meanwhile, EU diplomats told Europe Express that the commission is keeping a tight lid on the sanctions package, with Austria, Hungary and Italy so far raising the most issues with their industries being affected by the sanctions. To avoid these fissures on the united EU front turning into major crevasses, Brussels plans to keep the text to itself and only show it to capitals in case of a Russian invasion, with a very short deadline to approve the sanctions.Speaking of diplomatic contacts, Nato hosted the UK prime minister and his political rival yesterday, separately, in a rare sequence of events. We’ll bring you up to speed with why the two made an appearance in Brussels but avoided the EU quarter — and what to expect from today’s meeting in London between the EU Brexit commissioner and the British foreign secretary.Google is again the subject of an EU competition complaint, this time concerning alleged abuses in the advertising technology sector, writes Javier Espinoza in Brussels.The European Publishers Council, a body that comprises leading press publishers including The New York Times, Germany’s Axel Springer, the UK’s Guardian and the Daily Mail, has today filed a complaint with the European Commission, asking it to hold Google “accountable for its anti-competitive conduct and impose remedies to restore conditions of effective competition in the adtech value chain”.Google has denied wrongdoing in its adtech business. “When publishers choose to use our advertising services, they keep the majority of revenue and every year we pay out billions of dollars directly to the publishing partners in our ad network,” said a Google spokesperson.In essence, argues the EPC’s Angela Mills-Wade, Google has a conflict of interest in the space because as a “super manager” it acts as a buyer, seller and intermediary in adtech.The plaintiffs’ lawyer, Damien Geradin, added: “It is as if Goldman Sachs were on the side of the buyer, the seller and also ran the exchange.”Since its acquisition of DoubleClick in 2008, Google has embarked on “a barrage of unlawful tactics to foreclose competition in adtech”, the news publishers have told regulators in Brussels. “This strategy paid off, and Google has achieved end-to-end control of the adtech value chain, boasting market shares as high as 90-100 per cent in segments of the adtech chain.”The complaint is part of a wider probe led by Brussels into whether Google is abusing its monopoly in online ads.The adtech sector is also subject to further regulatory efforts under the Digital Services Act, with the European parliament pushing for stricter limits on what companies can do as part of targeted advertising.And under the Digital Markets Act, online platforms (including Google) deemed large enough to act as market arbiters — or gatekeepers — will in future face limitations on promoting their own services and products to the detriment of smaller rivals.Some worry Google is taking advantage of the “regulatory vacuum” as the bloc puts the final touches to DSA and DMA, which are unlikely to enter into force before the end of this year.Google is feeling the heat elsewhere too.

(More here)Britain’s national psychodrama moved to the Belgium’s capital yesterday with both the prime minister and the leader of the opposition in town to meet Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg, writes Andy Bounds in Brussels.First in: Boris Johnson, who arrived in the morning to make clear his support for the alliance’s stance against Russia. The UK is making ready another 1,000 troops to assist with any refugee crisis if Moscow escalates with a full invasion of Ukraine.The prime minister was followed by Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour opposition. Labour sources claim Starmer booked first, and when Downing Street was notified out of courtesy, Johnson demanded an audience before him.Nato would only say that it was a scheduled meeting with the UK’s prime minister.It is rare for Stoltenberg to meet opposition leaders but he is a fellow centre-left politician (from Norway). Starmer wants to show the party has changed since the departure of his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn, who earlier in his career opposed Nato membership and remained lukewarm about the US alliance.However, he remains just as lukewarm towards the EU. Neither Johnson nor Starmer found time to visit the European Commission across town from Nato HQ. Labour is anxious not to be painted as pro-Brussels while a dispute continues over Northern Ireland.There is yet another round of talks today between Liz Truss, UK foreign secretary, and Maros Sefcovic, the Brexit commissioner, over the Northern Ireland protocol, which regulates trade between Great Britain and the region.Truss stressed that fixing it was an “absolute priority for me”, but EU diplomats say she has yet to make the compromises they need to do so. Today could be the last chance to do so before an election campaign in Northern Ireland from March forces a pause.Brussels has suggested a meeting of the Joint Committee on February 21, a body consisting of the UK and member states that is required to agree any changes to the protocol.The best officials are hoping for is a joint statement to keep working and endorsement of EU plans to keep British medicines flowing to Northern Ireland. But with Truss promising bold new proposals they do not underestimate London’s ability to spring a surprise.
402  Outside Odesa’s trade union house, scene of a fire in 2014 that left 42 pro-Russian protesters dead, a makeshift shrine of crosses, candles and flowers commemorates the victims, along with a stark message fixed to a fence: “We’ll never forget, and never forgive”.Graffiti etched on a nearby flagpole is more ominous: “Ukraine — you’re gonna get so fucked up soon” and “your days are numbered”.2014 was the last time communal tensions erupted into violence in Odesa, a port city on the Ukrainian Black Sea coast with a large ethnic Russian population. But with a Russian attack on Ukraine feared to be imminent, it might not be the last. “Odesa is cloven in two,” said Boris Khersonsky, a well-known local psychiatrist and intellectual.Its divisions make it uniquely exposed in the current crisis. Many residents worry Odesa could become a key target for Vladimir Putin’s forces if war breaks out — and that parts of the population might even welcome a Russian invasion.“Odesa is crucial to anyone who dreams of rebuilding the Russian empire,” said Oleksiy Goncharenko, a local MP. It has, he said, the same hold on the Russian imagination as Sevastopol, the Crimean naval redoubt that Moscow annexed in 2014. “That’s why the danger we face here is so great.” This week has seen a frenetic diplomatic offensive aimed at ending the stand-off over Ukraine, one of the worst east-west showdowns since the cold war ended. After talks between Putin and French president Emmanuel Macron in the Kremlin, there was even tentative talk of de-escalation. But in Odesa, tensions have, if anything, increased.Many people in the city feel encircled. To the north-west there are Russian peacekeepers hunkered down in the separatist Moldovan enclave of Transnistria. To the south-east is Crimea, bristling with Russian arms. And to the south is the Russian Black Sea fleet, recently reinforced by six landing ships that have just passed through the Bosphorus Strait, ostensibly to take part in naval drills.“Odesa is highly vulnerable,” said Volodymyr Dubovyk, director of the centre for international studies at the city’s main university. “The fear is that it could be targeted in an amphibious assault, possibly combined with paratrooper landings. It’s geographically very easy to invade.” Even if there is no invasion, locals fear Russia could be planning something less spectacular but similarly damaging — a naval blockade which would throttle maritime trade and cut off one of Ukraine’s key export routes.Either way, the big unknown is how Odesans would react if Russian forces attacked. “There are definitely a lot of people here who would welcome them,” said Khersonsky.That is a consequence of the city’s unusual demographics: it contains many more ethnic Russians than most other Ukrainian towns. “They look more to Moscow than to Kyiv,” he said. “If Odesa is a country, its capital is Moscow.”Moscow, too, looks to Odesa. Long revered as the birthplace of some of Russia’s greatest comedians, actors and writers, its peculiar brand of folklore and special humour enjoyed cult status in the Soviet Union. With its mix of roguish charm, faded glamour and its whiff of criminality — think a Black Sea Brighton Rock — it was always a world of its own.But in 2014 the city’s easy-going, peaceful reputation was shattered. That was the year Moscow annexed Crimea and a separatist revolt broke out in Donetsk and Luhansk, in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region. The violence then spread to Odesa where, on May 2, pro-Kyiv and pro-Moscow mobs fought vicious street battles.Then, later that day, the trade union house in its city centre was set on fire and dozens of pro-Russian protesters who had retreated there died, some from smoke inhalation, some after leaping from windows.To some Odesans it was the moment they stopped their city becoming another Donetsk. But to others it was a massacre. “It became a rallying cry for Russians fighting against what they called ‘Ukrainian Nazis’,” Dubovyk said.Alexander Prigarin, an ethnologist at Odesa national university, said that as Russian forces took control of Crimea, there were many in the city who wished their city would be next. “A lot of small businessmen hoped Putin would come here and impose order.People envied Crimea,” he said.Since 2014, he claimed, things have got worse. He cited recent laws that aim to promote the primacy of the Ukrainian language and restrict the use of Russian in public settings. One, which came into force last month, compels all national print media to publish in Ukrainian. “You can’t impose a language on people,” Prigarin said.Odesa itself offers little evidence that Russians and their language are persecuted. It openly celebrates its ties to Russian culture and history and has a statue of Catherine the Great, who incorporated swaths of present-day Ukraine into the Russian empire, on one of its central squares. Russian is still the dominant language, though Ukrainian is making inroads.But the media law has provided an opening for Kremlin propagandists to portray Ukraine’s government as “ethno-fascists” who victimise Russian-speakers. “It gave Putin a pretext to say he’s defending the rights of Russians,” said Khersonsky.Others see things differently. Igor Yakobchuk, Odesa representative of Asnova Holding, a Ukrainian logistics company, said residents had become more loyal to Ukraine over the past eight years. “Before, people used to idealise the Russian world,” he said. “But after 2014, they came to their senses. They saw what happened in Donetsk and Luhansk, how bandits took power, and they were shocked.”Though people in the city think a full-scale Russian assault is unlikely, they fear the return of clashes and ethnic tensions. There is anxious talk of “provocations” by Russian operatives, street violence and terror attacks.“Putin is former KGB — he thinks more in terms of ‘special operations’ than invasions,” said the MP Goncharenko. “He could easily try to turn Odesa into a new Donbas.”Additional reporting by Roman Olearchyk in KyivLetters in response to this article:Odesans looked on Putin as a tiresome drunk / From Anna Reid, Trustee, Ukrainian Institute London, London W6, UKIt’s urgent that Unesco lists Odesa’s opera house / From Sam Dunkley, London W8, UK
403  The writer is chief investment officer of emerging market debt at FIM PartnersThe warnings back in 2011-2013 were ominous: “If the Turkish lira breaks through 2 against the dollar, the economy will implode.” Once the 2 was reached, the new implosion target moved to 3, then to 5, and here we are at 13. The economy is still standing.An economy with debt in dollars as high as Turkey’s should seemingly have imploded a long time ago under such currency volatility. The history of emerging markets is littered with balance of payments crises under similar foreign exchange depreciations.There might be several reasons for this resilience. For one, up until earlier this year, the Turkish authorities did what they always had done in the past when confronted with capital outflows and currency weakness: interest rate hikes, if only belatedly and often in an obfuscated manner.This boom-and-bust way of managing the economy kept the system going for quite some time. That time is what gave economic actors the chance to build buffers against an unbalanced economy. Banks, for example, kept balance sheets largely hedged on currency.By virtue of a build-up of dollar deposits and a low level of foreign currency loans made relative to them, banks also had excess dollars. So they kept lending dollars to obtain cheap lira funding, creating in the process another safety mechanism for themselves.But it hasn’t been only banks which have built resilience over time. As dollarisation progressed, households have continued to accumulate dollar assets but no foreign exchange liabilities. This is because banks were forbidden to lend foreign currency to households, making them a lot more resilient to currency risk. This was perhaps the regulators’ greatest foresight.The creditor profile of the country has also changed over time. Fickle portfolio flows have greatly reduced. Foreigners used to own nearly 30 per cent of the local debt market but this number is now less than 5 per cent (a mere $3bn in absolute terms). Meanwhile locals now own almost 50 per cent of the country’s sovereign Eurobonds.This has left Turkey more dependent on different types of external creditor — the syndicated loan market, trade finance, intra-corporate lending, or domestic lenders. These creditors are more patient, more long-term oriented than foreign portfolio investors.The passing of time has also allowed Turkish corporates, the weakest link in the country’s external balance sheet chain, to reduce debt levels somewhat while building a positive net short-term foreign exchange position.The problem, however, remains one of co-ordination. While on paper each economic sector has enough liquidity buffers of its own, they are all “joined at the hip”. One sector drawing on its foreign exchange assets has a ripple effect on the entire system, as those assets will be residing in someone else’s balance sheet.Against that, the country is tentatively turning its persistent current account deficit into a surplus by virtue of the very large lira depreciation which boosts exports and contracts imports. Whether this turn in the current account, if it materialises, is yet another boom-and-bust episode or a structural manifestation of a policy-driven rebalancing of the economy remains unclear.All in all, it’s been a surprisingly resilient journey, though longer than many of us would have anticipated. Turks also have suffered from high inflation and a squeeze in purchasing power in dollars. And the fact that Turkey hasn’t “broken” yet doesn’t mean it still can’t.There is clearly a before-and-after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s dismissal of orthodox central bank governor Naci Agbal in March 2021, and the economic-logic-defying interest rates cuts that followed. The old policy playbook of belated hikes has seemingly been abandoned for good.The foreign exchange equilibrium in the system remains too tenuous for the government to be confident an accident can be avoided.Meanwhile, any touting by Ankara of a “new economic model” based on high savings rates and a cheap currency must be evaluated against high and persistent inflation, and the acceptance by the government of a painful acceptance of a contraction in demand.Turkey was a very attractive destination for foreign lenders — a double-B rated, high-growth economy, with five per cent dollar yields, at a time the rest of the world was at zero. This context has changed for the worse. Whether the new creditors in town as well as the locals will take enough comfort from the existing economic set up remains an open question. But unless there is a change in policy direction, the government will be testing their limits.Letter in response to this article:Remember the family’s role in Turkey’s economy / From Onur Dalliag, Geneva, Switzerland
404  ESG investment could become more complicated for British savers with a growing risk of divergence between European and UK sustainability disclosure rules.While stronger standards for funds focused on environmental, social and governance goals (ESG) have been welcomed by many investment specialists, the industry has warned of increased confusion and high costs if the UK charts a sharply different course from Europe.UK regulators are drawing up proposals on the sustainability disclosure requirements set to pass at the end of the year, following new EU rules which came into effect in March last year.“A proliferation of differing sustainable finance disclosure frameworks by multiple jurisdictions carries the risk of adding to complexity, cost and confusion for investors,” said Johan Vanderlugt, sustainable finance specialist at Kempen Capital Management. “Challenges can arise when disclosure regulations differ too much, for example around interpretation, implementation and monitoring.”The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is currently drafting a labelling system for funds, to categorise their sustainable credentials. The proposed framework includes five labels, to be mapped out against the existing three European categories.The UK regulator acknowledges that many British firms have “already invested in systems and processes to classify [their] products” to comply with Europe’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR).Fragmented approaches could run the risk of not treating consumers fairly and consistently, says the Investment Association, a UK trade body, calling for “as little divergence as possible” in the scope of products covered.“There is a risk that the [proposed labels] could also prove too complex and difficult for consumers to understand,” it adds.The introduction of European sustainability disclosure rules helped drive global sustainable fund assets to almost $2.7tn at the end of the last quarter last year, according to data provider Morningstar. The region accounted for almost 80 per cent of global flows into sustainable funds in the same quarter.Nicolas Mackel, the chief executive of Luxembourg for Finance, a promotion agency, says that fragmented regimes would “increase costs” and, ultimately, investors’ fees.Despite the anticipated cost burden of divergence, some professional investors hope that building its own rule book will offer Britain a chance to improve on areas where EU rules fall short. “The FCA has the opportunity to learn,” says Mirza Baig, head of ESG at Aviva Investors, which holds £357bn under management.Critics of the European framework point to the breadth of some sustainability categories, which can be difficult to implement.Sacha Sadan, head of ESG at the FCA, said some local regulators were looking to add to the EU framework to make it more effective. Both the French and German regulators had published their own guidance.Some investors worry that the rigid fund classifications demanded by both EU and British regulators could discourage investment in so-called “brown” companies — such as steel groups — working to improve their ESG credentials, notably through slashing emissions.The UK legislation’s overarching goal is not “fully clear yet,” says the Investment Association. The trade body has called for “fewer, less rigid [labelling] categories”.Environmental advocates have urged the regulator not to be too lax, however. “The FCA must resist industry pressures seeking to water down its labelling system,” says David Barmes, a senior economist at the think-tank Positive Money.UK-based asset managers who market their funds on the continent or provide advisory services to European clients could find themselves caught by both regulatory regimes. The British rules, on the other hand, are only set to apply to financial firms authorised by the UK regulator, the FCA. For now, they are not set to apply to foreign funds marketing in the UK, although this hasn’t been ruled out later.
405  Liz Truss, UK foreign secretary, is to make new proposals to break the deadlock over post-Brexit trading arrangements in Northern Ireland on Friday, saying that resolving the row with the EU was “an absolute priority”.Truss’s allies said both sides wanted to bridge their differences, although Boris Johnson, the prime minister, warned this week that Britain could still unilaterally suspend parts of the so-called Northern Ireland protocol if no deal was reached.British ministers have been drawing up fresh contingency plans in recent weeks in the event that Johnson activates the Article 16 override mechanism, possibly plunging the UK into a trade war with the EU.The “carrot and stick” approach taken by Truss is intended to intensify the pace of the talks, which both sides want to wrap up, if possible, within weeks and ahead of Northern Ireland assembly elections on May 5.Speaking ahead of talks in London with European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic, Truss said: “We have a shared responsibility with the EU to work towards solutions as quickly as possible that deliver for the people of Northern Ireland.”Truss, who will host the talks at Lancaster House, wants to reset relations with the EU. Recently returned from Moscow, the foreign secretary has told colleagues she wants Europe to unite over the crisis in Ukraine, not descend into a trade dispute over Northern Ireland.While Johnson would win some cheers from Conservative Eurosceptics if he suspended parts of the NI protocol — part of the UK’s Brexit treaty — it would open up a range of unpredictable outcomes.Renewed “no deal” contingency planning by ministers, which stepped up in January, has looked at issues such as possible disruption of medical supplies in the event of an EU trade war, along with much broader economic disruption.Johnson, who is trying to stabilise his political situation after weeks of chaos, may also recoil from the idea of a trade dispute that could create turmoil at the ports and possible shortages of some products.Officials on both sides cautioned against expecting a breakthrough at Friday’s talks, but said there was a joint determination to create a positive atmosphere ahead of a February 21 meeting of the Joint Committee that manages the post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland.Under the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol, all goods going from Great Britain to the region must follow EU customs and health rules leading to the creation of an “Irish Sea border” that the UK government has declared unsustainable.A source with knowledge of the UK’s latest offer to the EU said that the ideas expanded upon the concept of “red and green channels”, in which goods that were clearly destined to remain inside Northern Ireland, would be exempted from border bureaucracy.One British official confirmed that both sides were putting new ideas on the table: “We are trying to be constructive and by definition in negotiations both sides are trying to move towards each other.”Despite the warmer tone from Truss, two senior Whitehall figures confirmed that the government had been actively “ramping up” contingency planning for the use of Article 16.In October 2021, when Lord David Frost was still the UK Brexit minister, the British government stepped back from the brink of triggering the safeguards mechanism after Brussels warned that it would lead to the suspension of the wider EU-UK trade agreement.However, Whitehall insiders said that since mid-January contingency planning for a suspension of the TCA had quietly restarted under the leadership of Steve Barclay, the Cabinet Office minister via the Domestic and Economic (Operations) cabinet committee.According to a person with knowledge of the plans, Barclay advised Johnson that in the event that it triggered Article 16 the government should consider rebuilding medicine stockpiles and prepare for disruption at the Channel ports of Dover and Folkestone as a result of further French retaliatory measures.“There is a big operation being run out of the Cabinet Office which has caused alarm in some parts of Whitehall,” one of the people said. “It all went quiet after October but really started to ramp up last month.”
406  The EU should allow its banks and fund managers to use UK clearing houses indefinitely, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said on Thursday, just weeks after the EU proposed extending temporary permissions by three-years.EU banks and fund managers have long used UK clearing houses but after Brexit Brussels baulked at being dependent on a non-EU country for the critical infrastructure that acts as an intermediary to prevent defaults on trades triggering a domino effect through markets.The EU initially set a deadline of June 2022 for its banks and fund managers to wean themselves off London’s clearing houses, but last month announced a three-year extension to the “equivalence” regime allowing EU financial services firms to clear their trades through the UK.However, Bailey told a dinner for lobby group The City UK that “there need be no time limit to this equivalence”. He pointed to the UK and EU’s “shared deep commitment to open markets and open financial systems with strong and appropriate regulatory standards and co-operation” that meant the UK regime could be equivalent to the EU’s indefinitely.The European Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“Pushing for permanent is a shrewd step,” said Simon Morris, a financial services partner with law firm CMS. “[The] EU remains reluctantly dependent on the City, overshadowed only by its fear that key infrastructure lies outside its oversight. If the Bank of England continues to show its credentials as a strong regulator there is every prospect of prolongation.”Last month, Mairead McGuinness, EU commissioner for financial services, said Brussels would begin consulting with member states on extending equivalence until 2025 to avoid “short-term cliff-edge effects” that could be triggered by the original deadline.Despite the commission’s ambition to bring clearing house activity within the bloc, its banks and fund managers have been slow to transfer their activities to EU clearing houses, which are much smaller than London’s.Moving European clearing to the EU would effectively split trading books in two, which is less efficient. Some companies also argue that European clearing houses do not have the same broad range of products as those available in London, and say the continent’s service levels and technology are inferior.Europe’s securities regulator, Esma, has supported the stance of banks and fund managers, ruling in December that the risks of moving business to the continent outweighed the benefits, since London clearing houses LCH and ICE Clear Europe were of “substantial systemic importance” to the EU.McGuinness has promised a public consultation on how to make the EU’s clearing infrastructure more attractive, something the commission hopes will lure Europe’s banks and fund managers away from London providers like LCH. The house still acts as a middleman for 90 per cent of the denominated derivatives market, handling deals valued at €91tn, according to data provider Osttra.Bailey said the BoE will “continue to work in strong co-operation with EU authorities to ensure risks in clearing houses are well managed, as we do with other authorities in other countries”.
407  Emmanuel Macron has outlined plans to build at least six new nuclear reactors in France in the coming decades, betting big on atomic power to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Speaking in Belfort, eastern France, about measures to meet net zero carbon emissions by 2050, the French president said that state-controlled utility EDF will build and operate the new reactors, which will be advanced versions of the European Pressurised Reactor. The cost is estimated at about €50bn, depending on financing conditions, according to EDF.In addition to building new reactors, Macron also said France would investigate ways to extend the 40-year lifecycle of existing ones to more than 50 years. France has 56 reactors in operation.“We need to pick up the mantle of France’s big nuclear adventure again,” Macron said.The investment plan strengthens France’s commitment to nuclear power, which now produces some 70 per cent of the country’s electricity and has been a symbol of its industrial prowess. It is a significant policy shift for the French president, who while a supporter of France’s atomic power industry, closed one ageing plant in 2020 and had promised to reduce the share of nuclear electricity in France’s energy mix.The state, which holds a 84 per cent stake in EDF, will provide financing for the projects as EDF is heavily indebted and facing cost overruns on new nuclear plants in France and Britain. Macron did not provide details but said “the state would act responsibly to ensure the financial stability” of state owned utility.Construction is scheduled to start in 2028 and the first new reactor would come online by 2035. Studies would be undertaken to consider a further eight reactors, the president said.The announcements come just two months before presidential elections, in a campaign that has been marked by higher energy prices and clashes between candidates over the pace at which France should roll out renewable energy investments.Europe’s last major nuclear power producer, France has so far been shielded from the worst of a fallout from soaring gas prices, adding to the sector’s appeal. Meanwhile Brussels recently stuck to plans to label nuclear energy as “green”, helping to make it more attractive to investors.Macron added that France would also need to develop renewable energy projects at a faster pace, in areas such as solar or wind power. But he said it was unrealistic for France to rely solely on renewables and would continue to need nuclear.On the renewable front, France will aim to increase its solar power capacity tenfold by 2050 and target building 50 offshore wind farms up from none now. Its first offshore wind project is due to go online this year.
408  Russia’s foreign minister has described a two-hour meeting in Moscow with his British counterpart as “disappointing” and “a dialogue of a mute person with a deaf person” as European countries continued to struggle in their diplomatic effort to prevent a Russian attack on Ukraine.Speaking to the press on Thursday, Sergei Lavrov said Liz Truss’s delegation had come “unprepared”, as he reiterated that the Russian military build-up around Ukraine posed no threat and that Moscow’s security demands in Europe had been ignored. Meanwhile, Truss demanded that Russia withdraw the more than 100,000 troops massed on the border with Ukraine.Truss’s trip — which included a visit to Red Square clad in a fur hat despite the unseasonably warm weather in an apparent attempt to channel images of Margaret Thatcher on a Moscow tour — was the first by a UK foreign secretary to Russia in more than four years.But Lavrov openly questioned whether there had been a point in holding the meeting. “I am disappointed that our conversation was the dialogue of a mute person with a deaf person,” Lavrov said. “We appear to listen to each other, but we do not hear each other.”Truss said: “I certainly wasn’t mute in our discussions earlier. I put forward the UK’s point of view on the current situation as well as seeking to deter Russia from an invasion of Ukraine.”She disputed Moscow’s argument that Nato’s eastward expansion in the past two decades posed a threat to Russia. “No one is undermining Russia’s security. That is simply not true,” Truss said.She instead pointed to the threat to Ukraine posed by Russia, which annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014, fuelled a proxy war in the country’s far eastern Donbas region and has massed troops and military equipment along Ukraine’s eastern flank. The tone of the comments contrasted with talks held on Monday in Moscow between presidents Vladimir Putin of Russia and Emmanuel Macron of France that opened with an amicable exchange and lasted more than five hours.British diplomats had said on Wednesday that Truss would seek to project a harder line with Russia, focusing more on deterrence than other European partners including France by insisting on the economic consequences of another invasion of Ukraine.“Minister Lavrov has said to me today that Russia has no plans to invade Ukraine, but we need to see those words followed up by actions,” Truss said on Thursday. “We need to see the troops and the equipment that is stationed on the Ukrainian border moved elsewhere.”Lavrov said western concerns about the military build-up, the largest in Europe in decades, were “incomprehensible anxieties”.His “detailed explanations” had “bounced off unprepared ground”, he went on. “It’s been a long time since I was in diplomatic negotiations that could have been held live on TV, because we didn’t hear anything secret or confidential beyond the usual grandstanding from London,” he added.Russian newspaper Kommersant reported that during the meeting, when Lavrov asked ironically whether Truss recognised his country’s sovereignty over Rostov and Voronezh, two Russian provinces near Ukraine where troops are currently stationed, Truss replied: “The UK will never recognise Russia’s sovereignty over those regions” — before being corrected by UK ambassador to Moscow Deborah Bronnert.Confirming the anecdote, Truss later said it had been a misunderstanding. “There was a point in the meeting where I thought he was talking about a part of Ukraine. But I am very clear that [the area] is a sovereign part of Russia,” she told Russian news outlet RBC.One ally of Truss said the talks with Lavrov were “robust” but there was “clearly a healthy level of respect between the two”. Truss invited Lavrov to London for talks in the next few months.Russia’s ties with the UK sank to historic lows when the former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko died from poisoning with a rare polonium isotope in London in 2006.Though other western countries such as the US, France, and Germany have made periodic attempts at unfreezing relations with Russia, the atmosphere with the UK has soured further since the poisoning of another former spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury in 2018.The British government on Thursday passed legislation allowing it to impose sanctions on Russian businesses and individuals in sectors including chemicals, defence, extractives and financial services.
409  Denmark is in talks to allow US soldiers and military equipment on its soil, ending a decades-long policy that barred foreign troops from its territory as tensions in the Baltic Sea region increase after Russia’s military build-up near Ukraine.Social Democrat prime minister Mette Frederiksen said the negotiations with the US started a year ago and were not linked to more recent rising tensions.“We want a stronger US presence in Europe and in Denmark.The situation in and around Ukraine is a very clear emphasising of the fact that we cannot take our peace, our freedom, or our security for granted and underlines why it is important to work even more closely with the Americans,” Frederiksen told a press conference on Thursday.The discussions are not about the opening of a separate US base but about allowing American troops to train and conduct exercises with their Danish counterparts as well as increased naval co-operation, according to defence minister Morten Bodskov.Denmark, a founding member of Nato in 1949, has had a policy of not allowing foreign troops or nuclear weapons on its soil since the 1950s when, under pressure from the Soviet Union, it declined to let the US station any forces. The Nordic country has a separate agreement for the autonomous territory of Greenland, where the US air force has a base at Thule.Neighbouring countries such as Norway as well as the three Baltic countries have opened up to US troops on a rotational basis. The president of Lithuania, where the US has a battalion of about 500 troops, told the Financial Times last week that he wanted them to increase their numbers.The change in policy was hailed as “historic” in Denmark, but political parties were split on the wisdom of the move.“Thanks, but no thanks,” said Karsten Honge, member of the Socialist People’s party, which supports Frederiksen in parliament. “Nato countries are being played off against each other, and Denmark’s sovereignty is under pressure.”Sikandar Siddique, leader of the small leftwing Independent Greens, said Denmark’s relationship with the US had already brought the Nordic country into “an illegal war in Iraq and a hopeless mission in Afghanistan” and questioned why it would want to be closer to the “aggressive American foreign and defence policy”.The main opposition centre-right party, the Liberals, gave the government its full support, saying it backed a “stronger Atlantic co-operation and a stronger European co-operation”.The US state department said it welcomed the offer to negotiate a new bilateral agreement, adding that it “reflects our commitment to reaffirming and reinvigorating America’s alliances to meet common security challenges while protecting shared interest and values”.Tensions in northern Europe have risen in recent months as Russia has amassed more than 100,000 troops on its border with Ukraine as well as in neighbouring Belarus.In Sweden and Finland, the two Nordic countries not in Nato, public support for joining the military alliance has risen.
410  Russia began massive military exercises in Belarus and naval drills in the Black Sea on Thursday as the UK warned that the stand-off with Moscow over Ukraine faced its “most dangerous moment” in the next few days.An estimated 30,000 Russian troops, supported by tanks, aircraft and the advanced S-400 air defence system, are involved in the Allied Resolve exercises in Belarus near Ukraine’s border, which end on February 20.“This is probably the most dangerous moment, I would say, in the course of the next few days, in what is the biggest security crisis that Europe has faced in decades,” UK prime minister Boris Johnson told a news conference with Nato’s secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg in Brussels.Stoltenberg added: “The number of Russian forces is going up. The warning time for a possible attack is going down.”Russian president Vladimir Putin has repeatedly denied western accusations that Moscow is planning a full-blown invasion, potentially the first big operations in Ukraine since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and fuelled a proxy war in the Donbas border region.Russia said its forces — some of which have travelled from as far away as Siberia and the North Korean border — would return to their bases once the exercises finish, though the Kremlin did not specify a date.Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said western concern about the exercises was “incomprehensible” and blamed the US and Nato for escalating tensions by deploying troops to the alliance’s eastern flank.“Unlike the exercises Russia is holding on its territory, after which the troops return to their barracks, troops are heading far from UK, US, and Canadian territory to the Baltic states and the Black Sea,” Lavrov said, according to Interfax. “And those troops and deployments, as a rule, never return home.”Once the Russian forces leave Belarus, Lavrov added, the west “will raise lots of noise to show that it was [they] who got Russia to escalate, when actually it’ll just be a load of hot air”.Russia has also sent six large landing ships, which can each carry about 20 tanks, into the Black Sea.Ukraine’s foreign ministry criticised the Russian naval drills, saying they made navigation through Black Sea shipping lanes “virtually impossible”.Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraine’s defence minister, described the Russian movements as “a tactic of creeping occupation of the sea”.The US embassy in Kyiv wrote on Twitter that Russia’s “economic warfare against Ukraine” was continuing. “Under the pretext of military exercises, Russia restricts Ukraine’s maritime sovereignty, limits freedom of navigation in the Black Sea/Sea of Azov, and impedes maritime traffic essential to Ukraine’s economy,” it said.Ukraine has launched its own military drills, which will also last until February 20, and include Turkish-made drones and anti-tank weapons sent by the UK.Moscow has accused the US and Europe of trying to undermine Russia by drawing former Soviet satellite states into Nato and has demanded that Ukraine be excluded from the military alliance as part of a new European security arrangement.Western leaders have said Russia’s demands were unacceptable, but have attempted to find common ground on other issues such as arms control.By early next week, Russia will have enough forces massed on Ukraine’s border to launch a full-scale invasion, the security committee in the British parliament heard on Tuesday.Russia and Belarus have said the exercises were defensive and designed to protect their borders from aggression and attack.According to Reznikov, there are 120,000 Russian troops deployed on Ukraine’s borders, as well as in occupied Crimea and breakaway eastern regions. That figure reached 140,000 if aviation and marine units, some of which are in Belarus, were included.
411  The surge in energy prices is set to exert a “more protracted drag” than expected on the European economy this year and drive higher inflation, the European Commission said in its latest growth outlook.Growth this year would fall short of previous forecasts, the commission said. It predicted a 4 per cent expansion in the EU and eurozone for 2022, compared with its 4.3 per cent forecast last autumn. Output growth would ease to 2.8 per cent in the EU in 2023 and 2.7 per cent in the eurozone, it said.In forecasts published on Thursday, the commission said inflation was expected to surge to 3.9 per cent this year in the EU and 3.5 per cent in the eurozone — much higher than previously expected, before subsiding to less than 2 per cent in 2023.The predictions highlight the extent to which supply chain bottlenecks and rising energy prices, combined with the outbreak of the Omicron variant of coronavirus, are imposing a near-term drag on the EU’s economic rebound.The commission remains broadly optimistic about the outlook once the disruptions die down, predicting the EU will remain in a “prolonged and robust expansionary phase” thanks to a strong labour market and rising household spending.“Multiple headwinds have chilled Europe’s economy this winter: the swift spread of Omicron, a further rise in inflation driven by soaring energy prices and persistent supply chain disruptions,” said Paolo Gentiloni, the EU’s economy commissioner. “With these headwinds expected to fade progressively, we project growth to pick up speed again already this spring.”The region’s economy regained its pre-pandemic level last summer, and output is predicted to surpass levels prior to the Covid-19 crisis in all 27 member states by the end of this year. However, the surge in inflation, which hit record levels in the eurozone in the fourth quarter, is set to cast a cloud over the economic outlook for the coming months.The inflation rate is set to peak in the first quarter of 2022 and stay above 3 per cent until the third quarter, according to commission projections. The biggest driver has been energy price growth, which was nearly 26 per cent in the eurozone in December. Gas and electricity continue to trade at record levels and prices are expected to moderate significantly only in 2023, the commission warned.The build-up of Russian military forces on the Ukraine border and in Belarus has heightened concerns about the impact of high energy prices on the EU economy, given Russia provides around 40 per cent of its gas imports.The commission warned that risks to growth and inflation were being “aggravated” by the geopolitical tensions in eastern Europe.Nevertheless, it predicted inflation would fade next year, taking the headline rate of consumer price growth to 1.9 per cent in the EU and 1.7 per cent in the eurozone in 2023, since the current pressures were largely driven by “the post-pandemic adjustment and energy and non-energy commodity volatility”.The EU’s inflation forecast, which was revealed by Bloomberg several hours before publication, gave ammunition to those arguing that the European Central Bank should not rush to tighten monetary policy in response to higher than expected inflation.The ECB sparked a sell-off in bond markets last week when it said inflation risks were “tilted to the upside”, fuelling expectations that it would next month raise its own forecast for annual price growth in 2023 and 2024 above its 2 per cent target — fulfilling a key condition to raise interest rates. In December, the ECB forecast inflation would drop to 1.8 per cent next year.“The EU commission forecasts euro area inflation to decline to 1.7 per cent in 2023,” Frederik Ducrozet, a strategist at Pictet Wealth Management and veteran ECB-watcher, wrote on Twitter. “If so, the ECB should ease, not tighten.”Philip Lane, the ECB’s chief economist, wrote in a blog on Thursday that “bottleneck-related price pressures should fade over time”. But he added that “a gradual tightening of the labour market constitutes a key mechanism for inflation to stabilise at our 2 per cent target over the medium term,” signalling the bank could raise its inflation forecast next month.Eurozone government bond prices rallied after the EU forecast was published.However, the commission said it stopped considering new data for its latest forecasts a day before publication of the flash estimate for eurozone inflation, which rose to a record 5.1 per cent, defying widespread expectations of a fall. The January figure “presents some upside risks to our first quarter forecast”, it added.The tightening of the eurozone labour market during the economic recovery had “not put noticeable pressure on wages so far”, it said. Negotiated wages in the eurozone, for example, increased by 1.3 per cent in the third quarter of 2021 from a year earlier, the slowest pace since the pandemic began.Interruptions to supply chains have also hit growth and inflation. The commission expected bottlenecks in the transport and metals sectors to ease gradually during the current year, while semiconductor shortages would take until 2023 to resolve.
412  Vodafone has rejected a bid for its Italian business from French billionaire Xavier Niel’s Iliad and private equity fund Apax, saying it was “not in the best interests of shareholders”.Iliad submitted an offer of more than €11bn for Vodafone’s Italian business on Saturday, according to people familiar with the matter, representing about seven times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.This was rebuffed by Vodafone on Thursday. “Vodafone continues to pragmatically pursue several value accretive in-market consolidation opportunities to deliver sustainable market structures in its major European markets, including Italy,” the company said.Vodafone shares were down about 1 per cent in afternoon trading in London at 138.1p. The FTSE 100 company has shed about 30 per cent of its market value over the past five years.Chief executive Nick Read has previously expressed support for consolidation in some of Europe’s more fragmented telecoms markets. He is under pressure to revive Vodafone after it emerged that Europe’s biggest activist investor, Cevian Capital, had taken a stake in the company and is pushing for a structural overhaul of the business.Niel’s attempt to consolidate the crowded Italian market was a bold one, given that Iliad only entered the country in 2018 and remains the fourth-largest mobile player with about 10 per cent market share. Vodafone held about 24 per cent market share as of the third quarter of last year, just behind market leader Telecom Italia, according to Agcom, the Italian telecoms regulator.After Vodafone’s rejection, Iliad defended its offer as representing a “very high premium” and arguing that it would have “answered Vodafone management’s desire for consolidation in Italy”.“Iliad Italia will pursue its stand-alone strategy with its great track record,” said the French group.Italy was Iliad’s first foray outside its home country. The group has since invested heavily to build a network and sought to woo customers with simpler and often cheaper offers than those of its rivals.Analysts at Barclays estimate that Vodafone’s Italian business has an enterprise value of £6.9bn. 
413  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.At first glance, it seemed the president of Poland’s jet-setting diplomacy on Ukraine had left the rule of law dispute with Brussels in the rear-view mirror, given the EU’s willingness to show a united front against Russia. But on closer inspection, the fundamentals have hardly changed and, with a ruling coming up next week, the conflict could easily flare up again.In France, back from his own diplomatic adventures on the eastern front, President Emmanuel Macron is set later today to announce fresh investments in nuclear energy — a divisive topic not just among EU member states but also in the country’s presidential campaign. We’ll explore the stakes and what he is likely to say.With the monthly infringement package out yesterday, the EU took the UK to court for the first time since Brexit (over an obscure state-aid case in Romania). The European Commission also started legal proceedings against Portugal, among others, over how it transposed the bloc’s rules on anti-money laundering.After months of deadlock in the battle between Warsaw and Brussels over the rule of law, Poland’s President Andrzej Duda has managed to engineer a shift in the political weather in recent days, write James Shotter in Warsaw and Sam Fleming in Brussels.Duda put forward a bill last week that envisages scrapping a disciplinary chamber for judges that has become one of the main flashpoints in the feud between Warsaw and Brussels. The regime would also allow judges who had been punished for the content of their rulings to have their cases reconsidered.Duda’s initiative was welcomed by the US, and followed swiftly by a meeting with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen. However, as the dust settles, there are doubts in Brussels and Warsaw that the improved political mood music will translate into real progress in the substance of the rule of law dispute.One key concern is that the new legislation will not meet all the requirements on judicial independence that the commission has set in order to approve Poland’s pitch for a €36bn chunk of the EU’s post-Covid recovery fund.Iustitia, a judges’ organisation, has dismissed scrapping of the disciplinary chamber as cosmetic, given that it will be replaced by another disciplinary body. And it points out that Duda’s proposal does not address the politicisation of the National Judicial Council — the body that appoints judges — and one of the key criticisms to the ruling Law and Justice party’s judicial changes.Then there’s the question of whether the bill even becomes law in the first place. The bill has come under fire from the opposition and members of the Law and Justice party’s hardline junior coalition partner, United Poland, which is led by hawkish justice minister Zbigniew Ziobro.Allies of Ziobro have criticised Duda’s bill as a climbdown that they say will lead to “anarchy” in the justice system. “It would be a very bad thing if the president’s proposals meant a white-flag policy,” Marcin Warchol, a deputy justice minister, said last week.One question occupying Warsaw political circles is whether Law and Justice could try to circumvent Ziobro’s objections by passing Duda’s bill with the votes of opposition parties. But that would risk the unity of the fragile ruling coalition — a gamble even without the reservations in Brussels.Making the political stakes even higher is an upcoming ruling by the European Court of Justice next Wednesday on the EU’s new and untested conditionality mechanism, which allows Brussels to hold back EU money where there are risks to the budget from rule of law violations.Assuming the judges uphold the legislation, the commission can expect a fresh wave of pressure from the European parliament for the new regime to be rapidly deployed.“If the ECJ confirms the ruling by the advocate-general we expect the European Commission to start implementing the law immediately,” said Manfred Weber, the chair of the centre-right European People’s party in the parliament. “This is not about a conflict between east and west, or left and right, it is about the functioning of the EU and protecting our most basic values and freedoms.”The most obvious candidates for the conditionality mechanism to be used against are Hungary and Poland. But if the commission does go down this road, the political mood could rapidly sour again.The UK’s gas imports will increase dramatically over the next 30 years, according to official forecasts, even if all of the existing North Sea reserves are exploited. The UK imports more than half of its gas from countries including Norway, Qatar and Russia and official production and demand forecasts suggest that by 2030, this would rise to nearly 70 per cent, according to the FT’s calculations. (More here)France’s President Emmanuel Macron is planning to build several new nuclear reactors in the coming decades, doubling down on Paris’s backing for a source of power that has divided Europe and further igniting a domestic electoral debate over the country’s energy future, writes Sarah White in Paris.In an announcement expected later today, Macron would also call for a substantial step-up in renewable energy investments, French officials said, an area where the country has lagged behind some European neighbours as it maps out how to meet a pledge for net zero carbon emissions by 2050.Just two months before a French presidential election — in which Macron is expected to run again but has yet to formally declare his candidacy — the nuclear announcements in particular are a boon for state-controlled power group EDF and for jobs in the industry after several years of hesitancy from successive governments.Macron is expected to announce orders for at least six next generation reactors, which could cost about €50bn. The state would participate in some of the financing, government officials said, without giving details.Pressure to reach climate goals, coupled with soaring gas prices, have tilted momentum more firmly towards the new investments, even though Macron has said he aimed to slice France’s reliance on nuclear energy to 50 per cent by 2035.A lower-carbon source of power than plants fuelled by fossil fuels, nuclear makes up some 70 per cent of France’s electricity production today and is subject to stringent safety norms. Detractors decry risks associated with accidents and question how the most toxic waste will be disposed of.Macron’s push comes after the EU recently stuck by a plan to give nuclear energy and some forms of gas a “green” label — allowing them to be considered sustainable for decades, and helping the sectors to attract investors.The labelling had caused pushback from some environmentalists and countries such as Spain, Austria and Denmark as well as Germany, which is shutting its remaining plants this year.France’s largely pro-nuclear presidential candidates — with the exception of the Green party and a few voices on the left — have also advocated building new reactors, and the risk of a post-election reversal of the orders may be limited as a result.Portugal is one of the four countries against whom the European Commission started legal proceedings yesterday, for failing to explain in detail how they are applying EU rules against money laundering, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon.Portuguese investigators have complained of a lack of technical resources and trained staff to deal adequately with the growing number of suspected cases of money laundering being reported by banks, real estate companies, casinos, lawyers and others.The country blocked suspicious bank operations worth more than €560mn in 2020, according to a police report released this week.In a contribution to a book on corruption published last year, one official described obsolete computer equipment, poor internet connections, difficulties in obtaining access to databases and inadequate staffing levels.This lack of resources, some investigators have said, makes it difficult to keep pace with new types of computer-based crimes, such as those involving cryptocurrencies. Portugal is also one of the few European countries where gains made on trading digital currencies are not taxed, according to the same officials.Investigators have partly attributed the increase in suspected money laundering in Portugal over recent years to two international cases.The transfer in 2019 of the headquarters of Venezuela’s state oil company, PDSA, from Lisbon to Moscow, after most western democratic countries recognised Juan Guaidó, head of the Venezuelan opposition, as the country’s rightful interim leader, reportedly led to a number of transfers being suspended because of money laundering inquiries.In 2020, the “Luanda Leaks” release of hacked documents alleged that Isabel dos Santos, who had extensive business interests in Portugal, had looted the Angolan state, where her father was president from 1997 to 2017. A number of bank operations ordered by dos Santos or her associates were subsequently suspended for investigation, officials have told the Portuguese media.The four EU countries (Portugal, Malta, Latvia and Lithuania) now have two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the commission. Failure to comply could lead to a court case and end with fines.
414  Presidential candidate Valérie Pécresse began a live interview with one of France’s most popular television hosts by going on the offensive, declaring she nearly cancelled the appearance because of sexual assault allegations against him.“I want to say very clearly that if these accusations are true they’re serious and must be condemned,” Pécresse said to veteran presenter Jean-Jacques Bourdin, surrounded by an audience of voters. The BFMTV journalist, 72, was accused publicly of assaulting a younger female colleague, although he denied wrongdoing.“The fight against sexual harassment and violence against women is a personal one for me,” Pécresse continued. “For too long, society has closed its eyes and sought to minimise the issue,” she added, vowing this would change if she became president.The dramatic moment sparked a torrent of coverage on the merits and excesses of the #MeToo movement, which has faced some resistance in France but led to revelations about a slew of TV stars, politicians and intellectuals.It showed how the female candidate factor and women’s issues could play into the battle to unseat President Emmanuel Macron in April.Macron was elected with strong support from women voters, and made gender parity a priority in his newly created party and government, but that support has faltered.“I think the women’s card will be important to this election,” said Chloé Morin, a political analyst and author of the forthcoming book We Get The Politicians We Deserve. “Pécresse showed that she will not hesitate to play it, and the other women candidates will too in their own ways.”Not only are there more women candidates than in the past, but two of them, Pécresse and the far-right’s Marine Le Pen, are leading contenders to make the run-off against Macron.Pécresse, a conservative politician known for her traditional social views symbolised by her past opposition to gay marriage, has begun to speak more frequently about her experience as a woman in politics, using it to differentiate herself and create a buzz around her candidacy.Pollsters said the positioning could help her attract some centrist or leftwing voters if she makes the second round in a potentially close runoff against Macron.The female factor is also affecting the duel on the far-right between Le Pen and anti-immigration polemicist Eric Zemmour, who has markedly lower approval ratings among women, potentially hurting his chances of making the second round.Zemmour, who has espoused traditional masculinity and criticised the feminist movement, has faced sexual harassment allegations from several women, which he has denied. In his book The French Suicide, he wrote nostalgically about the days when a man could grope a woman without being hit with a lawsuit.In contrast, Le Pen has performed better with women to close the historical gap that existed when her father was in charge of the far-right movement she now leads.Bourdin was suspended from duties a few days after the Pécresse interview last month. In their exchange, he said: “I have decided not to express myself on this topic, but I contest the allegations reported by the media and will let the justice system do its work.”The women’s vote in France has evolved over the decades since they got the vote in 1944 — much later than the UK in 1918 or the US two years later — and is not a uniform bloc, according to sociologist Janine Mossuz-Lavau.In the 1950s, women voted less than men and were more conservative, but by the 1970s they had equal participation and shifted leftward. Since the 1980s, their political choices have been more influenced by education, geography and economic status than by gender.Women’s voting patterns could play out differently this time, said Louise Jussian, an Ifop analyst who in October polled 2,000 women on their views on the election. Younger women viewed defending women’s rights and fighting sexism as key, with 86 per cent of under-25s putting it as their top issue, roughly double the level for women overall.“It’s the first election after #MeToo, which has put questions of women’s rights and feminism on the agenda,” said Jussian.French women have in recent years begun to speak out more about being harassed, and activists have also criticised the failures of the justice system to properly investigate murder and rape against women.About 120 women have been killed by their partners in France each year since 2015, according to interior ministry figures, and more than 200,000 incidents of domestic violence occur annually, with less than 20 per cent of them resulting in a police complaint.Measures introduced under Macron have included outlawing harassment, tackling the gender pay gap, setting the age of consent at 15, and improving police and health services to victims of violence.Yet many feminist advocates turned against the president in 2020 when he named Gérald Darmanin as interior minister even though he was under investigation after one woman accused him of rape, and another of sexual harassment. Darmanin has maintained his innocence, and one case has been dismissed, while the other is ongoing.Marylie Breuil, an activist with the feminist NousToutes movement, likened Macron’s record on women’s issues to an “empty shell”. “Not enough money is budgeted to the promises [so] we cannot fight domestic violence effectively,” she said.A December poll by Harris Interactive showed the average voter put “equality between women and men” roughly half way down their election priorities list, far behind consumer purchasing power, coronavirus and security.Yet the fact that much about women’s daily lives remained unchanged despite the #MeToo movement jolt had “opened up a political space to talk about these issues”, said Pierre-Hadrien Bartoli, a researcher at Harris.This was why the Bourdin confrontation resonated well for a candidate who hoped to become France’s first woman president, he added.
415  US officials have warned that Russia has continued to ramp up its military activity around the Ukrainian border, despite a flurry of diplomatic efforts to defuse the crisis including a high-profile visit to Moscow this week by French president Emmanuel Macron.The White House and the Pentagon on Wednesday said Moscow was increasing its military presence near Ukraine, even though Macron earlier this week said Russian president Vladimir Putin had assured him there would be no “deterioration or escalation” in the stand-off.“We have continued to see even over the last 24 hours additional capabilities flow from elsewhere in Russia to that border with Ukraine and Belarus,” John Kirby, Pentagon spokesperson, said.“The numbers continue to grow. We maintain that he’s north of 100,000 [troops] for sure. And he continues to add to that capability. We also see indications that additional battalion tactical groups are on their way. And so every day he adds to his options.”Jen Psaki, White House press secretary, said: “What we’re looking at here [is] whether or not Russia is taking de-escalatory steps. They are not. They are taking escalatory, not de-escalatory, steps. We certainly hope that changes.”After his visit to Moscow on Monday, Macron said he had fulfilled his aim of “arranging things to prevent an escalation and open up new avenues” for diplomacy. The French president then travelled to Kyiv to meet Volodymyr Zelensky, his Ukrainian counterpart.Joe Biden, US president, met Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, on Monday in a bid to portray unity between Washington and Berlin and warn Moscow that it would face severe economic sanctions if it went ahead with an invasion of Ukraine.US and European Nato members remained adamant that a diplomatic solution to the stand-off was still their preferred option and that the path to an agreement with Moscow was open.But there are concerns in Washington and in some European capitals that a combination of the threat of sanctions, troop deployments to eastern European allies, aid to Ukraine and diplomatic exchanges with Russia have failed to yield concrete results.Biden and Macron spoke on Wednesday about the French president’s meetings in Russia and Ukraine. They discussed “ongoing diplomatic and deterrence efforts”, according to a White House account of their conversation.During the Pentagon briefing, Kirby confirmed a report in the Wall Street Journal that some of the 1,700 US troops deployed to Poland recently could be used to help evacuate US citizens who might try to cross the Ukrainian border following a Russian invasion.Kirby urged Americans in Ukraine to pay “close attention” to the warnings from the US government that they should be leaving the country in the face of the Russian threat.
416  The UK has said it will project a tougher stance than Emmanuel Macron when its foreign minister meets her Russian counterpart in Moscow on Thursday, in a move highlighting the difficulty of shaping a common approach in Europe over how to prevent another Russian invasion of Ukraine.While France’s president insisted on dialogue after his five-hour meeting with Russia’s leader Vladimir Putin on Monday, Liz Truss, UK foreign secretary, will seek to emphasise the “severe costs” of another invasion of Ukraine when she meets Sergei Lavrov, British officials said on Wednesday.“We will be taking slightly different messages,” said one UK diplomat. “We all believe in deterrence and dialogue. We are just keen to emphasise the deterrence line a bit more.”Another government insider said the French were “taking a slightly different message from almost everyone else”.Truss said: “Russia should be in no doubt about the strength of our response. We have said many times that any further invasion would incur severe costs, including through a co-ordinated package of sanctions.”While France and Germany have been more circumspect about Putin’s intentions, the UK has embraced the US’s more urgent assessment that the build-up of more than 100,000 Russian troops near Ukraine’s border could be the prelude for another invasion. Writing in The Times newspaper on Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK would “not flinch” over Ukraine and that he was considering sending RAF Typhoon jets and Royal Navy warships to eastern Europe in the event of further Russian incursions into Ukraine.Speaking in Kyiv on Tuesday, Macron said he had received reassurances from Putin the day before that there would be no “deterioration or escalation” of the crisis. He insisted Russia’s leader and Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky had committed to re-engaging in the “Normandy format” talks — which involve Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany — to end the conflict pitting Russian-backed separatists against Kyiv in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas. The war, which started shortly after Moscow invaded and annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in 2014, has killed more than 14,000 people.A London-based French diplomat said Macron conveyed a “firm message” to Moscow, adding that Paris was “ready to react firmly in case of any new attack on Ukraine’s territorial integrity”.British officials also insisted the UK prime minister and Macron had a productive call over the weekend to discuss the crisis and both countries were both keen to see “de-escalation”.Andrei Kelin, Russia’s ambassador to the UK, on Monday accused Truss of spreading “pure lies” about his country’s alleged plans to attack Ukraine. “Preparing to visit Moscow in that mood is odd. Because if that’s what she’s bringing, it’ll be a short conversation,” he was quoted as saying by Russian news agency Interfax.Truss’s visit is the first by a UK foreign secretary to Russia in more than four years. Ben Wallace, defence secretary, is also due to meet his Russian counterpart in Moscow on Friday.The visit is part of a diplomatic push by European countries to de-escalate tensions. Johnson will travel to Poland for meetings with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and President Andrzej Duda; he will then meet Jens Stoltenberg, Nato secretary-general, in Brussels.Macron also met Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, and Duda on Tuesday after his Moscow-Kyiv tour and has been holding calls with US President Joe Biden and Baltic leaders on Wednesday. Scholz met Biden in Washington on Monday.Additional reporting by Max Seddon in Moscow
417  The European Commission has launched the first post-Brexit court case against the UK in a move that could exacerbate tensions between Brussels and London.The commission on Wednesday referred the British government to the European Court of Justice, claiming a February 2020 UK Supreme Court judgment ordering the Romanian government to pay compensation to investors who lost out on state subsidies “breached the principle of sincere co-operation” and violated EU law.The referral comes as London and Brussels are locked in talks over possible changes to the Northern Ireland protocol, which governs post-Brexit trade on the island of Ireland.Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, threatened again on Wednesday to trigger Article 16 of the protocol which would suspend some checks on goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.The commission had started infringement proceedings over the UK’s failure to fully comply with the protocol but paused them during the negotiations.Under the EU withdrawal agreement, the UK is subject to the ECJ and its rulings for four years after the transition period that ended on December 31, 2020.The court also adjudicates disputes in Northern Ireland as long as the protocol is in effect, since the region remains effectively in the single market for goods. The UK wants to change that arrangement since pro-Brexit Conservative MPs are unhappy with what they say is the imposition of a foreign court.The ECJ is already considering a case brought by the commission against the UK in 2020 for alleged failure to comply with rules on lower-taxed red diesel, but it concerns the enforcement of a pre-existing judgment.The Romanian case predates the country’s EU membership. Romania revoked an investment incentive scheme in 2005, four years before its scheduled expiry, to align its national legislation with EU state aid rules.Ioan and Viorel Micula, two investors with Swedish citizenship, challenged the decision in Romania and, subsequently, in Brussels, where they lost a compensation claim. The Miculas challenged the decision before the General Court of the European Union, one step below the ECJ. But they also asked the UK courts to enforce the compensation award.The commission now wants the ECJ to determine whether the UK broke the law by adjudicating a legal question that was already before EU courts, and misapplied the law.The ECJ could fine London. Commission officials say the decision to launch the case was unconnected to the Northern Ireland talks.The UK government declined to comment.
418  Europe’s desperation to achieve some degree of self-sufficiency in semiconductors is leading to extraordinary measures and a partial burial of principles by the EU.While it has campaigned against subsidies globally, Brussels is now embracing them to build up its chip industry. The European Commission unveiled a €43bn investment plan on Tuesday to help its Chips Act in its aim to double the EU’s share of the semiconductor market from 10 to 20 per cent by 2030, which would require a quadrupling of production.It follows Joe Biden’s administration coming up with a $52bn package to subsidise US semiconductor manufacturing. China spent $33bn on subsidies for semiconductors and other key sectors in 2020 alone.The coronavirus pandemic had “painfully exposed the vulnerability” of Europe’s supply chains, said commission president Ursula von der Leyen, with production lines for cars and other goods hit by shortages.Europe’s plan is for the commission and national governments to spend €11bn to build three pilot facilities for any company to use. Member states and businesses were expected to invest a further €32bn by 2030.Acknowledging concerns over a “subsidy race”, Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner, said the semiconductor industry was a special case. A “rarely used” procedure in the EU’s founding treaty could create a “bespoke approach” for new plants, she said.The Chips Act reeks of protectionism — it will also establish a monitoring system allowing governments to restrict exports from EU-based companies that do not prioritise production of chips for the bloc when there is a global shortage.Yet with every trade bloc now prioritising chip production, there must be a risk of oversupply once the current crunch dissipates. Our Trade Secrets newsletter has an excellent analysis of the implications.1. Microsoft lobbies for Activision approval Microsoft has pledged to ensure open distribution of its games to address regulators’ potential antitrust concerns over its $75bn takeover of Activision Blizzard. A delegation including CEO Satya Nadella has travelled to Washington to talk to lawmakers about the deal.2. Amazon is a grocer, says UK The UK competition regulator has designated Amazon as a grocer and placed it under new rules governing the way supermarkets treat their suppliers, in the latest regulatory assault on the tech giant’s dominance. It ties it to a code of practice that prevents large grocers from squeezing their suppliers.3. US arrests couple and seizes $3.6bn from crypto hack The US Department of Justice has arrested New York-based llya Lichtenstein, 34, and his wife, Heather Morgan, 31, and confiscated more than $3.6bn worth of cryptocurrency it said was stolen during the high-profile 2016 hack of the Bitfinex exchange. The move marks the DoJ’s largest financial seizure. Alphaville has more on those involved.4. Iliad bids for Italian Vodafone French billionaire Xavier Niel’s telecoms group Iliad has offered more than €11bn to buy Vodafone’s Italian business, said people familiar with the matter. The attempt at consolidating the crowded Italian market is a bold one by Niel given that Iliad only entered the country in 2018 and remains the fourth-largest mobile player, with about 8 per cent market share. Vodafone has roughly 28 per cent.5. Nuclear fusion record European scientists have set a new record for the most energy to be generated from nuclear fusion. A team of researchers from the Eurofusion consortium produced 59 megajoules from a sustained reaction lasting five seconds — enough power to boil about 60 kettles — in an experiment at the Joint European Torus (Jet) facility in Oxford, England. “If we can maintain fusion for five seconds, we can do it for five minutes and then five hours as we scale up our operations in future machines,” said Tony Donné, head of Eurofusion.Samsung unveiled the latest iterations of its flagship Galaxy smartphone today, with the main shift being a merger of its Note line with the S series in the shape of the top-of-the-line Galaxy S22 Ultra. It features “a 6.8in screen, a built-in S pen stylus, a boatload of cameras, a $1,199 price tag, and a boxy shape straight from the Galaxy Note series”, said The Verge. “The arrival of the Galaxy S22 Ultra confirms our long-held view that it makes sense for the flagship Galaxy S and Note devices to converge,” said Ben Wood, chief analyst at the CCS Insight research firm.“If the long-term plan is to discontinue the Note family, it means the most premium Galaxy S device will now always have an integrated stylus. For customers who don’t see the utility in having S-Pen capability, the natural device of choice will be the S22+ which looks like a cracking product.”The S22+ starts at £949, but there is £400 off with a trade-in device. It features a faster chip than the S21 Ultra and superior night-time photography.

420  Turkey will expand its drive to lure savers back to the lira next week with a scheme aimed at bringing billions of dollars worth of “under the mattress” gold into the banking system, the country’s finance minister told investors during a visit to London.Nureddin Nebati, who this week made his first trip to the UK since being appointed at the end of last year, said that the government hoped that 10 per cent of the estimated $250bn worth of gold kept by Turks in their homes would be converted into lira under the initiative, according to two participants at the event.Nebati said that 30,000 gold shops would play a central role in the scheme, which will build on a broader package of emergency measures unveiled in December in order to halt a freefall in the lira, which lost 44 per cent of its value against the dollar in 2021.The government had signed contracts with five gold refineries to convert jewellery handed over under the programme into gold bullion that would contribute to the country’s central bank reserves, he added.The ministry of finance declined to comment on the plan but Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency cited Nebati as saying that new measures would soon be announced to put “under the mattress gold into the [financial] system”.A traditional gift given for weddings and births, gold has long been a preferred way for Turks suspicious of the banking system — and their country’s history of inflation — to guard their wealth. But Turkish officials see it as part of a broader problem of “dollarisation”, or flocking to foreign currencies and precious metals, that has been a persistent source of pressure on the Turkish lira.While the new deposit schemes have had some success, attracting about $23bn in total, analysts are sceptical that they will provide a lasting solution to mistrust of the lira. Turkey has negative real interest rates of almost 35 per cent once Turkey’s inflation rate of 48.7 per cent in January is taken into account.One investor who attended one of Nebati’s group meetings said Turks’ longstanding mistrust of the lira would be hard to overcome. “Maybe if they pay a really good interest rate they can get some [interest],” he said. “But I doubt they’ll get $25bn.”Nebati, who was appointed in December after the resignation of his predecessor, struck a bullish tone in a series of London meetings aimed at winning back foreign investors who have fled from Turkish stocks and bonds in recent years.He defended president Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s contentious policy of keeping interest rates far below inflation, predicting that inflation would fall sharply at the end of this year.Still, attendees told the Financial Times that Nebati came across as confident and well-briefed, especially in comparison with Berat Albayrak, a former finance minister and son-in-law of Erdogan who had a testy relationship with the foreign investor community.“This guy had a pitch. He’d prepared,” said Tim Ash, an emerging markets strategist at BlueBay Asset Management. “The message was clear: foreign capital is welcome. Forget about capital controls, we’re not going to do that. That’s encouraging.”Others warned, however, that the government’s efforts to hold the lira steady through micro management tools such as the deposit scheme, rather than orthodox economics, would backfire eventually. “The determinator of the valuation of the currency is the interest rate,” said another participant. “De-dollarisation by administrative means is impossible. Maybe they can make it work for a year but after that it will blow up.”
421  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
422  Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s imperious president, behaves more than ever as though there are no limits to his power — and at precisely the moment he is looking most vulnerable after two decades towering over Turkish politics.So when year-on-year inflation reached close to 50 per cent last month, the highest of the Erdogan era, he fired the head of the Turkish Statistical Institute. Soaring food and energy prices, which are helping sink his ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) in the polls, were disobligingly unresponsive.Erdogan’s power is unbounded, ever since he replaced Turkey’s parliamentary democracy with a Russia-style presidency. But imposing one-man rule has encouraged him to make reckless errors of judgment. Having dispensed with all the co-founders of the AKP and discarded all serious economic expertise, there is no longer anyone around him to say that the sultan has no clothes.In October, he ordered the expulsion of 10 western ambassadors, including from the US, which would have finally sundered the fraying moorings Nato member Turkey has with the west. He backed away from the threat.But he seems unable to back away from his ruinous economic policy, in particular a belief that raising interest rates causes rather than curbs inflation. He has bludgeoned the central bank — and a procession of sacked governors — to cut rates, sending the lira into a tailspin (44 per cent down last year against the dollar) and fuelling inflation.Erdogan’s thirst for the economic growth that enabled him to spread prosperity, education and healthcare into the conservative heartland of Anatolia during his first decade in power was based on cheap credit, consumption and unbridled construction. This evaporated long before the pandemic. His failure to defend the lira despite burning through over $100bn in reserves leaves investors wondering whether Turkey will be able to service its debts.This unchecked slide is at the heart of the opposition’s growing belief that it may finally be able to oust Erdogan and restore Turkey’s parliamentary democracy. The presidential elections are due in June next year. But the AKP, since it first gained power in November 2002, selling itself as a neo-Islamist analogue of European Christian democracy, has been on a permanent campaign footing ever since. It behaves simultaneously as an overbearing ruling party and a scrappy opposition fighting the secularist forces that deny it political legitimacy. And Erdogan could call an early contest in circumstances intended to wrongfoot challengers.He has neutered parliament, weaponised the judiciary, populated almost all the media with placemen, and eviscerated the civil service. He has imprisoned the leadership of the leftwing, pro-Kurdish HDP that deprived the AKP of its parliamentary majority in 2015 — Erdogan re-ran the contest in a febrile atmosphere of revived war with Kurdish insurgents and a spate of jihadist atrocities.Yet Erdogan has also hollowed out the leadership of the AKP — one of the most successful ruling parties of modern times. It is being abandoned by his core constituencies, but from the cocoon of his palaces he is insulated from intimations of political mortality.The question, then, is whether the opposition can unify behind a viable candidate and set off an electoral wave he will not be able to resist. Many political analysts believe it can. “We are at the end of a major historical cycle in Turkey,” says one.In 2019, after the AKP lost most of Turkey’s great cities in local elections, Erdogan tried to repeat 2015 with a rerun of the contest in Istanbul, the city at the heart of his mystique and where he had been mayor. Ekrem Imamoglu, of the centre-left Republican People’s party (CHP), the main opposition, won conclusively with a united opposition. So did Mansur Yavas in the capital, Ankara. Both now outpoll him as putative presidential candidates.Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the CHP leader, as a member of the minority Alevi sect in mainly Sunni Turkey, almost certainly could not beat Erdogan. Some believe he is a decoy to protect genuine candidates from regime attacks (already there are sectarian stories that Yavas, who enjoys the biggest lead over Erdogan, is an undeclared Alevi).The opposition grows in confidence that it can bring Erdogan down and bin his one-man rule. It will shortly announce plans as to how. It is hard to rig elections in Turkey. Less so to find a pretext for a state of emergency, or a provocation: such as declaring the officially secular state’s official religion is Islam, in the hope of splitting the opposition. This could get ugly.
423  The UK’s financial regulator has told banks to strengthen and test their defences against the threat of Russian-sponsored cyber attacks as the stand-off over the future of Ukraine deepens.Large banks with operations in the UK have been warned over the heightened risks stemming from Russia’s build-up of more than 100,000 troops around Ukraine, according to two executives who received a so-called “dear CEO” letter from the Financial Conduct Authority.Regulators noted that the financial sector could be a target for retaliatory cyber attacks if an invasion of Ukraine leads to sanctions on Russian companies or oligarchs with ties to Vladimir Putin, the recipients of the letter said.In the event of an invasion, UK foreign secretary Liz Truss has vowed to impose tough sanctions as well as widen the scope of Russian assets that can be targeted in the UK, including the possible seizure of London properties owned by billionaires with ties to the Kremlin.“We have all received multiple formal warnings about Ukraine.[but] firms should be doing it anyway and need not require regulator prompting,” one of the recipients of the letter said, adding that his bank had already conducted exercises to test responses to an attack.An executive at a large international bank said they were on “high alert” about potential cyber issues.Systemically important lenders in the UK have also been contacted by British security services, such as the National Cyber Security Centre, with a similar warning.“As you’d expect, we’re contacting firms to highlight the National Cyber Security Centre’s statement that organisations should bolster their cyber security resilience,” the FCA said in a statement. It added that all companies it regulates should look at their cyber security.Alongside diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions, western allies are drawing up tougher penalties than those imposed after Moscow’s invasion of Crimea in 2014, which were widely criticised as toothless.The EU is also preparing its own set of sanctions and the US has warned Russia it would face “massive consequences”, with the country’s largest banks and trading in its sovereign debt among possible targets.The European Central Bank has also been consulting with the banks it supervises about their preparations in case of an attack, but has so far stopped short of issuing a formal written warning, according to a person familiar with the matter.The discussions are to also check their ability to identify an attack when it happens and to quickly restore any IT systems that are disrupted, the person added.This includes working with their outsourced providers of IT and cloud systems — such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure — to ensure they can get the bank’s digital operations back up and running quickly, potentially by switching to a back-up system.The ECB declined to comment.Financial regulators and banks have already discussed the implementation and effects of possible sanctions against Russia. The Financial Times previously reported that the ECB requested details of banks’ own assessments and contingency plans, with a particular focus on those with large direct exposures such as France’s Société Générale, Austria’s Raiffeisen Bank and Italy’s UniCredit.Several Ukrainian companies, websites and institutions have already been hacked and disrupted as tensions on the border escalate.In the US, the New York Department of Financial Services late last month alerted financial services companies to the possibility of retaliatory cyber attacks if sanctions against Russia are imposed, Reuters reported.
424  Japan is to divert some of its supplies of liquefied natural gas to Europe in an effort to soothe fears that a Russian invasion of Ukraine will disrupt gas supplies to the continent.The deal, announced by industry minister Koichi Hagiuda on Wednesday in response to a request from the US, is intended as a symbol of solidarity with western allies over the conflict in Ukraine.Rahm Emanuel, the US ambassador to Japan, said the country’s “assistance to Europe” showed how closely Washington and Tokyo were working “with like-minded partners to deter Russian aggression against Ukraine, and uphold our shared values”.Several carriers, each carrying at least 70,000 tonnes of LNG, are already on their way to Europe and due to arrive this month according to officials at Japan’s ministry of trade, economy and industry.More ships will head to the continent in March and April. But energy analysts say the deliveries are unlikely to make much difference to Europe’s energy security because of the continent’s huge energy needs.The EU’s ambassador to Japan, Patricia Flor, said she welcomed Japan’s support “which is an excellent reflection of our longstanding close co-operation.”Although Japan was, until last year, the world’s biggest importer of LNG, its energy companies, trading houses and electricity producers maintain reserves amounting to only two to three weeks’ worth of demand. However, officials said the request for LNG had been made on the understanding that Japan could handle a draw on its surplus.“This has never happened before, and it is extremely unusual for Japan to be asked to comply with such a request because the country is both a consumer and importer of gas,” said trade ministry official Takeshi Soda on Wednesday, adding that LNG imported under long-term contracts without fixed buyers will be the main target for the diversion to Europe.Representatives of Japan’s biggest energy companies said the move could produce a unique arbitrage situation if gas bought cheaply on long-term contracts was sold to Europe at much higher prevailing market prices.Energy companies contacted by the Financial Times said that, while it was unclear exactly what rules would apply under an emergency situation, it was theoretically possible that Japanese companies would now be selling LNG to Europe at far higher prices than they had paid.All companies involved in the talks said that any energy supplies previously bought for domestic utilities or that would impact Japan’s energy stability were off-limits. Some said there was some excess gas previously purchased by the energy companies at spot prices for emergencies that could also be easily resold to Europe.“Every long-term contract has to be honoured but as long as the buyers have their demands met hypothetically it is possible to use the gas bought on long-term contracts for this purpose,” said an official at one of the energy companies involved in the talks.Energy analysts said that, at $25.3/mmbtu, the current benchmark index of Asian LNG prices for March delivery was around 78 per cent higher than the average price of LNG that arrived in Japan on long-term contracts in December.Japanese officials said the trade ministry had been conducting discussions with companies with interests in natural gas since the end of January.Takayuki Ueda, the chief executive of Japan’s largest oil and gas explorer Inpex, told reporters on Wednesday the company would try to respond to the request but cautioned it would not be easy as most of its LNG production was linked with long-term contracts with buyers in Japan and Taiwan.The world’s largest LNG buyer and Japan’s biggest power generator, Jera, as well as Inpex, both confirmed they had been approached by the government to consider what levels of surplus capacity they had available to export to Europe.People close to the situation said Japan’s largest trading houses — a group that includes Mitsui, Mitsubishi and Marubeni — had either been contacted or would be in the coming days.
425  The writer is author of a history of Ostpolitik, ‘In Europe’s Name: Germany and the Divided Continent’German chancellor Olaf Scholz often and rightly praises the Ostpolitik of his great Social Democratic predecessor, Willy Brandt, who was chancellor of the Federal Republic a half-century ago. Indeed, Brandt turned Ostpolitik, which simply means “eastern policy”, into a globally recognised term. But 50 years on, the geopolitical context has changed completely and Scholz urgently needs a new Ostpolitik for today.In 1969, when Brandt launched what was then called his “new” Ostpolitik, West Germany was a revisionist power, ultimately seeking unification with East Germany, and the Soviet Union was a defensive status quo power. Today, united Germany is the defensive status quo power and Vladimir Putin’s Russia is the revisionist power, prepared to use all available means to restore its hegemony over Ukraine and other parts of eastern Europe.Back then, West Germany’s economic relations with Russia were put at the service of the country’s innovative variant of the detente also being pursued by the US, France and the UK. Osthandel, or eastern trade, paved the way for Ostpolitik. Gas first started to flow down a pipeline from Russia to West Germany in 1973. The long-term results of that systematic promotion of economic ties include Germany’s current energy dependence on Russia. The boot is on the other foot. That may help to explain Scholz’s refusal, at this week’s news conference with President Joe Biden, to say plainly that if Putin invades Ukraine, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline becomes instant industrial archaeology.The underlying Ostpolitik gambit of Egon Bahr, Brandt’s adviser, was a judo throw: entice your heavy, slow-moving opponent, the Soviet Union, to lean so far into your embrace that with a skilful twist you can throw him over your shoulder. Now it is Putin, a judo black belt, who is trying to throw heavy, slow-moving Germany over his shoulder.In the 1970s, as US detente policies skilfully widened the Sino-Soviet split, West Germany could concentrate its efforts entirely on the Soviet Union. But in Beijing a few days ago, Putin and Chinese president Xi Jinping reaffirmed a Russian-Chinese alignment against the west. So a new Ostpolitik has also to be a far eastern policy. Unfortunately, Germany’s export dependence on China is as acute as its energy dependence on Russia.Let me add a last, painful difference. Brandt was one of the most inspiring figures in Europe’s postwar history. In a deeply moving symbolic expression of a democratic Germany learning the lessons of its past, Brandt fell to his knees in 1970 before a monument to the heroes of the 1943 Warsaw ghetto rising. But Gerhard Schröder, the last Social Democratic chancellor before Scholz, is one of the most disgraceful figures in the recent history of German democracy. After his rather successful period as chancellor, Schröder’s acceptance of highly paid senior positions at Nord Stream, Rosneft and a recent nomination for the board of Gazprom, while offering constant apologies for Putin’s repression and aggression, has shamed the legacy of Ostpolitik.Now for the good news. All these points are being made eloquently in German media, think tanks and political debate. Even the left-liberal weekly Die Zeit, the parish magazine of the church of Ostpolitik, has aired sharp criticism of those German Social Democrats who continue to mouth old Ostpolitik platitudes unfitted to new circumstances. Shaped by the junior parties in Scholz’s “traffic light” coalition, the Greens and the Free Democrats, his government’s three-party coalition agreement actually prescribes a significant reorientation of the country’s eastern policy. It is to be more integrated into an overall EU strategy, more attentive to human rights and democracy, and more concerned to balance the interests of countries like Ukraine and Belarus against those of Germany’s special relationship with Russia. Scholz himself says we need “a European Ostpolitik”. Had it not been for the Ukraine crisis landing on Scholz’s desk within hours of his becoming chancellor, the tanker of Ostpolitik could gradually have turned, in the slow consensual fashion characteristic of contemporary German democracy, while his government’s green transformation policies gradually weaned it off Russian carbon. But history, that cruel taskmaster, has not left him the luxury of time. The new course has to be set right now. His appearance at next week’s Munich Security Conference is a golden opportunity to spell it out. To adapt Scholz’s own praise of Brandt’s Ostpolitik, his vision needs to be skilfully conceived, geostrategic and courageous. The world will be listening.
426  The new head of Germany’s central bank has said it is time for Europe to tighten its financial belt by ending the exceptional monetary and fiscal stimulus that helped the economy to rebound swiftly from the pandemic.Joachim Nagel, who took over as Bundesbank president last month, has called for a “normalisation” of eurozone monetary policy in response to record inflation and said EU fiscal rules should be “stricter” to prevent countries ignoring them.“Many countries are beginning to relax the pandemic restrictions,” Nagel told Die Zeit in his first interview since starting the job. “The economy is recovering. The job markets are looking good. That’s an encouraging picture. That is why monetary policy can become less expansive.”His comments are a clear confirmation that the new president will continue the Bundesbank’s inflation-fighting hawkish tradition. The German central bank has always viewed unconventional policies such as negative interest rates and bond-buying with suspicion.Nagel predicted inflation would stay high and average 4 per cent in Germany this year, saying that unless the situation changes soon, he would call for the European Central Bank to reverse its ultra-loose monetary policy when it meets on March 10. “The first step is to end net bond purchases during 2022,” he said. “Then interest rates could rise this year.”He also urged Brussels to tighten EU fiscal rules so that it was harder to “circumvent” them as many countries did in the past, even Germany. The rules limit government debt levels and deficits, but have been suspended since the pandemic hit in 2020.“What applies to monetary policy also applies to fiscal policy: a lot has to change after the pandemic,” said Nagel. “When we put the crisis behind us, it will be time to reduce the high government debt ratios and thus build up buffers again.”“We should think about clearer, simpler and stricter rules,” he said. “The rules should better ensure that high government debt ratios are reduced.” His comments clash with recent calls by the leaders of France and Italy to revamp the rules to allow higher public investment, setting up a battle before the limits are due to be reintroduced next year.Other members of the ECB governing council are also leaning towards normalising policy. “Raising rates would not lower energy prices,” Isabel Schnabel, an ECB executive board member, said on Twitter. “But if high current inflation threatens to lead to a de-anchoring of inflation expectations, we may still need to respond, as our mandate is to preserve price stability.”Nagel, a former executive at the Bank for International Settlements, worked at the Bundesbank for 17 years before leaving in 2016 and was chosen by Germany’s new government to take over from Jens Weidmann who decided to quit after a decade in the job.Last week, he joined several of his fellow ECB governing council members in calling for more immediate action than was ultimately announced at their meeting.Christine Lagarde, ECB president, caused a sell-off in bond markets by no longer ruling out that the bank could raise interest rates this year. Her comments triggered a sell-off in eurozone government bond markets as investors predicted the ECB could stop net asset purchases and return its negative deposit rate to zero by the end of the year.Nagel said the current situation of high inflation, falling unemployment and resurgent demand was a “textbook template” of when a central bank should act. “We mustn’t ignore the fact that we have provided the markets with plenty, even overabundance, of liquidity over the years because the inflation rate was too low for a long time,” he said.He warned hesitating to act now could force the ECB to take more drastic action later on, which would be more jarring for financial markets and the economy, adding: “In my estimation, the economic costs are significantly higher if we act too late than if we act early.”
427  In their efforts to deter a Russian invasion of Ukraine, western leaders are rightly keeping open diplomatic channels to Moscow as well as warning of severe sanctions should an attack take place. However, clarity and unity of purpose among the US and its allies are essential. The Kremlin must be left in no doubt that all western governments are determined to uphold the enduring right of Ukraine to sovereign statehood in a community of European nations.In this context, proposals for the “Finlandisation” of Ukraine must be treated with great caution. President Emmanuel Macron of France, who held talks in Moscow this week with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, says he avoided such a formula. Still, the idea of using Finland’s cold war relationship with the Soviet Union as a model for Ukraine’s present-day relationship with Russia, mooted before in unofficial western debate, has surfaced again in the current crisis.Comparisons between Finland and Ukraine are superficially attractive but do not stand up to close inspection. Finland was neutral in the cold war and careful not to antagonise the Soviet Union. Yet it was a prosperous western-style democracy whose people had an unquestioned right to live in a sovereign state of their own.Matters stand very differently with Ukraine today. Putin casts doubt over Ukraine’s legitimate right to independent statehood. He suggests Ukrainians lack a national identity distinct from that of Russians. He regards the vibrancy of Ukraine’s democracy as a potential threat to his system of power at home, as the Russian people might one day demand the same freedoms.Furthermore, Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014 and fomented a conflict in the Donbas that continues to this day. In all these ways, Putin gives the strong impression that he does not think of Ukraine as a country with the undisputed sovereign status of Finland during the cold war. Russian behaviour towards Ukraine recalls not Finland but Poland in the 18th century, when the tsarist empire exerted increasing control over domestic Polish politics, eventually colluding in three partitions that wiped Poland off the map of Europe for more than a century.This is not to deny that a case for a neutral Ukraine exists. Although Nato allies defend the right of any country to make a free choice to apply for membership, it is clear some governments in western Europe would rather Ukraine did not join. An understanding between Nato, Russia and Ukraine on Ukrainian neutrality would be a recognition of that fact, not intolerable weakness on the west’s part.However, cast-iron conditions would have to apply to any such arrangements. Kyiv and Ukrainians would have to consent and, after seven years of Russian attempts to undermine Ukraine, it is far from clear they would. There can be no deals over their heads and no concession to Russia’s quest for formal spheres of influence in Europe.Russia would have to make commitments to respect Ukraine’s sovereign independence far more binding than those in a 1994 agreement it signed then trampled underfoot with its aggression in 2014. The illegal annexation of Crimea and Russia’s de facto occupation of the Donbas would have to be on the table in any talks.Putin’s pressure on Ukraine is part of his broader push for revised post-cold war security arrangements in central and eastern Europe. Western leaders are right to resist these extravagant demands. But they should also send a clear message that they view a free, stable, independent Ukraine as a core element of the improved western-Russian relationship that Europe sorely needs.Letter in response to this editorial comment:Finns prove a small state can live with big neighbour / From Armen Martirosyan, Ambassador of Armenia to Lithuania, Vilnius, Lithuania
428  Welcome back — midway through another turbulent week. In Europe, the argument over the EU’s green taxonomy continues to rage, with lawmakers plotting an effort to shoot down the legislation in the European parliament. In Washington, presidential science adviser Eric Lander has been forced to quit over bullying claims, in the latest blow to Joe Biden’s climate agenda.While the political storms around climate change have been intensifying, so too have the physical storms — as well as wildfires, floods and other disasters. Weather-related catastrophes caused losses of $329bn last year, the second-highest figure on record, according to a recent report from Aon — and more than a third of this was covered by insurance.The insurance sector has long been painfully aware of the threats it faces from climate change. Scientists at Munich Re started studying the subject nearly five decades ago. But as I discuss below, the recent wave of disasters has sent shockwaves through the industry. There are implications here for property owners all over the world — and lessons for businesses of all stripes — who will need to start grappling with their own climate risks, if they have not already. — Simon MundyWhat did last year’s huge winter storm in Texas, the horrific summer floods in Germany and the December tornadoes in the US midwest have in common? All caused the insurance sector billions of dollars in losses. Yet all were classified, under the conventions of that industry, as “secondary perils”.That’s the term that insurers have conventionally applied to disasters outside a narrow category of “peak perils”: high-profile catastrophes such as north Atlantic hurricanes and Japanese earthquakes, which have tended to generate the biggest losses for the sector. But as climate change disrupts long-established patterns, a wide range of threats are looking increasingly dangerous. The bulk of the $120bn of insured disaster losses last year — and in seven of the eight years before it — came from secondary perils, a term that industry insiders say looks increasingly like an artefact of a more stable time.“In the last few years, we’ve seen wildfires, floods, winter storms, tornadoes, together costing tens of billions of dollars,” David Flandro, head of analytics at insurance broker Howden, told me. “Can we really say these are secondary perils? Or is this the new normal — are we in a world with more peril risk than we thought?”According to Flandro and other industry experts, this concern has begun to affect pricing in the property insurance and reinsurance markets. It is an important case study in how this economically vital industry is grappling with the climate risks to which it is conspicuously exposed.When contracts came up for annual renewal last month, the premiums charged by reinsurance companies to cover insurance groups against property catastrophe losses rose on average 9 per cent — the highest rate since 2009, according to Howden. The biggest rate rises were in places hit by secondary perils — especially Germany, where the prices on some reinsurance contracts went up by more than 50 per cent.The rate rises reflected some important structural changes in the market, said Mike Mitchell, head of property and speciality reinsurance underwriting at Swiss Re. Over the past decade, he noted, there has been a “dramatic” flow of capital into the market for catastrophe bonds and other insurance-linked securities (ILS), which reinsurers use to offset their own risks. But last year, according to analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, that figure dropped from $94bn to $73bn — eroded by the impact of last year’s disaster losses and by many investors pulling money out.Industry insiders say that for some investors, last year was the final straw after several years of elevated losses. Annual insured catastrophe losses averaged $96bn between 2017 and 2021, compared with $44bn in the prior five-year period — but as our colleague Patrick Jenkins pointed out in a recent column, the market remained notably soft. “In previous years people have said they’d roll the dice again,” said James Few, UK head for insurance broker TigerRisk. “What’s different this year is that patience has finally run out. The problem is that all these supposedly minor parts of pricing have caused a major impact on losses.”The concern about new, emerging hazards is conspicuous in the market patterns. The biggest withdrawals from the ILS market, said Mitchell, have been in the “aggregate cover” space: that is, contracts where a payout can be triggered by an accumulation of midsized losses, rather than by a single monster event.And that, in turn, is affecting how the reinsurers treat their insurance company clients. “It’s the accumulation of lots of small attritional claims,” said James Vickers, chair of international business at reinsurance broker Gallagher Re. “Primary insurers have been able to move that risk off to reinsurers quite effectively. And the reinsurers are beginning to wake up and say, that doesn’t work for us any more.”All of this is likely to cause a cascading effect, in which the cost of protection for consumers increases. That is, if insurers are allowed to raise prices, noted John Iten, an analyst at S&P Global Ratings. California, he pointed out, has regulated limits on insurance pricing. As insurers fret about the surging incidence of wildfires in the state, they are finding that the regulated rates are not enough to cover the risks — so they are increasingly pulling back their cover in fire vulnerable areas. In California and a growing number of other places, state-backed insurance schemes are set to take on a growing share of climate-related risks — pushing costs from homeowners in dangerous areas to the rest of the taxpaying public.Even as awareness about the danger of climate risks skyrockets, the recent pricing dynamics are by no means locked in for the foreseeable future. Industry figures note that memories in the insurance sector — especially in the ILS market — can show a pronounced recency bias. If 2022 proves quiet on the disaster front, Few said, some market participants will look at the fat returns and say: “Maybe climate risk is overstated — let’s have another go.” (Simon Mundy)As debate continues about whether this year’s Games deserves its label as the “green” Olympics, China does have some grounds to brag about its environmental credentials.While critics have homed in on the environmental risk of creating artificial snow, it’s worth noting that the Beijing Games are the first Olympic event where all venues are powered entirely by renewables, primarily with solar and wind.And in 2021, China added more offshore wind capacity within a year than the rest of the world managed in the past five years combined. The expansion means that China operates nearly half of the world’s installed offshore wind power, eclipsing the UK, the former champion of the field.China has more cars running on electric batteries than anywhere in the world, and there are no signs the green shift is slowing. The share of electric vehicles, known as new energy vehicles (NEVs) locally, is on track to reach 20 per cent of all new car sales this year — speeding ahead of Beijing’s 2025 target. Thanks to subsidies, NEVs are gaining popularity among not only urban elites but also rural consumers, a local report said.China has outperformed the rest of the world in the field of green finance, too. Last year, China overtook Germany and the US as the top global green bond issuer, according to Anish Ailawadi, senior director and head of investment banking at research company Acuity Knowledge Partners. The issuance of green bonds in China could grow by more than 80 per cent, crossing $100bn in 2022 for the first time, he said. Domestic policy updates and international efforts to harmonise standards would fuel the rapid growth of China’s sustainable finance market, Ailawadi said.Further, China has excluded all fossil fuel electricity projects, including gas, from its green taxonomy, while the EU has failed to do so. “China understands that ESG-focused investors have become more forensic in their research and decision-making on what the different taxonomies recognise,” said Christina Ng, research and stakeholder engagement leader at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.Despite significant challenges such as the governments’ human rights records, Kiran Aziz, head of responsible investments at Norway’s largest pension fund KLP, said “there are specific positive tendencies which tend to get less global attention than the negatives” in China. If the green competition were a race at the Olympics, China might already have won a medal or two. (Tamami Shimizuishi, Nikkei)Europe led a sharp global rise in new climate regulations throughout 2021, according to research from Cube, a financial services advisory company that uses software to scan regulatory announcements. The EU accounts for 47 per cent of the 116,325 climate-related messages from regulators flagged by Cube over the past four years. (Kristen Talman)
429  Could the coronavirus crisis help save the planet? Teresa Ribera, Spain’s environment supremo, is betting Europe’s multibillion-euro response to the pandemic will make a decisive difference to the EU’s battle against climate change.In an interview with the Financial Times, Ribera, a deputy prime minister in the leftwing government, set out the country’s plans to tap into the bloc’s €800bn coronavirus recovery fund. But she also acknowledged challenges such as skill shortages, inflation and the need for private funds and popular backing.“It is the kind of responsibility you have once in a lifetime, the sort of thing that probably no one imagined,” said Ribera, the principal author of Spain’s energy and climate plan. “The total €140bn in recovery fund grants and loans is equivalent to all the structural funds Spain has received since it joined the EU; it is a spectacular amount.”The EU requires countries to spend at least 37 per cent of the recovery funds on climate action. Spain, the fund’s second-biggest beneficiary after Italy and the first country to have its plans approved by Brussels, is aiming at 40 per cent. Its status as one of the EU members most at peril from climate change — because of problems such as desertification, water shortages and intense heat — makes the issue still more important.Some of the biggest ticket items in Spain’s recovery plan — €6.5bn for electric vehicles and public transport, €7bn for energy efficiency in buildings, and €6.9bn to make the country a renewable energy hub and develop “green hydrogen” — will play vital roles in determining whether it meets its goals to reduce carbon emissions by 2030.Spain’s opposition People’s party has railed against the plans for the EU funds, taking legal action after accusing the government of favouring Socialist-controlled regions, and highlighting delays.Ribera has dismissed such criticism, arguing that the funds are subject to heightened scrutiny by Brussels and insisting that all the country’s regions will benefit.But she said, for the resources to be spent most effectively, the workforce would have to gain new skills.“Do we have enough workers to absorb all the money for the rehabilitation of buildings?” she asked. “Well, obviously, they are not the construction workers of 20 years ago, who probably were not very trained. And at present, we have fewer registered construction workers than in 1999. So professional training is a focus.”She added that she anticipated “episodes of inflation”.“Suddenly, the whole world decides that everything has to be digital, renewable and green: this creates tensions in the supply chain and generates inflation,” she pointed out.There are also questions over whether the plans are ambitious enough for the change needed.The shift to electric vehicles, for example, is vital for Spain, which has Europe’s second-biggest car industry and hopes to head off competition from China by manufacturing low-cost electric vehicles by 2025.Ribera acknowledged the country’s charging infrastructure was behind its EU peers. “It is true we have begun late, but we will make up for that very quickly,” she said.Under the recovery plan, the government plans to increase the number of chargers from about 13,000 last year to 100,000 by 2023 — when 250,000 electric vehicles should be on the roads.But Spain’s car manufacturers association wants a more sustained push — to more than 300,000 chargers by 2030 — and warns that many of those in place at present are not powerful enough to charge cars quickly.Overall, Ribera is hopeful the private sector will invest four to five times the amount coming from EU grants. Whether such a scale of resources — up to €350bn given the total grants of €70bn — will be mobilised is one of the biggest questions surrounding the EU funds.The minister also argues public opinion will play a huge role. With the rise in gas prices pushing Spanish electricity bills higher, Madrid has been calling on the EU to revise its pricing rules so consumers will be charged less — a measure the European Commission is now contemplating, at least on a temporary basis.Ribera warned that continued high prices could jeopardise the energy transition, by increasing costs and alienating the public.“A transformation like we are living through always needs social support,” she said. “Citizens have to think there is something positive in it for them.that it is not an agenda for big companies.”
430  Europe’s largest car parts supplier Bosch will spend a total of about €2bn on retraining some of its 400,000 staff to limit further job losses as the industry switches from combustion engines to electric technology.The announcement by the German group comes after warnings that the EU’s target of phasing out petrol and diesel cars by 2035 could lead to hundreds of thousands of roles being axed on the continent.The privately owned company, among the EU’s largest employers, has spent €1bn on programmes to reskill those working on legacy technologies over the past five years and plans to spend “a similar sum” over the next five years, its human resources chief Filiz Albrecht said.The amount equals roughly €500 spent per employee per year. Staff working in non-auto departments are being offered courses on artificial intelligence and other software skills, the company said.Bosch has been majority-owned by a charitable foundation since 1964, which spends the income from dividends on social causes.Its shares are managed by a trust committed to “safeguarding the company’s long-term existence”, which has so far opted to maintain a high-cost German workforce, limiting job cuts in the country to a few hundred roles. The net number of employees in Germany has remained stable, as Bosch has also hired a slew of software and electronics experts.However, European car suppliers have increasingly been raising the alarm about the consequences of a rapid shift to battery-powered cars.Clepa, the European association of automotive suppliers, warned in December that 500,000 roles could be eliminated under EU plans for the decarbonisation of transport, unveiled last summer.Bosch has also been a vocal critic of the EU’s ambitions, with former longstanding boss Volkmar Denner urging the bloc last year to “urgently rethink” its proposals, in order to safeguard European jobs.But his successor Stefan Hartung, who took over at the start of 2022, said the manufacturer now “supports these [EU] targets without any ifs and buts”, and that Bosch would play its part in ensuring that electric cars were dominant in Europe by the deadline set by Brussels.“That’s the rule,” he told journalists, referring to the EU’s Green New Deal. “That’s what has been passed, right? So we respect that.“In concrete terms, this means working closely with policymakers to implement the Green Deal in our business in such a way that we not only retain as many jobs as possible, but also create new ones. To do this we need, above all, enough time.”Hartung’s comments came as Bosch unveiled preliminary figures for 2021. Sales at the Stuttgart-based company rose 10 per cent to almost €79bn, exceeding internal forecasts and 2019 numbers before the pandemic. Operational earnings before interest and taxes came in at €3.2bn, and profit margins improved from 2.8 per cent to 4 per cent.However, the profit margin remained lower than some of Bosch’s publicly listed competitors, and well below the company’s internal target of 7.5 per cent, highlighting the persistence of its relatively high cost base.This includes a well-paid German workforce of more than 131,000, roughly half of whom work on automotive products.In 2020 — the last full year of available figures — personnel expenses at the 135-year-old company amounted to almost €22.5bn, or almost €57,000 per Bosch employee worldwide.Albrecht said Bosch had invested in training programmes for existing employees, “so that mechanical engineers have become software developers and skilled workers from combustion technology were reskilled to work in electric mobility”.The initiative coincides with an acute shortage of skilled labour in Germany and beyond. Earlier this month, eurozone businesses reported that worker shortages had reached their highest level since at least 1982.
431  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.Every three years, the European Commission looks at the state of economic development in regions that rely on so-called cohesion funds, which are aimed at reducing the development gap compared to the wealthier parts of the bloc.This year’s report, to be published today, makes for a grim reading, as it includes early findings about the impact of the pandemic on middle and low-income regions. I’ll take you through the main findings and policy recommendations.On the Russia front, Emmanuel Macron, president of France, has claimed that he obtained assurances that his counterpart Vladimir Putin would not invade Ukraine. But the Kremlin retorted that no agreement had yet been reached “because France is a member of the EU, and of Nato, where it is not the leader. A different country in that bloc is the leader.”And in financial news, the EU extended — possibly for the last time — the access to UK clearing houses for its banks and fund managers for another three years.This year’s report on cohesion policy — the European Commission’s first since the pandemic — shows that the funding going to less-developed regions has generally boosted growth and allowed them to catch up with the wealthier parts of the EU. But the report also found that the pandemic has erased some of the gains made and highlighted social and economic disparities that linger in southern and eastern Europe.The pandemic increased the EU’s overall mortality by 13 per cent, but the impact has been higher in less-developed regions, where mortality increased by 17 per cent, the report states.Health disparities have been shrinking over the past decade, with life expectancy increasing faster in less-developed regions (but still below the EU average, particularly in the east). When the pandemic hit, regional differences in healthcare capacity became more glaring.From a social perspective, EU funding in this area reduced the number of people at risk of poverty by 17mn between 2012 and 2019, but the pandemic added back 5mn in 2020.In economic terms, regions depending on sectors such as tourism, particularly in southern Europe, took a disproportionate hit. The pandemic has also created difficulties in crossing national borders for work, education, healthcare and other services.But even before the pandemic, several middle-income and less-developed regions, especially in the southern part of the bloc, struggled to recover from the 2008 financial crisis — a phenomenon the commission describes as a “development trap”.In order to avoid such a predicament in the future, less-developed regions are advised to boost education and training, increase investments in research and innovation, and improve the quality of their institutions.On the plus side, since 2001, less-developed eastern regions have been catching up with the rest of the bloc, leading to a substantial reduction of the GDP per capita gap, the report says. Their high growth rates have been fuelled by structural transformation, notably a shift of employment out of agriculture and into higher-paid jobs. Some of these regions have relied on infrastructure investment and low costs to promote growth.However, the commission warns, returns on infrastructure investment will decline and low-cost advantages will shrink if real wages grow faster than productivity.The report found that countries relied more on cohesion funds in the last EU budget (2013-2020) when compared to the previous seven-year budget, the exceptions being Hungary and Malta, which saw significant drops in EU cohesion funding relative to public investments.Next year, the commission’s economic modelling projects GDP per capita to be 2.6 per cent higher in less-developed regions because of support from cohesion policy. This model also shows the gap between GDP per capita in regions representing top and bottom deciles will fall 3.5 per cent.Déjà vu once again in Brussels as the commission formally confirmed it would extend access to UK clearing houses for its banks and fund managers for another three years, writes Philip Stafford in London.Another extension heads off the likely instability on global financial markets if the permit to the end of June were allowed to lapse. A clearing house stands between two parties in a trade, ensuring one side is paid if someone defaults on payment and acts as a crash barrier to stop the effect cascading through global markets.Publicly, authorities say it gives the markets more time to build capacity in the EU and loosen its exposure to London, where LCH still handles about 90 per cent of all euro-denominated derivatives.Even so, Brussels yesterday gave the strong impression that this would be the last extension. As Markus Ferber, an influential German MEP, said: “If we continue to extend the equivalence decision until the dawn of the future, we will never succeed in bringing euro clearing back to the EU.”To reach that long-coveted goal, the commission also launched a consultation looking at ways to improve the “attractiveness” of EU-based clearing houses, with new rules to come later this year.The 46-page document asks detailed questions about everything from the impact of higher capital requirements for EU banks if they have exposure to London to the practicalities of setting targets that reduce the level of exposure.“The various measures are mostly stick rather than carrot,” said Pauline Ashall, capital markets partner at Linklaters, a London law firm.How successful it will be and whether there will be another extension is another matter. Brussels has given no guidance as to what is an acceptable level of exposure.An EU-industry working group last year produced few tangible results, illustrating the depth of resistance from the market. While users want the cheaper service that competition brings, their first priority is reducing the risks and the vast cost of running hundreds of open derivatives positions. That works best if it is done in one location, netting positions held in euros against those held in other currencies, especially dollars.The other problem is that restrictions or added capital requirements make EU institutions less competitive than international rivals, which can continue to use London. The reality is that there are few easy options for Brussels if it wants to pursue its ambitions.A majority of Europeans believe Russia will invade Ukraine this year, according to a survey carried out in seven EU nations and published today by the European Council on Foreign Relations. When it comes to Nato or the EU being best placed to protect their national interests in case of an invasion, only France and non-Nato members Sweden and Finland put the EU above the military alliance.

432  A study by the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM), published on Wednesday, will add fuel to EU regulators’ scrutiny of payment for order flow, a process whereby brokers sell their customers’ orders to market intermediaries. The AFM found customers were hit with a higher price in 70-85 per cent of cases than if those same orders were sent to more competitive markets.By comparison, investors were better off when their trades went to venues also open to banks and fund managers, or Euronext, the primary European exchange — receiving an inferior price in less than a quarter of cases.Payment for order flow has also been the subject of intense debate across the Atlantic. Wall Street trading firms paid almost $3bn to retail brokers such as Robinhood to manage their trades in 2020, and $3.8bn last year, according to Bloomberg data. Regulatory focus on the practice intensified in early 2021 when the meme-stock frenzy fuelled a surge in payment for order flow, prompting Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren to express “troubling concerns” about the companies carrying out Robinhood’s trades.The practice is not banned outright across the EU. But tough rules on inducements and finding the best price for clients mean most market participants find payment for order flow difficult to implement. Even so, a few national regulators, including Germany’s financial watchdog, interpret the rules differently. Brussels has proposed a formal ban to ensure the rules are enforced across the bloc.The uncertainty has created uneven rules in which some regional stock exchanges and alternative trading venues offer fees for orders. Other venues permit only one dedicated market maker to supply prices to buy and sell, with brokers selling their orders to that market maker.The AFM’s study assessed two trading venues that relied on payment for order flow, one which did not and one low-cost retail broker. The study covered the first half of 2021. It found that retail investors received a better price only about 5-8 per cent of the time on a “PFOF venue”, which had paid for customers’ orders. That proportion compared to only 1-2 per cent on more open markets. Using a broker, retail investors received a worse price in about a third of cases but were just as likely to get a better price.The AFM’s analysis focused only on Dutch shares, but the watchdog said it had sent its model to other regulators in Europe to use for their own studies.Market participants have been divided over a potential ban. Trade Republic, a German trading platform with a million customers, has warned it would hurt retail investors. Virtu Financial, the US group, has urged European authorities not to pursue a ban and called on them to study the US market to understand how a “properly configured PFOF ecosystem” can benefit investors, according to a private submission to European Securities and Markets Authority last month and seen by the Financial Times. It has advocated explicit disclosures to all clients of retail brokers who receive payment for order flow.“The US structure, formulated to ensure competition, best execution, and transparency, is not evident in the current EU market practices surrounding PFOF,” it warned.Optiver, a Dutch market maker, has backed a ban, but cautioned that the wording of the AFM’s proposals would not curb other market practices that skirt the spirit of the rules.
433  Investors are growing worried that if the European Central Bank signals too aggressive a tightening in monetary policy, it could trigger the type of bond market tumult that worsened the eurozone debt crisis a decade ago.Government debt across the currency bloc has tumbled since last week’s ECB meeting, when President Christine Lagarde declined to rule out the possibility of a rise in interest rates this year as the central bank battles record high inflation. For bond investors, that prospect is particularly concerning because the ECB has repeatedly stressed that it will wind down its vast bond purchasing programmes before lifting rates.“The ECB is the only thing that’s been keeping the bond market at bay and it is being forced into retreat,” said James Athey, a portfolio manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments.Crucially, the sell-off has hit highly-indebted countries — whose bonds have benefited disproportionately from ECB buying — hardest, widening the gap in borrowing costs between eurozone members. If the central bank hurries to the exit, investors may once again choose to focus on the daunting debt loads of Italy and Greece, worth around 160 per cent and 200 per cent of gross domestic product respectively.Greece’s 10-year spread — the extra yield Athens needs to pay relative to ultra-safe German borrowing costs over a decade — surged above 2 percentage points this week, from 1.4 percentage points at the beginning of the year and doubling since last August. Italy’s 10-year spread, an important gauge of risk in eurozone bond markets owing to the vast scale of Italian debt, widened to more than 1.6 percentage points, the most since July 2020.These levels remain well below those reached during a powerful jolt of volatility in the early stages of the pandemic, let alone the heights scaled during the region’s debt crisis, when Greece, Ireland and Portugal received official bailouts* and Italy and Spain came close to being shut out of bond markets. Even so, the speed of market moves in recent days carries an uncomfortable echo of the upward spiral in yields seen a decade ago, when rising borrowing costs fed concerns about debt sustainability, leading to further selling of sovereign bonds.“I think if the ECB rushes through the end of asset purchases spreads could blow out further from here,” said Athey. “At some point, as we saw in the [eurozone debt crisis], that can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.”The ECB last raised interest rates in 2011, a move which has to be swiftly undone as the eurozone headed into the most acute phase of its debt crisis. Some investors are hoping such experiences will remind Lagarde and her colleagues to move slowly.“Exiting net asset purchases and raising policy rates increases the risk of financial accidents, especially as debt levels have surged during the pandemic and as many other central banks are tightening policy at the same time,” said Joachim Fels, global economic adviser at bond investing group Pimco.“Given these risks, and mindful of the 2008 and 2011 episodes of ill-timed ECB tightening, cool heads and steady hands are still likely to prevail at the ECB. However, the risks of yet another policy mistake have clearly increased.”Lagarde helped to stem the widening in spreads when she told the European parliament on Monday that the ECB’s tightening would be “gradual”. She hinted that reinvestments of maturing bonds held under the central bank’s €1.85tn pandemic era bond-buying programme could help to counter any move higher in borrowing costs.While the ECB president’s tacit acknowledgment of the recent rise in bond yields is reassuring, such a policy is unlikely to be sufficient to counter a concerted sell-off in Italian or Spanish debt, said Antoine Bouvet, a rates strategist at ING. “The tools offered to guard against further spread widening lack in firepower,” he added.Some investors stress that Italian borrowing costs remain a long way below levels where debt sustainability would once again become a concern. Italy’s average interest bill on its outstanding debt is about 2.5 per cent. With 10-year yields currently at 1.87 per cent, Rome can continue to cut its average debt costs as it borrows, said Iain Stealey, international chief investment officer for fixed income at JPMorgan Asset Management.With high nominal growth, a market-friendly prime minister in the form of former ECB chief Mario Draghi, and support from the EU’s €800bn recovery fund, the country can withstand higher yields than it could a decade ago, according to Stealey.“Italy is in a hugely different position,” he said. “Once the dust has settled you might say 2 per cent on the 10-year looked attractive.”Still, the selling in bonds of Italy and its peers has been a painful one for many investors who had parked their cash in riskier debt to earn a little extra yield, safe in the knowledge that the ECB would only very slowly unwind its massive stimulus programme.“The ECB has had many plans to create inflation, but zero plans of what to do if they succeeded,” said Ludovic Colin, a senior portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management. “The euro area as a whole can withstand higher yields. The problem we have is how fast you get to it. For the ECB, this is going to be like trying to land a massive jumbo jet in a storm without crashing.”*This story has been amended to reflect that the three countries received rescue packages during the eurozone debt crisis.
434  Cutting gas flows to Europe is Moscow’s trump economic card if the west imposes tougher sanctions in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine. But the EU’s vulnerability to countermeasures by the Kremlin extends well beyond energy.Policymakers fear the bloc is less prepared than Moscow, where President Vladimir Putin’s “Fortress Russia” strategy is aimed at helping the country weather any deeper sanctions.From technology suppliers and lenders to goods exporters and manufacturers dependent on raw materials, disrupted trading links would increase inflationary pressures and curb activity for a wide range of European businesses.“The geopolitical clouds that we have over Europe, if they were to materialise, would certainly have an impact on energy prices.but [they] would also impact growth as a result of reduced income and possibly as a result of reduced consumption and deferred investment,” said European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde last week.Russia is the EU’s largest energy supplier. About 40 per cent of the bloc’s natural gas imports and nearly one-third of its crude oil imports come from Russia.The US, a net energy exporter, and EU are discussing the possibility of securing alternative energy supplies.Gas reserves are below historical levels and prices have soared in recent months, giving Russia increased leverage. “The truth is, Europe has no substitute for Russian gas,” said Ronald Smith, senior oil and gas analyst at BCS Global Markets.In the event of a conflict, natural gas prices “could easily regain the [December 2021] peak of €180 per MWh”, said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics. “Electricity rationing could push the economy into a recession,” he added.The EU would need “difficult and costly decisions” around curbing industrial and consumer demand to survive large-scale disruption to gas supplies until the summer, according to Brussels think-tank Bruegel. Moreover, countries such as Germany have limited scope to switch to other sources of energy in the short term, having moved away from nuclear power and coal.The Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany could also have sanctions imposed on it, while the UK and EU are discussing curtailing new Russian gas projects.However, as in 2014, when sanctions were imposed on Russia after it annexed Crimea, most economists do not expect gas flows to dry up entirely, as Russia wants to be seen as a reliable energy supplier.“The ‘Russia gas weapon’ is too powerful to ever be used or, for that matter, to even be mentioned directly in negotiations over this or that disagreement between countries,” said Smith.Meanwhile, European oil groups such as BP, Total and Shell could see their joint ventures in Russia disrupted if new sanctions were introduced.Russia is a leading commodities exporter and features in the European Commission’s list of suppliers of critical raw materials.Russia supplies about 40 per cent of the world’s palladium, which is needed in the catalytic converters used in vehicles to limit harmful emissions, and about 30 per cent of titanium, which is crucial for the aerospace industry.Europe’s Airbus, which sources about half of its titanium from Russia, and US rival Boeing both use large amounts of the metal in the manufacture of aircraft. Airbus has said it would “rigorously comply with any sanctions and export control regulations”.EU officials have also discussed imposing tough export controls on western technology.Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING, said sanctions imposed on Russian banks or industries were likely to have “a far-reaching impact on the commodities complex” that could spread across markets in which the country is a leading exporter, including aluminium, nickel, copper and platinum.Russia-Ukraine tensions have fuelled volatility in stock markets this year. Companies with interests in the region, such as Finnish tyremaker Nokian Renkaat or Danish beer producer Carlsberg, have seen their share prices dip in recent weeks. Last month, Italian bank UniCredit pulled out ofa potential bid for Russian lender Otkritie.“Investor nervousness can spread quickly into sectors that should be relatively safer,” said Angel Talavera at Oxford Economics.Lenders are also at risk, as the ECB has warned. About $60bn is owed to EU banks by Russian entities, nearly four times more than the amount they owe to US banks, according to the Bank for International Settlements. Large amounts deposited in EU banks by Russian entities could be frozen.Ukraine’s government owes about $23bn to holders of its sovereign bonds. Bondholders have grown increasingly nervous about a possible default or restructuring. The cost of insuring against default has doubled since September.Investors have said a full-blown invasion of Ukraine would trigger a flight to safety in global markets, away from stocks and into government bonds or other traditional havens such as the Swiss franc, yen and gold.Shutting Russia out of international payment systems or obstructing its access to US dollars would also hit counterparties in Europe.From Polish chemicals to Latvian spirits, trade ties between Russia and eastern EU states are particularly strong in some sectors. Russia is the biggest export market for Latvian goods and the second-biggest for Lithuanian products.Overall, Russia is the bloc’s fifth largest export market, accounting for 4 per cent of its goods exports in 2020.But trade from large EU economies to Russia has been in decline since its annexation of Crimea. Less than 2 per cent of goods exports from Germany, Italy or France go to Russia.“Direct trade links between Russia and Europe are limited and have been reduced since the Crimea crisis,” said Nadia Gharbi, senior economist at Pictet Wealth Management.The EU remains the largest investor in Russia, driven by Germany, but last year its foreign direct investment in the country was less than half the figure of a decade earlier at $6bn, according to fDi Markets.Though analysts said most businesses with Russian interests were resilient enough to cope with disruption, Lagarde warned that heightened tensions could lead to “increased costs throughout the whole structure of prices” in the eurozone economy.“Peace is a lot better than any kind of war from an economic point of view,” she added.Additional reporting by Katie Martin and Jonathan WheatleyLetter in response to this article:FT graph on Russian gas vulnerability is deceptive / From Mikko Koivukangas, Helsinki, Finland
435  What is possibly the world’s most popular savings product, has four legs, produces milk and, as every child knows, says “moo”?In many rural areas those without much access to formal banking use cattle to preserve their surplus funds. Like a savings account, cows provide a regular income, although in the form of milk (or dung for fuel) rather than interest payments. While you might not be able to withdraw your money from a cow, you can always sell or eat it.This is nothing new. What is probably humanity’s oldest economic model was based on cows. A roughly 4,000-year-old Sumerian tablet discovered at Drehem in modern-day Iraq describes the growth of an idealised herd over 10 years. Like many models, it relies on unrealistic assumptions: no cows ever die and each pair always has a calf.Nevertheless, the Sumerian accountants likely used this tablet to forecast the value (in terms of silver) of the milk and cheese produced by such a herd over 10 years. Archaeologists believe the Drehem tablet was probably an investment plan. The initial number of cows increases exponentially in the same way as adding interest to savings compounds the value over time.Why should this matter to a modern investor? One who faces not a choice of whether to eat or keep their cows but choosing between stocks, bonds, cash or even just spending their nest egg? Well, it helps illuminate how central bankers see the world.Critical to their decisions is the economic theory of the “natural interest” rate — the principle that, even in a world without money, our savings should still produce a return. Indeed, the idea of a herd of livestock naturally growing in number may be where the Sumerians got the idea to charge each other interest.If a farmer lends a neighbour his herd, not only would he expect to get back what he lent — the principal — but also the income produced by the assets, in this case calves. The Sumerian word for interest is mash, which also means “calves”.The English word “capital” has a similar origin. In medieval Europe, livestock was an economic keystone and it was counted by heads of cattle. The Latin for head, capita, then gradually started to refer to wealth more generally and, eventually, to funds of money used by merchants.These days, economists draw a distinction between capital goods and financial capital. Actual things — a business’s premises, software and equipment — are all capital goods. They are commodities used to produce other commodities — an oil rig gives you oil; a cow gives you milk. This physical capital can be lent to a business, just as money is.Following the lead of the 19th century Swedish economist Knut Wicksell — a birth control-advocating iconoclast who was imprisoned for blasphemy — central bankers think the natural interest rate matches the supply and demand for investment funds.Wicksell knew that the commercial banks — not the central banks — created the vast majority of modern money and he wanted to know where the limits were to this process. His answer was that when the interest rate on money — the cost of borrowing — matched the return on “real” assets, the natural interest rate, there would be some sort of stability as the costs and benefits of creating new debt were equal. Otherwise, prices would surge out of control, leading to hyperinflation, or, if rates were set too low, a deflationary spiral.This theory is why central bankers often do not believe they really set interest rates. The long-term natural rate of interest ought to be independent of the short-term rates at which a central bank lends — changes in the money supply will not make cows breed faster or any other investment more productive. So, as central bankers target a particular rate of inflation, they will have to adjust their policy rate.So what does this mean for monetary tightening? Central banks are now engaged in a programme of withdrawing their pandemic support: the Bank of England raised interest rates at its February meeting, in only the second consecutive rise in base rate since 1997.But where will rates end up? Before the pandemic, central bankers argued that lower productivity growth — akin to cows breeding more slowly — would mean that rates would need to be lower for longer. The returns on offer from investing in real assets were lower so more needed to be done to push investors out of cash.It now seems clear that the pandemic has shaken something loose in the global economy: the emergency low interest rates adopted after the 2008 financial crisis seem, after years of not doing very much, to be finally generating inflation.Yet almost two years into the experiment of mass working from home, it also seems hard to believe that the pandemic will, on its own, unleash more than marginal productivity improvements. Indeed, a 2020 economics paper argues that the historical record shows that pandemics typically lead to a 1.5 percentage point fall — not rise — in the natural interest rate. Possibly, the authors argue, this is because there was less need for investment as the death toll meant fewer surviving labourers for each unit of capital.That would be an argument for inflation to fade swiftly as the central bank’s short-term interest rates increase: monetary policy will soon become disinflationary rather than stimulative. Interest rates will rise a bit and then stop.There is another half to this mainstream theory of interest rates, however. The natural rate is not determined only by how productive investment is but also society’s willingness to save and that includes governments and companies. This time things may be different: unlike during historic pandemics the government has been willing to spend to protect jobs.Pressure to keep spending, for better or worse, looks unlikely to fade any time soon, whether that is in the drive to reduce carbon emissions, repairing supply chains, or just satisfying largesse-loving voters.On the other hand, it may be that there is nothing “natural” about the natural interest rate. The mid-20th century British economist John Maynard Keynes, for instance, argued that it was a misleading idea as “interest” had to be a purely financial phenomenon, one that depended not on the return on capital but the desire to hold money and, therefore, our uncertainty about the future.Vaccines may have removed many of the darkest clouds on the horizon — since the central banks began the latest iteration of extraordinary policies — but many investors would be forgiven for thinking that there is still too much to worry about to abandon cash just yet.Gavin Jackson’s book Money In One Lesson was published by PanMacmillan on January 22.

436  Hungary’s conservative government is increasing a pre-election spending spree, paying out the country’s largest pension bonus on Wednesday and giving families big tax rebates later this month.The measures are part of handouts and tax cuts worth more than €5bn that Hungary’s central bank and some economists have said could fuel inflation, prompt a short-term spike in consumption and hit the country’s external trade balance by sparking an influx of imports.They come ahead of a general election in April, when Prime Minister Viktor Orban is expected to face his toughest contest since taking office in 2010 after six opposition parties formed an alliance in an attempt to unseat him.Most polls show the prime minister’s rightwing populist Fidesz party only slightly ahead, with many voters undecided.Orban has previously run a tight fiscal ship. He steered the country away from the brink of default in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis through tough measures such as renationalising most private pension funds and extra taxes on large businesses in the financial, energy, retail and telecommunications sectors.But his government has increased spending in recent years. The country’s budget deficit ballooned to 8.1 per cent of gross domestic product in 2020 as the Covid-19 pandemic took hold. The government factored in a 7.5 per cent deficit for 2021 in its spending plans and forecasts a 5.9 per cent shortfall in 2022.Additional spending announced since the 2022 budget was published last summer included a €550mn pension bonus in November to reflect higher growth and inflation. Other measures included a higher than expected annual increase in pension payments from January, at a total annual cost of €550mn, and a further €1bn bonus in February.In a video posted on Orban’s Facebook page on Monday, in which the prime minister showcased the pension boost in the home of an elderly Budapest resident, he said he was reinstating a bonus that was scrapped in 2009 by the then Socialist government in the midst of the financial crisis.“Apart from the money making a difference, it tastes like satisfaction, doesn’t it?” said Orban. “They took it away, we give it back.”Meanwhile, families with children will get a personal income tax rebate worth a total €1.7bn; members of the armed forces will receive an extra six months’ pay at a cost of €500mn; and workers younger than 25 will no longer pay personal income tax — a move the finance ministry expects to cost an annual €400mn.Last November, the finance ministry also announced a roughly €2bn cut in social security contributions and other taxes. The new rates took effect this year.“The total picture shows a very large fiscal hole that will have to be financed somehow,” said Andras Farkas, an independent retirement consultant. “This will be a particular task in 2022 but several of these measures are permanent, so will be there for subsequent governments to deal with.”Peter Virovacz, an economist at ING, said much of the extra income for households would probably be spent. “At least half of the benefits, but probably closer to 70 per cent, will feed through into consumption,” he said. “Because all of the measures kick in at roughly the same time, an enormous amount of money will flood the economy.”The resulting “consumption shock” would exacerbate inflation, potentially pushing the annual rate close to 8 per cent, he said, compared with last December’s year-on-year 7.4 per cent rate.Opposition leader Peter Marki-Zay said inflation could erode the pensions boost. “A new government will not give one-off pension adjustments but create a sustainable pension system, reliable in the long term,” he wrote in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
437  Marcel Boiteux, the former boss of French nuclear power operator EDF, once famously damned the French state — at the time the company’s only shareholder — as “dishonest and unreliable”.In fact, he was wrong. The French government is most reliable when it comes to exploiting its state-controlled companies for political expediency — even if they are partially privatised, as EDF has been since 2005.President Emmanuel Macron, gearing up for expected re-election this year, appears particularly keen on wielding EDF’s resources for best political effect. Last month his government ordered the company to step up significantly the power it sells (at a loss) to rivals under a competition-boosting tariff scheme.The order allows Macron to keep a promise that household energy prices would not rise by more than 4 per cent. No matter that EDF predicts this will cost €8bn, that it cuts the group’s credit rating a notch and puts yet more pressure on a debt-laden balance sheet. Or that EDF has to find €50bn over the next decade to refurbish its ageing reactors.Now, adding insult to injury, EDF will have to stump up to buy a steam turbine business from General Electric of the US that it does not want. The deal, to be announced on Thursday, will secure jobs and the future of the gigantic Arabelle steam turbines used in French nuclear reactors. But it is clearly beyond the remit of a power generation utility to become a turbine maker.Macron is expected to announce the rescue of the turbine unit himself, and it is not difficult to guess why. In 2014, as economy and industry minister in a Socialist government, Macron backed the politically controversial sale of Alstom’s turbine business to GE. The US group, in the throes of its own restructuring, now wants to sell and Macron needs to bury the politically inconvenient memory of his support for the sale. So EDF has to foot the bill.To be fair, this is not the first time EDF has been called on to sort out political problems. The group was once required to buy dollars it did not need to help resolve a balance of payments problem for the state, according to Boiteux.But the scale of the government’s recent demands has stoked a ferocious debate about whether EDF should ever have been floated. Perhaps it should have been left in the state’s complete control, sheltered from the volatility of markets, with a mission only to serve its public masters.But what would that have achieved? Back in 2005, before its initial public offering and under full state ownership, EDF suffered from the same problems of debt, fleet renewal and competition that it faces now. It was less diversified and, according to one customer, less responsive. And without external shareholders to hold management to account, it was much less transparent.Most importantly, the listing has helped to align the interests of private shareholders and EDF’s famously well-treated employees, who now own 1.3 per cent of the company.One of the ironies of the recent outcry is that, back in 2005, the government had to promise not to raise household electricity prices above inflation to win public and union support for an IPO. Today, employee shareholders are outraged that EDF is being forced to help keep household energy prices low.The debate has also drawn attention to the country’s flawed pricing regime, which leaves EDF exposed to the volatility of gas prices even though the group generates mainly nuclear and hydro power. Setting a regulatory regime that enables more visibility and stability on pricing would transform EDF’s credit rating and its ability to raise funds, insiders say.So the problem is not with EDF’s listing. It is instead with the state’s schizophrenic approach to what it requires from the energy group. It wanted a listing to help drive reform of the quasi-civil servant culture. But the state still insists on treating EDF as it always has. That makes reform nigh-impossible.When Macron unveils the turbine deal on Thursday, reports suggest he will also announce a long-mooted order for new power stations, and perhaps even a capital increase to fund them.That will be welcome news for EDF. But a bolder and longer-term strategy would be to devise a better regulatory framework and then step back. If the state were to cut its stake from the current 84 per cent to 51 per cent, France would still control its strategic energy provider. Yet it would be harder to ignore the voices of other stakeholders who want a more stable and consistent partner in EDF.

439  French president Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday said he had obtained assurances from his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, that there would be no “deterioration or escalation” of the crisis over Ukraine.Macron was speaking on his way to Kyiv, where he met Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky after more than five hours of talks on Monday night with Putin in Moscow.The French president’s tour is the latest western diplomatic attempt to de-escalate tensions caused by Russia’s military build-up of more than 100,000 troops around Ukraine.“For me, it was about arranging things to prevent an escalation and open up new avenues.and that aim has been fulfilled,” Macron told reporters accompanying him on the plane, according to AFP, while acknowledging that Putin was “determined, pretty sure of himself and making his own arguments”.After meeting Zelensky in Kyiv, Macron added that Putin had made commitments about Russian military movements in Belarus on Ukraine’s northern border as well as a broader pledge not to escalate.“He said he would not be the instigator of an escalation,” Macron said during a press conference, cautioning, however, that, “no one (was) naive”.He noted: “The recent deployments are linked to a tense situation and you didn’t hear me announce anything on this yesterday.”Russia said Putin and Macron were “prepared to continue dialogue” on the French proposals but that the discussions had yet to assuage Moscow’s concerns or yield an agreement.“It’s impossible because France is a member of the EU, and of Nato, where it is not the leader. A different country in that bloc is the leader. So how can we speak about any ‘agreements’?” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Tuesday.Western leaders are mounting an eleventh-hour diplomatic push in hopes of convincing Putin to stand down from what they believe could be plans for a renewed invasion of Ukraine.Analysts said any Russian military action would eclipse the casualty toll from the separatist conflict in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas border region, where more than 14,000 have died in the past eight years. Ukraine and the US have accused Russia of fuelling the Donbas war by providing troops and weaponry. Moscow, which invaded and annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in 2014, officially denies helping the Donbas separatists against Kyiv.Russia has stationed more than 106,000 troops at its border with Ukraine and is holding exercises in neighbouring Belarus with about 30,000 troops.Putin has denied he is planning to invade and has blamed the US and Nato, which he accuses of ignoring Moscow’s security needs, for escalating the crisis. Western officials have said Russia’s main demands — that Ukraine never joins Nato and that the western military alliance rolls back its presence — are unacceptable. They have sought instead to address other issues, such as arms control.During their press conference, Macron and Zelensky denied reports that a “Finlandisation” of Ukraine, or making it a neutral country by dropping ambitions to join the Nato military alliance, had been discussed.“I didn’t make any comparisons,” Macron said. “I said [to Putin] that ending Nato’s open doors would pose a problem for several European states, including Finland and Sweden for example,” he added, referring to fresh debates in those neutral countries about joining the alliance. He added that he had “never used” the word Finlandisation, contrary to reports in several news outlets earlier on Tuesday.Zelensky said: “’Finlandisation’ of Ukraine.This is the first time I’m hearing it.”Peskov said Russian forces, some of which have travelled from as far as the Pacific in recent weeks, would leave Belarus after the drills but declined to give a date for their withdrawal.Macron insisted after meeting German chancellor Olaf Scholz and Polish president Andrzej Duda in Berlin that Putin and Zelensky had committed to re-engaging in the “Normandy format” talks — which involve Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany — to keep negotiations moving forward.“We have to find the ways and means to have this challenging and important dialogue with Russia in different formats,” he said. “In the coming days and weeks, we will have talks in the Normandy format, because that is the political framework for resolving the Ukraine crisis.”Another session of the Normandy talks will be held in Berlin on Thursday, he added, although deep differences remain between Moscow and Kyiv on how to implement the faltering 2015 Minsk agreements.Jen Psaki, White House press secretary, reacted cautiously to Macron’s comments about a de-escalation.“We’re encouraged by any efforts at diplomacy,” said Psaki. “If there is diplomatic progress, we would welcome that, but we will believe it when we see it with our own eyes at the border.“We still don’t have any prediction of what President Putin will do. We can’t control what Russia will do next. What I think President Macron played a role in doing yesterday is making clear.that there will be massive consequences should Putin choose to further invade Ukraine,” Psaki said.Additional reporting by Polina Ivanova in Moscow and James Politi in Washington
440  Hundreds of scientists from across Europe have launched Stick to Science, a campaign to persuade the EU to let the UK and Switzerland take part in its €95bn research and development programme.Brussels has blocked British and Swiss associate membership of the current seven-year Horizon Europe initiative, which began late last year — “putting political disputes ahead of science collaboration” — the campaigners said. Both countries have played prominent roles in previous EU science programmes.Initial signatories of the initiative include more than 200 individual European scientists, including Nobel Laureates, as well as research organisations such as the Wellcome Trust and Royal Society in the UK. They said science would suffer across the continent and not just in the two excluded countries.“Excluding the UK and Switzerland is punishment for Europe. It’s a sadomasochistic decision,” said Antoine Petit, chair and chief executive of CNRS, France’s national research organisation.Horizon Europe is the largest R&D programme so far in a series that the EU has run over the past few decades to support science, cross-European collaboration and industrial competitiveness.UK participation was included in the December 2020 Brexit deal but has been blocked by continued political disagreements, particularly over renegotiations to the trading arrangements in Northern Ireland. If the UK and Switzerland joined the programme as associate members, their contributions would add an estimated €17bn to its €95bn budget.British scientists say they are already in limbo after successfully being awarded European grants in recent weeks, without clarity on whether they can accept or will need to find alternative funding. Some researchers have quit academic roles in the UK in recent months to join EU universities that provide security over the right to receive Horizon funding, and others are negotiating possible moves.Prof Chris Drakeley at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine was informed last week that he had been approved to lead an €8mn EU project to test a new malaria diagnostic — and then the following day was told the grant would not proceed because of the uncertainty over the UK’s status with Horizon.He has until next week to clarify whether he is willing to relinquish his coordinating role to one of his EU academic partners, France’s Pasteur Institute, and continue as an associate in the consortium, on condition he can provide assurances of finding research money elsewhere.“We are in complete limbo, in a no man’s land with the UK and the EU not knowing what they are doing,” he said. “What they gave with one hand, they took away with the other.”Andrea Ferrari, professor of nanotechnology at Cambridge university, recently received a European Research Council grant but was unclear whether he could accept it.“We’re in a holding pattern where we will lose out on money because we are not allowed to apply and we will lose key collaboration with European partners,” he said. “This is like a plane. The programme is starting in the next few months, and it will be very difficult to get in once you take off.”“If we don’t work with our Swiss and British colleagues they will find collaboration outside Europe,” said Petit at CNRS.There are signs that this is already happening. The Swiss and UK governments are negotiating their own bilateral research agreement and drawing up plans for a new global science programme, known in British science policy circles as Plan B, in case they cannot join Horizon Europe.The European Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
441  Market participants were quick to detect a “hawkish pivot” in the European Central Bank’s subtle word changes at its press conference last week. ECB president Christine Lagarde declined to repeat her earlier judgment that an interest rate rise this year was “highly unlikely”. Instead she reported “unanimous concern” among the euro’s monetary policymakers over the latest inflation number, which at 5.1 per cent was higher than they had expected.It was enough to send euro bond markets into a minor tailspin, with a jump in yields that was particularly large in economies with the most debt-laden governments.Taking the changed language as a signal to sell was understandable. Many economic observers take their cue from the increasingly hawkish rhetoric and action of the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. If those central banks are behind the curve, so, they conclude, is the ECB. Market pricing suggests eurozone policy rates could go up as soon as June.That analysis, however, ignores another part of Lagarde’s message: that the eurozone differs in important ways from both the US and the UK. She is right — and markets would be wise to heed it.Above all, continental Europe has been much more successful in bringing people back into work — probably in large part thanks to the bloc’s better-established furlough schemes — than the US and the UK, where the number of jobs still lags pre-pandemic trends. In aggregate, the monetary union now has more people in work than before the pandemic, and unemployment is the lowest since the euro’s creation. (Nevertheless, there are worrying differences between euro countries — notably, Germany lags behind its peers in recovering pre-pandemic employment rates.)As a result of this lack of labour market scarring, the euro’s interest rate setters see little sign of wage pressures. If anything, Lagarde suggested she would welcome somewhat faster wage growth: “I am not here saying that there should be wage moderation”, she said last Thursday, in sharp contrast with the Bank of England governor’s warning against strengthening wage demands on the same day.That is not the only way the euro area distinguishes itself from economies across the Channel or the Atlantic. The eurozone has not seen anything like America’s enormous shift in consumer spending towards manufactured goods away from services. And while shortages of workers are felt everywhere, the continent does not have to contend with the additional negative labour supply shock the UK has inflicted on itself through Brexit — another point mentioned by Lagarde.It no doubt serves the ECB that markets do some of its work for it: the recent sell-off in effect brings forward some of the tightening that will eventually come. In remarks to the European Parliament this week, however, Lagarde hinted markets may have got carried away.The paradox is that since its strategy review last year, the ECB has had in place a commendably clear — if intricate — set of criteria for when it will tighten. Medium- and long-term inflation expectations very close to the ECB’s target testify to the new framework’s effectiveness.In the short term, however, markets are driven by their second-guessing of how the euro’s central bankers will react to the discomfort of prolonged above-target inflation. Bringing even more focus to the ECB’s criteria could help both markets and central bankers keep their heads cool.
442  Europe has followed the US in setting out plans for a massive increase in semiconductor manufacturing, as Brussels attempts to secure supplies of the chips that drive the global economy.Unveiling a €43bn investment plan, the European Commission said it wanted to use state aid to promote research and production of higher technology chips used in computers, smartphones, vehicles and other products.The coronavirus pandemic had “painfully exposed the vulnerability” of Europe’s supply chains, said commission president Ursula von der Leyen, with production lines for cars and other goods hit by shortages.The Chips Act aims to double the EU’s share of the semiconductor market from 10 to 20 per cent by 2030, which would require quadrupling production.The EU is following plans by President Joe Biden’s US administration for a $52bn package to subsidise semiconductor manufacturing. Other governments are also trying to improve semiconductor supply chains.Under the plan announced on Tuesday, the European Commission and national governments would spend €11bn to build three pilot facilities for any company to use. Member states and businesses were expected to invest a further €32bn by 2030.French industry commissioner Thierry Breton has convinced colleagues to adapt EU state aid rules to allow big subsidies for cutting-edge factories.The Act would require companies receiving subsidies to prioritise European customers in times of supply shortage. The EU could also widen the measure to all businesses if the US or other countries applied such controls.Intel, the US chipmaker, plans to invest €20bn to build two chip fabrication plants, known as fabs, expected to be in Germany, as well as support facilities such as packaging and research, which would require further investment.France, Italy and the Netherlands are also in the running for different activities.Digital Europe, which represents technology companies, said it was “unclear” if all the money for the EU plans would be forthcoming.Cecilia Bonefeld-Dahl, director-general, said: “The EU attracted just 3 per cent of global investment for chip factories in 2020 and a lot of work is needed to push this figure upwards.”Some EU countries fear that bigger states will outbid them for chip investment. It could start a “race to the bottom”, warned one EU diplomat, with pressure to permit such aid in other industries.Acknowledging concerns over a “subsidy race”, Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner, said the semiconductor industry was a special case. A “rarely used” procedure in the EU’s founding treaty could create a “bespoke approach” for new plants, she said.Large semiconductor plants, or “fabs”, have huge price tags and “would not exist in Europe if we did not do something”, Vestager said.Companies said aid would need to match the 40 per cent of construction costs offered by international competitors such as South Korea.Greg Slater, Intel’s regulatory affairs director, told the Financial Times that state aid to support cutting edge manufacturing was “essential to Europe’s ecosystem”.He said Intel would look closely at the export control proposals.“The devil is in the details. The US has that authority. What really matters is what is defined as a crisis and how far will [Europe] go with that authority. It just depends on how they implement it,” Slater said.Member states and the European parliament must still approve the plans.
443  The writer is international policy director at Stanford University’s Cyber Policy CenterLast December, the European Commission announced infringement procedures against Poland, on the back of growing concerns that Warsaw’s ruling party is seeking to sideline EU laws and politicise its own judiciary. If that were not bad enough, research by cyber security watchdog Citizen Lab suggested the Polish government was using spyware against its opponents. Alongside its infringement case, the European Commission must urgently address these latest violations, which represent a new digital frontier of the rule of law.Researchers at Citizen Lab have identified a series of cyber intrusions into the devices of Poland’s judges, journalists, opposition leaders and their lawyer, including during the 2019 election campaign. The hacks — which were facilitated by NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware — have already wreaked damage in the lives of those targeted. For example, sensitive material gleaned from opposition politician Krzysztof Brejza was broadcast through state media channels. “They were at the table during strategic political meetings and went with me to the bathroom and the bedroom,” he said in an interview this month. An avalanche of press rumours insinuating fraud, which were repeated by the national broadcaster, prompted his resignation as campaign leader for the opposition party Civic Platform.After an initial denial, the Polish government conceded it had purchased Pegasus software, but has defended its actions by claiming it has acted in line with due process and legal provisions. It refutes having used the tools for political gain. Still, the Polish Auditing Office (NIK) alleges more than 500 of its employees’ devices have been hacked. Legal exemptions can be granted by agencies and entities which report to the organisation which is using the spyware. It is easy to argue that an activist or journalist is a risk to national security, in order to justify surveillance. This vicious cycle must be broken.Unfortunately, EU law relating to the use of spyware by member states is unclear. When Brussels updated its dual-use export control rules last year, surveillance technologies were included on the controls list. Before granting an export licence, responsible authorities would have to be convinced these tools would not be co-opted for human rights violations. While a step in the right direction, seeking to prevent exports only tackles one side of the problem: domestic use of these tools remains unregulated.It is good news that the EU has proved its determination to address rule of law violations in Poland. Yet further action on the use of spyware is not straightforward. It is currently unclear which EU governments use NSO’s Pegasus and similar systems. Few member states offer transparency over use of stealth hacking systems against their own citizens. Addressing the deployment of spyware by Polish authorities is likely to be unpopular if it puts pressure on all member states to come clean about their own uses of this technology.The Polish Senate is in the process of starting an investigation into allegations of state-sponsored hacking of opposition politicians’ phones. It is also drafting a new law to prevent intrusive software being deployed again in future. However, the ruling party has boycotted it. Brejza is trying to sue Poland’s ruling party leader for slander, but he is reliant on the Ministry of Justice choosing to take up the case. Until the opposition wins a majority, legal change does not seem possible. Even with the political will to pursue these cases, prosecuting them would be a challenge. “Judges have no tools to realistically check whether the services are abusing their powers, and there is no one who could verify this later,” Wojciech Klicki of Panoptykon, a Polish NGO set up to oppose surveillance technologies, told The Guardian.For its own part, NSO Group claims to have a zero-tolerance policy on the use of its tools against political targets, but how can it enforce this? So far, the company has not managed to prevent the use of its tools against government opponents in Poland and Hungary or even Israel, its domestic market.Whether there will be any accountability depends to a large extent on EU leaders. Those pondering Poland’s alleged violations should seriously consider the democratic implications of spyware being used against opposition leaders, journalists and judges. This case should also serve as a warning for other European governments. At the very least, we need to impose significant limits on the use of spyware, or ideally, an outright ban on tools that are prone to abuse.
444  Somers Forge, a manufacturer of bespoke steel parts for the aerospace, automotive and nuclear industries based in the English midlands, has operated a US sales office for more than 30 years.In April, the branch will close, a victim of tariffs on steel imports introduced in 2018 ago on national security grounds by then president Donald Trump.“We’ve held on and held on with the hope that our government would succeed in revoking them [the tariffs],” said Tammy Inglis, finance director at Somers Forge, one of Britain’s biggest forgings specialists. “We are now into our fourth year and with all the added manufacturing costs, in particular the high energy costs, we can’t subsidise the branch any more. It’s not sustainable.”Under the terms of the tariffs, US importers can apply for exemptions on certain products if they cannot be sourced domestically but Somers Forge is among dozens of small and medium-sized UK specialists that have been hit. Trade body UK Steel estimates that exports to the US have fallen from 351,000 tonnes in 2017 to just over 190,000 in 2020.The US and the EU last October agreed to suspend the tariffs — 25 per cent on steel and 10 per cent on aluminium to manufacturers from the bloc — from January 1 but the UK government failed to secure a matching breakthrough.The UK industry was already at a competitive disadvantage to European peers because of higher energy costs, an issue that has become even more critical amid the recent surge in wholesale gas and electricity prices. Somers Forge is among companies that have raised concerns with the government over costs.Japan on Monday reached a similar deal with the US, with Washington announcing that it would suspend the 25 per cent levy on imports up to a certain quantity. The agreement does not cover aluminium.The Financial Times reported in December that the US was delaying a deal with Britain because of concerns over London’s threats to change post-Brexit trading rules in Northern Ireland. Talks between the UK and the US on the issue restarted last month but for Somers Forge a deal, even if it comes this month, will be too late to reverse the decision to close its Michigan-based site.Bright Steels, a family-run company in Yorkshire that makes steel bars for use in precision engineering applications, exports between 50 and 60 per cent of its output, including to the US. Philip Jackson, managing director, said the company had lost business to EU rivals as well as domestic American producers as a result of the tariffs.He said he remained hopeful that if a deal was struck soon the company could yet recover some of that volume.James Brand, managing director of foundries at United Cast Bar, a cast iron specialist that operates a foundry in Chesterfield, decided last year to launch a new size range at its site in Spain in order to avoid the 25 per cent levy.“We heard a trade agreement was getting closer between the US and the EU so decided to make that size range in Spain,” he said. “It is business lost from the UK.” Brand said that if a deal could be done quickly, then the company might be able to bring some of what was moved to Spain to the UK.“Britain is being left behind and strung along,” said John Healey, a Yorkshire-based Labour MP who has campaigned extensively on behalf of the industry. “People have a right to expect better from the government. Incompetent ministers are leaving steelmakers to pay the price, and the UK is continuing to lose out on the big US market.”Gareth Stace, director-general of UK Steel, warned that the lifting of the tariffs was “essential to the ability of the UK steel sector to compete in this important market and recover lost sales”. While US customers had been “reasonably successful” in securing exemptions to allow them to continue to import some UK steel tariff free, Stace added that “even this could be under threat if those customers, tired of waiting for a UK deal, determine that sourcing from the EU reduces administration and increases certainty for them”. Britain’s largest producers warn of lost business opportunities as a result of the tariffs. The need for exclusions for individual products and customers means “we are very limited in our competitiveness towards existing customers and offerings towards new business opportunities”, said Tata Steel.The tariffs are an added burden that manufacturers could do without at a time when soaring wholesale electricity and gas prices have already eroded profit margins. Although most companies have long-term contracts in place, many worry that a sustained increase in prices could undermine companies’ competitiveness. The government has so far stopped short of helping energy intensive users.UCB’s Brand said he expected his energy bills to jump from 10-12 per cent of operating costs last year to 20 per cent by this autumn. The company is trying to pass on some of the extra expenditure but “this ultimately means higher prices for the consumers”.At Somers Forge, Inglis said the company typically buys energy in advance for 18 months to two years. The hedging helped to insulate the business from last year’s peaks but the outlook for this year is less certain as Inglis has only locked in 25 per cent of the company’s needs from March onwards. “We are getting more and more exposed.”The Department for International Trade said talks with the US had started and its focus was on “reaching a speedy resolution that lifts these tariffs promptly and clears the way for our thriving trading relationship to grow”.
445  France’s trade deficit in goods widened to a record €84.7bn last year, creating what its finance minister Bruno Le Maire called “a black mark” over the economy.The 31 per cent increase in the country’s trade deficit in goods came as its economy rebounded strongly from the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, with annual growth of 7 per cent last year.Soaring energy prices last year boosted the value of French goods imports to 3 per cent above 2019 levels — before the Covid-19 crisis disrupted global trade. Meanwhile, the country’s manufacturers lost market share in exports, leaving them 2 per cent below pre-crisis levels, according to French customs.Goods exports from France’s main EU trading partners were between 3 and 9 per cent above pre-pandemic levels, customs said in a statement, adding: “France’s loss of market share, almost uninterrupted since 2010, will continue in 2021.”Le Maire said the figures highlighted “the industrial weakening over the past 30 years”. Emmanuel Macron’s government had been tackling the problem by “creating a more favourable tax environment, by lowering production taxes, by training and qualifying employees for new industrial professions”, he added.“There is no other solution to restore France’s external trade balance than to reindustrialise our country massively and quickly,” Le Maire told France Inter radio.In contrast, the country’s trade balance for services improved to a record surplus of €36.2bn, meaning that overall foreign trade still provided a slight boost to the economy last year.Franck Riester, trade minister, said it was “important to look at the full picture of our commercial activity”. He added that “strong export sectors are still below their 2019 level”. These include aerospace manufacturing, which stands at 57 per cent of pre-pandemic exports.Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said large parts of French manufacturing were in “sectors that were doing quite poorly due to overcapacity before the pandemic and are still struggling to rebound from the crisis”, such as aerospace and car making.Other key French industries suffered setbacks last year, after Australia cancelled a A$90bn ($64bn) submarine contract with defence contractor Naval Group, and pharmaceutical group Sanofi halted development of its Covid vaccine based on messenger RNA technology.France’s trade surplus in goods with the UK shrank last year to €7.6bn, down 40 per cent from 2019 before the pandemic and Brexit disrupted cross-Channel commerce. Its deficit in goods trade with China has widened by 27 per cent to €34.6bn since 2019.Vistesen said: “Part of this could be a eurozone-wide phenomenon, as the bloc’s trade deficit with China has been widening in recent years.”The French central bank said the country’s overall current account deficit — including both goods and services — was €25.8bn last year, down from €43.7bn in 2020, but significantly higher than the €7.1bn in 2019.Riester said continued rises in energy prices were likely to mean that the country’s trade deficit would remain elevated this year. BNP Paribas forecast the French trade deficit in goods would rise to €100bn this year.
446  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
447  French officials said Vladimir Putin had moved towards de-escalating the Ukraine crisis by promising not to undertake any new “military initiatives” and agreeing to withdraw thousands of Russian troops from Belarus after the completion of planned exercises. If an agreement — brokered during talks with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron on Monday — is confirmed by Putin, it could ease tensions in the region after Russia amassed more than 100,000 troops on Ukraine’s borders.Dmitry Peskov, Kremlin spokesperson, told the Financial Times that Putin and Macron were “prepared to continue dialogue” on the French proposals but that the discussions had yet to fully assuage Moscow’s concerns. He told reporters on Tuesday that Putin and Macron had yet to reach an agreement.“It’s impossible, because France is a member of the EU, and of Nato, where it is not the leader. A different country in that bloc is the leader. So how can we speak about any ‘agreements’?” Peskov said.Russia and Belarus are this month conducting huge joint military exercises involving a contingent of as many as 30,000 Russian troops. Peskov said Russian forces, some of which have travelled from as far as the Pacific in recent weeks, would leave after the drills but declined to give a date for their withdrawal.Asked about a reported French proposal to give Ukraine a neutral status akin to Finland’s during the cold war, Peskov said Kyiv’s pledge to retake the annexed Crimean peninsula amounted to “anti-Finlandisation” and warned that western countries were not taking Russia’s security concerns seriously enough.“For now, of course, we can’t state that we’re sensing any real ways towards a solution,” Peskov said. “Tensions are rising day by day [.] so de-escalation is really, really needed.”Neither Putin nor Macron referred directly to a deal at a news conference after five hours of talks, although France’s president said Putin had assured him of his willingness to talk about de-escalation.Putin was combative and critical of Nato, blaming the west and Ukraine for the crisis, but said Russia would do “everything possible to reach compromises acceptable to everyone” on European security.“I think it’s entirely likely that some of his ideas and suggestions, even if it’s probably too early to talk about them, could become part of the basis for our next joint steps,” Putin said of Macron’s proposals.Russia is demanding Nato pledges never to admit Ukraine and to roll back its eastward expansion, essentially rewriting the post-cold war security order in Europe. Western officials said those requests were unacceptable but attempted to find common ground with Moscow on other issues, such as arms control.Macron, who is set to meet Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, in Kyiv on Tuesday acknowledged the deep differences between Russia and the west over the Ukraine conflict and said the sides were looking for “new solutions” to ensure security and stability.“We are conscious of the gravity of the situation and the imperative need in the interest of all to find the path of preserving peace and stability in Europe,” Macron said after the talks. “There is still time.” According to French officials, there was an agreement not to undertake new military initiatives and to have a broad dialogue on Russian troop deployments.Macron said the aim was to build “concrete security guarantees” for all the states in the region, including Russia, Ukraine and members of the EU, which would allow the building of a “new security and stability order in Europe”.Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, on Tuesday said his country would not “not cross our red lines”, which include changes in the country’s foreign policy goals of joining the EU and Nato being forced upon Ukraine, or compromises on sovereignty and territorial integrity.“We are with interest all waiting for the signals that Mr Macron brought from Moscow,” Kuleba added.Putin and Macron began their negotiations sitting alone at opposite ends of an enormous oval table, which the Kremlin said was a social-distancing precaution, before moving on to a lavish dinner that included langoustines, Russian fish soup and a choice of sturgeon or venison.The wine on offer was from a vineyard on the Black Sea that the jailed opposition activist Alexei Navalny, Putin’s most prominent opponent, has claimed is part of a palace complex allegedly built for the president’s use. Putin has denied owning the palace.Additional reporting by Polina Ivanova in Moscow and Roman Olearchyk in Kyiv
448  It is sited in a former electrical substation in the historic centre of the capital, and indeed there is a unit in the basement still powering Prague’s trams. But the Pudils assure me there will be no hum or vibrations to distract from the three exhibition spaces they have created in the 5,700 sq m building.They bought it seven years ago, though the idea of establishing a Kunsthalle had been germinating for years before that. “We already had the idea of doing something for Prague, but we needed to find the right place — and then the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity [to buy the substation] came along,” says Pavlína.Neither she nor Petr comes from a collecting background. “I was born in communist Czechoslovakia, in 1974, under a socialist regime,” says Petr over Zoom from Prague, “and it was quite difficult to be educated in any sort of art at the time. There was the National Museum, but it was like a hidden institution and the regime had no interest in promoting it. My first contact with art was after the revolution.” Pavlína chimes in: “My story is the same, the only things I might have seen were reproductions of Alphonse Mucha posters.”Things have changed a lot for the couple since then. Petr’s businesses prospered — in real estate, chemicals and venture capital — and almost 20 years ago they bought their first work of art, a painting by Slovak Zdeňka Marschalová. “It captivated us at first sight and we had it on our walls for a long time, although otherwise we often renew works at home,” says Petr. “[Former president] Václav Havel was an inspiration, he opened my mind to art, he was an advocate for culture in general, but was quite visionary about what Prague could be and its position as a cultural crossroad in Europe.”They started to haunt galleries, initially smaller Czech ones, but as Pavlína says, “We soon realised we wanted to collect Czech and central European art, but also we wanted to put Czech art into a more international context.” They started travelling to art fairs and institutions around the world, particularly influenced by the programming at the Louisiana in Denmark and by the operational models of US and UK galleries.Last year the Pudils made a trip to London with their chief curator, Christelle Havranek, to visit Frieze — but they didn’t buy anything. Petr says, “We prefer to buy artworks displayed in galleries or artists’ studios”, rather than at a fair. “If you see the whole exhibition in the gallery, you can absorb all the interactions between the artworks.” Rather chillingly for the British art market, he adds that his collections manager asked him not to buy art in the UK “because, post-Brexit, it is so much more expensive and complicated these days”.I ask them if they always have to agree before deciding to buy. They laugh, and each waits for the other to reply. “We have the same taste: 99 per cent of the time we agree, fortunately,” Petr offers. “If there is no agreement, there is no deal.”Their collection now numbers more than 600 pieces, including works by Zhanna Kadyrova, Krištof Kintera, Alicja Kwade and Lina Lapelyte, as well as internationally known names: Marcel Duchamp, Max Ernst, William Kentridge and Tomás Saraceno.The museum has one permanent installation, “Cabinet of Electrical Curiosities”, a project by Mark Dion. It tells the story of the building through the industrial objects found on site: the enamel signs, switches and transformers are assembled into a sort of contemporary Kunstkammer. The programme, with six to eight exhibitions every year, will focus on contemporary and modern art. Taking its cue from the building, the inaugural show is Kinetismus: 100 Years of Electricity in Art, which will explore how electricity has transformed artistic practice from the start of the 20th century to the present. It is curated by Havranek, Lívia Nolasco-Rózsás and the Austrian post-conceptual artist Peter Weibel.Exhibitions will feature loans from the Pudils, as well as from private lenders and institutions such as Tate and the Centre Pompidou. About 20 private collectors have already loaned works. “That way,” says Petr, “we will gradually build a leading collection of central European art.” But “we also aim to bring the best of international art to Prague, and so make a dialogue with the local art scene”.The museum is ambitious — it has a staff of 30 — and as well as running the exhibition programme there is an educational arm, a design store, a restaurant and a café. The couple reckons the project costs them €30mn-€35mn for acquisitions and converting the building and anticipate annual running costs will be in “the low millions of euros”. “The Kunsthalle is non-governmental and non-profit, funded by our family foundation,” says Petr, “but the goal is to cover the running costs.” To this end there is an entrance fee of €10 for those aged over 26. It has a membership programme and might even look at crowdfunding.Is it going to be sustainable in the long term, though? The Pudils have three children between them and now, with the Kunsthalle, they have “another child to be substantially supported”, says Petr. But, he adds, “We had this in our mind from the beginning, and we hope that we can find patrons and supporters going forward.”I ask if they are still adding to their own collection. “Yes!” they reply in unison, and Pavlína says, “Nowadays we are more focused on buying what is missing from the collection — for sure, it’s a never-ending process.”Kunsthalle Praha opens on February 22 with ‘Kinetismus’, which runs until August, kunsthallepraha.org
449  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.It’s launch day for the EU’s long-anticipated (and internally disputed) Chips Act, which seeks to bolster the bloc’s production and development of semiconductors with billions in EU and national subsidies. We’ll run you through the latest draft and lay out the issues that still need ironing out.Still on tech, as the Financial Times reports exclusively, a senior US trade official has written to German MEP Andreas Schwab, who is leading the negotiations on the Digital Markets Act, to lobby for broadening the scope of the regulation so as to include tech companies from other countries.As for the Russia tensions, after having met Vladimir Putin at a safe distance (and without aides) in the Kremlin yesterday, France’s Emmanuel Macron is getting together with Germany’s chancellor and Poland’s president in the so-called Weimar Triangle in Berlin today. I’ll bring you up to date with where things stand and what this says about Warsaw’s ambition to be seen as a security player.Industrial policy is back as the EU unveils a plan today to spend billions of euros to build semiconductor factories in the bloc, write Andy Bounds and Javier Espinoza in Brussels.The Chips Act, a draft of which was obtained by Europe Express ahead of publication, will tweak state-aid rules so that taxpayers’ money can fund fabrication plants rather than just research centres.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said last week the bloc foresaw €42bn of mostly public funding for the plans, but commission departments were still squabbling over where the cash would come from last night.The aid would cover 100 per cent of the funding gap between a company choosing the EU instead of elsewhere. Some governments worldwide offer support worth 40 per cent of the cost of a typical €20bn factory.To qualify under the EU’s proposed regime, a project would need to meet a “first of a kind” test to prove it is more advanced than any other facility built or set to be built in Europe, the draft documents say.Thierry Breton, the internal market commissioner behind the plan, told the FT that he had found €12bn to build three pilot production and packaging facilities available to any EU company. “That will benefit everybody. That’s huge,” he said.One could be in Belgium, he added. Some €6bn would come from the EU budget by 2030, raiding the Horizon research fund and other areas, and the rest from industry and member states. National governments had pledged €30bn more to subsidise factories, he said. Publicly announced commitments from national governments fall far short of this figure, however.The Chips Act aims to quadruple EU microchip production by 2030 and double its global market share to 20 per cent. Chip shortages have slowed production of cars, computers and other tech products and spurred government intervention worldwide.The act will also establish a monitoring system allowing governments to restrict exports from EU-based companies that do not prioritise production of chips for the bloc when there is a global shortage. They could be fined for non-compliance. They would also need to provide confidential information about their customers and production methods.The legislation — which had to overcome internal resistance from more pro-market commissioners — must also be approved by member states and the European parliament.Some smaller member states fear that EU capitals will end up competing with each other, and that those with the largest budgets — Germany, France and Italy — would outbid others for plants that might have been built anyway.EU states are wooing Intel, which has committed to $20bn of investment in chip manufacturing in Europe, with the fab itself most likely to go to Germany. France, Italy and the Netherlands are also in the running for a share of chips investments.“What is the problem we are trying to solve? We have a temporary shortage. The market will respond, ” said one EU diplomat. “There could be overproduction; we could waste a lot of money.”Spain was the source of more than a third of all eurozone jobs created last year and the country’s youth unemployment is down 10 percentage points on its level a year ago — reflecting a global trend that has defied expectations of huge job losses in the wake of the pandemic. (More here)A frequent saying making the rounds in Brussels these days is that if anything, Vladimir Putin has managed to bring the Europeans closer together. At least on a diplomatic level, that seems to be the case.Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, was in Brussels yesterday showcasing his country’s diplomatic acumen when it comes to Ukraine and Russia. Fears over the situation in Ukraine have even prompted a reappraisal in Warsaw of its battles with the EU, with Duda extending an olive branch last week by proposing a law that could take steps towards alleviating a rule-of-law irritant in EU-Polish relations.“Good exchange with President Andrzej Duda on the security situation and Russia’s military build-up,” tweeted European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen after meeting with Duda yesterday. “We are co-ordinating deeply our preparedness, including on energy supply, and on sanctions to respond to any further escalation.”In a follow-up tweet, she added: “We also discussed the objective of having a robust judicial system in Poland, in line with EU standards.”Today, Duda is joining France’s President Emmanuel Macron, who is just back from Moscow and Kyiv, and Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz, who returned from a short visit to Washington yesterday — to compare notes and revive the so-called Weimar Triangle in Berlin.This loose format was founded in 1991, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and sought to foster European integration and help Poland join euro-Atlantic structures. At a leaders’ level, it was put on hold for more than a decade, with the last meeting having taken place in 2011.The three countries got together slightly more often over this period in other formats, with foreign ministers gathering in Paris in October 2020 after an eight-year hiatus, mainly focusing on Belarus’s crackdown following the contested re-election of leader Alexander Lukashenko.Despite the recent rallying around the flag over security issues, some capitals do have their suspicions about how long Poland will play ball. “I don’t remember the last time a love triangle ended well,” quipped an EU diplomat.
450  In the face of a huge Russian military build-up in Belarus, the Ukrainian army is turning to Britain’s wartime ‘blitz spirit’ for inspiration.“Winston Churchill said we shall fight them on the beaches, in the fields and in the streets, and so will we,” said Vladislav Gorban’, a lieutenant in the Ukrainian border force. “We will hope for the best but prepare for the worst.”Gorban’ serves in Novi Yarylovychi, a sleepy town of about 500 people next to the biggest crossing point on the Ukrainian-Belarusian frontier. Normally quiet, it is now the focal point for mounting fears of a new war in Europe.At issue is what Nato has described as Russia’s largest military deployment to Belarus since the end of the cold war. Moscow has sent 30,000 troops to its ally ahead of joint military exercises that will run for 10 days from February 10. Many western experts fear the troop build-up will be used to spearhead a huge offensive against the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.Russia has denied it intends to invade Ukraine. But on Thursday last week, the Belarus defence ministry released images of live-fire exercises in the west of the country that illustrated the extraordinary firepower Moscow has concentrated close to its western neighbour. The footage showed jets flying in formation, tanks firing and manoeuvring and surface-to-air missile systems releasing volleys of rockets.The deployment “is completely unprecedented”, said Konrad Muzyka, of Rochan Consulting, a military analysis company. He noted the huge transfers of hardware from thousands of miles away in Russia’s far east. “We are looking at about 60 to 70 per cent of the combat potential of the Eastern Military District being moved to Belarus,” he said.Some observers think Russia might deploy the troops it now has in Belarus together with forces stationed elsewhere along the Ukrainian border to attack its neighbour in a pincer movement on several fronts. Novi Yarylovychi is just over 200km from Kyiv, down a flat, straight motorway, with barely an obstacle in sight.The border crossing itself also offers little in the way of resistance. Gorban’ pointed to a shallow trench stretching between rows of tall silver birches. “There’s no way this would stop a 21st-century tank,” he said.Meanwhile, the only protection on the 700-metre stretch of road to the Belarusian checkpoint is a simple barbed wire-topped fence and some puny-looking wooden barricades lying forlornly on the roadside.Locals are surprised at the flimsiness of the Ukrainian defences. “How come there are only wooden stakes on our side, and the Belarusians have these great big concrete piles?” asked Alexander Dolya, a resident of Novi Yarylovychi.Drawing water from a roadside well, Dolya said the weak defences were typical of the low-key Ukrainian military presence. “Where are all the tanks?” he asked in bewilderment. “Why aren’t we doing anything?”Gorban’ said that while the border appeared calm, preparations were being made behind the scenes. An “operational reserve” had been deployed to reinforce the border guards, he said, adding that its precise size was a military secret.Authorities said local men were also being formed into territorial defence units and trained for combat. Officials say they will be allocated weapons and uniforms if and when the Russians attack.One man who will need no persuading is Boris Gromov, a local insurance agent and reserve lieutenant colonel in the Ukrainian army. “I’ll be the first to take up arms,” he said. “Defending one’s fatherland is the finest profession.”He said the local government had also been drawing up plans for the evacuation of civilians in the event of an invasion, identifying assembly points and preparing to lay on dozens of buses to move people to safety.“We’ve also been told to report on any strangers in the area,” he said, amid rising fears about covert operations by Russian provocateurs. US intelligence services believe Moscow could be preparing to fabricate an attack by Ukraine or the west and use it as a pretext for an invasion.The mood continues to be jittery. “It’s really scary, watching TV,” said Marina Ponomarenko, a teacher in Novi Yarylovychi. “Where can we run to? How do I save my eight-year-old daughter?”She said she hoped that the threat of sanctions by the US and EU would be enough to deter Russian president Vladimir Putin from sending in his troops. “He knows the west will crush him,” she said. “It’s the only thing holding him back.”Older people in the town, however, seemed less perturbed at the prospect of a new round of fighting between Russia and Ukraine. “Let them invade,” said Mykola, a pensioner. “We’ll just sit in the cellar and wait it out.”Additional reporting by Polina Ivanova in Moscow
451  Juan Manuel Canals and Basma Eddaheri, both in their 20s, are part of the reason why Spain has confounded predictions of massive job losses in Covid’s wake.During the pandemic, Canals started work as an IT engineer; Eddaheri has been staffing a Covid helpline for a month.Their first experiences of work mirror broader changes in the Spanish economy. More people are now employed by sectors such as health, IT and social services than was the case when Covid-19 hit just under two years ago.Such growth — partly fuelled by state spending — helps explain why the number of people in work has hit a record 20mn. Unemployment has fallen to its lowest level since 2008, roughly half the one in four rate once predicted by groups such as the OECD.“It’s very easy to get jobs in this sector,” says Canals, an engineer at Kyndryl, an IT services company spun off from IBM last year. “As someone who has just come into the labour market I see many opportunities.I feel very optimistic.”At a different extreme of the job market, Eddaheri also expresses optimism after being aided by Fundación Iter, a Madrid non-profit to help young people find work.“I like the fact that I can help people,” she said. “My contract [on the Covid helpline] is for three months, but afterwards I would like to do something else like it.”Unemployment has been Spain’s glaring failing for decades and the country’s jobless rate of 13 per cent remains twice the EU average, as does its youth unemployment rate of 31 per cent.But strikingly more than one-third of all eurozone jobs created last year were in Spain. The country’s youth unemployment is down 10 percentage points on its level a year ago.The Spanish government, which last week narrowly passed a long-negotiated reform of labour laws to restrict temporary contracts, argues that faster technological change and increased social spending sparked by the pandemic are here to stay. Madrid plans to spend 30 per cent of its €70bn in EU coronavirus recovery funds on digitalisation, as well as increasing funds for health.Last month, the social security ministry said there were 429,000 more jobs than in February 2020 — 229,000 in the public sector and 200,000 in the private sector.“If you look at the last three Spanish economic crises, never have jobs recovered so fast,” said a government official.Spain’s figures are part of a global trend that has defied expectations of huge job losses, as demand has returned to the economy and labour has proved scarce rather than surplus.Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, said last week there was “good news to celebrate” after eurozone unemployment fell to a record low of 7 per cent, while worker participation rebounded above pre-pandemic levels at 73.6 per cent.The US also reported strong numbers last week, with the increase of 467,000 jobs in January — three times expectations.Spain’s figures also reflect a Europe-wide bet on furlough schemes.At its peak, Spain’s scheme — known as ERTEs — supported 3.6mn people. As of last month, just 106,000 people were on the pandemic scheme. “We had analysts saying 1mn people on ERTEs would end up unemployed,” said the government official. “But the number of people still on the schemes is just a tenth of that and steadily going down.” Rafael Doménech, head of economic analysis at BBVA, the bank, said: “Europe made a bet to maintain jobs, on the expectation that businesses could recover their previous activity, and for most companies, in almost all sectors, that’s what has happened.”It is a contrast with the aftermath of the financial crisis, when Spain’s oversized construction sector collapsed — destroying vast numbers of jobs and pushing unemployment up to 26 per cent in 2013. More than one in two young people were jobless.But he acknowledges a Spanish paradox: despite the improvement in the jobs market, the country’s gross domestic product remains about 4 per cent behind 2019 levels. Much of the reason for the disparity, he thinks, is because of tourism, a seasonal business that is responsible for about 12 per cent of GDP.Last year, the number of foreign tourists visiting Spain — and the money they spent — were down more than 60 per cent on 2019 levels.Working hours are also down on pre-pandemic levels despite the increase in employment. Even in the fourth quarter of last year, the total number of hours worked was down almost 4 per cent on the same period of 2019 — a difference Doménech suggests may be because of factors such as self-isolating staff and businesses wary of spending too much.Domestic demand is still weak in Spain and, as in other countries, salaries have failed to keep pace with inflation, which has hit 30-year highs of up to 6.5 per cent. Some unions are stepping up wage claims. “The main question mark remains whether the economy can sustain higher wage growth and an unemployment rate still in double digit territory,” said Giada Giani, an economist at Citigroup.Youth unemployment also remains a huge problem. “For someone without studies, it is very hard to get a good job; you only get the work no one wants,” says Carlos Inca, who recently did Fundación Iter’s training course near Madrid.But things are looking up for the 18-year-old, who has just obtained a job promoting solar panels — another area where Spain says it is using EU funds to invest in its future.
452  Call My Agent, or Dix pour cent, is a breakout Netflix hit that has generated spin-offs at dizzying speed. Its original Parisian blend of tantrum-prone talent and wheeler dealing reps has been remade in 10 different locations, from Bollywood to Istanbul.But one thing stands out about the Call My Agent franchise in the age of streaming. Netflix brought it to prominence with an audience of 220mn subscribers, but — ultimately thanks to French law — it was the show’s independent producers who reaped the rewards from its spin-offs.“In terms of rights, Dix pour cent is a good example of the old world and the new one because at the time no one knew it would become such a global phenomenon,” said Pierre-Antoine Capton, chief executive of Mediawan, the KKR-backed independent producer that owns the show.For Netflix, Disney and Amazon, it is potentially a worrying sign of things to come in Europe, where a regulatory squeeze is starting to cramp the operating freedom of global streaming platforms in one of their most important markets.Just as spending is booming, production costs are rising and subscription growth is flagging, streamers are grappling with another European problem — state-set investment targets and awkward quotas. Such is the challenge that Reed Hastings, Netflix’s founder, notably visited Brussels in January to meet EU commissioners.Call My Agent offers a glimpse at how old rules are re-emerging for a new streaming economy. The series was first commissioned and financed by France 2 television in 2015, under a regime where producer rights for traditional television were protected by law.This meant ownership of the brand eventually returned to its producers — in contrast to most Netflix originals such as Squid Game or Sex Education. So while some Call My Agent remakes are on Netflix, its producers had the power to sell other versions to rival services and broadcasters: Disney in Indonesia, Amazon in the UK and HBO in the Philippines.After years of heavy lobbying from producers, France last year effectively extended the Call My Agent model from traditional television to global streaming services, bolstering local producers who want to retain rights to their work. Other key EU governments are looking on with interest.The regimes, along with mandatory “investment obligations” and levies, represent a new era for Netflix, Disney, Amazon and Warner Media — services whose soaring global ambitions are being hemmed in by national politicians telling them where to invest and who might share in the upside.“The producers we work with in Spain, Italy, Germany and elsewhere in Europe look at the French system with envy and say they wish there was something similar in their own markets,” said Capton, who has built Mediawan into one of the biggest independent producers in Europe. “France is a model in the world of TV and cinema production. The power dynamic with the US studios has shifted.”Using powers under an EU directive adopted in 2018, France has required big global platforms to invest at least 20 per cent of their French turnover in European productions. As a result Netflix, Amazon and Disney have in total committed to invest at least €250mn in France every year from 2022, regardless of the quality of projects available.Furthermore, 85 per cent of those productions must be French language — and most must be “independent” works where producers retain rights.Such national flexibility in the EU framework opens the door to 27 separate investment regimes emerging, alongside other potential restrictions on rights. That is a far cry from the old model, which essentially allowed Netflix to base itself in the Netherlands, comply with its national rules and market its service across the union.While Spain has been more cautious, Italy has followed France with a more proscriptive approach; it is looking to apply an “investment obligation” of up to 20 per cent of turnover with independent projects. In Germany, a vital market for streamers, producers are pressing the coalition government to take similar action.“This is a turning point,” said Juliette Théry, an official from France’s broadcast regulator Arcom. “Involving the streaming platforms in the system for financing cinema and audiovisual works has taken a long time, and it is coming to life now.”Netflix spent €4bn on European films and shows between 2018-2021, and it still licenses much of the content: three-quarters of the European titles added to its catalogue during this period were not Netflix-owned originals.“We’ve evolved a lot over the years as there’s no one size fits all approach and we want to be flexible in meeting the needs of the producers and the projects,” said Larry Tanz, a Netflix vice-president who oversees local language series in Europe.But that freedom to choose when to retain rights on a project, or how much to invest in a country, remains prized by streamers, and increasingly under threat.Jan Koeppen, president of Disney in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said the group was “pushing more investment into local European production than ever before”.“There has never been a better time to be a content creator in this region, but a free market is essential in order to ensure that investment goes to the best projects, at the right time, wherever they may be in Europe.”Laura Sboarina of Cullen International, a regulatory research group, said the directive’s application had “indeed ended an era where the global streamers could freely decide when, where and how much to spend on productions across the EU”.It comes as a production boom drives up costs and creates real problems finding crews and directors: shows commissioned by global streamers in Europe rose 57 per cent last year, according to Ampere Analysis.Given these existing pressures, one executive compared the extra investment obligations with “filling the punchbowl when everyone is already falling over drunk”.Some executives also fear Europe could fall into a regulatory arms race as investment flows are distorted. Smaller countries are particularly vulnerable to money being diverted to tougher regimes such as France.Speaking on behalf of the European video-on-demand coalition — whose members include Netflix and Discovery — Julia Maxwell, who oversees regulatory issues for the Nordic Entertainment Group, noted investment obligations “could become a barrier to entry” for companies wanting to offer cross-border services.“They risk shifting the focus away from producing high-quality European content that consumers want, and could ultimately lead to less diversity, less innovation and less availability of quality content,” she said.While most streamers are already spending enough to meet the investment obligations relatively easily, François Godard of Enders Analysis warned that may change.“At some point in the future, where they are in a position they need to cut a bit and fall back on a more sustainable model, it becomes a burden,” he said. “The regulation has thrown sand in the engine.”One longer term worry for US entertainment groups is the risks of the regulatory regime tightening over time, either at national level or when the EU’s audiovisual directive is next updated.France is leading calls for the European Commission to revisit the definition of “European works”, particularly in light of Brexit and Britain’s outsized role as a production hub.EU law requires streaming services to carry at least 30 per cent European content, but eligibility is still based on a convention that includes non-EU states such as the UK, Turkey and Switzerland.Moving to a more narrow EU definition would have dramatic effects given the UK’s importance for Disney and Netflix. But EU diplomats said the politics of excluding just the UK, or rewriting commitments included in other EU trade agreements, could make it hard to change easily.For now the European Commission is studying the issues. Thierry Breton, the EU internal market commissioner, told the FT the UK issue was “well on my radar” and that an analysis of “our resilience” would be published this year. “We will make a decision on this basis.”Additional reporting by Javier Espinoza in Brussels
453  US president Joe Biden and Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz struggled to present a united front in the stand-off over Russia’s threat to invade Ukraine after a pivotal White House meeting exposed lingering differences over the fate of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.During a joint press conference on Monday afternoon, Biden said that if Russia invaded Ukraine, the pipeline linking Russia with Germany would not become operational. “There will be no longer a Nord Stream 2. We will bring an end to it,” Biden said. “I promise you, we will be able to do that.”Biden’s comments on Nord Stream 2, which has strained US-German relations for years, were his most forceful to date and represented a hardening of Washington’s position on one of the biggest sticking points in the transatlantic debate over which sanctions to impose against Moscow in the event of an invasion.However, Scholz repeatedly dodged questions on the fate of the pipeline, which has been built but is not yet pumping gas, and refused to even mention it by name. Instead, he offered a generic assurance that “there won’t be any measures in which we have a differing approach” and said Russia would pay a “high price” for any attack.Biden was forced to jump to Scholz’s defence, saying Germany had the “complete trust” of the US and was one of its “most important allies”.The US president said he did not know whether Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, had made a final decision on whether to invade Ukraine, but noted he had the capacity to launch an attack. Biden urged about 30,000 Americans not working in the US diplomatic corps to leave Ukraine in case they were “caught in the crossfire”.Biden and Scholz met on a frenzied day of diplomacy intended to stave off an invasion by Russia, which has amassed more than 100,000 troops at its border with Ukraine. Moscow has also started preparations for massive joint military exercises in neighbouring Belarus that western officials said could involve the deployment of an extra 30,000 soldiers later this week.As the US president and Germany’s chancellor addressed the press, Putin and Emmanuel Macron, president of France, were wrapping up their own meeting in Moscow.Biden did not specify how Washington planned to block the Nord Stream 2 in the event of an invasion, but the US could impose sanctions on the operator of the project. In addition, the US could put pressure on EU energy regulators to withhold final approval for the project.On a visit to Washington on Monday, Josep Borrell, the EU’s top foreign policy official, warned that the Ukraine crisis represented “the most dangerous moment for European security since the end of the cold war”.He was speaking after meeting Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, who dismissed criticism that Washington was too aggressive in releasing intelligence about Russia’s intentions with regards to Ukraine. “This is not alarmism. This is simply the facts. We have to deal with the facts,” he said.Additional reporting by Polina Ivanova in Moscow
454  The US has reached an agreement to ease Trump-era tariffs on Japanese steel as President Joe Biden presses to relax trade tensions with American allies.The US will suspend its 25 per cent levy on steel imports of up to 1.25mn tonnes a year beginning April 1, according to the deal with Japan announced on Monday. A 10 per cent tariff on aluminium will remain in place.Donald Trump’s administration imposed tariffs on a range of countries in 2018 on the grounds that cheap foreign metal imports posed a threat to national security.In a statement, the US and Japan agreed to co-operate on tackling overcapacity in the global steel market as a result of subsidies in non-market economies, as well as on the carbon intensity of the steel and aluminium sectors.Biden administration officials have previously accused China of dumping steel produced by its state-subsidised industry into global markets.Katherine Tai, the US trade representative, said the agreement would help Washington and Tokyo “work together.to combat China’s anti-competitive, non-market trade actions in the steel sector, while helping us reach President Biden’s ambitious climate agenda”.Japan will begin to put in place its own antidumping tariffs within six months, the statement said, and would confer with the US on “potential domestic measures to address non-market excess capacity”.According to figures compiled by the Peterson Institute for International Economics, US steel and aluminium prices have been higher than European prices since Trump applied his tariffs to imported steel and aluminium.The tariffs were controversially based on national security grounds taken from Section 232 of the US Trade Expansion Act of 1962 — a justification that irritated Washington’s allies.The deal with Japan is similar to one struck by the Biden administration with the EU in October, which lifted tariffs on billions of dollars of transatlantic metal trade.As part of that agreement, Washington and Brussels pledged to co-operate on addressing Chinese steel overcapacity and to reach an agreement aimed at carbon emissions in the sector by 2024.The US agreement with Japan did not set out a timeline for any further commitment to reduce carbon produced by steelmaking, but White House officials said the two would begin to “discuss methodologies and share data” related to emissions.This year, the US said it would begin talks over lifting tariffs on the UK’s steel and aluminium exports. The Financial Times reported last year that the US was delaying talks because of Washington’s concerns about London’s threats to change post-Brexit trading rules in Northern Ireland.Washington believed repeated threats by former Brexit minister Lord David Frost to suspend the Northern Ireland protocol, which ensures there will be no trade border on the island of Ireland, compromised the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, which brought peace to the region.Frost resigned just before Christmas and Liz Truss, the UK foreign secretary now in charge of talks, has taken a more conciliatory tone.
455  Christine Lagarde, the European Central Bank president, has played down the chances of a “measurable tightening” of monetary policy to tackle this year’s record eurozone inflation, saying any shift would be gradual.With financial markets pricing in an interest rate rise in June, Lagarde told the European Parliament on Monday that the ECB saw “no need to rush to any premature conclusion at this point in time — the outlook is way too uncertain”.Her comments were more cautious than last week when she sparked a sell-off in eurozone bond markets by refusing to rule out a potential rate rise this year and saying there was “unanimous concern” about inflation on the ECB governing council.However on Monday Lagarde also said she no longer expected inflation to fall below its 2 per cent target by the end of this year.Eurozone inflation defied expectations for a decline at the start of this year by rising to a record of 5.1 per cent in January. Lagarde said it would “continue to be high in the near term” before declining over the course of the year.Lagarde said there was “a real chance inflation will stabilise” at the 2 per cent target, which she said would lead to a “normalisation of our monetary policy”.The ECB’s governing council next meets in March. If it was confident then that inflation would remain at the target over the next two years, Lagarde said, it would “take the necessary decision”. That would include “gradually reducing” its asset purchases, which it has used to deliver added stimulus to the eurozone economy, and then “hiking interest rates”.Carsten Brzeski, head of macro research at ING, said Lagarde had “tried to put the hawkish genie back into the bottle after an aggressive repricing in markets following Thursday’s ECB meeting”.Eurozone government bond prices continued to fall on Monday, pushing up the borrowing costs of some southern European countries, such as Greece, back to pre-pandemic levels. Bond prices fall as yields rise.The spread between Italian 10-year borrowing costs and those of Germany — a key measure of stress in eurozone bond markets — rose to 1.63 percentage points, its highest level since July 2020.Frederik Ducrozet, a strategist at Pictet Wealth Management, said: “The lack of change in tone in the face of a significant re-pricing in rates markets is in itself an important signal.”He predicted the ECB was likely to raise rates for the first time in September or December, after having ended its net asset purchases in the third quarter. The bank last raised rates in 2011.Lagarde was asked repeatedly by MEPs whether the ECB would intervene to curb the rise in borrowing costs for peripheral eurozone countries.She said: “We will use any tools, any instruments that are needed in order to make sure that our monetary policy is properly transmitted throughout the whole euro area, to all member states.”The ECB president also emphasised that the eurozone economy had no “labour market overheat” — unlike the US or UK. She said it was in a “completely different” situation in terms of the size of its fiscal stimulus, the strength of demand and the level of core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices.Eugen Jurzyca, a Slovakian MEP, said: “People are genuinely worried about what will happen in the upcoming months as inflation has been much higher than predicted and governments face tough questions of whether they should respond with compensation measures.”
456  Poland’s finance minister Tadeusz Koscinski has resigned following a backlash over how the government has implemented a flagship package of tax reforms.The so-called Polish Deal, which took effect at the beginning of this year, includes a series of spending pledges and tax changes for lower and middle earners that the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) hoped would boost both the economy and its own flagging popularity.However, the package has proved to be contentious and has led to confusion over the effect of some of the changes. Some lower earners received less income in January than expected, even though officials had said that only the highest earners would be affected.“At the end of the day, I am the captain, I take responsibility,” Koscinski, a former banker who took over as finance minister in 2019, told the Financial Times.A spokesperson for PiS said that Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, himself a former finance minister, would take over Koscinski’s responsibilities until a permanent replacement was chosen.Jaroslaw Kaczynski, a co-founder of PiS and Poland’s de facto leader, responded to the criticism of the Polish Deal last week, saying that “a radical correction and certainly.political decisions including about personnel” were necessary. His comments sparked speculation that changes at the finance ministry could be imminent.The decision over who replaces Koscinski, a close ally of Morawiecki, will be read as a barometer of the delicate balance of power in the ruling camp, which has become increasingly fractious over the past 18 months.Among those mentioned as possible successors to Koscinski, Artur Sobon, who was appointed deputy finance minister last month, is seen as the closest to Morawiecki. Two others mentioned as possibilities — Piotr Nowak and Henryk Kowalczyk — are regarded as closer to other factions within government.“For the time being, there is no change in the balance of power because the prime minister is able to supervise the ministry of finance,” said one person close to the government. “But to make a final call on what is really going on we will have to wait for a decision on who will be appointed as the new minister.”Poland’s economy has grown rapidly over the past 30 years and weathered the pandemic better than most others in the EU, but the economic challenges for the next finance minister are mounting.As well as remedying the problems with the Polish Deal, one of the biggest challenges will be dealing with surging inflation, which hit 8.6 per cent in December — its highest level for more than two decades.
457  Borrowing costs for southern eurozone governments jumped close to pre-pandemic highs on Monday as investors adjusted to signs that the European Central Bank could raise interest rates as soon as this year in response to the global wave of inflation.The ECB has trodden a careful line on the prospect of rate rises for several months, promising to keep financing conditions favourable until the eurozone economy has rebounded from the pandemic and it is convinced inflation will settle at its 2 per cent target over the medium term.But president Christine Lagarde signalled a “hawkish” shift on Thursday by refusing to rule out a potential rate rise this year — as she had done only weeks earlier — and noting “unanimous concern” on the ECB’s governing council about record eurozone inflation of 5.1 per cent in January.Over the weekend, Klaas Knot, the Dutch central bank head, became the first member of the ECB council to say publicly that it should raise interest rates this year, warning that eurozone inflation would stay at 4 per cent for most of this year. He called for the ECB to end net bond purchases “as soon as possible” in preparation for raising rates in the fourth quarter.In response, a drop in eurozone bond prices sent the yield on Italian 10-year bonds up 0.1 percentage points to 1.84 per cent — back to levels reached in April 2020 shortly after the coronavirus pandemic hit.The spread between Italian 10-year borrowing costs and those of Germany — a key measure of stress in eurozone bond markets — rose to 1.63 percentage points, its highest level since July 2020.The drop was even greater in Greek 10-year bonds, as their yield rose 0.3 percentage points to 2.55 per cent — the highest level since June 2019. Selling pressure was widespread and Spanish 10-year yields rose above 1.1 per cent for the first time for almost three years.Analysts said the bond market was adjusting to the increased likelihood that the ECB could bring net asset purchases to an end in the next few months, opening the door to its first interest rate rise for more than a decade.“We are ending a period of negative rates — even Greek bond yields turned negative last year — and we are seeing a repositioning of the market,” said Carsten Brzeski, head of macro research at ING.However, Brzeski said investors seemed to have “moved completely to the other extreme” by pricing in an ECB rate rise by June, adding that the earliest he could imagine such a move was September.But selling in Italian, Greek and Spanish debt eased later in the day after Lagarde downplayed the chances of a sudden shift in ECB policy by saying there was “no need to rush to any premature conclusion at this point in time — the outlook is way too uncertain”.Speaking to the European Parliament, she added: “The chances have increased that inflation will stabilise at our target, but there are no signals that inflation will be persistently and significantly above our target over the medium term, which would require a measurable tightening.”The yield on the 10-year Italian government bond pared its gains to sit at about 1.78 per cent. The equivalent Greek yield stood at 2.45 per cent in the late European afternoon, while the Spanish 10-year yield moved back below 1.1 per cent.The ECB has amassed huge influence over eurozone bond markets, particularly in the past two years when it has bought more than 100 per cent of debt, net of refinanced bonds, issued by governments in the single currency bloc. The central bank has almost doubled the total amount of bonds it owns to €4.7tn.In December, it outlined plans to stop net purchases under a €1.85tn emergency programme at the end of March, followed by a temporary doubling of an earlier bond-buying programme before reducing it back to €20bn a month from October.However, some veteran ECB watchers worry it risks repeating the mistake of raising rates too soon, as it did in 2011, just as the eurozone sovereign debt crisis was starting.“We’ll pay the price for the premature tightening as we move through 2023-24 in the form of lower growth, higher unemployment and inflation well below 2 per cent,” said Erik Nielsen, chief economics adviser at UniCredit.Italian stocks also took the strain on Monday. While other parts of Europe’s stock markets pushed a little higher, Italy’s FTSE MIB dropped as much as 1.7 per cent.
458  Hello all. This week, if I manage to tear my attention away from the chaos engulfing perhaps Britain’s worst prime minister since Lord North lost the American colonies, I’m turning back to the most salient example of the supply chain/reshoring issue: the global scurry to build semiconductor production at home. In a day or two the EU will unveil its Chips Act, inspired by the hyperactively interventionist French internal markets commissioner Thierry Breton and enthusiastically embraced by European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen. I shamelessly crib off the work of my excellent Brussels colleagues for precise details of the debate inside the commission, and I advise you to do the same. Today’s main piece stands back to consider the risk of gluts and trade wars from a semiconductor subsidy game that goes global. Charted waterslooks at the reasons to be cheerful for global trade in 2022.Amid lots of strategic-autonomy rhetoric and with the shortages of the past year in mind, the European Chips Act will set the suspiciously precise yet arbitrary goal of increasing its share of the global semiconductor market from 10 to 20 per cent by 2030.To this end, von der Leyen wants the EU to match, more or less, the $52bn in investment the US government is about to shower on its chip industry. Is this going to happen? It looks pretty ambitious. As I’ve said before, the EU is more resilient than the US when it comes to shovelling out public cash, thanks to its relative lack of centralised funds, and it has a history of being heavily over-optimistic that public money will leverage in private.Compared with other countries, there are also significant policymaking counterweights in Brussels to the industrial policy interventionists. The main one is the commission’s competition directorate. The competition commissioner, Danish heavy-hitter Margrethe Vestager, is very publicly resisting a free-for-all on state aid. Providing quieter back-up is the trade directorate, which correctly fears a whole load of trade-distorting handouts undercutting its campaign to reduce subsidies worldwide.In an industry that’s always been characterised by cycles of shortage and glut, the risk of global oversupply in some products is rising. Aside from China’s vast efforts to increase output, we’ve already seen public money start to gush out from advanced economies such as Japan and South Korea to build up domestic chip production. There’s no real sign of global co-ordination between governments: the EU’s Chips Act will call for partnerships with its international allies, but with no credible binding mechanism that we can see.The chips that have been in short supply over the past year or two are often the less sophisticated “legacy” ones used in cars. But that’s a mature product. As the Peterson Institute’s semiconductors guru Chad Bown repeatedly warns, if the legacy chips shortage starts to diminish — and it’s at least partly related to the one-off surge in consumer durables demand — governments subsidising their production will end up with a lot of outdated facilities indefinitely dependent on public money. The likes of Breton claim they only want to subsidise manufacture for the more sophisticated chips, but if a fire hose gets turned on it’s hard to control it.It’s tempting to think OK, if governments are daft enough to create global gluts in semiconductors (as they’ve done in steel, aluminium, shipbuilding and other prestige capital-intensive industries down the decades) so be it. Spend public money subsidising everyone else’s car industries and other downstream users if you really want to. It won’t be efficient, but it’s your money you’re wasting.However, if you put that much money into boosting semiconductor production you’ll want to get first dibs on the chips if the cycle swings and there’s a global shortage. Hence either implicitly or explicitly these subsidy programmes contain threats of general export restrictions, going beyond existing blocks on the sale of sensitive technology to geopolitical rivals. This creates a classic prisoner’s dilemma like the vaccine procurement issue last year. If everyone else is building chip factories and preparing to block the exits you’d better do so too.This suboptimal outcome doesn’t even make sense on its own terms. Everyone who knows anything about semiconductors seems to think it’s just not possible to take such a blindingly complex supply chain entirely in-house at any reasonable price — Vestager estimates self-sufficiency would cost the EU €240bn-€320bn. You can imagine a world where all the big economies have chip production facilities, there’s a global shortage of one particular product, everyone slams on export controls and still no one is actually self-sufficient.The EU already has an excellent strategic position in the early parts of the supply chain, particularly thanks to its research capacity and to businesses such as the Dutch company ASML, which supplies extremely advanced lithography machines to chipmakers. Some very precise official support enhancing European dominance of this part of the global industry would give it strategic power. But that’s not just what the expansive version of the Chips Act wants. It’s trying to bring big chunks of the manufacturing supply chain within Europe, and it wants to spread production into other EU member states, such as, I don’t know, to take a purely hypothetical example, maybe Breton’s native France?It’s not 100 per cent clear what’s going to emerge as the EU’s final strategy. Like everyone else, we’re watching the balls in the Brussels policy lottery clatter around the rotating drum ahead of the big draw. But along with the headline subsidy numbers, which will almost certainly be overstated, keep an eye on what people are saying or implying about how exports might be controlled.And now for some good news. ING Bank’s macroeconomics team last week published its trade outlook for 2022, predicting that world trade will not only normalise this year but grow further, despite the challenging circumstances.The chart, showing the percentage change in global trade volumes year on year, records a growth in merchandise world trade of 4.1 per cent this year, down from 10.6 per cent in 2021, but still a healthy figure.Co-authors Inga Fechner and Rico Luman acknowledge that the pandemic remains an uncertain factor affecting the outlook for 2022. But they note that last year showed that supply chain problems and higher shipping costs didn’t necessarily hamper the world from continuing to trade. “The economics of trade still make sense,” they said. “So, we’re optimistic given the economic outlook, a hopefully receding pandemic, and clear evidence of richly filled order books, notably in the automotive sector.”US president Joe Biden’s administration has renewed expiring tariffs on solar panels for another four years.A podcast from the Centre for European Reform discusses the economics of climate change including carbon border adjustment mechanisms.Six forthcoming WTO rulings against the US’s use of national security grounds to restrict imports could have serious implications for its future trade.New research on a group of French companies during the first pandemic lockdown shows that holding higher inventories helped guard against supply chain shocks, but geographically diversifying sourcing did not.The US and EU have agreed to allow trade between the two in mussels, clams, oysters and scallops.The EU is discussing plans to shield European households from energy price rises if Russia invades Ukraine.
459  Will there be a war in Ukraine? The one man who might know for sure is Vladimir Putin. The Russian president has ordered the build-up of troops on the borders of Ukraine. The ultimate decision about whether to invade will be his alone.But how will Putin decide? That depends on which version of the Russian leader you believe in: Putin the Rational or Vlad the Mad.Most western policymakers believe in Putin the Rational. They argue that, after more than 20 years in power, the Russian leader is a known quantity. He is ruthless and amoral. But he is also shrewd and calculating. He takes risks, but he is not crazy.But there are other analysts who fear the Russian leader is turning into Vlad the Mad. They think that Putin has been in power for too long and is growing increasingly out of touch and paranoid. His isolation during the pandemic has made matters worse. Vlad is listening to a dangerously small circle of nationalist advisers.As evidence that Putin the Rational has morphed into Vlad the Mad some point to the Russian leader’s recent penchant for publishing long, nationalist essays on history and culture. There was his 5,000-word blast on the “Historical unity of Russians and Ukrainians” published in July — which portrayed the independence of Ukraine as a historical aberration.The previous year Putin published a long essay on the origins of the second world war, arguing that Britain and France had deliberately encouraged Nazi Germany to attack the Soviet Union. These passionate musings suggest that the Russian leader may increasingly be driven by emotion and eccentric theories.Western diplomacy on Ukraine is still largely designed to deal with Putin the Rational. Emmanuel Macron, France’s leader, travels to Moscow this week in an attempt to reason with Putin and strike a bargain.Both the US and the Europeans are pursuing a policy that could be described as “deterrence plus off-ramps”. The goal is to show Putin that the price of attacking Ukraine will be too high. The Russian military will suffer heavy casualties, the Russian economy will be hit with devastating sanctions and the Russian nation will be increasingly isolated.Set against this unappealing prospect, the west is trying to give Putin “off-ramps” — diplomatic options, which afford him the prestige of great power status and the opportunity to start wide-ranging talks on security in Europe.Hopes that Putin may make a rational calculation to turn away from conflict have been raised by some of his recent comments. His suggestion that the US is deliberately trying to goad Russia into a war could be seen as preparing the ground for a climbdown. After all, why go to war — if that is what your enemy wants you to do?But the prevailing American assumption is still that war is more likely than not. This view is based not on what Putin is saying — but on what he is doing. Over the past fortnight, the Americans have seen an intensification of Russia’s military build-up. They are particularly concerned by a new concentration of forces in Belarus — just two hours’ drive north of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. The newly-pliant Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, is allowing Moscow to use his country as a base for a possible invasion. The Russians are also completing all the logistical preparations that would be needed for war.Military analysts think that Russian forces could probably surround or even occupy Kyiv quite quickly, if ordered to. But believers in Putin the Rational argue that the Russian leader knows that a full-scale invasion of Ukraine would be folly. They think that Putin is more likely to take limited military action — perhaps confined to eastern Ukraine, where there is already a low-level conflict between the Ukrainian army and pro-Russian forces.A limited offensive, designed to give the Ukrainians a “bloody nose”, might divide rather than unite the west as allies squabbled about the response. The Ukrainian government could be destabilised and might fall. And Russia would preserve the option of recognising parts of eastern Ukraine as separate republics. All of these moves could be classed as risky, but rational.But if Vlad the Mad is now running the show, it is possible that Russia will take much more radical action. What if Putin believes his own propaganda? A passionate belief in the “unity of Russians and Ukrainians” — combined with a paranoid belief that America is manipulating events in Ukraine — may lead the Russian leader to dangerously underestimate the reality of Ukrainian nationalism. As a result, Putin may not fully comprehend the extent of opposition that Russian forces will encounter, if they attempt to invade and occupy Ukraine.A final twist is that Putin the Rational may be pretending to be Vlad the Mad. It was Richard Nixon who outlined the “madman theory”, when the US president told aides that it could be helpful if America’s enemies thought he was crazy enough to use nuclear weapons. Putin is said to be planning high-profile nuclear weapons exercises in the coming weeks — which would be a move straight from the “madman” playbook. But the line between acting like a madman and being a madman is disconcertingly thin.
460  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.A week of dizzying diplomatic meetings seeking to de-escalate tensions with Russia kicks off today in Moscow and Washington. These include EU meetings with the US over potential back-up supplies of gas in case Russia were to invade Ukraine. We’ll bring you up to date with who’s going where and what the expectations are.Meanwhile, in Brussels, after some tentative signs of thawing in EU-Poland relations, President Andrzej Duda will meet the heads of the European Commission, European Council and Nato today — his main focus being also Ukraine.And after being one of the first EU countries to impose extra travel restrictions to curb the spread of the Omicron variant, Portugal as of today is scrapping the additional Covid-19 test for incoming tourists (including Brits) — and so is Greece.Europe’s diplomatic efforts to defuse the Ukraine-Russia crisis are amped up today as France’s Emmanuel Macron visits Vladimir Putin in Moscow, and Germany’s Olaf Scholz travels to Washington to see President Joe Biden, writes Mehreen Khan in Brussels.Two of Brussels’ senior officials will also be in the US capital on a mission to help Europe wean itself off Russian gas.Top diplomat Josep Borrell and EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson will meet counterparts Antony Blinken, secretary of state, and energy secretary Jennifer Granholm to revive the dormant EU-US energy council. It is the latest leg in a European charm offensive to coax the world’s liquefied natural gas producers to bump up their exports to the EU as tensions with Moscow show little sign of abating.Asking the US and others to pump more LNG into Europe’s energy network is an immediate priority. But as the FT reports, the EU is considering a number of other ways to protect consumers from soaring energy costs in the event of a full-scale military conflict in Ukraine.These include examining how to prevent the rising cost of gas from bleeding into household bills.The idea of “delinking” energy costs from the price of gas has been a perennial demand of France and Spain since the autumn — when wholesale electricity prices hit records in Europe. At the time, the notion was consistently dismissed by commission officials as a drastic and unnecessary step (here’s an overview of how the marginal price system works).The Russia crisis is forcing the commission back to the drawing board. Diplomats have told Europe Express that ways of temporarily muting the pass-through of gas prices to electricity costs may be part of a package of measures to be presented to EU leaders in March.But achieving this temporary delinking is beset with complications, and Brussels is anxious not to damage the functioning of the market. Ideas for a price cap or the use of an average price of electricity have been criticised by the EU’s energy agency, Acer, for risking more volatility and endangering security of supply.Another option under consideration is providing countries with a time-limited emergency derogation from the system to protect consumers.Such carve-outs were not considered during Russia’s 2014 conflict in Crimea and if they go ahead would mark an unprecedented break with the rules of the EU’s single energy market.Poland’s President Andrzej Duda is heading to Brussels and Berlin this week for talks on Ukraine, amid signs that the tensions to Poland’s east are also prompting Warsaw to try to resolve some of its own international disputes, writes James Shotter in Warsaw.While in Brussels today, Duda will meet the heads of Nato, the European Commission and the European Council, before joining Olaf Scholz and Emmanuel Macron in Berlin later this week.“France, Germany and Poland are all taking various types of actions [in relation to Ukraine].Each of these countries has its contacts, and it makes sense for the leaders of these three great European countries to exchange [information on] these contacts,” Jakub Kumoch, Duda’s top foreign adviser, said last week.Duda’s trips come as Poland attempts to ease sources of conflict with its neighbours and shore up relations with its allies in the face of Russia’s military build-up around the borders of Ukraine.Last Thursday, Poland’s conservative-nationalist government resolved a long-running dispute over a Polish lignite mine near the Czech border that has soured relations between Prague and Warsaw.The same day, Duda put forward a proposal to amend aspects of the judicial overhaul that has sparked a serious rift between Brussels and Warsaw.“We do not need this fight,” he said at the time. “In the face of all the threats that are occurring, all the shocks on the international scene, we need calm reflection, we need calm conversations, and above all we need to stand together as one force.”Polish judges’ organisations have dismissed Duda’s proposals as purely cosmetic, while allies of hardline justice minister Zbigniew Ziobro, who favour a more uncompromising approach to Brussels, have criticised them as a recipe for anarchy in the country’s judicial system.But Duda’s move was welcomed by arguably the country’s most important ally, as the US embassy in Warsaw expressed appreciation for Duda’s “engagement” in “relations between Poland and the EU.”One move that may still raise eyebrows in Brussels, however, is Duda’s decision last week to travel to Beijing and be the only EU elected leader present at the opening of the Winter Olympics (Luxembourg’s grand duke was also there) — which were also attended by Vladimir Putin who secured the support of China for his opposition to Nato expansion.The US, the UK and the other EU countries had refrained from sending high-ranking officials to the Olympics in protest at the human rights abuses in Xinjiang province.Ukraine’s trade with Russia collapsed after the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the start of the war in eastern Ukraine. Once allies, the two countries are now at their lowest point in relations since Kyiv declared independence 30 years ago. (More here)In another sign of how Europe is gradually relaxing Covid-19 restrictions, passengers landing in Portugal and Greece will no longer have to show negative test results from today, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon.Lisbon announced the change on Thursday, with Athens following suit 24 hours later, as the two tourism-dependent countries seek to remove barriers that might discourage holidaymakers from booking early spring breaks. Portugal’s hoteliers’ association welcomed the measure as “very positive”.Portugal’s tourism industry recovered somewhat last year after a disastrous 2020, but bed nights were little more than half the level recorded in 2019 and domestic holidaymakers remained abnormally in the majority for a second consecutive year. Last year’s tourism numbers in Greece were about 60 per cent of the 2019 level.The Covid-19 testing requirement, in addition to proof of vaccination or recovery, was introduced early December as Portugal’s authorities sought to limit the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant. PCR tests had to be made within the previous 72 hours and rapid antigen tests within the previous 48 hours. Greece introduced a similar measure three weeks later.As of today, travellers arriving in both countries will still be required to show a valid EU “green pass” or equivalent document, such as a UK recovery and vaccination record, showing that they have been fully vaccinated or recently recovered.Portugal is the world’s third most-vaccinated country against Covid-19 after the United Arab Emirates and Brunei, with more than 89 per cent of its population having been fully jabbed. The level in Greece is approaching 70 per centand later this week
461  After Belarus sent a fighter jet to intercept a Ryanair flight carrying a young dissident, who was later arrested and detained, the EU hit back with sanctions designed to inflict a “substantial cost” on anyone who supported Alexander Lukashenko’s dictatorial regime.But there was a catch. It turned out that the sanctions imposed in 2021 on the lucrative petrochemicals and potash industries in Belarus applied only to new contracts, meaning that their impact would be gradual. And the penalties placed on potash came with specifications that excluded around 80 per cent of the commodity exported by the east European nation.The Belarusian opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, warns of “regrettable” omissions in the package, which also included measures against the finance sector, and is demanding that new targets be added. “We should not underestimate the regime’s ability to minimise the full impact of the EU’s sanctions,” she says.Her complaints carry particular resonance as Europe discusses with the US creating what they have billed as one of the hardest-hitting sanctions packages the west has ever deployed, this time against Russia.The western allies are seeking tougher penalties than those imposed after Moscow’s invasion of Crimea in 2014, hoping the threat of draconian measures will deter President Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine after massing more than 100,000 troops at its border.But Moscow knows the EU faces formidable hurdles when it comes to applying sanctions. For a start, it needs unanimity among the 27 member states — many of which have deep economic ties to Russia. Its capitals are also accused by diplomats and lawyers of having a patchy record when it comes to speedily enforcing sanctions programmes.EU officials say they are optimistic that European capitals are ready to swallow the economic pain that would come with sanctions on the Russian financial sector as well as parts of its energy and high-tech industries. “We all hope that diplomacy will succeed,” Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, told the Financial Times on Friday, “but we also know that when it’s time to use this robust package we are ready.”The ultimate test will only come when leaders convene for an emergency EU summit should Russia attack Ukraine.“It is vital that the west maintains its unity in the face of this threat from Russia — and that means we have to have the EU fully on board,” says Edward Fishman, an adjunct fellow at the Center for a New American Security and a state department official during the Obama administration. “Right now all the signals from US and European leaders point to a remarkable degree of consensus on the sanctions effort. It’s crucial that this is maintained.”Critics say the Belarus sanctions embody many of the frailties and limitations of the EU’s framework. The measures against the Lukashenko regime fell short of some officials’ ambitions because of carve-outs requested by EU countries seeking protection for some of their own companies trading with Belarus, and because of the time taken to implement and then enforce the measures.The sanctions on Belarus’s petrochemicals, potash and financial sectors — the first with any teeth — were agreed almost a year after Lukashenko began his brutal crackdown on his country’s opposition in August 2020. Analysts say the early impact on Belarus’s potash export volumes was limited, while prices soared — giving the country’s state-controlled potash groups an unexpected shot in the arm.“Ultimately sanctions are only a tool towards something, and the moment has passed [in Belarus],” says Maria Shagina, visiting fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. “The time [window] when you can apply pressure and translate it into something is quite narrow.”The EU has streamlined its sanctions machine in recent years. But all 27 member states must still unanimously agree on sanctions before they can be imposed. It is a very different system from the US where, in the words of Brian O’Toole of the Atlantic Council, action is taken by “three agencies that work for one president”.The drawn-out bureaucratic process gives greater scope for member states to demand carve-outs to protect their own industries, complained one official involved in the Belarus process.“It is not easy for the commission when they have member states looking over their shoulder as they draw up sanctions, saying: ‘No, you’re overstepping your competences here’ or ‘we need a loophole there’,” says an EU official. “It slows it down and weakens the result. The outcome is not the highest common denominator but the lowest in terms of what member states can stomach.”The commission defends the multiple rounds of Belarus sanctions — which targeted people, entities, sectors of the economy and financial services — insisting they are designed to be “progressive”, meaning they can be scaled up or down depending on Minsk’s behaviour.But there are similar questions over the effectiveness of the 2014 sanctions on Russia. The US and EU were wrongfooted by Putin’s actions, leading to a reactive response and fractious internal discussions as they ratcheted up their measures. The toughest steps were only enacted after the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines MH17 over Ukraine by a Russian missile in July 2014.The penalties included restrictions on companies and individuals with close ties to the Russian government, as well as measures related to the defence, energy and finance sectors. They failed to force Russia out of Crimea or to stifle Putin’s military ambitions in his neighbour — although some western diplomats believe the measures dissuaded Putin from further escalation in Ukraine’s Donbas region which was seized by Russian-backed separatists in 2014.Differences between the US and EU sanctions regimes undermined their effectiveness. French energy company Total, for example, was able to continue partial ownership and funding of the construction of two major gas projects in Russia’s arctic owned by Novatek, even as US banks pulled their support. While ExxonMobil withdrew from joint venture deals with Kremlin-controlled oil company Rosneft, Italy’s Eni stood by its operating project until 2018.Overall the sanctions meant Russia’s annual growth from 2014 to 2018 fell short of prior expectations by 0.2 per cent, according to an IMF report in 2019, meaning they had a much smaller impact than, for instance, the decline in the oil price during the same period.Diplomats warn that Europe’s regime suffers further from uneven enforcement. The US relies on a single powerful body — the Office of Foreign Assets Control — which has wide latitude to enforce sanctions and track their effect.In Europe enforcement is handled at a national level, and officials say its effectiveness varies dramatically between member states. Tom Keatinge of the Royal United Services Institute think-tank, argues that once sanctions are agreed at the EU level, there is sometimes the impression that “everyone has flopped over the finishing line and said ‘thank God, we can go off and think about something else’.”The commission tacitly accepted the need for improvement 12 months ago, when it put out a communication proposing a more “robust and rapid implementation and enforcement” of the union’s sanctions, including reforms to bolster information sharing between capitals.Yet radical change, such as the creation of an EU agency to take sanctions enforcement powers from national governments, remains unlikely. “Which country is going to give up more sovereignty in terms of things that can hurt their economy, and tell their voters that Europe now makes these decisions?” asks a senior EU official.The crucial difference between the current planning and 2014, EU officials say, is that the detailed work between allies is being done early and proactively, in the hope it will deter Putin from taking hostile action.Intensive discussions between the US and EU over Russian sanctions have now been under way for three months. They follow a period of brittle relations in the wake of America’s chaotic military withdrawal from Afghanistan, which European officials criticised as ill-co-ordinated, and the White House’s nuclear submarine agreement with the UK and Australia, which excluded France and triggered a diplomatic spat with Paris.Policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic stress the goal is not to alight on exactly the same sanctions against Russia, but to forge a co-ordinated approach, in contrast to the chaotic events of the Trump administration, which imposed sanctions on aluminium giant Rusal in 2018 without consulting allies.Officials say the unusual volume of intelligence and public briefings by the US on the Russian build-up helped heap pressure on reluctant EU governments to back sanctions. Adding to that pressure is the awareness that China is closely watching the planning, they say, as it gauges western powers’ ability to rally in the face of a shared security threat.Victoria Nuland, the US under-secretary of state for political affairs, told the FT in January that a key goal in discussions was to find ways to fairly share the economic burden of the sanctions between European countries.“We always say that our goal needs to be to hurt Russia more than we hurt ourselves if we have to go in this direction,” she said, stressing that the EU and US packages didn’t necessarily have to be “identical” but did have to be “equally painful”.The package taking shape will cover energy, banking, high-tech companies and oligarchs with close links to Putin. Critically, western capitals are more willing to inflict pain on the Russian banking system than in 2014, when measures against the big state-owned banks were relatively restrained. Sanctions on Russia’s biggest financial institutions, including Sberbank, VTB, Gazprombank, Alfa-Bank, and The Russian Direct Investment Fund are all under consideration, say diplomats.In addition, the allies are willing to hit gas producers, as well as oil companies — despite anxiety over Europe’s reliance on Russian gas. That means the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline through the Baltic Sea “cannot be removed from the table” as far as sanctions are concerned, von der Leyen has previously said.US and EU officials are also seeking to finalise measures preventing exports to Russia of an unprecedented range of key technologies produced by western companies, mirroring steps taken by Washington to prevent Chinese telecoms company Huawei from using US-made components.One EU diplomat says disagreements remain over the detailed scope of all the products and companies to be targeted. But the EU’s participation in this part of the package is seen as particularly critical given the scale of its exports to Russia, which totalled nearly €80bn in 2020.The aim is to hold back high-tech components that Russia cannot easily replace by turning to suppliers in other parts of the world, in areas ranging from artificial intelligence to quantum computers and lasers, degrading Russia’s ability to diversify its fossil-fuel-reliant economy.The overall proposals “look to be a dramatic broadening and strengthening of the [2014] measures,” says Erica Moret, a sanctions specialist at the Graduate Institute, Geneva.In Washington, Europe’s emerging willingness to hit Putin hard is seen as the result of destabilising actions they blame on Moscow which have multiplied in the past decade.These range from election interference and cyber attacks to the Skripal poisoning in the UK and the presence of Russian mercenaries in Mali. US officials say they believe an invasion of Ukraine would be a bridge too far for Europeans to tolerate in terms of the continent’s security.The Europeans are weighing the cost of imposing sanctions “against the counterfactual of an invasion in the heart of Europe, and.the impact it would have to their business environment and their economic conditions,” says a Biden administration official.Von der Leyen says she now sees a “growing sense of unity” among the 27 member states as they observe Russian actions, including “the massive military build-up around Ukraine and in Belarus, the continued cyber attacks and the disinformation campaigns to prepare the ground.“Many were caught by surprise in 2014,” she adds, “but this time we have a clear understanding of the magnitude of what Russia could do.”Björn Seibert, her head of cabinet, has been holding what diplomats describe as “confessional” meetings with small groups of EU ambassadors to understand their pain thresholds with regard to the options on the table.The goal within the commission is to have a detailed set of sanctions ready, which could be upgraded or downgraded depending on the gravity of any Russian incursion. These would be signed off in an emergency summit of EU leaders if they decide action is needed, all in close co-ordination with the US, UK and other allies.Diplomats insist that being too prescriptive in advance about the triggers needed for penalties to be imposed risks backfiring. “You wouldn’t want to define thresholds in advance, because then Russia can seek to stay below them,” says one.The risk remains, however, that unity between the 27 member states falters in the face of hostile or covert acts by Putin that fall short of an outright invasion but still have the effect of further destabilising Ukraine.A number of member states — among them Italy and Austria — have deep business links with Moscow, while Germany is hugely exposed to disruptions in the energy markets given it draws more than half of its gas imports from Russia.Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, last week criticised the mooted measures on a trip to Moscow, saying they were “doomed to failure” — although officials remain hopeful that he will fall into line.Some experts argue that the power and extraterritorial reach of US sanctions are so massive that any weaknesses in the EU response should not be debilitating when it comes to applying pressure on Putin.If Russian banks are subjected to tough new sanctions by the US, for example, western financial institutions will steer well clear of them for fear of falling foul of the US authorities. But O’Toole of the Atlantic Council insists that having the EU fully on board will be critical to closing all loopholes and depriving Putin of any room for manoeuvre.“Let’s be clear — sanctions only work as long as everybody plays ball,” says a senior EU official. “That is the bottom line.”Additional reporting by Emiko Terazono in London and James Politi in Washington
462  Vladimir Putin’s ire at the west and at Nato’s eastward expansion ostensibly hinges on a decades-old treaty provision the Russian president maintains is under threat: “the indivisibility of security".The concept broadly states that the security of any state is inseparable from others in its region. Putin’s stated belief that Nato strategy puts this principle in jeopardy is at the heart of Moscow’s justification for its military deployment on Ukraine’s borders, where it has stationed more than 100,000 troops.Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, repeated the complaint last week when he cast western allies as aggressors following intelligence assessments that Russia was plotting to fabricate a pretext for a full-blown invasion of Ukraine.“Russia is seriously concerned about increasing politico-military tensions in the immediate vicinity of its western borders,” Lavrov said. There were “differences in the understanding of the principle of equal and indivisible security that is fundamental to the entire European security architecture”.But some observers say Moscow’s comments are only a way to buy time while it prepares its military strategy.“Less important than its substance is the form and timing of this Russian messaging,” said Mathieu Boulègue, research fellow at Chatham House’s Russia and Eurasia programme in London. “It’s a talking point designed to distract and divide.”First crafted during the cold war, the term “indivisibility of security in Europe” was included in the Helsinki Final Act of 1975, which set ground rules for the interaction between two antagonistic blocs, the western alliance of Nato and the Warsaw pact made up of the Soviet Union and some of its satellite states.But the dissolution of the Soviet Union changed things, with former Soviet satellites feeling free to choose their own security arrangements.The 1990 Charter of Paris for a New Europe stated that “security is indivisible and the security of every participating state is inseparably linked to that of all the others”.Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe summits in Istanbul in 1999 and Astana in 2010 repeated the importance of this concept, with the rider that this could not come at “the expense” of another state’s security. But both summits also reiterated that no state or group of states “can consider any part of the OSCE area as its sphere of influence”.The 1997 Nato-Russia Founding Act, which aimed to build mutual trust, similarly recognised the concept and pledged Nato would not, “in the current and foreseeable security environment”, install permanent bases in new member states. Notably, the preamble also said Nato and Russia “do not consider one another adversaries”.But things have moved on and today there was “a totally different reality”, said Samuel Charap, senior political scientist at the Rand Corporation think-tank in Washington.Russia under Putin has sought to create a sphere of influence, launching a war against Georgia in 2008 and annexing Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Nato has, meanwhile, expanded to include former Soviet satellites, such as the Baltic states and Poland, with rotating bases in those countries.Analysts take it to mean that the security of each state in the region is inextricably linked to the security of every other state. The problem is that the concept is open to wide interpretation.Even under the relatively pro-western 1991-99 presidency of Boris Yeltsin, Moscow took “indivisible security” to mean Russia would be involved in Europe’s security decision-making process, Charap said. It understood that any expansion of Nato that affected Russia’s “core security interests” must be made with its consent or it would take action to prevent such plans from being realised, he added.In contrast, newly liberated Soviet satellites saw the concept as an expression of their sovereign right to make their own security arrangements, including joining the EU or Nato, he noted.The differences of interpretation are at the heart of Russia’s demands, which Andrey Baklitskiy, a senior research fellow at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, paraphrased as: “You promised us indivisible security. But you haven’t given us that.”But according to Charap, this is a misleading argument. In Moscow’s eyes, the principle of not increasing your security at the expense of others must hold when it comes to a former Soviet satellite joining Nato, he alleged, but not “when [Russia is] building up 100,000 troops on the border”.Russia set out its security demands on December 17 last year, essentially demanding Moscow have a veto over European security arrangements, including a ban on “Ukraine as well as other states” joining Nato.The US and Nato responses, leaked this week by Spanish daily El País, went through the legalese of past treaties but largely rejected Moscow’s demands.However, the US said it was “prepared for a discussion of the indivisibility of security — and our respective interpretations”. Washington also offered Moscow a mechanism to verify that Nato’s missile defence systems in Romania and Poland were not equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles, in exchange for similar transparency by Moscow.Putin has yet to formally respond, but on Tuesday criticised the offer for ignoring Moscow’s demands.“The west needed to give a response, so it presented a carefully crafted document, with lots of references to the past, to try and give a salve to the Kremlin without offering anything really new,” said Boulègue. “It was an exercise in strategic ambiguity.”For now, diplomacy continues. French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Olaf Scholz are scheduled to meet Putin in Moscow in the coming days, and Scholz is set to meet US president Joe Biden in Washington on Monday.Meanwhile, the ambiguity of what “indivisibility of security” means, and to whom, remains — and the relative chances of war or peace are unresolved. Analysts say it is difficult to see how a compromise might be reached.“The problem is,” Boulègue said, “there’s no knowing what ‘success’ might mean for Russia, or the west”.Letter in response to this article:Time to drop the Baltic states’ ex-Soviet moniker / From Kaarli Harry Eichhorn, Brussels, Belgium
463  This article is part of a guide to Paris from FT GlobetrotterMixing business and pleasure seems like an intrinsic trait in France — at least in a certain received idea of what makes the French so very much themselves. Even in less louche ways than that might suggest, the natural French propensity when doing business is more social than the more traditionally transactional Anglo-Saxon approach. There has long been a custom of generous entertaining expenses. That’s also because of an even more consummately French reflex: food and drink present natural opportunities for enjoyment and fineness — which also happen to be optimal lubricants for getting business done.In any case, the idea of mixing business and pleasure is especially tempting in Paris — even if it’s on your own after the business of the day is done. As you watch the grandiose Haussmanian façades and boulevards stream by from the back of a taxi on your way in from the airport or the train station, or walk by bustling cafés with waistcoated waiters serving coffees or bubbly kirs, you’ll probably regret that you’re not here for a weekend of flânerie and bistro dining, or that you don’t have time to go back to that sumptuous restaurant where you once enjoyed an exquisite meal.Fortunately for the business traveller in Paris for just a short stint, the sheer beauty of the city (and its endless amount of chic, intimate or grand venues) is that it’s the perfect place to easily — and quite professionally — lighten work with a bit of play. Even as work remains the focus and time is limited, it’s easy to enjoy a taste of the city of pleasure, if only for just a quick business drink or a power breakfast.Here are a few of my favourite venues and experiences that allow you to optimise time, location, work and pleasure — whatever your order of those priorities.Bar 8 at the Mandarin Oriental is well located on the Rue Saint-Honoré near the Place Vendôme: very close to many of the offices and business hotels where the traveller is likely to be working and staying. But much better than the typical business-hotel bar, Bar 8 is both intimate and chic, with an uncharacteristically relaxed vibe in an elegantly designed interior with backlighting and modernist banquettes. It feels professional, but it also feels good, and you could pleasurably linger after your meeting to enjoy a second drink (they are flawless here) and the sense of partaking, on the fringes, in a bit of Parisian nightlife. Warm evenings are best spent alfresco in the lovely lush courtyard.In the Paris outpost of The Hoxton hotel, a grand converted 18th-century residence in the 2nd arrondissement, Jacques is just one of the venue’s beautiful and welcoming spaces for “bleasure”-style socialising. It’s billed as a speakeasy, but the bar is both cosy and infinitely more Parisian than the underground idea would suggest. You climb up to its first-floor location via a stunning original wood and wrought-iron staircase before entering through a closed door into a small space that feels like Parisian boudoir meets London members’ club library.It has just half a dozen small tables and overstuffed velvet and leather chairs and sofas (so you should book ahead). The elegant table lamps, luxe retro wallpaper and polished wooden bar give it a sense of formality. It is also pleasantly quiet, allowing you to speak discreetly. The bartenders are impressive mixologists who will devise a bespoke drink to your tastes in the unlikely event you don’t find a cocktail that suits you on the menu (which includes a “10am Martini” if you’re feeling particularly ambitious at your morning meeting).Whether for a power breakfast, a light business lunch or early-evening drinks, L’Escadrille is all about the location. It occupies a grandiose corner of real estate, bang on the Champs Elysées just a few blocks from the Arc de Triomphe, at the heart of the neighbourhood that is ground zero for dozens of business hotels and offices. The elegant and recently renovated Fouquet’s is likely to always be just a few minutes by foot or taxi to wherever it is you need to go next.Inside, with shiny black tables, velvet chairs, and polished wood panelling, the atmosphere is classic and business-like in a space small enough that, evening descending and your work concluding, it can feel intimate and warm enough to want to linger in the glow of the gleaming zinc bar. There are no beautiful Parisians hanging out here, but the hotel’s international clientele and a decor of photo portraits of the world’s great aviators lend a little flavour of Casablanca mystique.It’s not Paris if you don’t go to a café at some point, whether for a morning coffee and croissant or a glass of wine at apéritif hour — and both quintessentially Parisian rituals graciously lend themselves to blending with business. Café Beaubourg is a modernised version of the classic café experience, and an ideal hybrid venue for a “bleasure” experience. Centrally located near the Centre Pompidou, which houses the National Museum of Modern Art, it is part of the small Costes empire of fashionable restaurants and cafés, though the vibe is more established than trendy.Designed by French architect Christian de Portzamparc (known for chic buildings such as the LVMH Tower in New York), its interior is a stylish take on a classic Parisian aesthetic. Abundant alcoves and nooks lend themselves to discretion if you need that, and the larger tables offer space to spread out papers (and even a stray plug or two if you need to recharge a laptop or phone). As part of the Costes experience, you receive the welcome — and fab people-watching — of a higher-end venue. You can even add culture to your bleasure here — the National Museum of Modern Art is open every day except Tuesdays until 9pm, so you can easily cross the esplanade out front for some after-drinks art.The eight-metre ceilings, the chunky Chesterfield-style bar stools, the choice between intimate clusters of lounge chairs or marble-topped café table for two — no matter whom you’re meeting, what your business is or if your business is thankfully done for the day, the Madame Rêve hotel gives you a choice of any number of deluxe-feeling experiences. And this is just the voluminous Café space on the ground floor (that also features a casual restaurant with excellent Mediterranean food). There is another, smaller but sleeker carved-marble bar upstairs that opens in the evenings, connected to the high-end La Plume restaurant serving Japanese-inspired food and stunning panoramic views.The ultimate experience, though, is the outdoor rooftop: a vast, lushly planted space with 250 seats stretched comfortably around several sides of the enormous building, and your choice of stunning views across central Paris with monuments in the distance. The hotel opened in October (the rooftop opens in April), the product of a years-long renovation project to remake a post office dating from the 1880s. There is no other space quite like this one in Paris yet, certainly not in this central a location: just a few minutes on foot from the Louvre, and a few minutes by taxi to the offices and business hotels of the adjacent 8th arrondissement.Which Paris bars do you like to mix business and pleasure in?

464  In the past two weeks, a much brighter light has been shone on how and why the world’s most influential central banks are scrambling to regain control of the inflation narrative and contain further damage to their policy credibility. The key message coming out of recent meetings of central bank policymakers is that inflation is higher and more persistent than expected — and the risks to their projections are tilted to an ever greater rate of price rises. It is a major shift for the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank which, unlike the Bank of England, maintained a call that inflation was “transitory” for far too long. Some market commentators have characterised this as a “hawkish pivot”. If it is a pivot, it is partial at best, still too slow and risks an over-compensation later this year. Currently, the two banks’ extremely accommodating policies are inconsistent with both their change in language on inflation and developments on the ground.Rather than facilitate a smooth transition for monetary policy and the economy, this continued go-slow approach will force both to tighten more this year than they would have had to otherwise. This will amplify worries about how the global economy and markets will cope with rising borrowing costs and prices.Already concerns about inflationary expectations becoming more embedded are building. There is a risk that price and wage setting shifts from seeking to compensate for the impact of past cost increases to also starting to include an element for future anticipated inflation.These considerations led the Bank of England to raise interest rates by 25 basis points, the first time it has opted for back-to-back increases since 2004. The fact that four of the five members of the Bank’s policymaking committee preferred an immediate 50 basis points rise suggests that a third consecutive increase at the next meeting is almost a done deal.What I view as desirable and timely policy moves by the Bank of England stand in stark contrast to ECB and Fed inaction — a disparity that increases the BoE’s policy challenges.With its policy meeting last month, the Fed should at a minimum have signalled more seriousness in tackling inflation by immediately stopping its large-scale asset purchases.Even before Friday’s blowout December jobs report, failure to do so had contributed to a remarkable shift in market expectations that centre on five hikes for this year alone, with one prominent bank (Bank of America) forecasting seven. This, in my view, would constitute an excessive tightening of monetary policy given that the Fed is also expected to reduce its bloated balance sheet.For its part, the ECB should have provided stronger guidance on interest rate rises this year at its policy meeting last week. The markets are already pricing in such increases. The ECB also reiterated its adherence to a “step-by-step” approach to raising rates only after stopping net bond purchases, a move that further reduces its degrees of freedom.All this increases the possibility of a second central bank policy mistake in as many years. The more the Fed in particular delays, the greater the risk of a summer bunching of monetary policy tightening that unduly suffocates the much needed strong, inclusive and sustainable economic recovery.An even bigger risk is that such policy tightening would come after inflationary expectations have been de-anchored, resulting in a twin blow — higher prices and lower income. That hits particularly hard the most vulnerable segments of the population. The damage would be amplified if pronounced market volatility spills back into the broader economy.The consequences of these policy mistakes extend well beyond Europe and the US. They are particularly threatening to developing countries lacking policy flexibility and financial resilience. It took way too long for the Fed and ECB to correct their misreading of price increases. The additional difficulties this poses are now being compounded by unnecessary delays in altering what remains an inexplicably uber stimulative monetary policy stance. Rather than ensure a soft landing for the economy, the world’s two major central banks are likely to be forced into excessive “catch-up” policy tightenings.Stubbornly slow and partial now, the policy pivot that is sure to occur in the next few months risks considerable damage to livelihoods. Letter in response to this article:Central banks are circumspect on inflation for a reason / From Stefan Gerlach, Chief Economist, EFG Bank, Zurich, Switzerland
465  EU legislators are preparing a cross-party bid to vote down Brussels’ new rules on green investments over the inclusion of nuclear power and natural gas as sustainable energy sources. MEPs from the European Parliament’s major groups have told the Financial Times that the “taxonomy” produced last week by the European Commission faces an uncertain fate. The parliament has the power to reject the rules by majority vote within the next six months.“The biggest chance of rejecting the taxonomy is within the parliament. It is going to be an uphill battle but there is widespread annoyance at how MEPs have been ignored during the consultation,” said Bas Eickhout, a Dutch green MEP.The taxonomy is designed to indicate which activities deserve a green label when investors want to channel private capital into sustainable technologies.The rules have been contentious because an alliance of countries that rely heavily on gas and nuclear energy pressured the commission to ensure the taxonomy did not punish those energy sources.Legislators do not have the power to amend the rules and can only either reject or approve them outright. A majority of EU countries support the taxonomy, despite opposition from anti-nuclear states such as Austria, Luxembourg, Denmark and Spain.MEPs need a simple majority — 353 votes — to veto the rules and force the commission back to the drawing board.Environmental activists are targeting MEPs as the only way to force a change in the rules. Parliament officials told the Financial Times that most MEPs from the centre-left Socialists and Greens will reject the taxonomy. They alone are not enough to form a blocking majority.However voting on the taxonomy is likely to follow national, rather than political lines, meaning that centre-right or liberal MEPs from countries like Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden, and Luxembourg could also join the ranks of dissenters.Some German conservatives also oppose the treatment of nuclear power and gas.Markus Ferber, a MEP from Germany’s Bavarian conservatives, said German legislators were split on how to vote. “We have a variety of approaches so it is difficult to give an estimation on the final numbers”, Ferber told the FT. “It will be difficult but not impossible for the taxonomy to be approved in the parliament.” A veto from the parliament would embarrass the commission, which had hailed the taxonomy as a “green gold standard” for international investors to follow. It will also give a fillip to rival jurisdictions, such as UK and US, which are devising their own green finance rules.MEPs’ grievances against the taxonomy also extend to how the rules were devised. The legal text from the commission, the EU’s executive, did not receive input from MEPs but only from EU member states and a group of independent experts, some of whom have subsequently criticised the final outcome.“Whereas the taxonomy was meant to be science-based, it is now subject to political meddling”, said Paul Tang, a centre-left MEP. “The commission uses the back door of a delegated act, rather than the front door of primary legislation, to push this through.”Letter in response to this article:Stick to the science-based spirit of the EU taxonomy / From Paul Schreiber, Regulation Analyst, Reclaim Finance, Paris, France
466  At Marine Le Pen’s first big election campaign event on Saturday in Reims, the city where for centuries French kings were crowned, the far-right politician told supporters she was ready for the biggest job today’s republic can offer: president.But much like the royals once anointed here, Le Pen is facing an offstage power struggle worthy of the court of Versailles.Defections by some key party officials, who have joined the camp of far-right challenger Eric Zemmour, and the potential political comeback of her charismatic niece and rival Marion Maréchal — who has also hinted at supporting Zemmour — are complicating Le Pen’s efforts to unseat President Emmanuel Macron.“It is a difficult moment for her,” said Robert Ménard, the far-right mayor of the southern city of Béziers, who has long shared the ideas of Le Pen’s movement but not joined her party.Six months ago Le Pen, who has led the far-right Rassemblement National — National Rally — party since 2011, was roughly tied with Macron at the top of the polls ahead of the two-round April election. The 53-year-old seemed well placed for another duel with Macron in the run-off after losing to him in 2017.But the sudden rise of anti-immigration polemicist Zemmour late last year has divided Le Pen’s targeted base of voters, who for the first time in decades have an alternative to the political dynasty started by her father.Polls suggest a tight race for a spot in the run-off. In recent weeks Le Pen has polled around 3 percentage points ahead of Zemmour in terms of first-round voting intentions, and 1 point ahead of conservative candidate Valérie Pécresse, who may benefit from far-right divisions to grab a place in the run-off.A new poll from Ifop published in Le Parisien on Saturday showed Le Pen and Zemmour with equal support for the first time, and Pécresse slightly ahead of both.As Le Pen campaigned in Reims, Zemmour held a rally 200km away in Lille and focused his speech on economic issues and the cost of living — topics he had previously left largely to Le Pen and others, while he focused on immigration and the threat that he says Islam poses to French society.Although Zemmour has sapped Le Pen’s support, some think his fiery rhetoric has had the effect of making her seem less extreme. Le Pen’s long-held strategy has been to seek to normalise the RN by changing the party’s name, exiling overtly racist elements and presenting a fleshed-out governing programme. She recently accused Zemmour of rehabilitating “nefarious characters” she had expelled.“Eric’s candidacy actually re-centres Marine politically since he is so extreme,” said Ménard, who after flirting with Zemmour has declared his support for Le Pen. “Even the family conflict can also play in her favour if it makes people identify and sympathise with her.” Among a crowd of 3,000 in Reims, Eléonore Cagnard, a retired teacher and longtime RN member, said she had come out to support “Marine”. “My two adult children have gone over to Zemmour. He has good ideas but is too brutal for me,” she added.During her speech, Le Pen ignored Zemmour and instead trained her criticism on Macron, contrasting her nationalist patriotism with his “progressive” globalism while dismissing Pécresse as his clone. “He is not only scornful but depressing! We must close the Macron chapter,” she said.She addressed her opponents’ jibe that her previous loss against Macron in 2017, after a disastrous television debate, was proof she could never win. “I’ve learned a lot. At times I failed. I stumbled and fell, but I always got up,” she told her cheering supporters. “Today I am ready for the highest office.”Not everyone in the RN ranks still believes Le Pen can make a breakthrough. Jérôme Rivière, a European parliament member who headed RN’s Brussels delegation, decided last month to support Zemmour after “traumatic” losses for Le Pen and the party in regional elections. “After that I realised that she will never be able to win the presidency. It’s not a glass ceiling — it’s a ceiling made of concrete,” Rivière said.Rivière is one of several RN MEPs who are expected to run for legislative seats for Zemmour’s new Reconquête! (Reconquest) party in June. “There will be more,” said a person in the Zemmour campaign.Another blow came when Marion Maréchal broke her silence to say she was considering supporting Zemmour and returning to politics after giving up her French parliamentary seat in 2017.The 32-year-old, who chose to drop the surname Le Pen, was once a popular figure among the RN faithful, creating a rivalry with her aunt.Her politics are closer to those of Zemmour: she is more conservative on social issues such as gay marriage and more liberal in terms of economic policies. The two women also disagree on strategy since Maréchal believes in building bridges with the centre-right, much as Zemmour advocates, while Le Pen’s bet is to aim for votes from the working classes who in times past would have voted for leftwing parties.Although Maréchal told Le Parisien she “did not want to recreate fracture in the family”, she hinted she could run for office again and lauded the “progress in posture, tone and gravity” by Zemmour in his campaign.Despite the ructions, Le Pen remains a far more popular figure than Zemmour, according to multiple polls. In an Odoxa-Le Figaro poll of 1,000 people published on Friday, 32 per cent of respondents had a positive opinion of her vs 22 per cent for him. Even those who identify as far-right prefer her by 16 points.Louis Aliot, the RN mayor of Perpignan, projected calm confidence in Reims: “We are running a good campaign and mobilising our troops. There is no crisis.”Indeed, the far-right’s overall poll scores are at historic highs, showing how France has grown more conservative. “Taken together Zemmour and Le Pen are polling around 30 per cent of first-round voting intentions — that is colossal for the far-right,” explained Odoxa’s Emile Leclerc.Paradoxically, it is that apparent success in the battle of ideas that is feeding the far-right power struggle, said Béziers mayor Ménard.“People are positioning themselves for what they think will be the total reordering not only of the far-right but also [the] conservative faction of the traditional right,” he added. Whatever the result of this year’s elections, he said, “things will be radically different on the right and far-right”.

468  Paris is a city obsessed with history, where you can’t walk into a Starbucks without a glassed-in bit of 18th-century boiserie. And in modern fashion terms, it’s well versed in reinvigorating existing heritage; this happened first in 1983, when the late Karl Lagerfeld audaciously revived the house of Chanel. But the mood of this current reinvention feels different. These five names – Pieter Mulier at Alaïa, Nicolas Di Felice at Courrèges, Casey Cadwallader at Mugler, Guillaume Henry at Patou and Daniel Roseberry at Schiaparelli – are grabbing attention with very different approaches. Combined, however, they add up to something like a new Parisian style template – and it’s a million miles away from the classic tropes of old.There isn’t an aesthetic thread connecting this bunch of fashion houses, nor their designers: you can’t reconcile the coquettish taffeta and ruffles of the new Patou with the sharp ’60s-tinged minimalism of Courrèges, nor those with the body-conscious sexuality of Mugler. But there is a similarity in situation and approach. All have come to prominence, largely, over the pandemic – some installed before, some, like Mulier (appointed in February 2021) and Di Felice (September 2020), working entirely during the Covid-19 restrictions. Their clothes have had to communicate differently to attract fans and customers without the traditional mechanics of the fashion industry.Casey Cadwallader, the 42-year-old New Hampshire-born creative director of Mugler since 2017, has seen phenomenal success with his intricately engineered clothing, in particular bodysuits with panels of opaque and sheer mesh, as worn by Beyoncé on the cover of British Vogue, and pretty much every other pop star of note. He draws from the house’s founder, Manfred Thierry Mugler, who died in January and found fame in the ’80s and ’90s with his racy designs that combined futurism with old-world glamour, and his bestselling fragrance Angel (1992). The Mugler signature is now more accessible, reflected in panelled denim jeans (which Cadwallader himself wears), or a new collaboration with Jimmy Choo including twisty, thigh-tugged boots that are a cross between hosiery and high heels. “I think at the moment we’re craving something that is very, very individual,” Cadwallader says, succinctly elucidating the unique appeal of each of these labels. “Each house really has to focus on what it does differently and get out of the grey zone because there are so many brands, so much Instagram, you really need to crystallise what it is that your brand does.” He pauses. “And do it better than anybody else.”The definition of sexy is much more open and dynamic than it was in the ’90s”Individuality also extends to Cadwallader’s casting and, latterly, the films that he’s used to unveil his collections – using models with genders across the binary, including actors Hunter Schafer (Euphoria) and Dominique Jackson (Pose). “For me, the exploration of what sexy is today is really at the crux of my work,” he says. “I think that Mugler has always been synonymous with sex and the body and projecting a certain image. Historic Mugler represented the culture it was born within, which was a time where it was all about a woman seducing a man… Now, it’s about a woman’s own sense of self and empowerment. The definition of sexy is much more open and dynamic than it maybe was in the ’90s. You don’t need to be a certain age or a certain height or a certain build.”Courrèges, which was founded in 1961 by husband and wife André and Coqueline Courrèges, fell off the fashion map in the early ’80s, and in recent years has been fitfully sputtering to try to gain some traction once again. If the name isn’t familiar, you will know the look: in 1964, Courrèges pioneered “Space Age” fashion, much ripped off then and ever since. The task of 38-year-old Di Felice has been to reinvent a 1960s look (vintage pieces of which are still sported by enthusiasts today) that many could see as an albatross. “I don’t feel restricted,” he counters. Before arriving at the house, Di Felice was womenswear senior designer under Nicolas Ghesquière at Louis Vuitton, and before that Balenciaga (coincidentally, Courrèges was a tailor to that label’s formidable founder, Cristóbal). His second catwalk show back in September – shown en plein air on a giant white square plonked in the middle of the Bois de Vincennes – featured the label’s signature slithery PVC and lots of miniskirts, alongside criss-cross wrapped tops and exposed flesh. “That was hot,” drawled a New York stylist to me as we left the space. “Those girls – Gigi, Bella – they’re not gonna care about the history. They’ll just love that stuff.”These labels are not like Chanel or Dior, where just the name can semaphore a look, a history and a philosophy (or, at least, a logo and a handbag). Patou, in particular, is a label whose identity is hard to pin down. It was founded in 1914 by Jean Patou, whose sportswear pieces were a major competitor to Gabrielle Chanel in the 1920s, but he died in 1936 aged just 55. Patou has gone through a revolving door of designers since, including Christian Lacroix, who reinvented the house in the ’80s, proposing his postmodern mish-mash of references, rich colour, bustles, bows and generally giddy silliness that was manna to the wardrobe of socialites such as Blaine Trump and Gloria von Thurn und Taxis. It was also haute couture, produced in tiny numbers and visibly expensive, that was perfect for its time.Henry, the only Frenchman among this new roster of designers, was chosen by Sidney Toledano to helm the now LVMH-owned Patou in 2018. He has looked to revive the house with his own memories of that ’80s heyday combined with the spirit of Jean Patou’s sportswear; instead of a couture ballgown, you have a sweatshirt and a bubbly pouf skirt, or a T-shirt with a gargantuan lace collar that looks as if it came from a Van Dyck portrait but can be buttoned off and bunged in the washing machine. “It’s also very nice to not be traumatised by the archives,” says Henry, who shrugs off the challenge of trying to revive a brand that many thought consigned to history long ago. “I’m really into fairytales – so it’s like we’re bringing life to a Sleeping Beauty,” says the 43-year-old with a smile.As Henry observes, archive clothes from these houses are very much being exhumed, revived and reworn by a new generation of consumers. There has been a healthy trade in Courrèges since the early ’90s, an era whose styles were influenced by retro and, in a typical case of fashion’s always short-term memory, are being revived themselves right now. Vintage Alaïa pieces fetch phenomenal figures at resale – especially his intricate intarsia knits of leopard spots and butterflies, and anything worn by supermodels, whose careers Azzedine Alaïa helped to craft as lovingly as his clothes. Creative director Pieter Mulier is buying vintage Alaïa for his own reference too. And, on the flip side, Mugler is happy to lend its archive – the rapper Cardi B has sported a number of one-offs. An original piece by Elsa Schiaparelli, who founded her house in Paris in 1927 and was a rival to Coco Chanel, can now fetch hundreds of thousands of dollars. The house’s modern revival, led by Daniel Roseberry, is perhaps more wearable. His surrealist designs, which draw on Schiaparelli’s original mission, have found favour on the red carpet, worn by Beyoncé and Emma Corrin, and by Lady Gaga to sing the national anthem at President Biden’s inauguration ceremony.These houses are connected by geography rather than ideology: ask any of the designers about Parisian style and you don’t get visual references – no beret and no Catherine Deneuve. “The younger generation, maybe, have never heard about her,” says Henry, a phrase that would’ve been considered Bastille-worthy a few years ago. “I love to share things with my team because they’re mostly younger than me,” he continues. “And the way they see fashion is something different. It’s more connected to the idea of attitude and community.” Cadwallader agrees: “The way that fashion feels in Paris is a total frame of mind.” And even though his Mugler is extreme – in fact, all these houses are offering pretty extreme aesthetics – there’s an idea of it being able to be broken down, pulled apart and integrated into everyone’s wardrobe.“I took over a brand that’s really Parisian, but I think Parisian style is more about the way they wear things,” adds Di Felice. “Today, there are fewer questions about if this is womenswear or menswear. It’s just about what you want to wear. And André Courrèges was obsessed, even more than walking on the moon, with dressing people on the street.”More than anything, these designers are dressing people who will likely wear their pieces mixed with vintage, with other designers, with sneakers and with jeans. Even if their clothes are sometimes extreme, what connects them is a sense of practicality. “To make a house live again, there’s no better option than to make clothes that people will wear,” says Di Felice pragmatically. And then he goes back to work, to do just that.
469  One of the largest and most illustrious places to stay in Paris is up for sale for €800mn, testing investors’ appetite for such trophy hotels in a post-coronavirus world. The Westin Paris Vendôme hotel, which has hosted Napoleon III’s wife, Russian dukes and the Dalai Lama since it was built in 1878, is being discreetly marketed by owners Henderson Park, according to two people familiar with the deal. Henderson Park purchased the hotel, which is franchised by the Marriott group and which occupies an entire city block, in 2017 for a reported €550mn from Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC. The hotel is currently being offered at around €800mn despite the impact of the pandemic on the sector — a “punchy” valuation, according to Kenneth Hatton, head of hotels in Europe, the Middle East and Africa at property company CBRE.“This is an asset with a lot of reconfiguration that is required so redevelopment risk is always something to be considered,” Hatton said, adding that the 440-room hotel, which faces onto the Tuileries gardens, had become “old and tired”. The sale has drawn interest from a handful of bidders, according to one of the people, including sovereign wealth funds, very wealthy individuals and heads of state. But none is yet in exclusive talks to purchase the property, which houses retail space below its rooms.“Given the footprint it will be very much of interest to a global pool of capital who will want to own forever real estate in the heart of Paris.particularly Middle East and Asian [buyers],” Hatton said.The sales process, first reported by property publication React, is a gauge of the willingness of investors to buy into high-end city centre hotels after two years in which the sector has been battered by ongoing and volatile travel restrictions. Luxury hotels have suffered particularly badly given their dependence on overseas visitors and the hefty overheads required to maintain their staff and services.Henderson Park has cut costs in the hotel, where suites with a view of the Eiffel Tower are advertised at around €4,000 a night. With the pandemic eating into revenues, the Westin announced a large round of redundancies at the start of 2021. Around half of the 350 or so staff at the hotel were made redundant and their roles filled with subcontractors. The Parisian market had already faced a tough period coming into the pandemic with supply outstripping demand as travellers steered clear of the city in the wake of terrorist attacks in 2015 and 2017, followed by the gilets jaunes protests a year later.Paris’ luxury and high end hotels have trailed rivals in London and Berlin with their highest occupancy levels since 2015 reaching 73 per cent compared to 81 per cent in London and 79 per cent in Berlin, according to the industry data provider STR.Hatton said that the Westin would need between €175mn and €250mn spent on it to “bring it to true luxury” as well as a radical reduction in the number of rooms but said that a developer could give it a quick “lipstick and rouge” makeover for around €50mn to €100mn if they were less keen to commit capital.The hotel has previously been heavily reliant on meetings and events such as high-end fashion shows, an area of travel that is likely to be among the last to recover from the pandemic.Henderson Park declined to comment.
470  Joe Biden sought to co-ordinate “diplomatic and deterrence efforts” in the Ukraine crisis with Emmanuel Macron ahead of the French president’s visit to Moscow on Monday to meet Russia’s leader Vladimir Putin.The White House on Sunday afternoon said Biden had spoken with Macron, the latest in a series of talks between the US president and allies in an effort to defuse the threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.“The leaders discussed ongoing diplomatic and deterrence efforts in response to Russia’s continued military build-up on Ukraine’s borders, and affirmed their support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” the White House said of the call.“They agreed their teams will remain in touch and continue consulting with our allies and partners, including Ukraine,” it added.The flurry of diplomatic activity will continue on Monday when Biden is due to host Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, at the White House to further co-ordinate the western response.In an interview with Fox News Sunday, Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, said the US was preparing for all scenarios as a deeper Russian invasion could happen at any moment, including a “contingency where Russian forces drive on the Ukrainian capital”.“[An attack] could take a number of different forms. It could happen as soon as tomorrow or it could take some weeks yet. [Putin] has put himself in a position with military deployments to be able to act aggressively against Ukraine at any time now,” Sullivan told ABC News.But he stressed that a diplomatic solution remained on the table.“We are ready if President Putin chooses to continue to engage in diplomacy and we are serious about that and we are ready to respond in a united, swift and severe way with our allies and partners should he choose to move forward with a military escalation,” Sullivan said.Macron’s visit to Moscow could be pivotal. France’s president, who has spoken to Putin by phone three times in the past 10 days, has signalled that he would recognise Russian security concerns without abandoning support for Ukraine’s sovereignty.Macron on Sunday outlined what he called a “realistic” approach to the threat of war, as more than 100,000 Russian troops massed on Ukraine’s borders.“Russia’s geopolitical aim today is obviously not Ukraine but the clarification of the rules of how Moscow lives with Nato and the EU,” Macron said in an interview with Le Journal du Dimanche.He added: “The security and sovereignty of Ukraine and of any other European nation cannot be compromised in any way, just as it is legitimate for Russia to raise the issue of its own security concerns.”Macron, who is also due to meet Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in Kyiv on Tuesday, said his aim was to prevent a Russian military operation that other western leaders had warned was “imminent”.“The intensity of the dialogue we have had with Russia and this visit to Moscow are designed to stop that happening,” he added. “Then we will discuss the terms of de-escalation. We have to be very realistic. We will not obtain unilateral gestures, but it’s essential to stop the situation deteriorating.”Russia has denied it has any plans to invade Ukraine. Dmitry Peskov, Kremlin spokesperson, said last week that Monday’s talks with Macron would focus on security guarantees that Moscow was seeking from the US, Nato and other western allies.French officials said Macron was communicating with Biden and other Nato allies and EU partners to ensure a united front over Ukraine, even as he was simultaneously pursuing his goal of a “new European security order” that would give the EU more responsibility for its own security.Ahead of Macron’s talks with Putin, Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, spoke on Sunday with Jean-Yves Le Drian, France’s foreign minister, about “joint efforts to strengthen Nato’s eastern flank and to ensure Russia understands the high costs it would incur if it were to invade Ukraine further”, according to the state department.One senior official in Paris, asked whether Macron was too accommodating towards Putin, said: “He doesn’t do it on his own behalf or in a manner that is isolated or secret.He [Putin] is the one who has made the threats so it’s with him that we must look for de-escalation.”
471  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
472  Brussels is examining how to shield consumers from a potential energy crisis as part of plans to protect Europe’s households, businesses and borders from the fallout of a Russian military escalation in Ukraine.Diplomats have told the Financial Times that the EU is discussing contingency measures to deal with risks from surging gas prices, a possible migratory crisis and cyber security threats if Russia invades Ukraine.The priority of the EU’s emergency planning is to cope with any reduction in gas flows from Russia, which as Europe’s largest supplier accounts for about 40 per cent of imports.World leaders will on Monday meet on both sides of the Atlantic to seek a diplomatic solution to de-escalate the crisis with Russia. Emmanuel Macron will meet Vladimir Putin face-to-face in Moscow after three phone calls in the past 10 days. The president of France plans to tell his Russian counterpart that, while the security of Ukraine cannot be compromised, he understands that Moscow has concerns of its own.At the same time, Olaf Scholz has flown to Washington to meet Joe Biden for the first time since becoming Germany’s chancellor in December. He intends to present a united front with the US president following accusations that Berlin had become a weak link in the west’s resistance against Russia’s build-up of more than 100,000 troops on Ukraine’s border.Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, told the Financial Times in an interview on Friday that the EU needed to be prepared for “any scenario” with Russia and Ukraine — part of which was to do everything it could to find alternative energy sources.“You would never trust a gas supplier that is not reliable,” she said. “This scenario would be very difficult for the EU, but the same goes for Russia with its one-dimensional economy. In such a situation we would also do everything to alleviate the pressure on households and consumers.”The commission is examining how it could intervene temporarily to weaken the link between record gas prices and the cost of wholesale electricity in the EU if there is a gas crisis — a measure that EU officials dismissed a few months ago during a record electricity price surge.The EU’s agency for energy regulation has warned against disrupting the bloc’s pricing system for electricity, saying introducing tools such as price caps would jeopardise the security of supply by forcing some suppliers out of business.Officials told the FT that short-term plans to deal with a crisis would also include securing increased flows of liquefied natural gas from big producing countries.Europe’s energy prices surged to record highs at the end of 2021, driven by fears over Russia’s willingness to supply imports during a full-blown military conflict. Should Moscow shut off all supplies to Europe, it would lead to emergency rationing and rolling blackouts in the EU, according to analysts at Citi.The contingency plans are due to be presented to EU capitals next month, although an extraordinary summit would be convened more quickly if Moscow increases its military threats.Officials said discussions were also likely to include how to handle any potential flows of refugees from Ukraine into neighbouring EU countries. Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania all border Ukraine.The EU’s dependence on Russian gas has long been seen as a brake on the bloc’s ability to wield punishing sanctions on Russia. Senior EU officials have in recent weeks embarked on diplomatic charm offensives towards big LNG producers, with the likes of the US, Azerbaijan and Qatar approached for additional supplies.After discussions in Baku on Friday, Kadri Simson, EU energy commissioner, said Azerbaijan had shown a “clear willingness to support the EU in case of a disruption of gas flows”.She is due to hold talks with the US this week over the country’s LNG capacity. The EU is additionally planning to open discussions with Nigeria as it seeks opportunities to expand its sources of LNG supplies.The commission said Brussels was working on ways to “make our energy markets even more resilient and operate in the most optimal way”.Letter in response to this article:Von der Leyen quip recalls master of the malapropism / From John Murray, Guildford, Surrey, UK
473  Klaas Knot has become the first member of the European Central Bank governing council to say publicly that it should raise interest rates this year, warning that eurozone inflation would stay at 4 per cent for most of this year.The Dutch central bank governor called for the ECB to end its net bond purchases “as soon as possible” in preparation for raising interest rates in the fourth quarter, which would be the first time it has done so in more than a decade.His comments, in an interview with Dutch television programme Buitenhof, came only days after ECB president Christine Lagarde refused to rule out raising interest rates this year, signalling that it could accelerate plans next month to end net bond purchases.Until last week, the ECB had dismissed the chances of a rate rise this year as “highly unlikely”.In response to Lagarde’s comments, markets last week shifted to pricing in half a percentage point of rate increases by the end of this year, Bloomberg data on trading in money markets showed. Such a move would lift the central bank’s deposit rate to zero for the first time since 2014.“Personally I expect our first rate increase to take place around the fourth quarter of this year,” Knot said. “Normally we would raise rates by a quarter percentage point, I have no reason to expect we would take a different step.”The Dutch central bank governor, one of the more conservative “hawks” among the 25 ECB governing council members, said he thought a second rate rise would follow early next year.“At the moment we still have our foot on the accelerator,” said Knot, referring to the ECB’s bond-buying which has amassed €2.2tn of assets since the pandemic hit almost two year ago. “We have to end that as soon as possible. That’s just adding fuel to the fire.”In December, the ECB agreed a “step-by-step” reduction of its asset purchases down to €20bn a month from October, but did not set an end date.Eurozone inflation has defied expectations that it would fade this year, climbing to a record of 5.1 per cent in January.In response, Lagarde said there had been “unanimous concern around the governing council table about the impact of inflation”. Higher than expected inflation has also led the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England to shift to more “hawkish” policy stances. The BoE raised its main policy rate to 0.5 per cent on Thursday, less than two months after increasing it to 0.25 per cent, while investors are pricing in five rate rises by the Fed this year.Lagarde said last week the ECB would stick to the “sequence” it had already agreed of only raising rates after it stopped net bond purchases, adding that the council would be “gradual in whatever we do” and “not be rushed into anything”.Knot seemed to agree, saying: “Before you step on the brake pedal, you must first take your foot off the accelerator.”Since last week’s ECB meeting indicated a likely “hawkish” shift in policy, analysts have brought forward the timing of when they expect it to start raising rates, with many predicting one or two such moves by December.
474  Olaf Scholz meets Joe Biden for the first time on Monday with a clear mission — to restore German credibility in the eyes of sceptical allies dismayed by his response to the Ukraine crisis.As the German chancellor heads to the White House, he faces accusations at home and abroad that Germany has become an unreliable partner and the weak link in the west’s united front against Russia.His domestic opponents say he has failed to show leadership over Ukraine and contrast his lack of assertiveness in the conflict with the robust role played by his predecessor, Angela Merkel, after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.“Europe is facing the biggest threat to peace and freedom and the chancellor has basically disappeared,” Friedrich Merz, leader of the opposition Christian Democrats, told Bild. “All his predecessors would have acted differently.”Meanwhile, officials are increasingly alarmed by the anti-German hostility that is spreading in Washington. Der Spiegel last week cited a leaked memo by Emily Haber, German ambassador to the US, headed: “Berlin, we have a problem,” which described how Congress saw Germany as a brake on sanctions against Russia.Warning of the “immense” damage being done to Germany’s reputation, she said Republicans viewed Berlin, with its overriding interest in maintaining gas exports from Russia, as “in bed with Putin”.Much of the anger stems from Germany’s refusal to send weapons to Ukraine. Indeed, it has also stopped Estonia from delivering howitzers that were once part of the east German army’s stockpiles.“To me this is outrageous that Ukraine is not receiving the weapons it needs because another country, part of the Nato alliance, is saying that they are not going to approve the transfer,” Republican senator Rob Portman said last week.Part of the problem, analysts say, is that Scholz had only been in the chancellery for a few weeks when Russia’s military build-up on the Ukrainian border in December began to stoke fears of an imminent invasion.“This is a chancellor who is inexperienced in international affairs and suddenly he’s thrown into one of the worst global crises in recent memory,” said Ulrich Speck, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund.He also has to deal with a coalition partner — the Greens — with a strong pacifist tendency, and parts of his own party, the Social Democrats, “who don’t want to confront Russia”, Speck added.One Social Democrat in particular has proven a big headache: former chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who took a post in the Nord Stream gas pipeline project from Russia to Germany after leaving office in 2005 and was last week nominated to the board of Gazprom, the Kremlin-controlled gas giant. He has angered Germany’s political establishment with his pro-Russian interventions, accusing Ukraine of “sabre-rattling”.The damage caused by Schröder and other voices sympathetic to Russia in the SPD is likely to cast a shadow over Scholz’s talks in the White House. “Germany’s reputation in Washington has tanked and Scholz has a lot of repair work to do,” said Thorsten Benner, director of the Global Public Policy Institute in Berlin.German officials play down the talk of a new climate of mistrust between Berlin and Washington. They say both agree on the need to deter Vladimir Putin from sending troops into Ukraine and insist Germany is fully signed up to the package of sanctions being assembled by western governments.The Scholz government has also toughened its rhetoric on Nord Stream 2, the gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea that is completed and awaiting regulatory approval, saying it cannot go ahead if Russia invades Ukraine.Berlin has hosted a succession of senior figures from the Biden administration in recent days, including secretary of state Antony Blinken and CIA director Bill Burns, and officials say Scholz has been active behind the scenes, too.In an interview with Fox News Sunday, Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, also sought to minimise differences between Washington and Berlin, saying they had been “co-ordinating closely” on a sanctions package. He said that while Berlin did not send lethal military aid to Ukraine it was supplying substantial financial support.On the military front, Sullivan said Germany was hosting bases that were critical to the defence of Nato’s eastern flank. “The reason that we are able to swiftly move a battalion into Romania to reinforce and reassure our ally.is because those forces were stationed in Germany.”Scholz is increasingly stepping into the international spotlight. After he returns from Washington he will meet the leaders of the three Baltic states in Berlin, before travelling to Kyiv on February 14 and to Moscow a day later.Officials say talks with Putin will emphasise the “high price” Russia will pay if it decides to invade Ukraine. Berlin believes the message has more credibility coming from Scholz than from other western leaders.“Everyone tells us — you have a special relationship with Russia that no one else has,” said one German official. “With Putin, no one’s getting through.”Yet some dismiss the idea that Germany can influence Putin’s behaviour. “The Russians have made it clear that they don’t take us seriously any more as an interlocutor,” said Speck. “They just see us as part of the US sphere of influence.”Even those in Germany who think talk of divisions with its allies is overblown say Scholz has failed to make clear to the German public what’s at stake over Ukraine. He won September’s election on a platform skewed towards domestic reform.“It’s partly Scholz’s fault that he didn’t communicate his own position [on Russia] forcefully enough,” said Benner.His aides say that misreads Scholz’s style. “His view is you have to do your job behind closed doors,” an official said. “If you keep making public statements during negotiations, you just end up narrowing your options.”To Scholz’s critics, the official urged patience. “Let’s see the result at the end and judge him then — not now.”Additional reporting by James Politi in Washington
475  The UK is planning to spend £6bn over three years on a new global science fund, if the EU refuses to let the country take part in its Horizon Europe research programme, the government’s preferred option.George Freeman, science minister, told the FT that he was working on the new international fund, known in science policy circles as Plan B, while still hoping that Brussels will give Britain associate membership of Horizon Europe — the EU’s main funding programme for research and innovation with a budget of €95bn over seven years.British association with Horizon Europe was foreseen in the 2020 Brexit agreement but has not taken place yet, as a result of continued disagreements between the EU and UK over Northern Ireland and other issues. Switzerland remains shut out too for similar political reasons.“Our position remains that we want to associate. Hopefully, perhaps after the French elections and the resolution of various issues still being discussed around Brexit, association will be possible,” said Freeman, who campaigned strongly for Remain during the 2016 referendum.He declined to say how long the UK would wait before giving up on Horizon but said the government was actively formulating an alternative “coherent and ambitious plan for international science.based on the elements of Horizon that researchers find most valuable: global fellowships, strong industrial challenge funding, innovation missions around tomorrow’s technologies. Outside Horizon we have the freedom to be more global,” he said.Freeman said he was “reaching out to science allies” outside the EU including Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. With Switzerland also feeling “very frustrated” by its exclusion so far from Horizon Europe, he will meet the Swiss science minister on Monday.“One problem with Plan B is that we don’t really know yet what it would involve,” said Daniel Rathbone, head of policy at the Campaign for Science and Engineering, a grassroots pressure group. “With Horizon Europe we know what we’re getting and the deal is ready to go if politics permit.”Pressure on Brussels to admit the UK is coming not only from British scientists but also from their continental counterparts who maintain that failure to reach an agreement would damage European science as a whole.“With the first Horizon Europe grant agreements approaching and new calls soon to be launched, UK association must be finalised without further delay,” hundreds of EU science and research bodies told Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, in a joint letter late last year.James Wilsdon, professor of research policy at Sheffield university, said: “The uncertainty is already leading to a downward spiral in collaborative activity between scientists in the UK and the continent.”He agreed that the government had to prepare a Plan B but should be more open with UK researchers about what it could and could not achieve. “We may be able to create a global grant-giving programme but it will be extremely hard to replicate the whole collaborative structure of Horizon Europe,” Wilsdon said.Freeman’s appointment as science minister last September was welcomed warmly by most UK scientists, who appreciated his knowledge of the sector from a pre-parliamentary career founding high-tech companies and then a spell as minister for life science in David Cameron’s coalition government.Rathbone said Freeman still enjoys support from the research community. “He has hit the ground running,” he said. “He has a lot of ideas and enthusiasm for the sector and is engaging with scientists.”Although the autumn’s spending review cut the rise in public R&D funding to £20bn in 2024-25 from the £22bn promised in 2020, researchers are still looking forward to an increase in real terms from the £14.9bn allocated this year.Besides Horizon Europe, another issue on Freeman’s ministerial plate is the new Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria) which the government is setting up with a £800mn budget to carry out high-risk high-reward research, modelled on the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa).Aria was a personal enthusiasm of the prime minister’s former special adviser Dominic Cummings, who left 10 Downing Street in November 2020, and some feared that the project was losing momentum. But it received a boost last week when Peter Highnam, a highly regarded computer scientist who is currently deputy director of Darpa, agreed to become Aria’s first chief executive on a five-year term starting in May.“When Peter Highnam, who for those who aren’t familiar with him is to science what Alex Ferguson is to football management, wants to become CEO of this exciting new agency, that is a huge validation of our plans and our science,” says Freeman. “We are now in the process of appointing a chair to complement Peter.”“We have created Aria in a way that is free of interference and management from Whitehall,” Freeman added. “It’s the ultimate laboratory to attract the world’s best scientists to come and use our infrastructure for research to answer the big questions facing the globe in the 21st century.”Aria’s chair and chief executive, together with a small group of programme managers, will have flexibility and power to select and pursue projects without interference, compared with their counterparts at UK Research and Innovation, the country’s mainstream science funding agency.Though ministers have been criticised for exempting Aria from the freedom of information requirements to which other public bodies are subject, Freeman insisted: “This is public money and Aria will be accountable to Parliament.But we want to be able to say to Peter Highnam: ‘You have the freedom to create here a living lab of exciting discovery science without the all too common short-term funding constraints and bureaucracy that dominate so much of global research’.”
476  The writer is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. He previously served as an under-secretary of state and chair of the Pentagon’s Defense Science BoardFor those paying attention to the worrying advances in hypersonic weaponry by China and Russia, the news that the Pentagon is pushing US defence companies to hasten their own progress on hypersonic weapons is a welcome development. The race must now be on to catch up, or risk ceding the advantage to America’s adversaries.Both China and Russia conducted hypersonic missile tests in the summer of 2021. Russia’s test of its hypersonic Skyfall nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed cruise missile took place at its Novaya Zemlya Island test range in the Arctic Ocean. Being nuclear powered, the missile has unlimited range.China also conducted two flight tests of hypersonic ballistic missiles. One flew in a fractional earth orbit on a manoeuvring trajectory to the target region in China. The other also flew on a manoeuvring trajectory, and additionally released a second hypersonic object — a “first” for any nation.The significance of these tests was quickly brushed off by both the arms control community and the media. Russia’s was reduced to environmental disregard (“a flying Chernobyl”) while China’s was dismissed as “nothing new” since Russian fractional orbital flights had taken placed during the cold war.These reactions missed the importance of such capabilities in the nuclear modernisation efforts of both China and Russia. Manoeuvring hypersonic vehicles are not simply another means of delivering a nuclear warhead to a target. Instead, they are an essential part of a “system of systems” designed to defeat the US’s early warning abilities.The US ballistic missile early warning system is a set of satellites and radars that are integrated with their command, control and communications system to detect, locate and track adversary missile attacks. Taken together, these interdependent capabilities are crucial to maintaining an effective nuclear deterrent. They were so fundamental to mutual deterrence during the cold war that the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty included provisions aimed at protecting them from attack.The evolving importance of space has been obscured by the seamless way in which space capabilities have become integral to both everyday public life and national security. But operations there are decisive for nuclear deterrence.Both China and Russia have well developed advanced offensive capabilities in space. In late January, for example, China’s Shijian 21 (CJ-21) satellite disappeared from its regular position in geostationary orbit 22,000 miles above the earth. The CJ-21 manoeuvred close to one of China’s malfunctioning satellites in its 35-satellite Beidou constellation. There it used a grappling arm to move the malfunctioning satellite to a “graveyard” orbit.The Space Priorities Framework published by the Biden administration in December recognises space as “critical to modern warfare”, but continues to adhere to its position that the US will not use space for offensive military applications. This leaves our deterrent vulnerable to nations who do not share this view.The US is developing a space-based system that uses advanced infrared sensors which may be able to detect manoeuvring hypersonic warheads. However, current missile defence systems do not permit them to engage with rapidly manoeuvring warheads. China and Russia have also developed counter systems that jeopardise US space monitoring and communications capabilities at low, medium and high altitudes.By manoeuvring their satellites for offensive space operations adjacent to US satellites, China and Russia could conduct a wide variety of offensive operations. These include disrupting, spoofing or destroying sensors, on-board computation, data links or satellite electric power systems, and inserting malicious code using cyber techniques.All of this is augmented by their ability to employ both cyber and kinetic capabilities to attack critical American infrastructure. This is the basis upon which military operations depend, as well as the electric power system, national telecommunications and the air and rail transportation systems that underpin US economic and military power.China and Russia’s manoeuvring hypersonic missile capabilities enable these adversarial powers to have an integrated capacity to defeat the US early warning system. Under these circumstances, the US would be blind to an incoming foreign missile attack, and its ability to respond significantly constrained.
477  This is one of the world’s most tense borders — where little more than 30 years ago no frontier existed. Ukraine and Russia were part of a vast Soviet Union, whose dissolution in 1991 has shaped the two countries’ relations ever since.For many observers in Ukraine and the west, it is a history defined by the Kremlin’s desire to retain influence in what it calls its “near abroad”. For Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, it has been coloured by Nato’s expansion east, which he claims is a security threat to Russia.Below are some key events that have led to the rupture between the two countries. Ukraine’s experience of the Soviet Union (USSR) was marked by the holodomor, when Soviet leader Joseph Stalin’s policies led to a mass famine in the early 1930s that Ukraine historian Serhii Plokhy said killed about 4mn in two years.Kyiv declared independence from the Soviet Union in August 1991. On December 1 that year, Ukrainians participated in a referendum on the issue, with more than 90 per cent voting for independence. Home to much of the USSR’s agricultural production, defence industries and military, the withdrawal of the second-most populous republic was decisive for the bloc. “Ukraine freed the rest of the Soviet republics still dependent on Moscow,” Plokhy wrote in The Gates of Europe. It “spelt the end of the Soviet Union.”In the first days of December 1991, Russia was still part of the USSR, but its president, Boris Yeltsin, was convinced its future lay outside the bloc, which was still led by his rival, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. A day after Ukraine’s referendum, Yeltsin’s Russia recognised Ukraine as an independent state.Crucially, Moscow recognised Ukraine’s borders as including Crimea, the multi-ethnic, multilingual Black Sea peninsula, which was transferred from Russia to Ukraine as a “gift” by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in 1954 in an effort to win Kyiv’s loyalty.“For Yeltsin it was truly a politically remarkable step,” said Vladislav Zubok, professor of international history at the London School of Economics. Yeltsin believed moving fast would hasten both the demise of the bloc, and Gorbachev’s resignation. It did both within weeks.However, the question of Crimea, which held symbolic significance for Russians and Ukrainians, could not be put on hold, as Yeltsin had hoped. A dispute broke out almost immediately over the future of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet.When the Soviet Union fell apart, many of its nuclear weapons ended up scattered across newly independent states. Kyiv held the majority of the Soviet arsenal outside of Russia, including 1,900 strategic nuclear weapons designed to strike the US.“When Ukraine became independent. it was not only born nuclear, it was born the third-biggest nuclear power in the world,” said Mary Elise Sarotte of Johns Hopkins University, author of Not One Inch, a history of Nato expansion in Europe.A diplomatic push led to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons and sent the warheads to Russia for destruction. In return, the US, Britain, and Russia pledged to “respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine” and “refrain from the threat or use of force against [its] territorial integrity or political independence”. Moscow violated this pledge when it annexed Crimea.In autumn 2004 hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians took to the streets to protest against an election result they believed had been rigged to favour a candidate backed by Moscow.Pro-western Viktor Yushchenko, whose campaign colours were orange, had emerged as the frontrunner with a platform to crackdown on the oligarchic economic system that had taken hold in the preceding decade, when state assets were privatised.But despite exit polls showing his victory, the election commission gave the presidency to Viktor Yanukovych, former governor of the Donetsk region and Putin’s preferred candidate.A winter of protests on Kyiv’s central square led to a vote rerun and the victory of Yushchenko, who had been poisoned and permanently disfigured during the campaign.The Kremlin said the “Orange Revolution” was part of a plot by foreign intelligence services — and a dress rehearsal for regime change in Russia itself. Ukrainians began looking west. You are seeing a snapshot of an interactive graphic. This is most likely due to being offline or JavaScript being disabled in your browser. In 2008, as Ukraine’s new leaders worked on turning the country to face the west, Yushchenko sought a Nato Membership Action Plan (MAP) for Ukraine, a major step towards joining the alliance. The US supported the idea.But by then, after Poland joined Nato in 1999, and the Baltic states, Bulgaria and Romania in 2004, Putin viewed the transatlantic alliance’s expansion as a smokescreen for attempts to contain Russia. He threatened to point nuclear weapons at Ukraine should it proceed, describing the young democracy as “not even a country” and a part of Russia.As a result several Nato members stymied Washington’s push to grant Ukraine and Georgia Nato MAPs. Instead, a promise was penned at a summit in Bucharest in April. “We agreed today that these countries will become members of Nato,” the alliance said in a declaration.By August, Russia was at war with Georgia. In the four-day invasion, Moscow seized two breakaway territories, to foster the sort of conflict that would make it difficult for the country to join Nato. In 2010 in Kyiv, Yanukovych — a former prime minister — became president. He quickly dropped Ukraine’s Nato bid, in a big concession to Moscow. Despite their government’s close ties with Moscow, many Ukrainians continued to see their future within Europe. When, in 2013, the opportunity came to join the EU’s Eastern Partnership programme — set up to bring Ukraine, among others, closer to the EU — it found wide popular support in the country’s west, an opinion poll showed. But many in the east preferred a customs union with Russia. Moscow was promoting this union at the time, and was watching with concern as Ukraine prepared to ink agreements with the EU.Yanukovych backed out of the EU arrangement at the last minute, in favour of a backdoor deal with Putin. The U-turn sparked the Euromaidan movement that brought hundreds of thousands of protesters in Kyiv’s central square. You are seeing a snapshot of an interactive graphic. This is most likely due to being offline or JavaScript being disabled in your browser. The movement, which became known as the Revolution of Dignity in Ukraine, toppled Yanukovych, who fled to Russia on February 21 2014. Less than a week later, armed men in green uniforms without insignia seized the Crimean parliament, cut Crimea off from Ukraine, switched off its access to Ukrainian media and, amid an intense propaganda campaign, staged a referendum on the peninsula’s reunification with Russia. Held in March, it allegedly garnered support from 97 per cent of voters. No observers from overseas were present and the vote has not been internationally recognised. The same spring, Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine began to demand independence, leading to a war that has so far killed some 14,000 people.Large-scale fighting has subsided but the region is caught in a stalemate, with two self-proclaimed and Russia-backed separatist republics established around the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk. Two agreements, brokered by Germany and France via a set of talks known as the Normandy Format, were signed in 2014 and 2015 in Belarus’s capital Minsk. These have attempted to lay the foundations for peace, but there has been little progress. Officially, Russia denies it is one of the sides in the conflict and agrees to participate solely as a mediator.The election of Volodymyr Zelensky as Ukraine’s president in 2019 was followed by several prisoner swaps, but relations between Moscow and Kyiv have since soured further. In spring 2021, Russia moved more than 100,000 troops to the Ukrainian border. The Normandy talks, designed to implement the so-called Minsk agreements, were severely undermined in November when Russia’s foreign ministry published its private diplomatic correspondence with Germany and France. The same month, the US and its allies began warning that Russia may be planning another invasion. Moscow issued a set of security proposals in the form of two treaties, including a request that Ukraine never join Nato and the alliance roll back its presence from former Warsaw pact states.Putin and US President Joe Biden spoke twice by phone before the new year in an attempt to resolve the crisis, and a string of meetings were held in January between Russian diplomats and their counterparts in the US, Nato and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. The conflict remains unresolved.

478  Every morning, Benoit Gannaz places a small black device in his breast pocket to make sure his work is not killing him. Like every worker at the Chooz A nuclear power facility in northern France, he carries a detector that measures ionising radiation levels at all times.The reactor was turned off more than three decades ago and the most hazardous materials removed soon after, but nobody here is taking any chances — least of all the project manager overseeing the challenging and lengthy process of decommissioning Chooz A. Gannaz’s job is to ensure the remaining hazardous materials on site are removed and stored away safely now that the lifecycle of the reactor is at an end.The risks are manageable though, he says. Radioactive exposure is measured in sieverts. One would make you sick, five would likely kill you. In more than 15 years in the field, Gannaz says the highest annual exposure he ever received was 0.05 mSv, or a thousandth of a sievert.“Do you think everyone who works outside is afraid of sunburn? Not really, they wear sunscreen. Not everyone who works in nuclear is afraid of radiation,” he says, standing a few steps away from a shimmering pool that holds thick wedges of highly radioactive metal. “I’m more afraid if the doctor sends me to get an X-ray I don’t need — that’s the equivalent of 6 months of work for me.”But the abundance of caution at Chooz A — one of six colossal nuclear reactors that are in the process of being shut down by EDF, the state-controlled utility company that owns and runs all of France’s nuclear power plants — underscores the high level of sensitivity still surrounding the technology even in France, the last bastion of nuclear power in Europe.The potential for catastrophic meltdowns at nuclear plants, such as the accident in Chernobyl in 1986, has led governments to move away from the technology. After the Fukushima nuclear disaster 10 years ago, Germany announced it would shut down all of its nuclear power plants by 2022 and Belgium vowed to close all of its facilities by 2025.However, there has been a wave of renewed interest in nuclear power over the past year. The governments of France, the US, China and India have all recently come out in favour of building new nuclear plants in the years ahead, with French president Emmanuel Macron expected to outline new orders in the coming weeks. Investments in nuclear are expected to total $45bn in 2022 and $46bn in 2023, up from $44bn in 2021, according to analysis by Rystad Energy, with 52 reactors at present under construction in 19 countries worldwide.The appeal of nuclear is the need for a reliable, carbon-free source of energy to complement clean yet inconsistent energy sources such as solar and wind power. The European Commission recently included nuclear power in its so-called “green taxonomy” of industries eligible for sustainable finance, provoking criticism from some scientists and climate change activists.Yet as momentum grows for a new generation of nuclear power plants in Europe and elsewhere, there is little discussion of the huge costs and complexity of dismantling the plants at the end of their approximately 50-year lifespan. And nobody has yet given a satisfactory answer to the question of what to do with thousands of metric tonnes of high-level nuclear waste, some of which can remain radioactive, and thereby lethal, for up to 300,000 years.A quarter-million metric tonnes of spent fuel rods are believed to be spread across 14 countries worldwide, mostly collected in cooling pools at closed-down nuclear plants, as engineers and waste specialists puzzle over how to dispose of them permanently. Many believe these are sitting ducks for terrorist organisations and that they could potentially cause catastrophic spills or fires.The cost of maintaining these sites can be extraordinary, and last for decades. Sellafield in the UK, for example, contains the largest stock of untreated nuclear waste on earth, including 140 tonnes of plutonium. Though the plant was shut down in 2003, it remains the biggest private employer in Cumbria. More than 10,000 people continue to undertake a colossally expensive clean-up that is expected to take more than 100 years and cost above £90bn.“Nowhere in the world has anyone managed to create a place where we can bury extremely nasty nuclear waste forever,” says Denis Florin, partner at Lavoisier Conseil, an energy-focused management consultancy in Paris. “We cannot go on using nuclear without being adult about the waste, without accepting we need to find a permanent solution.”With the Chooz A reactor, France is attempting to do just that — and in the process create a prototype for how decommissioning could be done more efficiently. If it succeeds, it could help convince environmentalists that nuclear power has a part to play in creating a greener planet. But there is still a heavy dose of popular opposition to the best option there is on the table for the waste: burying it.The challenge with cleaning up Chooz A is not so much the site itself as the materials once contained within. The facility was shut in 1991, and within three years 99.9 per cent of the most highly radioactive materials had been evacuated to a specialist plant 620km away in La Hague, in the north-west of France.According to French law, the most highly radioactive elements of a plant, the fuel and the rods, should be removed as quickly as possible once the plant has been shut down — in stark contrast to policy in most other parts of the world, where the most hazardous products are handled last.Some of these products have since been recycled. In a process pioneered by France, many of the uranium, plutonium and fission chemicals have been reprocessed into new fuel at the La Hague site, while waste chemicals that cannot be reused have been vitrified, or turned into glass, for short-term storage in shallow sites underground.Though EDF says the 23,000 tonnes of spent fuel it has reprocessed at La Hague are enough to power France’s nuclear fleet for 14 years, critics point to the fact that the fuel can only be reused once and the process itself creates yet more radioactive waste, without providing a long-term solution.The dismantling of the rest of Chooz A began in 2007, after it received legal permission from the state, and is due to be completed by 2024, at a total cost of €500mn. But the most hazardous waste removed from the site will remain radioactive for centuries to come, and perhaps millennia. “Only a state or a religion will live as long as the waste, and maybe not even them,” says Florin.Countries have toyed with ejecting such waste into space or burying it deep under the seabed, but these ideas were eventually deemed either impossible or too dangerous.Only one long-term solution is broadly considered safe and feasible: deep geological repositories, where radioactive material can be stored several hundred metres below ground in formations of clay, rock salt and granite that have not moved for millions of years.But no one has yet managed to do it. The US has come close; it pumped $15bn into a project to bury waste beneath Yucca Mountain in Nevada, but the initiative was eventually abandoned in the face of intense and sustained public backlash. Similar opposition from local communities has dogged attempts to find burial sites in Germany, the UK and Japan.Some countries have earmarked provisional sites to try again. After a decades-long planning and negotiation process with a remote island community, Finland will bury its radioactive waste in copper tubes in a tomb 1,400 feet below the granite bedrock in Olkiluoto island. The burial site is expected to begin operation in 2023.France has identified its own site, just outside Bure, 300km east of Paris, in which radioactive waste might be entombed. Consisting of a research centre sitting above a web of tunnels and vaults almost 500 metres below ground, the Cigeo project has so far cost €2.5bn and involved 25 years of research.The French government is due to decide this year whether to declare the site officially viable as a storage option, setting in motion another sequence of construction and authorisation stages that would lead to the first toxic samples being deposited between 2035 and 2040.The ambition is to seal all the tunnels irreversibly from 2150, with residues encased in blocks of cement or steel within the ultimate barrier — a subterranean layer of clay with the ideal properties to entrap any material that eventually seeps out. This seeping material should lose its radioactive qualities within the 100,000 years it would take them to permeate other strata.But Cigeo has attracted the same kind of vocal opposition found at other potential burial sites. And, as a result Bure, a village of fewer than 100 inhabitants, has become a battleground where protesters have regularly clashed with police over the future of the site.Demonstrators have set up a “house of resistance” in Bure that has become a magnet for anti-nuclear protesters around the country. The former barn is equipped with a projection room, mattresses to welcome guests and a cosy communal kitchen.Campaigners say the Bure site has become representative of a broader cause. “Beyond the waste, it’s nuclear production above all else that worries us,” says a 29-year-old jurist who gave his name as Antoine, one of a handful of campaigners manning the fort on a snowy February morning. “It’s a supposedly low carbon source of energy, but you’ve got to build the reactors. it is such a dangerous and destructive solution.”Yet the state holds that the undeniable risks of nuclear energy are outweighed by its potential benefits as a cost-effective way of cutting CO2 emissions. According to a report last year from French grid operator RTE, France’s cheapest way to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 would involve building 14 new reactors.Under the scenarios RTE presented, if France built no new nuclear reactors and relied exclusively on expanding renewables and extending the lifespan of existing nuclear, this would cost €10bn more per year than other options including new reactors, with the cost of decommissioning factored into the final bill.But that may not factor in the costs of convincing French citizens to host such facilities in their backyards. Bure resident Anne-Marie Henn, a retiree, says the project has forced her and her artist husband Jacques to give up on their dream of creating a painting atelier in an annex to their home. “We’d like to leave, but our house isn’t worth anything any more,” she says.Ed Lyman, senior global security scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, who has spent decades researching nuclear power safety, says the science behind burying waste is robust, and the dangers of corrosion or leakage minimal. But there remain real risks for the public, he says, such as accidents happening when materials are transported to the site.“There may be a price [communities] are willing to accept in order to stomach the waste and its risks, but we don’t know what that price is yet,” he adds. “If it’s high enough, it will ultimately add to the cost of disposal.” Local authorities have poured millions of euros of subsidies and compensation into the area to support the project and residents. In Bure, that has translated into snazzy lampposts lining every street alongside the barns and stone houses; households have also got fibre optic internet connections and sanitation networks have been improved.“We’ve got to deal with this crap,” Henn says. “At the very least we can benefit a bit from [subsidies].”But the concerns of many communities go way beyond immediate dangers to more existential questions: how can we ensure that not just our children and grandchildren, but people living thousands of years in the future have the knowledge and understanding to handle it responsibly? And how can we be sure that the storage containers we have developed now will stand the test of time?“What we’ll be getting here is the really dangerous core of the waste,” Henn says, adding that it was “the generations to come” that worried her.Andra, the French state agency responsible for nuclear waste management, is considering ways to warn future generations of what lies below Bure — perhaps by inscribing microscopic information on a hard disk of sapphire, designed to withstand erosion, should the site be forgotten. “Even if we lose our collective memory, the storage site will be safe,” says spokesperson Audrey Guillemenet.If these kinds of innovations fail to impress French lawmakers and the site does not win approval, that leaves the government with a problem that goes far beyond the billions spent on construction. “Some 50 per cent of the [nuclear] waste destined to come here eventually already exists,” says Guillemenet. Forget the next generation of power plants; the decades-old materials Gannaz and his predecessors have removed from Chooz A are a problem that needs a solution.

479  US military and intelligence officials believe that Russia is planning to hold a big nuclear weapons exercise this month as a warning to Nato not to intervene if President Vladimir Putin decides to invade Ukraine.General Mark Milley, chair of the joint chiefs, and Avril Haines, director of national intelligence, told lawmakers in the House of Representatives on Thursday that Putin was planning to start the exercises in mid-February, according to a Congressional aide with knowledge of the closed-door briefing.Russia generally holds its annual nuclear exercises — which involve testing intercontinental ballistic missiles from land, sea and air — in the fall. But the US believes Putin has decided to hold them earlier this year as a show of strength in the event that he orders his military to further invade Ukraine.The US believes that the optimum time for a Russian invasion would be from mid-February to the end of March.Holding the exercises to coincide with an invasion would send a powerful reminder to Nato about the strength of Moscow’s nuclear forces, which are the largest in the world. Russia has just under 4,500 nuclear warheads in its stockpile, according to the Federation of American Scientists.“It would be an incredibly provocative and foreboding message if they did that simultaneously with an invasion of Ukraine,” said Rebeccah Heinrichs, a nuclear weapons policy expert at the Hudson Institute in Washington.The US has not determined if Putin has decided to invade Ukraine. But with its allies, Washington is increasingly alarmed by the continuing military build-up of Russian forces around the border with Ukraine.In the past two weeks, Russia has increased the number of battalion tactical groups — which can range from 750 to 1,000 troops — deployed in the border region from 60 to 83, according to one Nato source. Another 14 BTGs are also in transit to the border area. The US believes Russia has also deployed between 1,200 and 2,100 special operations troops in the region.The new battalion tactical groups and other troops deployed in the area bring the total number of Russian forces in the region to well over 100,000.Washington estimates that Russia has deployed enough forces for a limited attack but has only positioned 70 per cent of the troops that it would need for a full-scale invasion, which would include an assault on Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital.US military experts believe Russia has the capability to deploy enough forces for a full invasion by the middle of February, which would coincide with the expected start of its nuclear weapons exercises.Earlier this week, President Joe Biden ordered the deployment of 2,000 US troops to Poland and Germany, in an effort to send a signal to Putin about the strength of the Nato alliance. On Thursday, the US accused Russia of preparing to fabricate an attack by Ukraine or the west, in a “false flag” operation designed to create a pretext for an invasion.On Tuesday, Putin accused the US of trying to “drag” Russia into armed conflict and said it was ignoring Russia’s security concerns and its demand for a guarantee that Nato would not admit Ukraine in the future.The Russian leader received support from Chinese president Xi Jinping on Friday when he visited Beijing for the opening of the Winter Olympics. In a joint statement, they said they “oppose further enlargement of Nato”.A senior US official said China should have used the meeting with Putin to encourage him to de-escalate in Ukraine.“If Russia further invades Ukraine and China looks the other way, it suggests that China is willing to tolerate or tacitly support Russia’s efforts to coerce Ukraine even when they embarrass Beijing, harm European security, and risk global peace and economic stability,” he said.Follow Demetri Sevastopulo on Twitter
480  Austria became the first developed world country to write compulsory Covid-19 vaccines into law this week, with any citizen refusing the jab soon to be guilty of a criminal offence.When the country’s conservative-led government announced its vaccine mandate plans late last year, surging infections in much of Europe left some wondering if Vienna was ahead of the curve.Three months on and the opposite is the case: numbers are falling and many European countries, including neighbouring Switzerland, have moved to loosen legal obligations on their citizens.The turnround is a sign of the volatility and unpredictability of pandemic politics. Austria’s government now finds itself in a bind: committed to a policy that has broad public support, but with the prospect of that support very rapidly eroding.“The government is really stumbling around and I think a lot of people perceive that,” said Thomas Hofer, a Vienna-based political consultant. “Polls show a majority are still in favour of the new law, but it’s hard to see how that doesn’t fall.”A sizeable minority of Austrians are resolutely opposed to the obligations contained in the Compulsory Vaccination Act, which President Alexander Van der Bellen will sign into force in the coming days. Large — and sometimes violent — anti-mandate protests have taken place in several Austrian cities in recent weeks.Austrian chancellor Karl Nehammer, who is just two months into the job, has cast the new law as a victory for liberty, saying citizens would be better protected when the next wave of coronavirus hit. “The only path to freedom is through vaccination,” he told a parliamentary debate last month.His conservative Austrian People’s party (ÖVP), the country’s largest political group, draws support from older, traditional voters who mostly endorse the vaccine mandate. But the swing voters who the ÖVP has had success in targeting, including more moderate young people as well as wavering supporters of the hard-right populist Freedom party, are mostly opposed.Efforts to sweeten the pill, including a lottery draw that offered those who could prove they had received a shot a chance to win shopping vouchers, looked increasingly desperate, Hofer noted.With Denmark recently dropping all virus-related restrictions and the UK and others not far behind, Austria seems to be increasingly out of step with the rest of Europe, nor could the contrast with Switzerland be more stark.Both ended 2021 with remarkably similar epidemiological profiles. Roughly a quarter of adults in each country were unvaccinated, while rising infections were pushing case numbers to their highest levels during the pandemic.Yet while Austria proposed its sweeping vaccine law, Switzerland merely tweaked the rules on gatherings and venue capacity and said only boosted people could go to nightclubs. Bern said this week it was considering abandoning all of its Covid-19 restrictions completely, including mask wearing, from February 16.Today, about 30 per cent of Swiss citizens are unvaccinated, compared with 24 per cent of Austrians.Aware it is on delicate ground, Austria’s government has planned a gradual rollout of the new law. The first phase begins next week and will last until mid-March, when unvaccinated citizens will again be invited to get jabbed.Police will then begin enforcing the law, conducting spot checks and issuing fines to those found to be unvaccinated. In the final stage, the start date of which has not yet been set, a national database will be used to track and fine the remaining holdouts.It is unclear whether the measures will convince the roughly 2mn vaccine-hesitant Austrians. In January, the government sent individual letters to each of them to schedule vaccination appointments. Just 4 per cent responded and turned up.A new party dedicated to opposing restrictive and coercive pandemic-related measures has also gained votes. The MFG, an acronym in German for “People, Freedom, Rights”, was initially derided as a party of vaccine sceptics and conspiracists, but it has drawn on an increasingly broad base of support.The MFG won more than 6 per cent of the vote in September elections in the key state of Upper Austria and last weekend swept up 17 per cent of the vote in the town of Waidhofen an der Ybbs, where votes for the ÖVP fell from 60 per cent to 41 per cent despite it being a traditional stronghold.“It’s absolutely not the case that we’re against vaccines,” said MFG chair Michael Brunner. “We consider vaccinations a fundamentally innovative and valuable form of medicine.“But we believe vaccinations must always be voluntary,” he added, citing the Nuremberg Code, a set of ethical guidelines governing scientific research and human experimentation drafted after the second world war.“I assume that a minimum of 2mn people are going to refuse to obey this law,” he continued. “It won’t just be people who haven’t had a vaccine, but also many who for example are double vaccinated but don’t want a third. People are not prepared to accept a lifetime of vaccinations.”
481  Gerhard Schröder, the former German chancellor, has been nominated to join the board of Russian energy giant Gazprom, fuelling scrutiny of his close links to the Kremlin-controlled company as tension mounts between Moscow and the west over whether Russia is preparing to invade Ukraine.Gazprom is also facing criticism over whether it has stoked a gas crisis in Europe by sending fewer supplies than in prior years. The group on Friday said it had proposed Schröder as a candidate to be appointed at its annual shareholder meeting on June 30.In the list of 11 candidates to the board, Schröder is set to replace Timur Kulibayev, the son-in-law of Kazakhstan’s former long-serving president Nursultan Nazarbayev.Schröder served as Germany’s chancellor during the early years of Vladimir Putin’s presidency in Russia. He joined the board of directors of Rosneft, Russia’s top oil producer, in 2017.He also has close ties to Nord Stream, the Gazprom-controlled pipeline bringing gas from Russia to Germany. Schröder became head of the shareholders’ committee of Nord Stream shortly after leaving office and is president of the administrative board of Nord Stream 2, a new branch of the pipeline that will double its capacity. The new pipeline is still awaiting regulatory approval in Berlin.Berlin’s allies in the US and Europe have harshly criticised both pipelines for potentially making the EU even more dependent on Russian energy exports. Nord Stream 2 is at the heart of debate over potential western sanctions on Russia in case Moscow invades deeper into Ukraine.Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, this week said Russia was “using gas supplies as leverage on us” and that Gazprom had “cast doubt on its reliability” by restricting supplies to Europe at a time when prices have soared to record levels.Gazprom and Putin have repeatedly said the company has fulfilled all requests for supplies.Schröder’s board nomination at Gazprom will prove controversial in Germany at a time when his defence of the Kremlin is proving increasingly embarrassing for his party, the Social Democrats, and Olaf Scholz, the current SPD chancellor.Scholz is due to visit US President Joe Biden next week in his first trip to the US since taking office late last year.Schröder is considered a close friend of Putin, whom he once referred to as an “impeccable democrat”. Putin took a Cossack choir to Hanover to celebrate Schröder’s 60th birthday in 2004 and 10 years later the former chancellor marked his 70th birthday in St Petersburg, at the height of the crisis over Russia’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula.He has also intervened in the Ukraine crisis, criticising Kyiv’s requests for weapons from the west as “sabre-rattling” and blaming Nato for Russia’s troop build-up on Ukraine’s border.“Schröder acts like Putin’s lobbyist, he works and is paid for it,” said Norbert Röttgen, a prominent MP for the opposition Christian Democratic Union. “It’s a shame.”Neither Schröder nor his office responded to a request for comment.His nomination to Gazprom echoes the appointment of other former senior western politicians to prominent positions in Russian business. France’s former prime minister François Fillon joined the board of directors of Zarubezhneft, a Russian oil company, last year.Additional reporting by Erika Solomon in Berlin and David Sheppard in London
482  Global government bonds underwent a fresh wave of selling on Friday as traders ratcheted up expectations that the world’s leading central banks will be forced to take more aggressive measures to tame inflation.Short-term debt, which is particularly sensitive to monetary policy expectations, was at the centre of the sell-off. In a reflection of sliding prices, the yield on US two-year Treasury notes — an important global benchmark — jumped 0.11 percentage points to 1.3 per cent. That sizeable shift, for a market that typically moves in tiny increments, took yields to the highest level since early 2020.Across the Atlantic, Germany’s five-year Bund yield rose as much as 0.13 percentage points, and ultimately closed above zero per cent for the first time since 2018.“G10 policy rate pricing has shifted sharply towards anticipating earlier and faster hikes,” said William Marshall, an interest rates strategist at Goldman Sachs.The moves came at the end of a hectic week for global monetary policymakers. The Bank of England on Thursday raised its main interest rate for the second time in a row, while on the same day, the European Central Bank signalled a hawkish turn in policy. A day later, a much stronger than expected report on America’s labour market solidified expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise borrowing costs aggressively this year to slow persistently elevated price growth.Bill Papadakis, macro strategist at Lombard Odier, added that the “one key driver across markets is this now co-ordinated hawkish pivot by the main central banks”.The speed at which policymakers have had to adjust their plans was particularly stark in Europe, where a report on Wednesday showed inflation in the eurozone unexpectedly rising to a record high of 5.1 per cent.Christine Lagarde, ECB president, on Thursday acknowledged that inflation risks were “tilted to the upside” and declined to rule out rate rises this year. Only last month, she dismissed such a move as “very unlikely”.The hot inflation data and Lagarde’s more hawkish shift prompted a big adjustment in market expectations for the bank’s monetary policy outlook this year. Markets are now pricing in half a percentage point of rate increases by the end of 2022, compared with about 0.12 percentage points at the end of last week, Bloomberg data on trading in money markets show.Giovanni Zanni, chief euro area economist at NatWest, said Lagarde appeared to be “morphing into a hawk” as she took more seriously the risks that inflation continued to significantly overshoot the ECB’s medium-term target of 2 per cent.“Inflation has been stickier than originally anticipated and risks are now tilted to the upside,” said Fabio Bassi, a rates strategist at JPMorgan.Goldman expects the ECB to end its huge asset purchase programme in June, followed by quarter-point rate rises to the deposit rate in September and December, leaving the central bank’s main policy rate at zero by the end of this year.A report on Friday showing the US economy added 467,000 jobs last month — far higher than the 150,000 expected by Wall Street analysts — bolstered expectations that the Fed will rapidly reduce its stimulus measures this year.Following the jobs report, traders in the futures market began pricing in more US rate increases. More than five quarter-of-a-percentage point rises are now expected this year, versus between four and five prior to the release, according to Bloomberg data. That puts forecasts of the Fed’s key interest rate at 1.3 percentage points by the end of this year.Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said the Fed was “cleared for lift-off” following the strong jobs numbers.“The 467,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in January is even stronger than it looks, as it came despite the spike in absenteeism driven by the Omicron virus wave and was accompanied by significant upward revisions to the gains over the preceding couple of months.”Additional reporting by Naomi Rovnick
483  There is a scene in the television show Servant of the People, when a fictional Ukrainian leader confronts his country’s western backers. “I want to thank the head of the IMF and its board of directors for time wasted on us, and for a very meaningful conversation,” says the president, played by Volodymyr Zelensky. “Feeling deep gratitude I want to say: Stick your head in your ass!”Fiction has turned to fact. Zelensky, elected president in 2019, is now the one defying his western partners, led by Washington, over their ever more insistent warnings of a large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine.Last month, he rebuked President Joe Biden for a gaffe about how a “minor incursion” by Russian forces might elicit a less severe western response. Then Kyiv berated Washington for withdrawing some US diplomats and their families. Last week, Zelensky took issue with repeated US warnings about an imminent Russian invasion, saying they could spread panic and serve Vladimir Putin’s aims of weakening the economy and destabilising the country.“I’m the president of Ukraine. I’m based here, and I think I know the details deeper than any other president,” Zelensky said.Many Ukrainian politicians and analysts share their president’s doubts that Russia is poised for a large-scale invasion. But castigating your closest ally is, to his critics, evidence that nearly three years into his presidency the former actor is ill-equipped for the job. “The messaging on the Russian threat is a total mess,” says Pavlo Klimkin, a former foreign minister.Supporters see a gutsy politician with a better appreciation than distant allies of the risks facing Ukraine. “On this one [invasion risk], I think he’s right,” says a European official. “He has to be calming the situation. He should be frustrated with the west. He should be furious with the Americans for pulling people out.”Zelensky, 44, had no real-life experience of government before becoming head of state. A Russian-speaking Jew, he formed a comedy outfit in his youth, known as Kvartal 95, which later became a successful production company. He shot to fame as the star of Servant of the People in which he plays a history teacher whose rant against corruption propels him to the presidency, a plot line that later became reality.He won the election with two vague promises: to end the war in the Donbas region, stirred up by Moscow and its separatist proxies in 2014, and to break the oligarchs’ corrupting influence on the state. A war-weary population angry with pervasive graft lapped it up, seduced by his likeable, clean image.Zelensky hoped to be “a good guy for everyone”, says Maria Zolkina of the Democratic Initiatives Foundation, a think-tank in Kyiv. Once he started taking positions, disillusionment set in. His early, fruitless attempts to forge a deal with Putin angered Ukrainian nationalists, while disappointing pro-Russian voters, a key part of his electorate.Even allies say he was too optimistic at the outset. “He was really dreaming of a fast, successful transformation. He believed he’d find some solution with Russia. He believed he would get some support from the west,” says Yuriy Vitrenko, head of energy group Naftogaz. At their first summit, Zelensky hoped to woo Putin with his personal warmth, Vitrenko adds. “Putin was not joking. He was not even tough. He was cruel.”The Ukrainian president’s efforts against the oligarchs are meanwhile making limited progress. Last year, he slapped sanctions on Viktor Medvedchuk, a pro-Russian businessman and politician, and closed down his TV channels, infuriating Putin. But Ihor Kolomoisky, a businessman who supported his election campaign, and who is under investigation in the US for fraud and money laundering, has faced no charges in Ukraine. Corruption charges levelled at Zelensky’s predecessor Petro Poroshenko are seen by western officials as politically motivated.Zelensky’s government has passed some reforms, including a liberalisation of land sales. But he has a record of removing ministers and officials who fail to bring him instant results.The government is run by a small team of aides, some of them associates of Kvartal 95. European officials complain of an “information bubble” surrounding Zelensky. A lot of power lies with Andriy Yermak, the head of the presidential administration, who is a family friend, lawyer and film producer by background. “The institutions are currently extremely weak,” says Klimkin. “It is all about people calling each other. There are no systems. The bureaucrats are totally disorientated.”Zelensky is an emotional, intuitive politician with a tendency to make snap decisions on his own. Advisers acknowledge that this habit can rub people up the wrong way.He resents the west’s failure to appreciate the complexity of Ukraine’s problems, says a European diplomat. Weak sanctions against Russia, Washington’s earlier reluctance to arm Kyiv, Donald Trump’s attempt to use Zelensky for the purpose of discrediting Biden and Germany’s new gas pipeline from Russia, bypassing Ukraine, have all created a distrust of western intentions.Zelensky fears being forced into a Donbas peace deal closer to Russian terms, which many patriotic Ukrainians would not accept, pushing the country to civil unrest. “He doesn’t trust the west,” says Klimkin. “He sees it as [exerting] all kinds of pressure. That’s his problem. He doesn’t trust Putin. He doesn’t trust the oligarchs. It is a big problem in his presidency.”
484  A surge in eurozone inflation transformed this week’s meeting of the European Central Bank’s governing council from what was widely expected to be an unremarkable event into a turning point for the bloc’s monetary policy.The shift towards a more “hawkish” stance came on the back of January’s record eurozone inflation figure, released shortly before the start of a two-day virtual meeting on Wednesday, according to five people involved.The rise seemed to spook many of the ECB council members who had until recent days believed the surge in prices in the final six months of 2021 was “transitory” and would quickly fade this year, not least because the inflationary effects of Germany reversing its temporary sales tax cut would have dropped out of the data.Instead of falling, however, inflation rose further above the ECB’s 2 per cent target for the seventh consecutive month to set a new eurozone record of 5.1 per cent. While about half of this was down to double-digit rises in energy costs, price pressures were also broadening: the cost of six out of 10 items in the basket used to calculate inflation rose over the past year.This led ECB rate-setters to agree that their president Christine Lagarde should use the press conference after its Thursday meeting to signal a likely U-turn. The best way to do this, they decided, was for her to stop dismissing the idea of a rate rise this year.Lagarde’s subsequent comments, including her remarks that inflation risks were “tilted to the upside” and that it was “getting much closer to target”, sparked a sell-off in bond markets and a surge in the euro — emphasising the pivotal nature of the move.The second factor behind the central bank’s shift was the rapid rebound of the labour market from the pandemic. This was driven home for ECB policymakers on Tuesday when Eurostat said eurozone unemployment had fallen to a record low of 7 per cent, due in large part to a drop in joblessness among young people to an all-time low of 14.9 per cent.Further evidence of the labour market’s recovery came from the European Commission, which revealed a few days earlier that record numbers of both manufacturing and services companies were complaining of worker shortages. Wage growth in Europe remains below that of the US and UK, but council members seem increasingly convinced it will pick up this year.The ECB said on Friday that after surveying 74 non-financial companies in January it found “they expected average wage increases to move from around 2 per cent in the recent past to 3 per cent or possibly more this year”.The final factor convincing the remaining “doves” on the ECB council to rethink their position came when US Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell sparked a stock market sell-off last week by refusing to rule out more aggressive interest rate rises this year than markets had expected. Furthermore, all the signs pointed to the Bank of England raising rates for a second time in three months on Thursday — as it duly did.Lagarde was quick to point out that the eurozone is in a very different place to both the US, where a vast fiscal stimulus has driven demand well above pre-pandemic levels, and the UK, where Brexit has amplified pressure on the labour market and driven up wages.However, the “hawkish” shift in policy by both the Fed and the BoE risked leaving the ECB looking like “the last dove standing’‘ — as Allianz economist Katharina Utermöhl described it this week. One ECB council member said it risked tightening policy “for credibility reasons, not for fundamental reasons”. But others said there was a widely shared feeling that the Fed and BoE had found themselves behind the curve on inflation and the ECB did not want to end up in the same tricky position.So where does this leave the ECB? Several of the more conservative “hawks” on the council spoke out at Thursday’s meeting in favour of clearly communicating plans for an accelerated end to bond purchases, which are due for a “step-by-step” reduction this year but still have an open-ended timeline.However, the “hawks” eventually agreed to wait until the ECB’s next policy meeting in March, when it is likely to raise its inflation forecast above 2 per cent for the next two years — fulfilling a key condition for it to eventually raise rates.One of those calling for a change in policy to be announced more quickly was Joachim Nagel, the new Bundesbank president, though a spokesman for Germany’s central bank said he was “very happy” with the outcome of Thursday’s meeting.An extra factor complicating the ECB’s position is the rising tension between Russia and Ukraine. If Russia invades its neighbour energy costs are likely to rise further, but if tensions ease prices could fall. The issue was briefly discussed at this week’s meeting, but most ECB rate-setters feel powerless to either predict how the saga will end or to influence energy prices.In response to Lagarde’s press conference, traders increased their bets on higher euro area interest rates, with markets pricing in several increases in the ECB deposit rate from minus 0.5 per cent to minus 0.1 per cent by December.However, most council members think this is too aggressive. Even more “hawkish” central bank officials dismiss the idea of a rate rise this summer as “ludicrous” and say the earliest it is likely to happen is the fourth quarter.This would mean the ECB continues to lag behind the Fed and BoE in tightening policy to combat high inflation. But given that the last time the ECB raised rates was on the eve of the eurozone’s sovereign debt crisis in 2011, most council members seem comfortable with it taking a more cautious approach this time.
485  China has joined Russia in opposing further expansion of Nato, a significant step up in Beijing’s backing for Moscow as the leaders of the two countries agreed to deepen co-operation across a range of security, political and economic areas.Presidents Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir Putin of Russia said they “oppose further enlargement of Nato”, in a joint statement released by the Kremlin after the two leaders’ meeting in Beijing on Friday.With the west opposing Russia’s military build-up on the Ukraine border and China’s treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, Putin and Xi presented a united front in talks just hours before the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics. They also cemented bilateral ties with a smattering of agreements including a new gas supply deal.While China had signalled backing for Russia in its stand-off with the US and Nato in recent days, the joint statement goes much further. “This is the first time Beijing has explicitly opposed Nato enlargement,” said Alexander Gabuev, an expert in Russia-China relations at the Carnegie Moscow Center, an offshoot of the US think-tank.Xi said China and Russia would support each other’s sovereignty and interests, while also dealing with external interferences and regional security threats, according to Chinese state media. Lashing out against the US, the more than 5,000-word statement criticised “certain states’ attempts to impose their own ‘democratic standards’ on other countries”.The two countries said they were “seriously concerned” over the Aukus security pact reached between Australia, the UK and US last year. They also pledged to “increase co-operation” to counter attempts by external forces to undermine security and interfere “under any pretext”.Putin and Xi discussed what Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov called “tensions intentionally forced by the west around Russia and China”.Xi reaffirmed his support for Moscow’s proposals to develop legally binding security guarantees in Europe, Lavrov told reporters in Beijing on Friday.“The Putin-Xi joint statement from Beijing takes Sino-Russian entente to the level of a common front to push back against US pressure on Russia and China in Europe, Asia and globally. An important evolution of the already close relationship,” Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, wrote on Twitter.Russia’s Gazprom also signed a deal with China’s CNPC to supply gas via a new route with deliveries of 10bn cubic metres a year over 25 years.The affirmation of stronger Sino-Russian ties comes against a backdrop of international alarm over Ukraine. Russia has moved more than 100,000 troops to the Ukraine border in what the US has said was a prelude to an invasion.Despite the demonstration of unity, Putin and Xi carefully sidestepped areas where their interests are not fully aligned. The two leaders’ statement made no mention of Ukraine, the South China Sea or China’s border with India.Ukraine is a difficult issue for China because territorial integrity is one of the key principles of Beijing’s foreign policy. For Russia, backing China’s contested claims in the South China Sea would put Moscow’s ties with other Asian nations such as Vietnam at risk. China’s border dispute with India is problematic because Moscow is seeking to strengthen its relations with New Delhi as well.The US and many western countries have refused to send officials to the Games over China’s human rights abuses in Xinjiang, where more than 1mn Uyghurs have been interned, and Beijing’s crackdown in Hong Kong.Putin, however, is among a group of foreign leaders attending the opening ceremony of the Games, which includes Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan, Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Argentina’s President Alberto Fernández.António Guterres, UN secretary-general, and Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, are also attending.That stands in stark contrast to the roughly 80 state leaders and royals at the Beijing Summer Olympics in 2008, including then US president George W Bush, reflecting frayed ties between the west and China and disruptions caused by the pandemic.Ahead of the talks, Putin condemned criticism of China’s hosting of the Winter Games and praised the “stabilising role” played by the two countries internationally.Chinese state media touted the “close friendship” between the two leaders, quoting Putin’s view of Xi: “He’s approachable and sincere. He’s also a partner that you can rely on.”Additional reporting by William Langley in Hong KongLetter in response to this article:Potential hit to reputation of China has ‘no limits’ too / From Paul Barrett, London SW4, UK
486  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.The EU’s long-anticipated Chips Act — spelling out extra funding and potential state-aid exemptions aimed at boosting innovation and production in the microchips sector — is hitting some internal bumps. We’ll walk you through the issues and why aggressive steps including export controls are being reconsidered.On the eastern front, Jean-Yves Le Drian, France’s foreign minister, went to Romania for a regional summit, promising extra troops and support as tensions with Russia continue to run high.Separately, Poland has extended an olive branch to Brussels, after its president put forward a bill to scrap a disciplinary chamber for judges that was at the core of the dispute holding up billions of euros of funding from Warsaw.Meanwhile in Spain, a cliffhanger vote in parliament yesterday was in the end carried by the Socialist government, allowing them to adopt a labour market reform linked to further payments under the EU’s recovery fund.And in central European banking news, Slovenia adopted a much-contested law that forces lenders to pay back millions of euros to people who have taken out loans in foreign currencies.A fierce battle has broken in Brussels over plans to equip the European Commission with sweeping powers to address supply crunches in Europe’s semiconductor industry, write Andy Bounds, Mehreen Khan and Javier Espinoza in Brussels.EU officials have told Europe Express that proposals in the forthcoming European Chips Act that would give regulators powers to ensure components are prioritised for the domestic production during a crisis are being heavily contested within the commission.The EU’s industry commissioner, Thierry Breton, has been championing the new powers as part of proposals aimed at bolstering the EU’s semiconductor industry. Last week, he told reporters the forthcoming act, which was due for publication on Tuesday, would involve tools to help “shore up our security of supply” — referencing emergency US powers to prioritise domestic needs.Chip supply shortages have hit the manufacturing of cars, aircraft and other products as industry rebounds from the pandemic. The EU wants a bigger share of the global chips market as part of its quest for “strategic autonomy”. It has 10 per cent of global production and wants to reach 20 per cent by 2030, with demand forecast to double in that time. It also wants to be able to make the most advanced chips.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, who has strongly backed the Chips Act, yesterday called it a “game changer” and said it would leverage up to €12bn from the private sector and public money. In addition, member states had already committed €30bn, she said.Among the companies that the EU is seeking to woo with subsidies is Intel, which is planning to announce a new chipmaking factory in Europe. One of the ideas that is still contested in the draft plans is to loosen state EU aid rules to allow the bloc to compete with rivals which offer public subsidies of up to 50 per cent of the cost of a new plant.Von der Leyen said the EU would be “adapting” its state-aid rules, under a set of strict conditions, to permit public support for European “first of a kind” production facilities.Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s liberal competition commissioner, has pushed back against the idea that semiconductor investment will require a loosening of the EU’s state-aid rules, arguing that the current regime is equipped to help promote investment.Asked whether state rules should be changed, Vestager told the Financial Times: “No. We cannot tweak them, we already have provisions in the treaty that enable that support.” She also told the Digital Europe forum yesterday that “self-sufficiency is not our goal” and would cost €240bn-€320bn to achieve.Officials said there was a clash between senior commissioners about the level of EU subsidies needed for the sector with some fearing that it would lead to a glut in international supply. The US, China and Taiwan all heavily support their microchip industries.“Can we hope to compete on subsidies with China? And where are the billions coming from?” one official asked. Senior officials will meet today to settle their differences ahead of the publication of the rules next week.Are subsidies the way forward for Europe’s microchips industry to catch up with the US and Asia?

That military presence will form the backbone of a battle group that Romanians said France could lead. Le Drian insisted the build-up was not meant to provoke Russia.The Kremlin wants Nato to return to the 1997 status quo — meaning pulling back from central Europe — and has accused western powers of escalating the conflict by sending additional troops to eastern Europe.“I don’t think one can say this is a provocation, to respond to the commitments we have in the framework of Nato,” Le Drian told a news conference alongside his Romanian counterpart.Romania fears a conflict could affect it, as it shares a 600-kilometre (370-mile) border with Ukraine.“If you compare allied presence on the eastern flank to the troops Russia has amassed, it is several times smaller so there is no question of an attempt to escalate tensions,” Romania’s foreign minister Bogdan Aurescu said.While in Bucharest, Le Drian also took the opportunity to mention a 2019 deal to sell four French warships to Romania for €1.2bn, which has been held up by legal challenges. He expressed confidence that the contract would be carried out soon.The majority of Nato’s members continue to fall short of their common goal of spending at least 2 per cent of gross domestic product on defence by 2024. But after Russia spent the winter assembling its forces on the border with Ukraine and warning of a military response to what it said were the alliance’s eastern European ambitions, Nato had been brought back to life. (More here)Slovenia’s lawmakers have overwhelmingly passed a bill forcing banks to pay back hundreds of millions of euros to borrowers who had taken up household loans in foreign currencies, writes Marton Dunai.The country’s banks, its central bank and even the European Central Bank have warned the move may harm the health of the Alpine country’s financial system, but lawmakers, who face elections in April, passed the bill with 52 votes and just eight against.“The vote today is short-sighted and against the interests of all Slovenians and not only against the banks,” said Herbert Juranek, chief executive of Addiko Bank. “[It] is setting a negative precedent in the eurozone and will damage Slovenia’s reputation among its European partners.”The Bank Association of Slovenia will petition the Constitutional Court to review the law and temporarily halt it, it said in a statement following the vote in parliament.Slovenia was one of a number of eastern European countries where consumers seized on the opportunity to borrow at low interest rates more than a decade ago in currencies such as the Swiss franc, only to face a big hit when exchange rates moved against them during the financial crisis.In response, several governments placed limits on repayment exchange rates or converted the loans to local currency. Ljubljana has now forced lenders to pick up the costs on loans — most of which had been repaid — more than a decade after they were taken out.Banks will have to redefine repayment terms and cap exchange rate losses for borrowers at 10 per cent, repaying them for any extra costs incurred going back to 2004.The banks involved include Hungary’s OTP, Austria’s Addiko Bank and Erste Bank, Russia’s Sberbank and Italy’s UniCredit. Hungary’s OTP, which will soon become the largest lender in Slovenia after an acquisition of a rival, was not immediately available to comment.Addiko Bank said it had conducted a preliminary impact assessment, which showed a hit of about €100mn to €110mn, based on its own interpretation and assuming a worst-case scenario. That would result in a net loss for the financial year 2022, the bank said.
487  In spring 2019, Matt Miller, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, made an especially contrarian wager. He bet that Europe, the perpetual continent of yesterday, was on the verge of a technology take-off.At the time he formed this conviction, it was a bold notion — in fact, his two senior European-born colleagues had resisted the idea of a Europe office. But Miller’s intuition was an omen. Despite the continent’s lacklustre business history, this could turn out to be a tipping point: the moment when Europe began to make the shift from tech bystander to tech contender.Miller set out his provocative belief in two memos to his partners at Sequoia Capital, the top venture shop in the Valley. The core of his argument was that tech ecosystems are like start-ups: winners advance exponentially. When a tech company is founded, there is generally no product, no established market, no staff — nothing. But each step forward makes the next steps easier. In 2019, Miller was saying, Europe was at the point where the curve of progress steepens. In a few more years it might go vertical.Miller’s theory of Europe’s advance began with the number of unicorns — private tech companies worth at least $1bn. Half a decade earlier, Miller reported, Europe had been home to fewer than 10 of these rare beasts. Now there were 49 — a fivefold increase in as many years — and that was without counting the most exciting successes, which had by now graduated from the list by being acquired or going public. A few of these winners were spectacular enough to induce a frisson of FOMO, even from the Valley’s most august VC companies. Sweden’s music-streaming giant Spotify had recently gone public and was at this point worth $24.6bn. As Miller and his colleagues understood, each European $10bn-plus unicorn could be read as its own prophecy. It signalled that dozens of executives and engineers had experienced exponential growth from the inside. Having ridden a rocket one time, a fair number of these veterans would chase the thrill again — by founding new companies, joining or advising them, or backing them as venture capitalists. Following the Silicon Valley model, success would beget more success, as entrepreneurs left for new ventures and turned into coaches, mentors and angel investors.As Miller pointed out, Europe had the raw materials to feed this virtuous circle. The continent was home to three of the world’s top five computer-science programmes — Oxford, Cambridge and ETH in Zurich — and 31 of the top 100. European governments invested heavily in coding literacy: the continent boasted 5.7mn software developers compared with 4.4mn in the US.And Europe’s technology firms could hire from across the continent because of the ubiquity of English. The fintech company Klarna had workers from 55 countries at its headquarters in Stockholm.What’s more, European coders were acquiring the ambition of their American equivalents. Inward investment had a lot to do with this: each of the Big Five US tech majors — Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple and Facebook — had opened research and engineering offices in the region. On scouting trips to Europe, Miller kept running into start-up founders who had spent time at these outfits; on LinkedIn, he reported, fully 12,524 people described themselves as engineers at one of them. Exposure to entrepreneurial Americans could be highly contagious. No wonder Europe’s start-up scene was starting to feel frisky.Miller’s memos to his partners concluded with a call to action. The US and China still had far more unicorns than Europe, he admitted. But Europe was catching up. In the previous five years, the number of early start-up investment rounds had doubled in the US. In Europe, by contrast, the number had leapt sevenfold. If there is one insight that venture capitalists share, it’s that ignoring signs of exponential progress is worse than betting on them and being wrong. Risk $100 and your maximum loss is $100. Fail to risk $100 and you could miss out on a gain of $1,000 — or $10,000.“Long dead are the days when all the attractive start-ups were a bike ride away,” Miller admonished his California colleagues. “The geographic map of opportunity is only getting larger and more complex.”Miller’s colleagues listened — and acted. Miller moved to London and Sequoia poached a local star, a young Romanian named Luciana Lixandru, from the rival Silicon Valley company Accel. The courting of Lixandru involved secret meetings in out-of-the-way restaurants, the assigning of code names and a call-to-greatness email from Doug Leone, Sequoia’s top partner. “What will you wish you had done 40 years from now?” he challenged her. Sequoia, Leone insisted, was offering Lixandru the opportunity to change her continent. Europe was ready to take off, and Sequoia would supply the rocket fuel it needed.Sequoia’s decision to plunge into Europe could turn out to mark a tipping point because of the partnership’s stature. Sequoia owns stakes in a fifth of the world’s unicorns, more than any of its rivals. But the larger point relates to venture capital itself. Despite claims that they are free-riders, extracting unearned riches from the sweat of company founders, sophisticated venture investors are the main catalyst behind productive tech clusters.The triumph of Silicon Valley illustrates this truth neatly. Believers in industrial policy sometimes attribute the Valley’s rise to government-backed science or lucrative federal defence contracts. For their part, pro-business chroniclers celebrate the Valley’s entrepreneurs and inventors.Yet neither perspective is satisfying. After all, the US has never pursued an industrial policy that favoured Silicon Valley over rival technology clusters such as Boston. During the cold war, when defence dollars mattered most, more flowed to MIT and Harvard than to Stanford and Berkeley. As to the Valley’s entrepreneurs and inventors, many of them hatched their ideas elsewhere. They moved to the region because something attracted them.AnnaLee Saxenian, a distinguished Berkeley sociologist, has come closest to explaining the Valley’s key advantage. In Boston, the electronics business was dominated by large, secretive, vertically integrated corporations. Engineers might come up with brilliant inventions, but if these didn’t fit with corporate strategy, they would fall by the wayside — and technicians at other companies would never hear of them. Silicon Valley, by contrast, was a bubbling cauldron of small businesses, each one hungry for a new idea, none of them held back by hierarchy. Corporate secrecy was not a thing. Ideas spread like wildfire around the Valley because of places like Walker’s Wagon Wheel, a packed watering hole where techies from competing firms traded gossip freely.Why did it take a sociologist to spot this advantage? Economists have always acknowledged the vitality of industrial clusters — finance in New York, movies in Hollywood. They are less good at explaining why one cluster might pull ahead of others.But in a celebrated article published in 1973, Saxenian’s fellow sociologist Mark Granovetter demonstrated that a network with a plethora of weak ties generates a greater circulation of information than a network with a handful of strong ones. It followed that Boston was hobbled: its large, self-contained companies featured tight relationships among colleagues but few links between professionals at one firm and similar professionals at another. Silicon Valley’s myriad loose ties promoted richer idea-sharing and creativity.Of course, the sociologists’ insight raises a question. What generated the abundance of weak ties in the Valley? The answer is that one tribe of professionals is relentlessly focused on cultivating such ties. This tribe is the venture capitalists.It was not a coincidence that Silicon Valley outran Boston following a surge of fundraising by West Coast venture shops in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Copious venture dollars meant that more eager dealmakers plied their trade in the Valley, schmoozing founders, interviewing prospective hires for their portfolio firms, linking ideas, people and money. For most venture capitalists, relentless networking was not just one thing that they did. Rather, it was the thing — the key to succeeding in the business. The loose ties that Saxenian stressed did not arise by accident.In fact, most of what makes the Valley distinctive can be traced to venture capital. Small companies have multiplied in the region because plentiful venture dollars make it so easy to start them. Engineers share confidences with rivals because VC hiring circulates talent continuously: today’s competitor may well be yesterday’s close colleague. The Valley’s celebrated tolerance of failure, often ascribed to some magical potion in the water, comes from venture capital as well. People quit secure positions to join start-ups because they trust VCs to slot them into a new job if their start-up becomes a shutdown.Venture capital has been equally central to China’s tech ecosystem. Again, the government’s role is frequently exaggerated: in the early internet era, Chinese industrial policy aimed to promote strategic technologies such as semiconductors, and the result was mostly failure. Instead, China’s digital economy got started in sectors that the government ignored, because the vacuum created space for venture capitalists to pick out rising firms and shape them. Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent and a host of other consumer-internet triumphs raised money from American VCs who brought the Valley’s tools to China.The case of Alibaba is instructive. Its first outside investors were two Taiwanese-born products of the Ivy League: Joe Tsai, a Wall Street lawyer turned investor, and Syaru Shirley Lin, a Goldman Sachs banker. Along with US capital, the two brought US lawyers, who created an ingenious corporate structure featuring a Cayman Islands parent company. This proved to be a game-changer, because it endowed Alibaba with the power to issue employee stock options.When Alibaba obtained this tool, the whole idea of equity was novel in China. The mainland’s two clunky stock exchanges, in Shanghai and Shenzhen, had opened as recently as 1990. Employee stock options were not recognised in Chinese law, and Chinese-American entrepreneurs struggled to find Chinese words for them. But once it got its hands on these exotic instruments, Alibaba moved aggressively.The company’s first Silicon Valley-style hire was none other than Tsai, who waved goodbye to a plush salary and accepted minimal wages, figuring that Alibaba options would more than compensate. Alibaba now had a star chief operating officer. Next, the company courted John Wu, the Silicon Valley-based lead engineer at Yahoo. Unsurprisingly, Wu balked — why would he leave one of the Valley’s hottest companies? But Alibaba countered with a generous package of options, plus a twist: Wu could remain in California and build his own team, using more Alibaba options to attract great people.Thanks to world-class recruits like Tsai and Wu, Alibaba became a world-class company. More than just a formidable enterprise in its own right, it became a training ground for go-getters who in turn created other start-ups. And Alibaba’s story was just one among several. Tencent raised early capital from a US venture shop called IDG, and later used options to hire a top executive, Martin Lau, from Goldman’s Hong Kong office. Baidu received capital from a fund led by the Silicon Valley investor Tim Draper, and the three early Chinese internet portals — Sina, Sohu and NetEase — all took foreign venture money. Without VC backing, any of these companies might easily have stalled. Like Silicon Valley, China’s digital economy owes much to venture capital.Which brings us back to Europe’s prospects. The continent has long had many of the ingredients that tech clusters need: strong universities, lots of engineers, access to a rich consumer market. But Europe has been held back, supposedly, by cultural factors: a lack of appetite for risk, an alleged commercial timidity. The history of innovation offers an encouraging lesson. People will take a risk if venture capitalists underwrite it.The progress that Sequoia spotted in 2019 underscores this verdict. Just as in China, US-linked venture capitalists were heavily involved in Europe’s awakening. European VC firms may have been the first investors, but the music-streaming giant Spotify was backed by US venture-capital firms such as Accel and Founders Fund. The Dutch fintech juggernaut Adyen received capital from the American firms General Atlantic and Iconiq Capital. The payments company Wise raised money from the Valley’s Andreessen Horowitz. On a narrow definition, more than a fifth of European venture capital deals involve an American participant. But that doesn’t count European participants with Valley DNA. A prominent example is Index Ventures: two of the firm’s leaders, Neil and Danny Rimer, worked at Valley investment banks before building their bicontinental venture partnership.To make the most of this incipient venture boom, Europe’s political leaders must embrace it. There are signs that they will. Some taxes penalising employee stock options have been reformed: as of last year, workers at midsized European start-ups owned around 16 per cent of their firms, up from 10 per cent five years earlier, according to Index Ventures. Britain is planning to relax visa rules for tech companies seeking foreign talent. But despite these hopeful marks of progress, there are risks of a backlash. The unpopularity of US tech behemoths may perversely tarnish the reputation of US VC firms — even though the best antidote to the monopolistic tendencies of Big Tech is venture-backed small tech.Rather than resenting the influx of Valley-style venture capital, Europe should welcome the help in fertilising the ground for its own tech champions. Already, Spotify is the global leader in music streaming. Klarna is the global leader in buy-now-pay-later finance. UiPath is the global leader in robotic process-automation software. There is no reason why this roster cannot grow. The continent of yesterday can do better tomorrow.Sebastian Mallaby’s ‘The Power Law: Venture Capital and the Art of Disruption’ is published by Allen LaneLetter in response to this article:US venture capital is late to the party of Europe’s tech revival / From Ophelia Brown, Founder, Blossom Capital, London N1, UK
488  French president Emmanuel Macron once observed that Europe was living through the “brain death” of Nato while former US president Donald Trump branded it “obsolete”.But after Russia spent the winter assembling its forces on the border with Ukraine and warning of a military response to what it said were the alliance’s eastern European ambitions, Nato has been brought back to life.Alongside the US, it led the response to the Russian threat, pushed talks with Moscow and bolstered troop numbers in eastern Europe. Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg rallied western nations towards a united position against the Kremlin’s aggression and declared support for its “partner” Ukraine even though Kyiv is not a member.Talk of Nato irrelevance was fuelled by last summer’s chaotic retreat from Afghanistan. Before that, around the times Macron and Trump made their observations, its search for a new purpose came as the US shifted its focus to China and growth in non-conventional warfare.Yet the Ukraine crisis has reinvigorated support for the alliance’s original concept: as a defensive collective to deter a possible attack from Moscow.“It’s quite clear that [Nato] is very much in business,” said Toomas Hendrik Ilves, a former president of Estonia, one of three ex-Soviet Baltic states that joined Nato in 2004. “The absence of an immediate threat does not mean it has gone away for good.”Since the build-up around Ukraine began in November, allies have pledged troops and equipment to Nato members in eastern Europe. France said it was ready to send troops to Romania, Spain dispatched a frigate to the Black Sea and the Netherlands pledged two F-35 fighters to Bulgaria and put other units on standby.This week, the US said it was deploying 3,000 troops to bolster Nato’s defences in Europe, a break from the trend of shifting its forces out of the continent.These movements are in addition to the four rotating battle groups — agreed in 2016 and staffed by troops from countries including the UK and Germany — in Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.“Russia’s ultimatums as well as its real-time amassing of a serious host of troops and material have led to a rethink in many capitals,” said Ilves, adding that France, Spain and the Netherlands had “upped their game” as the threat increased.Nato, formed in the second world war’s aftermath as a transatlantic security alliance, was at the frontline of western European defence during decades of tensions with the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact satellites.The organisation’s role became less defined after the end of the cold war and, as it sought new meaning, its involvement in the 1990s Yugoslav wars drew criticism from within its own ranks.It entered Afghanistan in 2003 and stayed, through a series of missions and guises, until its ignoble exit last year. Involvement in Libya’s civil war in 2011 also sparked deep divides between members.In recent years, Washington’s pivot to Asia under Trump and his successor Joe Biden have prompted calls, most forcefully by Macron, for the EU to take on a larger role in Europe’s defence to achieve an autonomy that was less reliant on the US-led alliance.Yet Vladimir Putin’s decision to deploy more than 106,000 troops on the Ukraine border, alongside demands including a ban on Ukraine and Georgia becoming Nato members, has made clear the value of unity and the organisation’s unique ability to collectively respond to Moscow with both political clout and troops, officials say.“This is an amazing moment for the alliance,” said Julianne Smith, US permanent representative to Nato.“The level of alliance unity in that room.was pretty breathtaking,” she added, referring to last month’s Nato-Russia summit. “It became crystal clear.the alliance and all 30 allies are absolutely in sync on where we stand.”Even before the Russian build-up, 2022 had long been viewed as a pivotal year for Nato. The alliance will outline its priorities for the next decade in a “strategic concept” document this summer. It is also seeking a new leader to replace Stoltenberg, who steps down in September to become Norway’s central bank governor.The new strategy is expected to include significant mentions of China, climate change and cyber security — underscoring the significantly altered security landscape over the past decade. But the events of the past few months have reminded allies that their original foe still remains a present threat.The alliance still faces considerable challenges. Its reliance on the US was painfully underscored during the withdrawal from Afghanistan, when it became clear that the allies were incapable of retaining a presence without US military infrastructure and notably air support from Bagram air base, north of Kabul.Lord George Robertson, former Nato secretary-general, said last summer that the disunity over Afghanistan was damaging. “It weakens Nato because the principle of ‘in together, out together’ seems to have been abandoned both by Donald Trump and by Joe Biden,” he told the Financial Times at the time.The majority of Nato’s members also continue to fall short of its goal of spending at least 2 per cent of gross domestic product on defence by 2024.Asked last week about the “brain death” barb, Stoltenberg said that in such uncertain times it was “even more important that we stand together”.“We demonstrated that in the Cold War, the Balkans and 9/11 and we’re demonstrating that now with the aggressive actions of Russia against Ukraine,” he told an event hosted by the Atlantic Council think-tank.“If Russia wants less Nato near its borders, it has achieved the opposite,” Stoltenberg continued. “And if it invades Ukraine, even more so.”
489  Australia’s liquefied natural gas industry has called for more land to be opened up for exploration after the EU issued a proposal that declared some forms of the fossil fuel a green energy source.The EU is attempting to become the world leader on climate policy and has committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050.Brussels on Wednesday produced the final version of its “taxonomy for sustainable finance”, a classification system for industries that produce most of the bloc’s emissions intended to encourage private capital to back environmentally sustainable activities.But the taxonomy plan has been widely criticised by some member states, the European Investment Bank, scientists and environmental campaigners for classifying nuclear power and some forms of natural gas as sustainable. The proposal could still be rejected by EU legislators.The International Energy Agency said last year that energy groups must desist from building any new oil and gas projects in order to achieve the target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.But Australian LNG producers believe the EU proposal offers a useful argument to investors and lenders considering divesting from the sector.A lobby group that represents large oil and gas companies in Australia, the world’s biggest exporter of LNG, said in a submission to the country’s government this week that the proposal justified increasing exploration to support the transition to net zero carbon emissions in Asia.“The [EU’s] policy announcement demonstrates the competitive advantage Australia has with the natural gas that abounds in the country and the role Australia can play in both domestic and international decarbonisation landscapes,” Andrew McConville, chief executive of the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association, told the Financial Times.Australia exports about 80mn tonnes of LNG each year and gas prices soared in the second half of 2021 owing to pandemic-induced constraints on supply.Woodside, an Australian energy company, said it sold LNG for A$93 (US$66.27) per barrel of oil equivalent, a unit of measurement that represents the equivalent energy content of a barrel of oil, in the final quarter of 2021, more than three times the price compared with the same period in 2020.LNG exploration sites have been opened across Australia, including Scarborough off the west coast, which Woodside estimates will produce about 8mn tonnes per year from 2026. Santos, another Australian energy company, has opened sites at Barossa off the coast of the Northern Territory and at Narrabri in New South Wales.Meg O’Neill, Woodside chief executive, told an investor briefing last month that the Scarborough field was “well-suited to our times” because it was “among the lowest carbon intensity projects for LNG delivered to north Asia”.Woodside said no new wells were planned for 2022 and only a fraction of capital expenditure had been allocated to develop new sites, but it would not rule out further exploration. The company said it would spend A$5bn on “new energy products and lower-carbon services” by 2030.Bruce Robertson, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a pro-renewables think-tank, said the push for more exploration was “totally at odds with what the IEA said we have to do to reach net zero”.Robertson added that overall greenhouse gas emissions from LNG were no better than from coal, thanks in part to the considerable methane leakage along the LNG supply chain.
490  Spain’s Socialist-led government has achieved one of its biggest policy goals after a single vote cast in error secured parliamentary approval for labour reforms that are a condition for aid from the EU’s €800bn coronavirus recovery fund.The measures are intended to cut the proportion of the Spanish workforce on temporary contracts, currently around 25 per cent — by far the highest level in the bloc.While the labour reform was agreed with business and union organisations in December following months of negotiations, the government was unable to build a stable parliamentary majority for Thursday’s vote.Instead, the uneasy constellation of parties that has backed prime minister Pedro Sánchez over the past two years splintered, leading the government to appeal to centrist votes to pull together the thinnest of majorities.In scenes of confusion, the measure was approved by 175 votes to 174 after the president of the chamber of deputies had initially declared it defeated. The legislation only went through because a member of the People’s party, the centre-right opposition, appeared to mistakenly back the measure and was not permitted to change his vote.The PP accused the president of the chamber, the Socialist Meritxell Batet, of rigging the vote, blamed parliament’s IT system for the error, and said it “would make all the necessary complaints so that justice is done”.Failure of the bill would have been devastating to the Sánchez administration.“This is the most important structural reform of this parliament,” said Pablo Simón, professor of politics at Madrid’s Carlos III University. He added that the reform was more likely to endure because of the compact with business and unions and because it ultimately sought to tweak, rather than overturn, labour market changes enacted by a previous centre-right government a decade ago.Spain’s labour market remains the country’s biggest economic black spot. Although the number of people in work has reached an all-time high of 20m and joblessness has fallen to its lowest since before the financial crisis, the unemployment rate of 13 per cent and youth unemployment of 30 per cent are both twice the EU average.Supporters of the 2012 measures — which reduced redundancy pay and gave company-specific negotiations precedence over sector-wide deals — say they added much needed flexibility to Spain’s dysfunctional labour market. Critics say they made inequality worse. A pledge to repeal those rules was a feature of the 2019 pact that established the minority leftwing coalition government.Instead of scrapping the old rules outright, the new labour reform largely focuses on the drive against temporary contracts, which will be limited in many cases.With leftwing Catalan and Basque separatist parties that normally back the Sánchez administration baulking at the measure, the centrist Ciudadanos party and several smaller groupings provided decisive support in Thursday’s vote.Ciudadanos — which is fighting for its existence after collapses in its vote in recent elections — says the accord with business and unions should be respected.Simón argued that the measure’s passage would not only help secure the EU funds on which the government’s political and economic strategy rest, but also bolster an attempt by the prime minister’s Socialists to lay claim to the centre ground.Spain’s €70bn of recovery fund grants formally depends on meeting benchmarks agreed with Brussels. Having received €10bn at the end of last year, the country is due to request the next instalment of €14bn before April.The labour reform was originally negotiated by Yolanda Díaz, Spain’s Communist labour minister and the likely prime ministerial candidate in the next elections for the radical left Podemos grouping. But she had resisted seeking to enlist her ideological foes in Ciudadanos to help pass the bill.
491  The most virulent HIV variant known to science has been discovered in the Netherlands, according to researchers who said it provided a valuable insight into the way viruses such as the one behind Covid-19 can evolve.People infected with the VB variant, as it is known, have an average viral load that is about four times higher than is usual for HIV infection and their immune system declines twice as fast, placing them at risk of developing Aids more quickly.Scientists at Oxford university’s Big Data Institute, who announced the discovery with Dutch colleagues in the journal Science, said the VB variant was not a threat to public health because the antiretroviral therapy used routinely to treat people with HIV worked effectively against it.“The worst-case scenario would be the emergence of a variant that combines high virulence, high transmissibility and resistance to treatment,” said Chris Wymant, the study’s lead author. “The variant we discovered has only the first two of these properties.”But the researchers said the discovery was a timely warning in the light of the debate about the way Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, was likely to evolve.“A lot of people are commenting that Sars-Cov-2 will evolve to become milder because that’s just what viruses do and it’s not in the virus’s interest to kill us off,” said Wymant. “What we really need is more examples of what viruses do in the real world — and we see it go in both directions, becoming more virulent and less virulent. So it certainly shouldn’t be taken for granted that Sars-Cov-2 will simply become milder.”The VB variant was identified in 17 people in late 2018 during an international project called Beehive, which monitors HIV samples from across Europe and Uganda. Since 15 of the people came from the Netherlands, the team then analysed data from 6,700 HIV-positive individuals and found another 92 cases of VB infection across the country, bringing the nation’s total to 109.“There are probably at least a few more people elsewhere who have not been detected yet,” said Wymant. “By making the genetic sequence of VB openly available, we are allowing other investigators in other countries to check their own private data.”The analysis did not show how the VB variant originated, but the researchers believed it was likely to have evolved within an individual who suffered an unusually long HIV infection because genetic analysis turned up no intermediate steps in viral evolution. The same mechanism has been proposed for the origin of Sars-Cov-2 variants, including Omicron.Although VB spread more quickly than other variants during the 2000s, it is now declining along with HIV as a whole in the Netherlands. The researchers said the variant arose in spite of widespread treatment for HIV, not because of it, since antiretroviral treatment suppresses transmission.Joel Wertheim, an evolutionary virologist at the University of California San Diego who was not involved in the study, said HIV was becoming less virulent in Uganda and more virulent in the US. The biological reasons for these changes are unknown.“The HIV and Sars-Cov-2 pandemics show how viruses can and will evolve higher virulence when favoured by natural selection,” he added.
492  Poland’s president has put forward a bill to scrap a disciplinary chamber for judges that has become one of the main flashpoints in a bitter feud between Warsaw and Brussels over the rule of law.Andrzej Duda said that he was taking the step to “give the Polish government a tool to end” a five-year dispute with the European Commission that has triggered multiple court cases and led to Brussels withholding billions of euros of funding from Warsaw.“We do not need this fight,” Duda said in a brief address on Thursday. “What Poland needs at the moment is calm. In the face of all the threats that are occurring, all the shocks on the international scene, we need calm reflection, we need calm conversations, and above all we need to stand together as one force.”Duda’s initiative came as prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki signed a deal with the Czech Republic to resolve another of Poland’s international conflicts, which related to a lignite mine near the Czech border.The disciplinary chamber was one of a number of far-reaching changes to the Polish judiciary introduced by the conservative-nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS) after it came to power in 2015.PiS claims its changes are necessary to overhaul an inefficient system, but the commission, Polish judicial associations and opposition politicians regard them as an assault on judicial independence.The EU has launched a series of legal cases to force Poland to roll back the changes, and the bloc’s top court has ruled various aspects, including the disciplinary chamber, to be illegal. Last year, it ordered Poland to pay daily fines of €1mn for failing to comply with an order to suspend some of the changes.Duda said on Thursday that his bill would scrap the disciplinary chamber, and allow the cases of judges who had been censured for the content of their rulings to be re-examined.However, he said it would be replaced a new Chamber of Professional Responsibility composed of 11 judges chosen via a draw, and that a mechanism for testing whether a judge was impartial would be introduced.The European Commission said it was too early to respond to the bill, saying it needed to review and analyse the full text. The commission would look “attentively into” anything that moves in the direction of the conditions laid out by the European Court of Justice, a spokesperson said.Judges’ organisations dismissed the proposals, arguing that they did not address the fundamental problems with the PiS reforms.“In the view of European tribunals, the problem is not the name of the disciplinary chamber, but the way its members were appointed,” Krystian Markiewicz, head of the judicial association Iustitia, told Onet.“This was a fundamentally flawed process, because they were recommended by the politically selected National Judicial Council. That is the fundamental problem.and the president isn’t even trying to solve it.”To become law, Duda’s bill would need to be approved by parliament. The government has been working on its own proposals for overhauling the supreme court, but they have not yet been made public, and it remains unclear whether it will throw its weight behind Duda’s proposal.The outcome of the mine dispute with Prague is clearer. Poland agreed to pay the Czech Republic €45mn in compensation to resolve the stand-off. Petr Fiala, the Czech prime minister, said his country would withdraw its case against Poland once the money had been received.A commission spokesperson said penalties that Poland had already accrued since September 20 in respect of non-compliance with the order would still be payable. Warsaw has been racking up fines of €500,000 per day.
493  The US has accused Russia of preparing to fabricate an attack by Ukraine or the west to use it as a pretext for an invasion of the country, including circulating a “propaganda video” with graphic images of a mock explosion.Senior Biden administration officials revealed the information on Thursday as tensions flared up between Washington and Moscow over Russia’s military build-up in Ukraine.While talks between Moscow and Washington to defuse the stand-off are continuing, Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, has escalated military preparations for an attack. Joe Biden dispatched 2,000 troops to Europe this week, including new deployments to Romania and Poland on Nato’s eastern flank.The US had earlier warned that Russia was planning a “false flag operation” as an excuse to attack Ukraine, but the White House went further on Thursday.“We have information that one of the options the Russian government is planning is to stage a fabricated attack by Ukrainian military or intelligence forces against Russian sovereign territory, or against Russian-speaking people, to justify military action against Ukraine,” a senior Biden administration official said. “We believe that Russia has already recruited those who will be involved in the fabricated attack and that Russian intelligence is intimately involved in this effort.”The US official added that Washington believed Moscow would produce a “propaganda video” to bolster its claim to an invasion. “This video likely will depict graphic scenes of a staged false explosion with corpses, actors depicting mourners, and images of destroyed locations and military equipment.”“We believe that the military equipment used in this fabricated attack will be made to look like it is Ukrainian or from allied nations,” the official added, pointing specifically to the possible inclusion of Bayraktar drones, which Kyiv purchased from Turkey, to implicate Nato.Washington’s frequent public warnings about Moscow’s intentions have also stoked tensions with Ukraine, where officials have tried to minimise the damage to the economy and avoid panic about the threat of an invasion. This week, press secretary Jen Psaki said the White House was no longer using the word “imminent” to discuss a possible attack because it implied Putin had already made a decision.Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraine’s defence minister, said during a briefing on Thursday: “I want to draw your attention to the fact that our western partners, strategic partners, have changed their rhetoric. And you can hear this, including from the words of the White House press secretary.”
494  Christine Lagarde refused to rule out raising interest rates this year in response to the European Central Bank’s “unanimous concern” about soaring prices, fuelling increased investor bets that it will raise borrowing costs several times in 2022.The ECB president said inflation risks were “tilted to the upside” after annual consumer prices in the eurozone rose by a record 5.1 per cent in January. She backed away from earlier comments playing down the chances of the bank raising rates in 2022 because of “the situation having changed” and said it was “getting much closer” to hitting its target on inflation.Lagarde said there was “consensus” among ECB policymakers on its decision to keep rates unchanged and to pursue a “step-by-step” reduction in bond purchases this year. But a person familiar with the council said “one or two” of its members had called for an immediate tightening of policy.In response to Lagarde’s comments during a press conference after the ECB governing council met on Thursday, investors increased their bets that the central bank will be forced to change course and raise rates several times this year.Konstantin Veit, portfolio manager at Pimco, said the ECB’s “hawkish message” signalled “more openness towards an earlier withdrawal of monetary policy support”.The euro jumped to a more than two-week high against the dollar and a sell-off in eurozone bonds intensified after Lagarde declined to explicitly rule out an interest rate rise this year. The single currency was up 1.2 per cent at $1.143.Germany’s 10-year yield, a benchmark for financial assets across the eurozone, surged to a nearly three-year high of 0.14 per cent. Traders increased their bets on higher interest rates, with markets pricing in a rise in its deposit rate from minus 0.5 per cent to minus 0.1 per cent by December after Lagarde’s press conference.While the ECB left policy unchanged, her comments were widely interpreted as signalling a likely shift to tightening monetary policy as early as March.Carsten Brzeski, head of macro research at ING, said Lagarde’s “hawkish backward roll” had “opened the door to a speeding up of asset purchase reductions and a rate hike this year”.Lagarde said there had been “unanimous concern around the governing council table about the impact of inflation” on Europeans and their “day-to-day hardship of having to put up with higher prices”.She said the ECB would stick to the “sequence” it had already announced of only raising rates after it stopped net bond purchases, adding that the council would be “gradual in whatever we do” and “not be rushed into anything”.But she raised expectations that the ECB will again raise its inflation forecast at its next policy meeting in March, bringing it up to its 2 per cent target for the next two years and leading to a quicker removal of its stimulus than planned.This could lead to it accelerating plans for stopping net asset purchases in preparation for the first increase in its deposit rate for more than a decade.Frederik Ducrozet, strategist at Pictet Wealth Management, said Lagarde had delivered a “reality check” for bond markets. “The risk scenario is now clear: large upward revisions to staff projections in March, a faster tapering ending net asset purchases by the third quarter, and a rate [rise] in the fourth quarter of 2022,” he added.Higher than expected inflation has led the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England to shift to more “hawkish” policy stances. The BoE raised its main policy rate to 0.5 per cent on Thursday, less than two months after increasing it to 0.25 per cent, while investors are pricing in five rate rises by the Fed this year.After the ECB press conference, Italy’s 10-year bond yields rose about 20 basis points to 1.66 per cent, their highest since May 2020. James Athey, investment director at Abrdn, said: “The ECB is opening up a potentially huge hole for Italian bonds to fall into.”
495  Russia will shut the Moscow office of German media outlet Deutsche Welle, the foreign ministry said on Thursday, a day after German regulators blocked state-run Russia Today’s German-language channel for operating without a local licence.The move, which comes amid escalating tensions between Russia and the west and a build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, is likely to dent Moscow’s relations with Berlin, one of the few western European capitals to take a more open stance towards Russia in recent months.Journalists employed by German state-run Deutsche Welle will have their accreditation annulled, preventing them from working in Russia, the foreign ministry said in a statement announcing the measures.It will also halt all broadcasting by Deutsche Welle in Russia, the ministry said, adding that it would put the outlet forward for “foreign agent” status. This is a prohibitive label that has been applied to numerous Russian journalists in recent months, but is rarely used on foreign organisations.“The measures by the authorities in Russia are completely incomprehensible and a total overreaction,” Deutsche Welle director- general Peter Limbourg said in a statement. “We have been made into a kind of pawn, which the media must often endure in autocracies.”Russia said it was taking the steps “in response to Germany’s unfriendly actions to prohibit satellite and other broadcasting of the German-language television channel RT DE.”The channel, a German-language offshoot of the established state-run media outlet Russia Today, has had an online presence for many years but first launched on European satellites last December.German regulators quickly took issue with its licensing, saying German-language broadcasts intended for a German audience required a local broadcasting permit. RT DE, they said, had not applied for one.RT DE countered that it had received a Serbian licence to transmit in Europe. But Paris-based European satellite operator Eutelsat promptly took RT DE off air.RT DE was a thorn in the German government’s side long before the broadcast ban. Its journalists are notorious for their aggressive questioning at government press conferences, and a tendency to repeat Kremlin talking points. RT DE has also been criticised for spreading disinformation about coronavirus vaccines and measures adopted by western governments to stop the spread of Covid-19. YouTube has banned several German-language RT channels on its platform in recent months, including RT DE, also citing Covid misinformation.Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously denounced the moves as “discrimination” against Russia Today, which is now known as RT. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called it an “attack on freedom of speech”.“If the German information-political machine has crushed its commitments to protect freedom of speech, then we should feel free to reciprocate,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.German national regulators on Wednesday reiterated that the channel must stop broadcasting in Germany, whether via its online services or another satellite, prompting Moscow’s retaliation against Deutsche Welle’s reporters.Claudia Roth, Germany’s minister for culture, said Russia’s behaviour was “in no way acceptable” and that the two actions were not comparable.“RT DE is currently broadcasting without a licence and has not applied for one,” Roth said. “That is a completely different situation to Deutsche Welle, which is now having its licence withdrawn.”“Deutsche Welle is also not state-controlled. That means that unlike with RT DE the German state does not influence programming,” Roth said, calling on Russian authorities to not “misuse” the situation.“We need clear steps towards de-escalation in our mutual relationship,” the German minister said.The dispute is one of several stretching the traditionally pragmatic relationship between Germany and Russia. In December, the governments each expelled two diplomats after a judge in Berlin accused the Kremlin of “state terrorism” for ordering the murder of a Chechen rebel in a Berlin park in 2019.Russia said it would also begin drawing up a list of representatives of German organisations that have been involved in restricting transmission by RT DE, the foreign ministry said, in order to ban them from entering Russia.It will not be making this list of names public, the ministry said, adding that measures announced on Thursday were just the first phase of a clampdown against the German media presence in Russia.
496  Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has signed a deal to deepen defence co-operation with Ukraine in defiance of warnings from Moscow not to further arm Kyiv.The Turkish leader struck a raft of deals on free trade and defence with Kyiv after three hours of talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Ukrainian capital.These include joint production in Ukraine of lethal drones, expanding a partnership that has seen Kyiv buy at least 20 unmanned aerial vehicles from Turkey — and deploy them against Russian-backed separatists.Erdogan, who described Zelensky as a “dear friend”, restated his support for the “territorial integrity” of Ukraine and Crimea and his offer to act as a mediator between Ukraine and Russia. Turkey wanted to “ease tensions rather than fuel military escalation,” he said.Describing their relationship as one of “real friends”, Zelensky thanked Erdogan for his mediation offer. “Today we have signed an agreement that will significantly expand the production of Baykar UAVs in Ukraine,” Zelensky said, adding: “These are new technologies, new jobs and strengthening Ukraine’s of defence capabilities.”But Erdogan faces a tricky balancing act. The show of support by Turkey, a Nato member, for Ukraine belies a close but complex relationship with Russian president Vladimir Putin and significant Russian leverage over Turkey.The Turkish president, for years accused by the west of turning towards Moscow and abandoning Nato, has not only repeatedly warned of the dangers of deeper Russian incursion into Ukraine but has also supplied the country with weapons including armed drones.That support for Kyiv carries great risks for Turkey, analysts say, given its economic reliance on Russia and the risk that Putin could use gas, tourism, trade and the conflict in Syria as political weapons against Erdogan.The Turkish president’s trip to Kyiv marked the 30th anniversary of bilateral relations and was long planned as part of a decade-long push to build economic, cultural and political ties.The decision to go ahead with the trip despite the tense backdrop was viewed in Kyiv as highly symbolic. Turkey opposed Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, driven by a centuries’ long suspicion of Russian expansionism and concern for the Crimean Tatar minority.But Erdogan’s relationship with Putin, however, has grown much closer in the years since then, spurred by his growing isolation from the west.The Turkish president’s decision to buy a Russian S-400 air defence system in the aftermath of a 2016 coup attempt prompted claims that Turkey had abandoned Nato and led the US to expel Turkey from its F-35 fighter jet programme.Despite warm personal ties between Erdogan and Putin, however, the two leaders have often found themselves competing rather than co-operating — especially in the realm of foreign policy. Turkish officials frequently point out that they have backed the opposite side to the Russians in conflicts in Syria, Libya and in the Caucasus.“They are very proud of the fact that they are the ones confronting Russia on the ground [in these areas],” said a US official. “This is contradicted by the S-400 sale but it is also true.”Moscow has been particularly irked by the growing defence co-operation between Turkey and Ukraine. Russian officials last October warned that Turkish drones could “destabilise” the frontline after Ukraine’s armed forces said a Turkish-made drone had destroyed an artillery unit belonging to Russian-backed separatists.Even before Thursday’s deal, Ukraine had already acquired “around 20” TB2 drones, according to Vasyl Bodnar, the country’s ambassador to Ankara, with more expected to follow.Kyiv has also placed an order for two Turkish warships, and Ukrainian defence firms are supplying engines for Turkish-made attack helicopters, cruise missiles and for a higher-spec Baykar drone.Western nations have been buoyed by Ankara’s willingness to continue supplying weaponry. “Turkey’s materiel support to Ukraine has been substantial,” said the US official, adding that Washington would be happy if Ankara simply did “more of the same”.Like Germany, however, Ankara is acutely aware of the pressure points that Putin could exploit if he felt that it had crossed a red line.Turkey is heavily reliant on imported natural gas to fuel its power stations and heat its homes, and has already been suffering from shortages this year. Nearly half of Turkey’s gas supply came from Moscow in the first 11 months of 2021, according to data from the Istanbul-based energy consultancy IBS.Putin has previously shown willingness to weaponise Russian tourists, who were Turkey’s top foreign visitors in 2019. He banned package holidays to the country in 2015 after the Turkish air force downed a Russian fighter jet near the border with Syria.He also banned imports of Turkish tomatoes. Russia was the most important market for Turkish fruit and vegetable exports last year, generating a third of the sector’s $3bn in foreign revenues.The potential economic disruption to Turkey is one of the reasons why Ankara is so eager to see tensions cool, said Burak Pehlivan, chair of the Turkish-Ukrainian Business Association. “Nobody in this geography will win from a conflict,” he said. “The most affected country after Ukraine and Russia would be Turkey.”But the vulnerability that worries Turkey the most is Idlib, the last rebel-held province of Syria, where thousands of Turkish troops are policing an uneasy stalemate with the Russian-backed regime of Bashar al-Assad.Erdogan is already under political pressure at home over the country’s 3.6mn Syrian refugees. Ankara believes that air strikes by Russian jets on civilian targets in the province earlier this month were a warning to Turkey — and to Europe — that Moscow could send millions more refugees its way.Turkey’s weak spots mean that western officials are resigned to the fact that the country is unlikely to sign up to a new sanctions regime against Russia if an invasion does take place.But the real challenge for Ankara, which polices the 1936 Montreux convention that governs access for warships to the Black Sea, would be what to do if Nato called upon Turkey to provide more military support.“What happens if Nato wants to use Turkish military facilities to support maritime or air operations?” asked a defence official from another western country. “That would really put them in a really difficult position.”
497  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
498  The writer is editorial director and columnist at Le MondeIn diplomacy, words matter. Keen observers of shifts in the rhetoric used by world leaders may have noticed over the past year that “strategic autonomy” has been replaced by “European sovereignty” in Emmanuel Macron’s discourse. The French president has also stopped promoting a “new architecture of trust and security” for Europe and now prefers talking about the “European security order”. These semantic changes reflect an evolution in the way Macron addresses the issue of European unity and the Russian question. Gone is the carefree audacity of the early days of his presidency, when he thought he could charm both Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin and ignore the sensitivities of his closest partners in Europe.He eventually dropped the word “autonomy” because of the alarm it caused in several other European capitals. The more palatable “strategic sovereignty” is now written all over the German government coalition treaty. And “architecture”, we are told by the Elysée, is not used any more because it echoes a failed 2008 Russian initiative — the “new European security architecture” proposed by then president Dmitry Medvedev.When Macron addressed the European Parliament on January 19, his vaguely crafted offer to “finalise a European proposal building a new security and stability order” was immediately — and wrongly — interpreted by some as an initiative designed to divide the western alliance. This misinterpretation also overshadowed another, much more significant announcement, in which he committed to sending several hundred French troops to Romania, in a gesture of reassurance on Nato’s eastern flank.Can Macron be trusted on Russia at a time when European unity is so crucial? This is a legitimate question, given traditional suspicions of French complacency towards Russia and a no less traditional irritation caused by the Gallic taste for an independent foreign policy.While France holds the rotating EU presidency, the French president wants to impose a European voice in the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Macron has managed to open a door for negotiation by reviving the so-called Normandy format, in which four-party discussions are held between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine on the conflict in Donbas.Amid a flurry of recent diplomatic activity, Macron has over the past few days spoken four times with Putin, making him the European leader to have had the most contact with the Russian president since Angela Merkel’s departure as German chancellor. Missing so far is a visit to Kyiv, but he is working on it, as well as on a trip to Moscow.Does he merely seek a path to de-escalation for Europe, or will he try to pursue his old dream of a reset of French relations with Moscow?Critics are quick to recall Macron’s ill-fated invitation to Putin to visit his summer residence on the Côte d’Azur in August 2019. The French president believed he could open a constructive dialogue on European security with his Russian counterpart. This was very much a unilateral initiative — even Merkel was kept in the dark.But that was 2019. Two factors have since made the Elysée more realistic. First, the main result of Macron’s Kremlin charm offensive was to antagonise some of his European partners. Second, Russian assertiveness has grown spectacularly — including at the expense of French interests, as shown with the recent deployment of Russian mercenaries in Mali. The Kremlin’s game with the Wagner Group of mercenaries in Africa has been an eye-opener for French students of Russian intentions, much as the Skripal poisoning changed perceptions of Moscow in London.This more sober assessment was on display in Berlin last week during Macron’s joint press conference with chancellor Olaf Scholz. When asked about Russia’s goals in the Ukraine crisis, Scholz was soft-spoken, hesitant, searching for words. In stark contrast, Macron sternly accused Russia of becoming “a force of disequilibrium”.Paris’s determination not to give in to Moscow’s pressure was visible early in this crisis. French diplomats like to recall that they were the first, on November 12 last year, to use the phrase “serious consequences” if Russia invaded Ukraine. In another sign of the priority given to western unity, French outrage at the Aukus pact concluded by Washington, London and Canberra last year, has been dialled right down. Britain and Australia may be slow to come out of the doghouse, but France’s relationship with the US has rarely been so good.So can Macron be trusted on Russia? The better question might be whether Putin can be trusted on Ukraine. But by now, we all know the answer.
499  Official inflation in Turkey has reached the highest level since Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling party came to power almost two decades ago, as global inflationary pressures combined with the president’s unorthodox economic management fuel a surge in prices.The country’s consumer price index rose 48.7 per cent year on year in January, the Turkish Statistical Institute said, up from 36 per cent in December.The figure, announced just days after Erdogan sacked the statistics agency’s head, was in line with the expectation of economists, according to a survey by Bloomberg — although opposition parties and some economists claimed it was far lower than the country’s true inflation rate.The reading was driven by sharp rises in the cost of food, electricity and gas, and represents the highest official rate that Turkey has experienced since April 2002.Erdogan, who was widely credited during his first decade in power with ushering in economic prosperity, has presided over repeated bouts of high inflation in recent years as he has consolidated his powers and meddled in monetary policy.The Turkish president, an ideological opponent of high interest rates, ordered the central bank to cut borrowing costs four times in a row last year, bringing the policy rate to 14 per cent despite warnings that it would exacerbate the country’s already high inflation.Erdogan has long argued, contrary to established economic orthodoxy, that lowering rates helps to stabilise prices. But economists say that the plunge in the lira that often accompanies the rate cuts quickly feeds through into rising prices in a country that is heavily reliant on imported energy and goods. The Turkish currency lost 44 per cent of its value against the dollar in 2021.Turkey’s recent rate-cutting drive also puts it at odds with global central banks that are tightening policy in a bid to cool the highest rate of inflation in decades.Polls suggest that support for Erdogan’s AKP is close to historic lows amid public discontent about the soaring cost of living.Still, Turkey’s finance minister, Nureddin Nebati, said prior to Thursday’s announcement that there would be “no turning back” from the policy of having interest rates that are far below inflation. “We have no rate hike in our agenda,” he told Nikkei Asia.Nebati said that he expected inflation to peak at a level below 50 per cent in April.Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, predicted that inflation would rise to around 56 per cent in May and remain close to that level for much of the year. “With real rates deeply in the negative territory, we also think that the policy stance adds to the inflationary risks,” it said.
500  So much for America’s shift from the Atlantic to the Indo-Pacific. By demanding concessions that have shocked a divided and rudderless Europe, Russian president Vladimir Putin has united the west behind US leadership. It has been years since that sentence could be written with a straight face. Russia has brought about what it fears — a west that is displaying something approaching resolve. As a result, US president Joe Biden now finds himself on the front lines of two potential cold wars, one in eastern Europe, the other in the South China Sea.This was not the script that Biden had planned on. He came to office promising to reorient US foreign policy to the east. To be sure, he said all the right things to America’s European partners, who were relieved to be treated as friends again after four years of belittlement by former president Donald Trump. But they soon learned that Biden meant something different by “America is back” than what they wanted. Much like Trump, Biden was fixated on China. Unlike Trump, he wanted Europe to help him in this new Indo-Pacific focus.Europe’s rude awakening began last summer when the US abruptly departed from Afghanistan without the agreement of its Nato allies. Much like the now-vanished Afghan National Army, America’s Nato partners relied on US air and logistical support to operate in Afghanistan. They were left thinking their opinion counted for little with Biden in spite of his warm rhetoric. The resulting debacle in Kabul left everyone bruised.Biden compounded the sin by failing to warn the French about its new Australia, UK, US nuclear submarine deal, Aukus, a few days after the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan. If ever there was a moment for Russia to exploit western disunity, it was then. But Putin has overplayed his hand. In contrast to last summer, US officials have been assiduous in consulting and listening to their European counterparts.Biden now faces two urgent challenges. The first is whether he can offer a way for Putin to climb down without losing face. The alternative is a conflict in Ukraine that could put the Balkans atrocities of the 1990s in the shade. With 40m people, a majority of whom want to join Nato, Ukraine is no Bosnia or Croatia. It is twice the size of Germany and has a bigger population than Poland. A more appropriate comparison would be the Spanish civil war in the 1930s when outside powers, fascist and communist alike, used proxy forces to fight each other. Even Putin would blanch at that.This is where Biden’s diplomatic creativity will be tested, and may be found wanting. If, as the consensus in Washington holds, China poses the overwhelming strategic challenge to the US, Biden must eventually find a way to loosen Russia from China’s embrace. Existential rhetoric about a global battle between autocracy and democracy will only drive Moscow closer to Beijing. It will also unsettle many of Biden’s newly reassured European allies. Some of them are uncomfortable with talk of Manichean contests between light and dark.It is not as if Ukraine is a model democracy. According to the Washington-based Freedom House, Ukraine is only “partly free” and rates well below Hungary’s “illiberal democracy” and other flawed ones such as Serbia, Colombia and Sierra Leone. Ukraine only ranks slightly below India, which the Biden administration heralds as a democratic bulwark against authoritarian China. If Biden prioritises this yardstick, his foreign policy is destined for confusion and accusations of hypocrisy. His language is also alienating relatively dependable friends such as Singapore and the United Arab Emirates — countries America needs on its side.The crisis in Europe offers Biden a clarifying exit from the rhetorical trap he has set for himself. The principle at stake is Ukraine’s sovereignty. Its borders should be no less inviolable were it to change its political system. The world would be a better place, of course, if democracy were flourishing everywhere. But recent history ought to have taught the US the risks of proclaiming its mission of universal freedom. Almost everyone, on the other hand, can agree on the sanctity of borders. By threatening Ukraine’s sovereignty, Putin has done something Biden could not on his own — unite the west. It gives Biden an advantage that should not be squandered. 
501  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.All eyes turn to Frankfurt today, where the European Central Bank is holding its governing council followed by a news conference where the bloc’s record-high inflation will be top of the agenda. We will explore the issues and why analysts and reporters will seek to parse out any signs of upcoming shifts in monetary policy.On the Russia-Ukraine front, El País got its hands on the written replies the US and Nato sent to Moscow — which the Biden administration confirmed yesterday and in which there are renewed offers for transparency on missile deployment and disarmament (which Russia rejected in the past). Washington also announced sending 2,000 troops to Poland and Germany and redeploying roughly 1,000 troops to Romania.And in our profile this week, we’ll look at the EU energy commissioner, Kadri Simson, who is headed to Azerbaijan tomorrow in an attempt to secure more back-up gas supplies for the bloc in case the Russia conflict flares up.Two months ago, Christine Lagarde dismissed rising inflation as a passing “hump” that was near its peak and said the European Central Bank was “very unlikely” to raise interest rates in 2022.Since then inflation has surpassed all expectations to set a new eurozone record of 5.1 per cent in January — well above the ECB’s 2 per cent target — and investors are now betting it will raise rates several times this year, writes Martin Arnold in Frankfurt.The increasing cost of living, driven by soaring energy and food prices, is top of the agenda as the ECB governing council meets today and investors will listen carefully for any hint from the ECB president of a “hawkish” shift in policy.Here are the three big questions:Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visits Kyiv today in a show of support for Ukraine underpinned by weapons sales that have become an irritant in Turkey-Russia relations. Ankara also opposed Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, driven by a centuries’ long suspicion of Russian expansionism and concern for the Crimean Tatar minority. (More here)The EU’s Estonian energy commissioner has been propelled into the role of gas crisis fighter, flying across the world to desperately secure additional supplies from major producers that are not Russia’s, writes Mehreen Khan in Brussels.Kadri Simson, who has served as EU energy commissioner since 2019, will be in Baku tomorrow in Brussels’s latest attempt to coax the world’s major liquefied natural gas producers (LNG) into ramping up supplies in light of a potential squeeze on Russian imports.The EU’s decision to go cap in hand to Azerbaijan — a former Soviet state and Turkey ally — shows the extent to which desperate times are calling for desperate measures. The Azeris have a 25-year deal to provide 10 bcm a year of LNG to the EU — the bulk of which goes to Italy. On her visit to Baku, Simson will reiterate the importance of Azerbaijan’s imports and the possibility of boosting volumes, said an EU official.Simson also met representatives from Qatar, the world’s largest producer of LNG, this week and on Monday will head to Washington for the revived EU-US energy council to bang the drum for more American LNG to Europe.Simson’s world tour comes as the EU is getting serious about security of supply amid constant worries about a Russian incursion into Ukraine. Russia accounts for about 40 per cent of all EU natural gas imports. LNG imports from the rest of the world make up roughly 20-25 per cent. Europe’s threats over applying crippling sanctions on Russia sound hollow unless the bloc has a real contingency plan to cope without Moscow’s gas flows.Brussels insists no major infrastructure bottlenecks exist to prevent additional volumes of LNG being pumped into the continent’s pipelines over the next months. About a third of the EU’s capacity remains free. The US is working on plans to help divert supply from Qatar intended for the Asian market to help out Europe.For now, Simson has struck a sanguine note on the EU’s diversification efforts. She told MEPs yesterday that increased LNG imports in January “showed that Europe can count on a diversified and fully functioning gas infrastructure. There is still spare capacity that can be used to receive even additional gas supplies in our LNG terminals.”
502  The cost of data needed to trade bonds in Europe has soared by 50 per cent over five years, according to new data that highlight regulators’ concerns about competition and pricing in the market.Costs for fixed income data rose by a half between 2017 and 2021, twice as much as overall market data price rises, a study by Expand Research on behalf of industry group Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) found. The increase was largely because of sellers increasing their prices, rather than demands for new kinds of data, the report said.The report comes as financial regulators review the inner workings of the system for supplying the information that banks and their customers rely on for trading every day. Financial watchdogs are closely scrutinising the charges levied on customers, and AFME plans to submit its findings to authorities.The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority has said it has concerns over competition, pricing and availability of information like benchmarks, indices and credit ratings, as well as stock and bond prices that are carried from stock exchanges, trading venues and data vendors.In Brussels, the European Commission is working on plans to make it cheaper for banks and fund managers to find prices of stocks and bonds throughout the single market, warning that a comprehensive picture is unaffordable to many investors.Some regulatory mandates require investors to have the most up-to-date and accurate prices, giving users little choice in paying for the information.Data suppliers have argued that their pricing models have become more tailored to customers’ consumption, while customers also want higher-quality data that require investment.Interdealer brokers — a type of intermediary that sits between financial groups — levied the biggest price rises, up an average 183 per cent, followed by alternative trading venues, which raised prices by 46 per cent to 107 per cent, Expand found.The survey by Expand, part of the Boston Consulting Group, found that some of the increase was because of Brexit as Britain’s departure from the EU created duplicated costs.However, the biggest price rises were for data accessed using terminals, the distinctive trading screens that carry news and real-time prices. As most bond deals are negotiated privately, fixed income trading relies more heavily on evaluated pricing, reference data and research for information, the report pointed out.“Our latest report finds that fixed income market data costs have increased far beyond those for equity markets, which are already considered to be too high,” said Adam Farkas, chief executive of AFME. “Rising market data costs is a marketwide problem which must be tackled as a standalone issue.”The EU wants to create central databases that record trading information on stock and bond markets, known as a consolidated tape. But Farkas warned that it would not fix the problem of rising prices. “For a tape to be effective.it must be built on cost-effective data,” he said.European and UK standards require data distributors to provide information “on a reasonable commercial basis”. Last year, Esma, the pan-European regulator, urged authorities to tweak the laws that allowed trading venues to charge for data proportionate to the value that the data represents to users.AFME argued that pricing should be related to the cost of producing and distributing information. Expand’s research was based on data supplied by ten European fixed income market makers, and publicly available sources.
503  European industrial giants have joined the race to create cleaner energy through nuclear fusion, a nascent industry pioneered primarily in the US.Munich-based Marvel Fusion has signed partnerships with Dax-listed Siemens Energy, France’s Thales and the privately owned German mechanical engineering group Trumpf, while also raising €35mn in a funding round led by tech investor Earlybird.Interest in nuclear fusion technology, a promising process that does not produce long-lasting radioactive waste and carries no risk of reactor meltdowns, has been hotting up in recent months.Last year, the sector attracted more than €2.3bn in venture capital funding, predominantly for companies based in the US.Unlike current nuclear power generation, which is based on fission, fusion could provide a virtually limitless energy supply with a very low environmental footprint. In theory, a fusion plant the size of a football field could even power a city as large as London.But although the technology has been around since Soviet scientists tried using it in the 1950s, to date none of the few dozen nuclear fusion companies worldwide have been able to achieve it while producing more electricity than the complex process consumes.Marvel Fusion claims its method, which uses lasers to trigger atomic reactions rather than magnets and extreme heat, will make the process commercially viable in a few years’ time.“It’s a theoretical model, which is essentially a very large computer simulation, and then step by step it is being validated in an experimental campaign that started last year,” Marvel Fusion chief executive Moritz von der Linden told the Financial Times, adding that the validation should be completed in two to three years. “If it works, it is the Holy Grail.”The company, which was founded in 2019, said its technology was based on the breakthrough by 2018 Nobel Prize winners Donna Strickland and Gérard Mourou, who “succeeded in creating ultrashort high-intensity laser pulses without destroying the amplifying material”.Most other nuclear fusion start-ups use a process called magnetic confinement and some have attracted large sums from investors.In December, American start-up Commonwealth Fusion Systems secured nearly $2bn from backers, including Tiger Global Management and Bill Gates, a few weeks after competitor Helion raised $500mn from Peter Thiel’s investment vehicle and Silicon Valley investor Sam Altman, among others.Marvel Fusion’s partners are among those hoping that Europe’s existing laser technology expertise could help companies on the continent catch up.Europe “can probably have a breakthrough by doing this with lasers”, said Thales’ director of laser activities, Franck Leibreich. But he added: “Right now we are more in the feasibility stage. We need to demonstrate that the fusion is possible physically, not just on paper.”Energy independence in Europe has also risen to the top of the political agenda in recent weeks, with fears mounting that gas supplies from Russia could be cut off or reduced in the event of conflict in Ukraine.Germany, which is due to close down its last three nuclear plants in the next year, needs clean technologies to make up for the lost capacity.Peter Leibinger, chief technology officer at Marvel Fusion’s new partner Trumpf, said the family-run company was “pleased to jointly develop this important technology” because “fusion is an essential component of the energy sovereignty of Europe and Germany”.But von der Linden said Marvel Fusion, which is launching another funding round this year, would “need significantly more money” for laser developments and warned that a prototype power plant — that would cost billions of euros — would have to be backed by public investment too.“Europe has to step up its game,” he added.
504  Many big investors have become increasingly nervous about the possibility of military conflict in eastern Europe, with Moscow warning of “the most unpredictable and grave consequences” if the west rejects its security demands. The notion that such tensions could lead to a war — and to western sanctions against Russia — has made financial assets in the region too difficult to hold for some large traditional managers, already jittery after a choppy start to the year fuelled in part by the prospect of tighter US monetary policy. “The narrative is alarming. And investors are not prepared to take a high-profile political risk,” said Joseph Mouawad, emerging market bond fund manager at Carmignac. Some hedge funds, however, are diving into the market in search of bargains, arguing that while Russian president Vladimir Putin is unlikely to back down soon, he will not want to risk a significant conflict. “We’re quite confident there will be no war,” said David Amaryan, founder of Balchug Capital, a global fund run out of Moscow.“I’ve talked to a lot of senior people in the Russian state. People are just going about their business,” he said. “If there was going to be a war, people would be acting in a different way. Everybody is quite calm.”Amaryan said he had been buying some stocks in big Russian companies such as energy group Gazprom and financial services company Sberbank, describing the move as a “no-brainer” given stock valuations, dividends and the high oil price. Russia’s dollar-denominated RTS index has fallen as much as 30 per cent since the end of October, although it has rallied over the past week and is now down 20 per cent over the period. Amaryan said he planned to “load up” if prices fall further.“None of us are naive enough to think they’re going to shake hands and hug,” he said. “But any form of war is in no way beneficial to Russia.For me, the idea of Russia conquering Ukraine is absurd.”Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer at Geneva-based Bank Syz, noted that profitable Russian exporters and banks had been “hit massively” and this could create opportunities.“This is exactly where you need to be,” said Barry Norris, chief investment officer at UK-based investment firm Argonaut Capital, who has positions in blue-chips such as Sberbank, Gazprom and Lukoil, although he has also been betting against some smaller, more highly valued stocks that he thinks could suffer in the short term. Overall, Russia’s Moex equity index is trading at about five times expected earnings over the next year, a steep discount compared with about 21 times for America’s S&P 500. Norris said the Russian market’s heavy weighting towards big energy companies and relatively low valuations mean it “should be one of the best-performing equity markets in 2022”. Some managers also see an opportunity in Ukraine’s sovereign bonds. A Ukrainian dollar bond maturing in 2032, for example, was trading on Wednesday with a yield of 9.6 per cent, compared with less than 2 per cent on a 10-year US government bond. “We believe that if you look at it from the Russian perspective, escalation makes a lot of sense but not a war,” said Pavel Mamai, founding partner at London-based emerging markets hedge fund ProMeritum Investment Management. He has been buying the bonds in recent months and partially hedging his position by betting some Russian assets will fall. “Ukraine’s [international bonds] are certainly pricing a tail risk of war.There’s been a lot of panic selling,” said Mamai, whose fund has made money in each of the past five years, according to numbers sent to investors.Still, many institutional money managers remain wary of investing in Russian or Ukrainian assets given the intense uncertainty and rising tensions between Moscow and western nations. Vincent Mortier, deputy chief investment officer at Amundi, which manages €1.8tn in assets, said it was “difficult to hedge” against the worst-case scenarios and that traditional tools to protect against risks of such an extreme, yet highly unpredictable, event do not work well in this situation.The crisis “is typically a black swan/tail-risk event that is difficult to prepare for as the probability it occurs is still pretty small”, he added. “But if it occurs then there can be some Armageddon-type consequences.”John McAuley, co-head of North American debt capital markets at Citigroup, cautioned, meanwhile, that the crisis marked the return of “old fashioned overnight risk in geopolitics” for investors.Dan Brocklebank, director at Orbis Investments UK, which manages £28bn in assets, said that while the situation could present opportunities, there were good reasons to be cautious.“While we believe that you have to be willing to act in a contrarian manner to be successful in investing, you can’t be contrarian for the sake of it — buying shares in Lehman Brothers, Theranos or Enron on the way down would have been contrarian, but not very smart,” he said.Additional reporting by George Steer and Katie Martin in London and Joe Rennison in New YorkOur weekly inside story on the movers and shakers behind a multitrillion-dollar industry.

505  Lithuania’s president called for Germany and the US to commit more troops to his Baltic country and send a signal to Moscow over its military build-up in Ukraine and neighbouring Belarus.Gitanas Nauseda said the Baltic countries were facing their “most dangerous situation since regaining independence” in 1990-91 due to the more than 100,000 Russian troops amassed on the border with Ukraine and “even more importantly” their presence in Belarus, an ally of Moscow.That puts Russia’s military potentially only 100km from its exclave in Kaliningrad, along the narrow “Suwalki gap” that divides Lithuania and the other Baltic states from Poland and the rest of Europe.“We discuss with our partners, first of all with Germany which is leading the EFP battle group in Lithuania, just to react to those processes. They are ready to discuss. So far I can’t say it’s leading to a direct result but.at the end of the day I hope we will have this result [of more troops],” Nauseda said.Nato countries are reinforcing their military presence along the eastern flank of the alliance. The UK has said it will double its contingent of troops in Estonia, where it leads the multinational battle group under Nato’s enhanced forward presence. The US said on Wednesday it would send 2,000 extra troops to Europe to bolster Nato’s presence.Germany is the lead nation of the Nato battle group in Lithuania but has faced criticism from many in eastern Europe for its perceived slow response to Russia’s sabre-rattling in Ukraine as well as its delay in dealing with a request from Estonia to send howitzers once housed in the former east Germany to Kyiv.Artis Pabriks, Latvia’s defence minister, last week told the Financial Times that Germany had an “immoral and hypocritical” relationship with both Moscow and Beijing, which is also pressuring Lithuania over its decision to open a representative office of Taiwan in Vilnius.Nauseda called Germany “our big friend” and stressed Lithuania was in “close contact” with the president, government and military in Berlin.“I hope that Germany understands very well what is happening here. But we need right now very clear signals. Concrete actions are very important, but sometimes rhetoric and a united standpoint are important too, especially to some adversaries,” he added.Germany, which has 550 soldiers stationed in Lithuania as part of the 1,200-strong battle group, declined to comment on Nauseda’s comments.German and Lithuanian officials said military planning for reinforcements was ready, with hundreds of potential troops working in Germany’s artillery, reconnaissance, and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence as well as air defence. But both said it was dependent on political decision-making in Berlin, which is complicated by the recently-installed three-party coalition.Nauseda said it was not necessary for Berlin to double its commitment, as the UK has promised in Estonia.“This is not probably a matter of concrete figures or concrete equipment. But it’s a matter first of all of readiness and commitment to react. Otherwise [somebody] can get the feeling that Nato is observing the situation and not reacting. It would be a very wrong signal to some countries in the east,” he added.The US also has troops in Lithuania, with a battalion present on rotation since 2019. “We expect that US troops on a rotational basis will be increased too,” Nauseda said.The president and other officials in Vilnius said they were particularly concerned by the de facto Russian military takeover of Belarus in recent years. Tens of thousands of Russian troops are being deployed there, ostensibly for a military exercise but with fears in Vilnius and elsewhere that they could stay on.The Suwalki Gap, the border between Poland and Lithuania between Kaliningrad and Belarus, is widely seen as Nato’s biggest vulnerability in Europe and an easy way for Russia to cut the Baltic states off if needed.“Lithuania feels sandwiched between this heavily militarised area of Kaliningrad and Belarus,” said Nauseda. “It means that Russia has all the possibilities to deploy military capabilities in the territory of Belarus, threatening the neighbours, not necessarily Ukraine but also Poland, the Baltic countries.”Lithuania and the other Baltic states have wanted permanent US bases in their country but Washington prefers to rotate them throughout eastern Europe.Margiris Abukevicius, Lithuania’s deputy defence minister, told the FT: “We in Lithuania, we are very much looking to Germany. We are talking. It’s very important that they step up and reinforce their presence.”Additional reporting by Guy Chazan in Berlin
506  Joe Biden has tried to ensure that the US and its partners remain united in responding to the threat to Ukraine from Russia’s military build-up, but one source of discord has come from an unlikely source: Ukraine’s own leader.Last month, President Volodymyr Zelensky rebuked Biden on Twitter for suggesting that a “minor incursion” by Russia might not prompt a severe response from the west — forcing Washington to row back on the comments.He then complained that the west, including the US, was exaggerating the prospect of an attack by Vladimir Putin’s forces and unnecessarily pulling diplomats’ families out of Ukraine. “We don’t need this panic.we don’t have a Titanic here,” Zelensky said.The relationship between Biden and Zelensky could be a critical factor as the stand-off over Ukraine reaches its endgame in the coming weeks, with Putin either stepping back from the brink or ordering his troops to invade.Andrew Lohsen, a fellow in the Europe, Russia and Eurasia programme at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said any rift between Biden and Zelensky on the Russian invasion threat risked becoming “grist for Russian disinformation” and a “real gift” for Moscow. He said he expected a “very concerted effort to get back on the same message”.In a notable shift after Zelensky’s pushback, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said on Wednesday that the Biden administration was no longer using the word “imminent” to describe a possible Russian attack, and instead, that it might happen at any moment.“We stopped using [imminent] because I think it sent a message that we weren’t intending to send, which was that we knew President Putin had made a decision,” she said.But some foreign policy experts say the tensions have been serious.“The US is doing all it can to support Ukraine, getting its allies on board, and sending them more defensive equipment. And yet you have President Zelensky publicly chastising the United States,” said Angela Stent, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington.Lohsen said the split reflected different priorities. The Ukrainian leader, he said, needed to prevent financial and social panic while Biden needed to keep maximum pressure on allies to take the Russian threat seriously.“Ukraine certainly has to look out for its own economic wellbeing. And I think that’s what we’re seeing is really driving these comments. Whereas the US is really in the driver’s seat, in terms of making sure that Ukraine’s partners are still presenting a united front,” he added.That view is shared in Kyiv. Maria Zolkina, an expert at Kyiv’s Democratic Initiatives Foundation think-tank, said the US “to some extent exaggerates” the Russian threat, while Kyiv “partially underestimates it. This is a reflection of the interests of both sides in negotiations with Russia.”The US and Ukrainian leaders are certainly coming to the crisis from very different backgrounds. Biden, 79, has been involved in foreign policy for decades. He was chair of the Senate foreign relations committee and as vice-president took a leading role when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.The following year he addressed Ukraine’s lower chamber of parliament, telling lawmakers: “If you succeed, you will be the founders of the first truly free, democratic, united Ukraine.” In contrast, 44-year-old Zelensky, a former comedian, was a political novice when he became Ukraine’s president in 2019.“The difficulty of managing Zelensky is to be expected and that’s because he is an iconoclast, he won the presidential election as an outsider standing up to the establishment,” said Charles Kupchan, a professor of international affairs at Georgetown University.Shortly after becoming president, Zelensky was pressured by Donald Trump to dig dirt on Biden’s family for political reasons, revelations that led to Trump’s first impeachment trial and a souring of relations between Washington and Kyiv.After the Trump era, US-Ukraine relations were rekindled, but there were still hiccups. Kyiv was unhappy over Biden’s withdrawal of sanctions on Nord Stream 2, the gas pipeline that links Russia and Germany, bypassing Ukraine. Zelensky was also not pleased that Biden met Putin in Switzerland last June, more than two months before his own meeting with the US leader.When Zelensky eventually met Biden in Washington in September the talks resulted in a new agreement on a strategic partnership between the two countries.Still, some Ukrainian officials privately fear that the US is ratcheting up pressure on Russia in order to quickly strike a deal involving autonomy for breakaway eastern Ukrainian regions, allowing Washington to turn back to China as its main foreign policy priority.Washington, meanwhile, has been at pains to underline its support for Ukraine, and both sides are trying to stamp out any sense of division. A US official this week pointed out that Biden had spoken three times with Zelensky recently, while contacts between other US officials — particularly Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, and Mark Milley, the chair of the joint chiefs of staff — and Ukrainian counterparts have been frequent. There are talks between Washington and Kyiv over a new emergency economic aid package.“We may have a difference of opinions on some issues, but those are friendly, open and candid discussions,” said Oksana Markarova, Ukraine’s ambassador to the US, in an interview with CBS on Sunday.Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser in Zelensky’s administration, was also keen to talk up the relationship. “There are no disagreements and no frustration and the presidents work quite productively. President Biden understands the Ukrainian context very well. His administration provides Ukraine with more support than ever before.”Meanwhile, the US still harbours some of its own doubts about Zelensky’s presidency. For instance, it has reacted sceptically to the trial on treason charges of former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko, saying it should be based on the “rule of law” rather than “politics”.But for now, despite the friction with Zelensky, some commentators believe Biden may be satisfied that the Ukrainian president is underreacting rather than overreacting to the Russian threat. “Measured behaviour is better than hot-headed behaviour in Kyiv,” said Georgetown University’s Kupchan. “That’s in part because the international community — the US and Nato — are trying to be firm without being provocative.”

508  The UK’s enforcement agency for financial sanctions has levied only six fines since being created in 2016, prompting lawyers and anti-corruption campaigners to question the effectiveness of the regime as ministers prepare to use the body to raise pressure on the Kremlin over Ukraine.The UK’s Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation was hailed as a “centre of excellence” when it was set up six years ago by George Osborne, chancellor at the time. It was designed to mimic the US Office of Foreign Assets Control, known for its tough stance on sanctions being busted.But the body, which reports to the Treasury, has issued only six fines in six years, totalling £20.7mn, despite receiving reports of potential breaches totalling £1bn in 2019/20 alone.Lawyers and anti-corruption campaigners said the low level of fines indicated a lack of enforcement, raising doubts about the UK’s financial sanctions regime in the week that the UK government announced tighter measures to allow it to target oligarchs with links to the Kremlin should Russia invade Ukraine. They added that unveiling stronger sanctions without an equally strong policing regime was pointless.In the 12 months to the end of March 2021, for example, 132 potential breaches were reported to OFSI but the organisation issued only a single fine. The situation was described as “extraordinary” by Susan Hawley, executive director at campaign group Spotlight on Corruption.“This is particularly concerning as it undermines the UK’s stated ambition to ramp up its independent use of the sanctions regime post-Brexit. Sanctions without enforcement are toothless,” she said.OFSI oversees financial sanctions against more than 2,200 entities and individuals, including those with links to the Iranian, Syrian, North Korean and Russian regimes.The agency was created in 2016 as part of a wider effort to crack down on corruption, and was also meant to target the tide of “dirty money” flowing into the City of London. It was given powers to issue fines a year later.Neill Blundell, head of the corporate crime and investigations team at Macfarlanes, said that, other than the “relatively few” monetary penalties issued so far, one of the other shortcomings of OFSI was the lack of criminal enforcement powers.“There appears to be a growing gap between the UK government’s increasing reliance on financial sanctions and the structures in place to administer them,” he said.OFSI levied its biggest penalty in 2020 — two fines worth £20.5mn against UK bank Standard Chartered for breaching sanctions imposed over Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 — accounting for most of the six fines levied.But in the two years since, the agency has issued just one fine, worth £50,000, against Transfer Go over a breach of the 2014 Ukraine sanctions.David Lammy, shadow foreign secretary, said the government needed to “come clean” on why the OFSI had been used so little. “These revelations show how government incompetence is contributing to the steady stream of dirty money from Russia and other authoritarian regimes flooding into the City of London,” he said.An individual close to the agency said sanctions breaches took time to investigate and a big lag had opened up between reports being completed and fines being levied. Fines are usually used in only the most serious cases.The government said: “OFSI takes a range of actions when breaches occur, including reporting rule-breakers to their regulators or professional bodies, issuing warning letters, imposing monetary penalties, and working with law enforcement agencies where appropriate.there are a number of investigations ongoing.”The agency stopped reporting the value of potential breaches in 2021 because it said the figure could be “disproportionately affected by a small number of transactions with a large value”, some of which turned out not to be breaches on further inspection.It is not the only agency involved in sanctions — the Department of Transport implements travel sanctions, for example, while HM Revenue & Customs enforces trade sanctions breaches.David Savage, a partner at Stewarts Law, said: “It is fair to say that enforcement activity for the various departments has, to date, been lacklustre.”
509  Joe Biden has ordered the deployment of an additional 2,000 troops to bolster Nato’s defences in Europe, strengthening the alliance’s response to a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine.John Kirby, the Pentagon’s spokesperson, announced the move during a briefing with reporters on Wednesday. In addition to sending about 2,000 troops from Fort Bragg, North Carolina to Poland and Germany, the US said it would redeploy roughly 1,000 troops from Germany to Romania.“President Biden has been clear that the United States will respond to the growing threat to Europe’s security and stability. Our commitment to Nato Article 5 and collective defence remains ironclad,” Kirby said, referring to the alliance’s mutual assistance principle.“These are not permanent moves,” he said, adding that they were “designed to respond to the current security environment. Moreover, these forces are not going to fight in Ukraine.”As the Russian military build-up along Ukraine’s border intensified in recent weeks, Biden put 8,500 troops on standby for deployment to the eastern flank of Nato and discussed details of a possible move with US allies. Alexander Grushko, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, described the extra US troops as “destructive steps that are unjustified by anyone”.“They increase military tension and narrow the room for political decisions,” he told Interfax on Wednesday.Even as diplomatic avenues have remained open, US officials have warned that Russia has continued to increase its military preparations, including additional movements of troops along Ukraine’s border in Belarus and naval activity in the Mediterranean. Moscow has deployed more than 100,000 troops and heavy weaponry along Ukraine’s borders, according to western intelligence.“There may soon be additional posture decisions to announce, including movements that are part of ongoing military exercises. This is not the sum total of the deterrence actions we will take,” Kirby said.The extra 2,000 troops — which are separate from the 8,500 on standby — are mostly members of the 82nd Airborne Division of the US Army, a group that played a central role in last year’s evacuation of Kabul.Their deployment comes as de-escalation talks continue between Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, and Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister.The US has offered to provide assurances to Russia over its Europe-based missile defence system and promised to refrain from deploying troops to Ukraine, according to a document disclosed by El País, whose authenticity was confirmed by the Biden administration.These written proposals, sent to the Kremlin last week, include a “transparency mechanism” to convince Russia that its Aegis Ashore missile defence systems, based in Romania and Poland, were not equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles.President Vladimir Putin has expressed concerns that the Aegis launchers could be used to attack Russia or shoot down its intercontinental ballistic missiles rather than those fired by Iran or other rogue states, as Washington maintains.The US said it was prepared to discuss transparency on its Aegis batteries if Poland and Romania agreed and “as long as Russian offers reciprocal transparency measures on two ground-launched missile bases of our own choosing in Russia”.It added that it was open to transparency measures and “reciprocal commitments” by the US and Russia to “refrain from deploying offensive ground-launched missile systems and permanent forces with a combat mission” on Ukrainian territory.Washington’s proposals were formulated as a response to Russian security demands issued in December. “We did not make this document public, but now that it is, it confirms to the entire world what we have always been saying,” said Kirby. “There is no daylight between our public statements and our private discussions.”State department spokesperson Ned Price added: “If the source of these documents, whoever that source may be, thought that by leaking them they would embarrass the United States, that they would drive a wedge between the United States and Nato, I think they will find that they were sorely mistaken in their effort to do so.”Kyiv said it would welcome a reciprocal commitment by the US and Russia to refrain from stationing missiles or troops in Ukraine.“I would like to note that, while the US has neither missiles in Ukraine nor their combat units in Ukraine, Russia has both,” said Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister. “And if this proposal is accepted on a reciprocal basis, that will imply that Russia has to withdraw. So no, we have no objections against the idea of Russia withdrawing its forces, its personnel and weapons from the territory of Ukraine.”The US and Nato have rejected Russia’s demands for a ban on further enlargement and for a withdrawal of Nato forces from the alliance’s former communist bloc members. Nato said the contingents sent to Baltic states and Poland following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 were small and temporary and in keeping with its commitments to Moscow.In a call with Putin on Wednesday, UK prime minister Boris Johnson reiterated that “all European democracies have a right to aspire to Nato membership” and that it was a defensive alliance, according to a UK official.Putin noted “Nato’s unwillingness to respond adequately to Russia’s legitimate concerns”, according to the Kremlin.Additional reporting by Guy Chazan in Berlin, Polina Ivanova in Moscow, Roman Olearchyk in Kyiv and Laura Hughes in London
510  A Northern Ireland minister has ordered a halt to post-Brexit customs checks on agriculture-related goods in the most concrete defiance to date of trading rules put in place when the UK left the EU a year ago.Edwin Poots, the agriculture minister, announced his decision in Belfast on Wednesday after taking legal advice which he said concluded he could go ahead and halt inspections even without the full backing of Northern Ireland’s executive.“I can now direct the checks to cease in the absence of executive approval,” he said, adding the change would start at midnight.The Democratic Unionist party, which Poots briefly led last year and which shares power with the nationalist party Sinn Féin in the Stormont government, vehemently opposes the so-called Northern Ireland protocol, the part of the Brexit agreement that governs trade in the region and put a customs border for goods down the Irish Sea.That customs border was introduced after London and Brussels agreed there would be no return to a trade border on the island of Ireland but the DUP argues that it downgrades Northern Ireland’s status within the UK.Sinn Féin maintains that the protocol offers Northern Ireland the best of both worlds since it remains both within the UK’s internal market and the EU’s single market for goods, and believes it should be respected.Poots said he would present a paper to the executive soon “to seek agreement on the way forward”.There was no immediate response from the European Commission. A spokesperson for the London government told the BBC: “The operation of checks is a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive. We have been consistently clear that there are significant problems with the Protocol which urgently need fixing, which is why we are in intensive talks with the EU to find solutions.”Maros Sefcovic, the EU’s Brexit commissioner, has virtual talks scheduled with UK foreign secretary Liz Truss on Thursday as part of long-running negotiations to reform the protocol after complaints it was suffocating trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.British officials said that although Poots had been warning for some time he might suspend checks, the UK government was not given pre-notification. They firmly rejected the idea that Poots’s action was part of any concerted British plan to put pressure on the EU.“We think they are under a legal duty to implement the checks,” said one UK government official while acknowledging that, ultimately, the Northern Ireland protocol was an agreement signed between Britain and the EU.Truss told the Belfast Telegraph newspaper last week during a visit to Northern Ireland that any halting of checks would be “a matter for the Northern Ireland executive to resolve”.An EU diplomat said Brussels was likely to give London time to bring the DUP into line and, if it did not, would probably activate dispute resolution mechanisms. That would take at least six months to rule on and could impose fines and allow EU tariffs on UK goods.Sinn Féin’s Michelle O’Neill, Northern Ireland’s deputy first minister, called Poots’ move a “stunt” ahead of elections due on May 5, and an “attempt by the DUP to unlawfully interfere with domestic and international law”.Dublin was also dismayed. Foreign minister Simon Coveney told parliament it was effectively a breach of international law which he hoped would not be implemented.Jim Allister, leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice party, welcomed the move, saying customs checks “should never have happened”.“There is no place for Northern Ireland to be subject to foreign laws, foreign institutions, foreign courts, a foreign customs zone, foreign single market,” he said.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of business group Manufacturing Northern Ireland, said Poots’ move could face legal challenges. “The first battle could come from within Northern Ireland’s civil service,” he said.
511  Consumer prices in the eurozone rose by a record 5.1 per cent in January piling more pressure on the European Central Bank to respond with tighter monetary policy.The new figure defied expectations of a fall in inflation, with economists polled by Reuters expecting a rate of 4.4 per cent.Steeper increases in the price of energy and food were only partly offset by slower growth in prices of manufactured goods, which meant annual inflation rose from its previous eurozone record of 5 per cent in December, Eurostat said.The rising cost of living is likely to dominate the first ECB governing council meeting of the year on Thursday, even if most economists expect the bank to stick to its timetable for keeping interest rates unchanged while it steadily reduces asset purchases over the course of this year.Bert Colijn, senior economist at ING, said he expected the ECB to “push back against early rate hikes” on Thursday. He said a fall in core eurozone inflation and the deceleration in goods prices showed “there is still no evidence of widespread second-round effects” whereby higher prices trigger sharp increases in wages.However, higher-than-expected inflation has led the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England to shift to a more “hawkish” policy stance than the ECB. The BoE is expected to raise rates for a second consecutive time on Thursday, while the market is pricing in five rate rises by the Fed this year.The ECB has rejected investor bets that it will raise rates this year, saying it will not do so before it stops asset purchases, which it plans to continue at least until October.Markets this week pulled forward expectations of a tightening in eurozone monetary policy, with a rise in the ECB’s deposit rate to minus 0.25 per cent — from its current rate of minus 0.5 per cent — now priced in by December, according to trading in short-term funding markets.The persistence of inflation above the ECB’s 2 per cent target has already caused widening divisions on its governing council. The “hawkish” heads of the German, Belgian and Austrian central banks complained at last month’s meeting that it was committing to continue bond purchases for too long.Krishna Guha, vice-chair of Evercore, said “a hawkish Fed-style pivot” at the ECB was “implausible” because “domestic inflation and wage dynamics are still in a very different place to those in the US and UK”.He forecast the ECB would end asset purchases early next year before raising rates three times over the course of 2023 to put its deposit rate back in positive territory for the first time since 2014.Compared with the previous month, eurozone consumer prices rose 0.3 per cent, indicating that underlying inflationary pressures continue to build in the 19-country bloc. The highest national inflation rate was 12.2 per cent in Lithuania, while France had the lowest at 3.3 per cent.Soaring energy and food bills are squeezing household budgets. A quarter of German consumers said they would struggle to make ends meet this year because of higher prices, according to a survey released by the Schufa credit agency.“Even if we have seen governments implementing some measures to offset higher energy prices, it is starting to impact consumers,” said Nadia Gharbi, senior economist at Pictet Wealth Management.Eurozone energy prices rose by a record 28.6 per cent from the previous year in January, while growth in the cost of unprocessed food accelerated to 5.2 per cent. Services prices continued to rise 2.4 per cent while growth in goods prices slowed to 2.3 per cent.The euro climbed 0.4 per cent against the dollar to $1.131 on Wednesday while the price of German bonds fell as the 10-year yield reversed earlier losses to rise 2 basis points to 0.05 per cent, its highest for almost three years.
512  Unwilling to risk a military clash with a nuclear-armed Russia, the west is relying in large part on the threat of punitive sanctions to deter Moscow from invading Ukraine. The good news is the US is developing a hard-hitting package and persuading some recalcitrant EU allies to sign up. Less good news is that these are unlikely to be enough, in themselves, to persuade President Vladimir Putin to desist — and the west must brace for pain from both its own measures and Russian retaliation.If Russia invades, the US and European allies are preparing potentially to bar its lenders from converting roubles into dollars, and restrict secondary trading of newly issued Russian debt. While agreement to bar Russia from Swift, the interbank payments system, seems elusive, other planned steps could do significant damage to its banks and financial system. Washington is also touting blocking exports of some sensitive technologies containing US components to Russia, hitting its arms and aviation industries and even some consumer products. Access to western technology and capital could be barred for new Russian energy projects. The Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany seems increasingly likely to be halted.Washington is threatening, too, to sanction tycoons and officials close to Putin, going after their mansions and bank accounts in the west. It has prodded the UK, whose support is vital given London’s role as a hub for Russian money, to prepare similar steps.Russia has, however, sanction-proofed itself rather well since the west took measures over its 2014 aggression against Ukraine. The Kremlin pressed oligarchs to bring money home in 2015, and banned senior officials from holding overseas assets. Moscow has amassed gold and foreign exchange reserves topping $620bn; only one-sixth are now in dollars. Surplus oil and gas revenues have been hoarded in a $190bn National Wealth Fund. Government debt is just 20 per cent of GDP.Moscow also has non-military ways to hit back, and has strengthened the leverage it exerts through Europe’s reliance on Russia for 40 per cent of its natural gas. By holding back from selling extra spot gas in the recent supply squeeze, Russia has helped to push European gas storage down to less than 40 per cent of capacity, the lowest ever at this time of year. Liquefied natural gas from suppliers such as Qatar would be insufficient to make up for even partial supply restrictions by Russia. Moscow could also retaliate to western steps by seizing foreign assets in Russia, or restricting repatriation of profits.Yet while the Kremlin may feel confident of withstanding a short-term shock, western measures would cause yet more damage to Russia’s economy over the longer run. Coming on top of the cost of both sanctions and sanction-proofing since 2014, which has led to stagnant growth and living standards, the political blowback for Russia’s president could, over time, be severe.The sanctions threat remains, then, a vital part of a strategy that includes diplomatic talks, and efforts to increase the military cost to Russia of any Ukraine invasion. Western countries should step up supplies of defensive weapons to Kyiv.Moscow’s military muscle-flexing also highlights the need to take long-overdue steps. The UK, in particular, should strengthen controls on illicit Russian money, not just as part of any Ukraine-related sanctions but to prevent efforts to subvert its democracy. And Europe must turn talk of making itself less dependent on Russian energy into a reality. Today’s crisis may yet be defused. But western leaders can no longer be in any doubt over the nature of the Kremlin they are dealing with.Letter in response to this editorial comment:Anti-Putin sanctions must target military and defence industry / From Oleksandr Danylyuk, Chairman, Centre for Defence Reforms, Kyiv, Ukraine
513  The Paris Opera is beginning to look like an episode of Squid Game. As participants are taken out by Covid, and with threats of national strikes looming, the house often cannot announce until the afternoon of a planned performance whether it is to go ahead or not. (Which is not to say that other houses are faring any better.)Netia Jones’s new production of Le nozze di Figaro (Palais Garnier) tries to walk the fine line between theatre and reality, in a self-reflecting mise en abyme that often loses its way. We are never really sure if the characters are figures in a drama or are themselves playing others. Do we believe in them or not? Jones has taken care of everything — sets, costumes, video and stage direction — so you might expect a little more coherence of vision.There are flashes of genius, such as the Countess singing her first aria while the Count — presumably an opera intendant as well as a nobleman — auditions her successor in the next room. Or take the video projection of Marcellina’s rant against men — present in Beaumarchais’s original play but not in the Mozart — and her observation of Barbarina’s lost pin aria: the old generation watches the young repeat its own mistakes, helplessly trapped in a man’s world. When the Count brings a cordless screwdriver to open the Countess’s closet, there is a rare moment of hilarity. But overall, humour and insight are too thin on the ground to carry this long evening.With half the cast masked, and some not using their full voice, it was hard to judge how the ensemble might have sounded in less pestilential times. Certainly Ying Fang is a show-stopping Susanna, bright, agile, a sweet, glass-clear voice and a vast expressive range. Luca Pisaroni is a good match for her as Figaro, athletic, nimble, with a rich and virile voice. Christopher Maltman, replacing Peter Mattei, makes a solid, nuanced Count.Lea Desandre sang the part of Cherubino in Aix-en-Provence last summer; it is as if she has cut and pasted her character from that production into this one. It is wonderful, but overdone, as if she thinks she can gesticulate the production into intelligibility. (Maria Bengtsson sang the Countess on the night I attended but was unwell.)On the podium, Gustavo Dudamel keeps a cool head and holds his forces together well. When things threaten to fall apart — which happens often — he brings them back together without breaking a sweat.Dudamel conducted this work at Daniel Barenboim’s Staatsoper Berlin, and the older man’s influence is audible in every note. Downbeats are heavy, phrases are driven and notes are directly attacked. A lighter touch, more contour in the phrasing and more attention to instrumental articulation would bring the music an organic momentum. Still, Dudamel’s Mozart is cogent and capable. He has room to grow.★★★☆☆Hartmut Haenchen at Sunday’s La Khovantchina (Opéra Bastille) has done all his growing. Haenchen, one of the most consistently convincing conductors of his generation, brings scores to life with such absolute mastery that after four hours of bloodlust and intrigue, you wish you could start again from the beginning.Sunday’s performance was the 19th of Andrei Serban’s unremarkable production, a dusting-off of something that looks as if it has been in the archives for at least half a century. If you think opera should just be a series of elaborate tableaux with fabulous costumes, you will love this staging. No matter; even the most intelligent updating of Mussorgsky’s blockbuster runs aground with its incendiary ending. How can you stage a mob of religious fanatics burning themselves to death? Serban doesn’t even try, making do with a couple of puffs of pyrotechnics and a haphazard exodus from the stage.Haenchen has chosen Shostakovich’s completion of the score, and the orchestra plays it for him as if they had frozen and bled for Mother Russia. The chorus, under Ching-Lien Wu, is magnificent, and the mostly Russian cast is uniformly excellent. From Sergei Skorokhodov’s impetuous Prince Andrei and John Daszak’s bullish Prince Golitsine to Anush Hovhannisyan’s beleaguered Emma and Anita Rachvelishvili’s treacle-dark Marfa, every role is well cast and superbly sung. And we believe every note, not least because Haenchen shapes the details and carries the whole with a savvy sense of architecture.Dramaturgically, La Khovantchina is a mess. Why are the pious Old Believers hanging out with the coarse Streltsy? Who are all these princes? Why does the story shift abruptly after Prince Ivan’s murder? And why, exactly, do all these people want to die? Never mind! The music is one giant roller-coaster thriller, and you will soon be so involved that you stop worrying about the why. At last we are in a world where pestilence seems like a minor blip in the order of the day.★★★★☆Both productions to February 18, operadeparis.fr
514  Germany’s constitutional court has told Facebook it must divulge the personal data of users who insulted a prominent Green politician, in a judgment that could have far-reaching consequences for social media platforms operating in the country.The politician, Renate Künast, identified 22 insulting comments on Facebook and asked the company to provide her with the authors’ data so she could sue them.Users had called her a “brain amputee”, a “sick woman” and “paedo-filth” among other insults, according to the court’s verdict. Two regional courts in Berlin considered only 12 of the 22 comments criminal and said politicians should be able to tolerate “even excessive criticism”.But in the judgment published on Wednesday, the constitutional court ruled that all 22 comments were criminal. The judges said the Berlin courts had failed to “strike the right balance between freedom of speech and privacy rights, as required by the constitution”. The court’s verdict is binding and cannot be appealed.Germany has long been at the forefront of efforts to police the internet. The so-called Network Enforcement Act — known locally as the NetzDG — came into force in 2018 and requires platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to remove potentially illegal material within 24 hours of being notified or face fines of up to €50mn.A new, even tougher version of the NetzDG came into force on Wednesday. It obliges platforms to pass on the data of suspected criminals to the German police. The law creates a new department at Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), designed to investigate suspected offenders on social media more quickly and efficiently. It is particularly aimed at the alarming rise in far-right extremist posts on platforms such as Facebook.Critics of Facebook have long complained of what they see as the platform’s unwillingness to divulge the data of users who engage in hate speech. Prosecutors investigating cases of incitement have said the social media company often failed to respond to requests for information.In the UK, criticism was sparked last summer by online racist abuse targeted at black England footballers after the team’s loss in the Euro 2020 final. It led to a petition with more than half a million signatories and a new bill calling for identity verification on social media.Facebook said it would “take action on hate speech whenever we become aware of it and are continuously investing in teams, technology and reporting tools so we can find it faster”.A statement from Meta, the corporate name for Facebook since its rebranding in October, said it would share the requested data about the people who insulted Künast as soon as the regional court in Berlin ordered it to do so, based on the constitutional court’s verdict. It said it invested $5bn in online safety and security last year.The European Commission’s latest progress report last year found that Facebook removed around 70 per cent of hate speech posts, in line with demands set in a 2016 code of conduct agreed with Facebook and other social media platforms.Künast has been one of Facebook’s most tireless critics and a longtime campaigner against hate speech and fake news on the internet. In 2017, she sued a rightwing organisation that had posted made-up quotes ascribed to her and accused Facebook of failing to delete the quotes quickly enough.Katrin Göring-Eckardt, the Green deputy president of the Bundestag, praised the court’s verdict, saying it was an “important day in times of hate versus democracy”.The German court ruling comes as the UK is preparing to pass an online safety bill. The landmark legislation proposes to hold tech companies liable for any illegal content on their sites, such as hate speech or posts that incite violence or terrorism, as well as legal but harmful content. UK legislators have faced pushback from tech companies and free-speech advocates who believe the bill will result in too much censorship.
515  Brussels has stuck by a decision to classify nuclear power and some forms of natural gas as green energy, defying criticism from scientists and climate change experts over its landmark sustainable finance rules.The European Commission on Wednesday published a largely unrevised final text of its “taxonomy for sustainable finance” which has come under fire from EU governments, environmental campaigners and the European Investment Bank for its acceptance of nuclear power and forms of carbon-emitting gas.The EU’s taxonomy is a sweeping classification system for industries that produce about 80 per cent of the bloc’s emissions to guide private capital into environmentally sustainable activities.But Brussels has come under fire for bowing to pressure from pro-nuclear and pro-gas member states to include the two technologies under the green label in an initial draft first reported by the Financial Times.Mairead McGuinness, EU commissioner for financial services, on Wednesday told reporters the text “may be imperfect but it’s a real solution that moves us forward towards our ultimate goal of climate neutrality”.“The taxonomy does not mandate investment in certain sectors. It does not prohibit investment in the sectors covered. It is a signpost towards the private investment market,” she said.Brussels’ final version of the text keeps the classification of nuclear power — which produces little CO2 but has toxic byproducts that pose radiation risks — largely unchanged. New nuclear power stations will qualify for the green label for permits issued before 2045 if countries can provide plans for safe waste management and decommissioning. The inclusion has been supported by nuclear-reliant EU countries led by France.Natural gas will also be given the green label if it is used to replace more polluting energy sources, such as coal, and if direct emissions from its use fall below 270g of CO2 per kilowatt/hour, or an average of less than 550kg a year over 20 years.This decision has been criticised by governments in Spain, Austria, Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden and Luxembourg, which called for a threshold of 100g, in line with scientific advice provided by experts to the commission.EU officials told the FT that EU commissioners from Portugal, Spain and Austria voted against the rules in an internal meeting of the college of commissioners — a rare show of dissent in meetings that are usually run on consensus.The governments of Spain, Austria and Luxembourg have said they will reject the taxonomy outright, but their opposition will not be enough to create a majority of countries needed to block it. Members of the European parliament can also veto the text with a majority vote within the next six months.Markus Ferber, a German conservative MEP, said the exercise “has failed” and warned the vote in the parliament was “by no means a sure-fire exercise”.The commission’s taxonomy comes as the EU’s reliance on natural gas — with Russia Europe’s largest single provider — has come under fire as Moscow raised military tensions over Ukraine, helping to drive up European electricity prices.Luca Bonaccorsi from Transport & Environment, a clean transport campaign group, said the labelling of gas would lead to a “wave of investments in gas, sabotaging the continent’s entire decarbonisation efforts. It is a gift to Putin at the very time we should be ditching gas.”The EU carbon price closed at a record high of €95 on Wednesday, or three times what it was a year ago, on expectations of stricter climate policies, as well as a result of the gas crisis. The price of allowances traded under the bloc’s emissions trading system gives the buyer permission to emit one tonne of carbon.Even with the elevated cost of polluting, it has continued to be more economical for power generators to switch from gas to coal, the most polluting fossil fuel. The carbon price would need to rise to around €200 to make the use of gas more profitable than coal, according to estimates by data provider Refinitiv.

516  The former boss of scandal-hit French nursing home operator Orpea has come under fire after it emerged he sold shares in the group ahead of the publication of a book alleging residents were mistreated.Orpea, one of Europe’s biggest listed care home groups, is under investigation by authorities after The Gravediggers, a book by journalist Victor Castanet published in January, alleged the company systematically cut corners, including rationing adult nappies, to save money at the 370 or so nursing homes it operates in France.Orpea’s former chief executive Yves Le Masne — who was fired on Sunday — sold almost €590,000 of shares in the company at the end of July, filings from French regulator the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) show.That was just weeks after Orpea received detailed questions about allegations contained in Castanet’s book when he contacted it for comment, France’s weekly Le Canard Enchaîné newspaper reported on Wednesday.Le Masne did not respond to requests for comment. Orpea’s new chief executive Philippe Charrier told BFM TV it was a matter for his predecessor and that “authorities would examine the case”.“He may have had good reasons but I will not judge this in the place of authorities,” Charrier added.Le Masne had sold blocks of shares in the past. The July sale was at €107.85 a share. The stock price has collapsed to about €40 per share since the allegations came to light.Brigitte Bourguignon, a French government minister, said she was “even more disgusted” by the situation surrounding Orpea after Le Masne’s share sale came to light.“There will be detailed investigations (of all the allegations),” Bourguignon told LCI television on Wednesday, adding they would focus on the finances of Orpea and conditions in its homes.The AMF declined to comment on whether it would open its own investigation. Orpea has also denied another of Castanet’s allegations: that he was offered a bribe by the company to stop his investigation.The Orpea scandal has erupted as France is in the throes of a presidential election campaign.Rightwing candidate Valérie Pécresse of Les Républicains said she would seek to overhaul the sector with stricter rules on how for-profit care homes were run. Communist party candidate Fabien Roussel on Wednesday called on the government to “expropriate” Orpea’s care homes. Additional reporting by Leila Abboud
517  Dear reader,There was a hint of parody about the Benefits of Brexit. The official document published here in London on Monday — the second anniversary of the UK leaving the EU — enthused about blue passports and crown stamps on pint glasses.It was published on the same day as a heavily redacted report on lockdown parties in Downing Street. In both cases, critics said, it looked as though anything of significance had been removed.That is harsh. But it is fair to say that the Brexit project is not delivering what some cheerleaders had hoped. In December, the government’s chief EU negotiator Lord David Frost resigned in frustration over the direction of travel.Meanwhile, the drawbacks of Brexit are materialising as predicted. As of October, UK imports and exports of goods were 16 per cent below the expected trend if the UK had stayed in the EU, according to the pro-EU Centre for European Reform.High time, then, for the government to take advantage of its newfound ability to forge its own rules. There should be scope to improve on the EU’s “one size fits all” approach that does not always accommodate national differences. Reforming agricultural subsidies, for example, will allow the UK to steer away from food production and towards biodiversity and carbon reduction.Well-designed rules could, in some cases, give the UK a competitive edge. In fintech, the government wants regulators to experiment and collaborate with business. It wants to encourage the use of “sandboxes”, which allow businesses to experiment under a regulator’s supervision, for example in testing new products.The UK has a chance of securing a “first mover” advantage by regulating emerging industries before the EU does. The government cites digital markets, artificial intelligence, gene editing, artificial meats and autonomous vehicles as examples of “new and exciting areas”.But it will be far from straightforward. The National Farmers’ Union says new precision breeding techniques, such as gene editing, could offer huge benefits. But many environmental campaigners want to stick with EU restrictions. Getting the public onside could be a struggle.In the case of autonomous vehicles, the UK could attract manufacturers and developers by relaxing restrictions on companies accessing personal data. But that could prompt the EU to withdraw the adequacy ruling that allows data exchange with the UK when it comes up for review in 2025.The cost to UK companies of transferring data from the EU in that scenario has been estimated at as much as £1.6bn. Moreover, safety standards for autonomous cars are governed by international agreements, rendering regulatory autonomy something of a token advantage, according to a study by UK In a Changing Europe, a think-tank.The UK’s freedom of manoeuvre is limited by the increasing division of the world into three regulatory spheres of interest: the US, EU and China. An innovative UK regime might not prove sustainable after the larger blocs have made their moves, says the Institute for Government. That said, the UK might be able to form alliances with other regulators, or exert influence on them.Escaping the EU’s orbit is tricky because many businesses do not want to operate under multiple different regimes. Chemicals producers have warned that replacing EU regulation could cost the industry £1bn.No wonder some of the punchier numbers about scrapping EU rules have been scaled back. The government says its reforms will cut £1bn of red tape for UK businesses. That compares with the Leave Campaign’s claim, ahead of the referendum, that Brexit could remove £33bn of Brussels red tape.There are some real opportunities as the UK diverges from EU rules. But they are unlikely to match up to the hopes of those, like Frost, who wanted Brexit to create a lightly regulated economy. Replacing existing rules can lead to additional burdens, while new technology and the move to net zero will require an entirely new set of edicts. The promised bonfire of red tape is failing to catch alight.Enjoy the rest of the week,Vanessa Houlder Lex writer
518  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.The EU’s long-awaited final text on the so-called taxonomy for what is considered a green investment (nuclear and gas included) is set to be published today. We’ll look at why all the opposition to the text hasn’t made much of a difference, and what are the next steps.Meanwhile, on the eastern front, Russia’s president Vladimir Putin dug his heels in yesterday, accusing western powers of ignoring his demands and dragging his country into war with Ukraine. Next door in Kyiv, the procession of western officials continued, with the prime ministers of the Netherlands, Poland and the UK all meeting with Ukraine’s president yesterday to show support.Switching gears, remember the idea — floated last year — of having an EU-wide digital wallet for personal, medical or official records? We’ll explore why it’s off to a rather bad start.It’s D-Day for the EU’s fraught publication of its green finance rules, writes Mehreen Khan in Brussels.The European Commission will this afternoon publish the final version of its taxonomy on sustainable finance, which has been heavily criticised for classifying nuclear power and some forms of natural gas as green energy sources.Ramming home the dissent, environmental campaigners will be greeting today’s text with a protest featuring commission president Ursula von der Leyen’s head on a mock tombstone reading “RIP EU Green Deal” outside the executive’s headquarters in Brussels.Today’s publication is the penultimate step in a taxonomy process that has been littered with complaints from environmental groups, some EU governments and even the European Investment Bank. Green experts, MEPs and governments, including those of Austria, the Netherlands, Spain, Luxembourg and Denmark, as well as Germany’s Greens, have all called for the commission to exclude natural gas from the green label.Their calls are likely to fall on deaf ears. Mairead McGuinness, EU commissioner for financial services, has said there will be no major changes from an initial draft that the Financial Times first reported on New Year’s Eve.The classification of fossil gas and nuclear power will be largely unchanged, but officials have told Europe Express there will still be some tweaks to watch out for. One of them includes removing targets for the blending of gas with renewables for 2026 and 2030 to qualify for the green label. In theory, that will make it easier for gas to be considered a sustainable investment.One key demands from anti-gas campaigners will not make it into the final text. This is a call for the inclusion of gas only if it emits less than 100g of CO2 per kilowatt hour of power and is used to replace more polluting sources such as coal. An initial designation of 270g will remain.Amid the outcry, expect the commission to put up a staunch defence of the rules at a press conference this afternoon. Brussels is also well aware that despite the complaints and even threats of legal action, there is no super majority of member states to reject the taxonomy outright.That leaves the European parliament as the only institution that can still stop the taxonomy in its tracks. MEPs would need to find a majority — 353 votes — to veto the rules and force the commission to go back to the drawing board. Anti-taxonomy MEPs are already rallying their troops.A rejection would be an embarrassing blow for the commission that has flaunted the taxonomy as a trailblazing green financial regulation that will create a “green gold standard” for the rest of the world to follow.Even if MEPs can’t veto the rules, investors may still shun the standard if they think it offers the greenwashing it was designed to eliminate. Should markets choose to comply with more rigorous alternatives — such as those being devised in the UK or the US — the EU’s green taxonomy will have failed on its own terms.Unemployment in the eurozone fell to a record low of 7 per cent at the end of last year, underlining how the region’s labour market has bounced back much faster than expected from the impact of the pandemic. (More here)Last summer, the EU unveiled plans for a digital wallet so that citizens could have access to services online, but some member states are starting to think it might not be a good idea after all, writes Javier Espinoza in Brussels.The project was supposed to allow EU citizens to securely store payment details and passwords and log into local government sites to pay bills with a single sign-on, recognised across the bloc. The proposals are non-binding and allow member states to implement them as they see fit.But some countries, including Ireland and Denmark, are starting to have reservations about the plans.A letter signed by 14 member states outlines their fears. These are twofold:
519  Descending a long ramp into the concrete basement of a former crematorium in north-west Berlin, the first thing that strikes you is the sound: hornlike organs fill this wide, dim hall, causing the metal rafters on the ceiling to rattle and leaving your ears a little numb from the low vibrations. A deep, swirling hum comes out of old church organ pipes, fibreglass tubes and bells that lie scattered on the floor, part of German musicians Phillip Sollmann and Konrad Sprenger’s sound installation, “Modular Organ System”, in the 23rd edition of Berlin’s CTM festival.Since the late 1990s, the festival — whose first part is on now, the second in May — has been at the forefront of the German avant-garde, venturing through the challenging, the esoteric, the ecstatic and the downright weird matrices of art and music.“Modular Organ System” fits in neatly. It feels like stepping into a vast dissection room and at the heart of the operation sit Sprenger and Sollmann at a laptop, controlling the flow of air currents through funnels and tubes to produce sound. These currents function as breath, of particular poignance in a post-Covid world where the act of breathing is both profound (it tethers us to existence and one another) and potentially perilous.Against a deep, billowing keynote, pipes can be layered, taking the soundscape from minimalist electronica to Buddhist temple ritual to hypnotic drone music. Over a 10-day run, different musicians join the duo to collaborate, such as American guitarist Stephen O’Malley, who runs his electric guitar through distortion pedals and amplifiers for an improvised duet with the system. But even without collaborators, the performance is living and meditative, breathtaking and breath-giving.Across town in Kreuzberg is Connected Alienation, an immersive group exhibition as part of CTM that invites artists to present work responding to the lack of human contact during the pandemic. (Contact is the overarching theme at the festival.)Highlights here include Jump-Cut, a six-part art-film series curated by Dana Gingras (the choreographer behind dance company Animals of Distinction). Gingras saw an opportunity for collaboration as international touring ground to halt, bringing dancers, video artists and musicians into contact with each other to make a short film.Running at 21 minutes, “Jump Cut #3” (directed by Austin Young) is bursting to the brim with colour, lewdness and monstrous camp. In a work that is less about contact and more about transformation, stars of the TV show RuPaul’s Drag Race rob a wig store to the sound of pithy, grinding electro by Canadian-born provocateur Peaches. In the throbbing, anti-establishment song “Flip This”, she spits: “Kick a column watch it tumble/Now is not the time to mumble/Scream it out and feel the rumble/Fuck the system make it crumble.” The film skirts scholarly piety with much-needed silliness. But if Peaches and co truly want a rumble, there is a former crematorium offering just that.CTM Festival part one runs until February 6; part two is May 24-29, ctm-festival.de
520  Compared with the limited and lightning-fast operation in Kazakhstan, today the international community is warning that Russia appears to be preparing for a very different operation: a comprehensive invasion of Ukraine.Moscow has repeatedly denied that it plans to invade, despite open-source intelligence showing that it continues to mass troops on the border between the countries. But should President Vladimir Putin order an attack, 62-year-old Serdyukov, the head of Russia’s VDV paratroopers — the world’s largest airborne force — is likely to play a leading role.“The VDV is typically the tip of the spear,” said Michael Kofman, a Russian military expert at the US research organisation CNA and author of a widely cited article on Putin’s military strategy. “It has already fought extensively in Ukraine in 2014 and 2015. You would see quite a few VDV formations in any new invasion.”Serdyukov’s career, which has encompassed deployments in Chechnya and Crimea, is illustrative of how Russia’s army has evolved under Putin, with the military, alongside the country’s nuclear arsenal, becoming a central instrument of the president’s foreign policy, say analysts.Two decades ago, the military was a lumbering and poorly equipped Soviet-era force of badly paid conscripts, padded with officers — almost one for each soldier — that took heavy casualties during the brutal suppression of the Islamist insurgency in Chechnya.Today, analysts say, it is a streamlined force capable of peacekeeping operations in Kazakhstan, out-of-theatre interventions such as in Syria in 2015, and stealthier missions, such as the annexation of Crimea in 2014. “The Ukrainian army may be better than it was in 2014, but Russian forces are still far stronger and have also modernised,” said Bettina Renz, author of Russia’s Military Revival and professor of international security at Nottingham university. “[Russia] has more capabilities, and with that comes more options.”The turning point came in 2008 when Russian forces bungled a war with Georgia. The intervention lasted only five days, yet several planes were lost to friendly fire, and field communications were so poor that commanders reportedly had to use their own mobile phones. Reconnaissance drones could only transmit pictures after landing, instead of in real time.A massive revamp ensued. Pay was increased, equipment modernised, combat strategies refined and a demoralised officer class increasingly deployed into action. Poorly trained conscripts began to be replaced with career soldiers. “Now the [army] is able to choose and recruit.maybe not the absolute best, but not the worst either,” said Ruslan Pukhov, director of the Moscow-based Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies.The Pentagon last week warned that Russia had deployed enough troops and equipment to invade Ukraine at any moment and had a “range of options”, including an attack aimed at occupying the country.Analysts estimate that 52 Iskander ballistic missile launchers have been placed near the border, plus 76 battle-ready Battalion Tactical Groups, which average 800 troops, more than twice the usual number. Overall, Russia has an army of about 900,000 personnel, including 280,000 ground troops. Over the past decade, it has added new aircraft, modernised its tanks and cut the ratio of conscripts to enlisted soldiers from nearly half to 30 per cent. Ukraine has an active force of 261,000 personnel, of which 145,000 are in the army, plus a further 900,000 reservists. Although hardened by eight years of conflict in the Donbas, where separatists are fighting to break away from Kyiv, the Ukrainians lack comprehensive air defence systems, most of which remain in Crimea and are in Russian hands.The fruits of Russia’s reforms became clear during the annexation of Crimea and were confirmed the following year in Syria, say analysts. “To many people’s surprise here, including mine, Russian actions [in Syria] were successful, efficient and cost effective,” Fyodor Lukyanov, editor-in-chief of Russia in Global Affairs magazine, said in a recent interview at Pittsburgh university’s centre for international studies.Syria also served as a test bed for precision missile strikes and unmanned vehicles and as a training ground for more than 60,000 personnel, including officers.“Serdyukov’s experience is the rule rather than the exception,” said Henry Boyd, a military expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. “Russia has a deep front bench of senior commanders.”The reforms have not always matched the ambitions, say analysts. Shortages of skilled personnel and high-tech components, especially advanced chips, have delayed deliveries of next-generation equipment. “Have you heard of many cases where our people went to study at, say, MIT and then returned to Russia? I haven’t,” Pukhov said.Even so, military experts say, Russia’s modernised forces are capable of delivering a massive dose of blunt force. “Russian missiles may not be precise enough to target the top right-hand window of a building, as the US and it allies can. But they are still accurate enough to blow up the whole building,” said Samuel Cranny-Evans, a military sciences analyst at the Royal United Services Institute.With Ukraine, Russia has also retained an element of surprise. By parking equipment against the border, which can then be manned by troops brought quickly forward, Kofman said, the scope and timing of any final operation would not be revealed until late into preparations.“If the VDV starts surging forces to take position near Ukraine’s borders, that’s a good indicator that they’re planning for an offensive,” Kofman added.
521  The EU will on Wednesday outline a more aggressive approach to setting global standards for cutting-edge and green technologies in a concerted effort to counter the influence of China.Margrethe Vestager, the bloc’s competition chief, told the Financial Times the new strategy was designed to ensure Europe continued to set international benchmarks that guided the development of everything from facial recognition systems, advances in battery power and the next generation of environmental innovations.“This is strategic,” said Vestager. “It’s really, really important who sets the standards because they should enable a market to work, but not to make innovation difficult.” She added the EU wanted to implement the plan “as fast as possible”.The emerging strategy is important as companies seeking to enter the EU’s internal market have had to satisfy the region’s tough rules, often forcing countries around the world to adopt Europe’s approach to regulating products and services.But China has shown an increasing appetite to set international standards on important technologies, such as the rollout of 5G mobile networks, following advances made by tech giants such as Huawei.EU and US officials have grown concerned that China has become successful at lobbying key technology standards-setting bodies, such as the International Telecommunication Union and the International Electrotechnical Commission, in ways that could provide an edge to its local champions.As part of the EU’s plans, European officials will work alongside US authorities on a new monitoring system on emerging standards, a method to have a unified position on tech rulemaking. They also plan to use joint resources to ensure start-ups are aware of coming standards, while relying on experts to foresee coming technological developments.The US and EU will meet regularly through the Trade and Technology Council, an existing grouping of top transatlantic officials, to iron out details on how the co-operation will work.To illustrate the challenge, Vestager pointed to China’s earlier efforts to redefine the basic standards for the internet, which would give state-run internet service providers more control over the way people surf the web.She cited that move as an example of how Beijing could take a lead on crucial technology standards that run counter to the approach of western governments and its tech companies.“When you work from a standard that is your benchmark and if that standard is set in a vibrant, democratic market economy, you get one [global] standard that will work,” Vestager said.Beijing has also been drafting a fresh strategy entitled “China Standards 2035” as it seeks to become a setter of international rules in fields such as 5G and artificial intelligence.As part of plans to counter these moves, Brussels will “urgently” develop standards for important technologies and environmental challenges, according to draft proposals seen by the FT.“Europe’s competitiveness, technological sovereignty and promotion of EU values, highest social and environmental ambitions will depend on how successful European actors are at international level,” the document stated.
522  Russian scientists once considered detonating a nuclear explosion as the best way to start mining at Udokan, one of the world’s largest untapped copper resources.That was in 1965, and technology has moved on, but the deposit — 400km north of the Chinese border in the permafrost of eastern Siberia — still represents a formidable challenge to geologists and engineers. An entire mountaintop has to be removed, and a way found to extract and refine complex copper ore.Now, though, rising prices and expectations of growing demand are pushing miners to place huge bets on Udokan and another remote Siberian copper reserve, as Russia eyes a chance to develop hard-to-reach resources and become one of the biggest producers of the industrial metal.The plans show how Russia, highly dependent on its vast fossil fuel resources, is trying to develop more resources associated with renewable energy and the revolution in electric vehicles.“On a 10-20-year horizon, I believe the share of green energy metals in Russian exports will have to grow at a higher rate compared with the share of oil and gas,” said Yulia Buchneva, a Moscow-based metals analyst at Fitch Ratings.Alisher Usmanov, one of Russia’s richest men, acquired Udokan via his USM Holdings company in 2008 and backed the development of new technology to extract its copper. Developing the mine will require about $7bn of investment. It is set to go into production in 2022 and raise annual production to 400,000 tonnes by 2026.“At the moment, there are no projects coming up as large as this one,” Valery Kazikayev, chair of Udokan Copper’s board, said on a recent visit to the mine. “By output, we will be among the top 10 copper producers globally.”Udokan, said Kazikayev was the last known global opportunity for a mine with significant copper content, above 1 per cent of the rock on average. “There are some [mines] being developed today with 0.3 per cent content,” he added.At Baimskaya, an even more remote project in the Chukotka region of the Arctic tundra, Kaz Minerals is working on another ambitious investment.Baimskaya is 3,000km away from the nearest railroad and 700km away from the nearest port. It needs not only roads and a new port; its power will have to come from floating nuclear power plants in the Arctic Ocean. The port might also need its own icebreaker to keep a sea route open.Despite state help and tax breaks, Kaz Minerals has already raised its estimated investment for Baimskaya by half to $8.5bn.“We have simple ore, but we have other problems, such as logistics,” Oleg Novachuk, the company’s chief executive, told the Financial Times. “I did not realise there would be this many infrastructure issues when buying the project, but we wouldn’t sell it anyway as our company has experience in managing challenges.”The mine is expected to open in 2027 and produce 300,000 tonnes of copper and nearly 500,000 ounces of gold annually over a decade.Russia has more copper reserves than any country bar Chile and Peru, the number one and two producers globally, according to its natural resources ministry. But it has only been able to mine its biggest assets when the price of a tonne of copper has risen significantly above its long-term average, as is the case now.The new projects, as well as continued growth at Norilsk Nickel, will allow Russia to more than double its annual output to above 2mn tonnes by 2030 and become the world’s fourth-largest producer, surpassing the US and China, according to the ministry.It would mean Russia playing a much bigger role in copper markets. Alexander Chernykh, head of the ministry’s research institute for base and precious metals, reckons Russia will export around 700,000 tonnes more of the metal each year.Not everyone believes copper is headed for a prolonged period of high prices that would make investments such as Udokan and Baimskaya easier to justify.Rather, some investors and analysts believe the recent boom — prices hit a record high above $10,500 a tonne in May — is cyclical and can be explained by the post-pandemic economic recovery. They believe prices will soften because of slowing growth in China, the world’s biggest consumer of industrial metals.And while few doubt the copper market will face long-term problems — analysts at BMO Capital Markets forecast a supply shortfall of several million tonnes — substitution with cheaper aluminium and increased use of scrap in some products can help fill the gap.“Over the next couple of years there is, on paper at least, enough copper supply to meet the world’s needs,” said BMO analyst Colin Hamilton. “However, delivering on this supply is a perennial problem.”Executives at both Udokan and Baimskaya say that, at current copper prices, the investments are expected to pay off in about a decade. Udokan expects to break even at half the current price — which the company says gives it a buffer against market shocks.“If we look five years ahead, we are big optimists given the trend for a low-carbon economy. Electrification increases the share of copper in power-producing technologies — wind, solar, EVs,” said Kazikayev. “We foresee some price decrease, but the sustainable trend will only be upward.”Kirill Chuyko, chief analyst at BCS Global Markets in Moscow, said Russia would become one of the main global suppliers of copper.“The current copper price reflects the inefficiencies of copper projects in the world, primarily geological problems,” Chuyko said. “Russian producers are doing their best to squeeze out the maximum of the current situation.”Additional reporting by Neil Hume in London
523  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
524  Her Royal Highness Crown Princess Mary of Denmark enters the study from her next-door office. She is dressed in black trousers and an emerald-green bishop-sleeve blouse with rigorous cuffs, her mahogany hair polished and pristine. She is warm but poised, ethereal but commanding, much like her surroundings. As the residence of the heirs to the Danish throne, the palace is a place of representation, and the princess well understands how her choices – of hairstyle, outfit or decorative scheme – will project. “A monarchy exists in the time and the society that it is a part of, and Danes are progressive and innovative and free-thinking,” she says. “How progress happens is dependent on the personalities of the people within the royal family, and, of course, the people they are among.”As crown princess, Mary is the future queen of Denmark. Australian by birth, she married Queen Margrethe II’s eldest son in 2004, and has been a consistent figure on the world stage ever since. If an appetite for public service was instilled in the Crown Princess from an early age, it came from academic circles rather than a childhood filled with high-profile fundraisers and galas. Mary Elizabeth Donaldson was raised worlds away from the elite schools, sports or society mixers that have shaped many of her princess peers in other countries. She was born in Hobart, Tasmania, 10,000 miles from Copenhagen, in 1972. Her father is John Dalgleish Donaldson, an applied mathematics professor and Scottish fisherman’s son, who emigrated to Australia in 1963 with her late mother Henrietta, who was an executive assistant at the University of Tasmania. (Today, he is married to the English suspense novelist Susan Moody.)Mary grew up immersed in outdoor sports. She got a BA in commerce and law and worked in advertising in Melbourne and Sydney but, after the sudden death of her mother, she quit and went backpacking around the world. She met Crown Prince Frederik, now 53, in a bar during the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Today, they live in the palace with their four children, Prince Christian, 16, Princess Isabella, 14, and the twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine, 11. In the vestibule next to the study, artist Jesper Christiansen’s Matrix-like world-map mural serves as testimony to the couple’s geographically diverse backgrounds.If Australia is the new world, the Crown Princess couldn’t have found a greater contrast than Denmark, one of the oldest monarchies whose bloodline can be traced back to the 10th-century Viking, Gorm the Old. Since 1513, the kings of Denmark have alternated between the names Christian and Frederik. When her husband ascends to the throne, he will be the 10th Frederik to do so. Vestiges of formal tradition surround. A footman in white livery serves us coffee in white-fluted cups with bespoke gold rims from Royal Copenhagen. A neat stack of paper napkins carry the couple’s cypher, an interlocked F and M. Outside, bearskin-wearing royal guards have put their red overcoats on for the January rain. They’re marching along one of four identical buildings that form the octagonal Amalienborg Palace on the harbour of Copenhagen. Across the square is the winter residence of the 81-year-old Queen Margrethe II, the world’s third-longest reigning monarch after Queen Elizabeth II (her third cousin) and the Sultan of Brunei.Growing up, the young Mary wasn’t what you’d call a royal-watcher. “I was very aware that Queen Elizabeth was our head of state and that we were part of the Commonwealth, but day to day I wouldn’t say there was a great deal of presence unless there was an official visit or a wedding or a jubilee,” she says, two big books on Queen Elizabeth now firmly placed on the sideboard in her study. “Today. wow. I can only admire Queen Elizabeth and my own mother-in-law, the Queen of Denmark, for their lifelong commitment and dedication to serving their country and their people.” Her accent has taken on the flat intonation of Danish. She has mastered her adopted language and occasionally uses Danish words to express herself. When conversation switches to Danish, she uses the formal “you” – “De” rather than “du” – an elevated form of address sadly almost only observed by the royal family in present-day Denmark.The Danish royal family holds no jurisdictional authority, but remains symbolically important for the country: a “samlingspunkt”, as the Crown Princess puts it, using a Danish term she translates as meaning “unifying body”. Her husband is a dedicated sportsman who leads an annual public “Royal Run” around Denmark, and looks dashing in a naval uniform. His mother, the Queen, is a larger-than-life personality: a multi-talented artist with a good sense of sarcasm, generous with herself but preserving an almost baroque understanding of duty, ceremony and protocol within her hyper-creative life. She’s incredibly popular. According to a 2020 survey by Kantar Gallup, 84 per cent of the country – population 5.8 million – support the monarchy. “The monarchy is a unifying institution for the Kingdom of Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands, which also comes with a bit of glamour, pomp and circumstance,” explains Helle Thorning-Schmidt, who served as prime minister of Denmark for the Social Democrats between 2011 and 2015 and is married to the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock. “Even in a welfare state devoted to equality, we appreciate a touch of grandeur.” Maybe it’s the Hans Christian Andersen effect – the Little Mermaid statue is just down the marina from Amalienborg – but for all its social-democratic normality, Denmark doesn’t expect its heads of state to be just like you and me. The Queen presides over four palace residences, a hunting lodge, a château in France and a royal yacht, which is used for visits to the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Off-duty, the Crown Prince Couple guard their privacy. In 2009, when Oprah Winfrey was in Denmark filming a show, the media mogul confirmed to the Danish press that an interview request had been politely declined. The glamour that surrounds the Crown Princess has hardly diminished the media’s interest. During the week of black-tie events that preceded her wedding, and which formally introduced her to the Danes, she had them floored: one resplendent ballgown after another, paired with the exquisite ruby parure originally worn by Désirée Clary (later Queen of Sweden and Norway) for Napoleon’s coronation in 1804. “Very early on, it was clear that there were expectations about what you wore and how you dressed appropriately to an event,” says the Crown Princess who, for official duties, is now used to being bedecked in powder-blue moiré sashes, silver stars, white crosses and the diamond-encrusted Order of the Elephant badge. “That was pretty daunting for me. I was a T-shirt-and-shorts girl, known to go barefoot.” In subsequent years, she has demonstrated a decidedly modern approach to royal daywear, largely forgoing the territory’s skirt suits and dainty frocks for executive separates and streamlined silhouettes. “As the future queen, Her Royal Highness’s ability to dress both appropriate to her standing but modern at the same time has always struck me as particularly impressive,” says Sir Paul Smith, a long-time friend of Crown Prince Frederik. “She has the confidence to dress with the authority her role requires but in a way that feels relevant today. She’s always dressed like a princess but never dressed up like one. She could make ripped jeans look regal!” The Crown Princess isn’t afraid of wearing designers like Smith, either. Mary will casually mix Danish brands with Chanel, Prada and Hermès, and often wears young international designers such as Erdem too. “Her evening approach is not dissimilar to her approach during the day,” Erdem Moralioglu says. “There is something both regal and formal to her. She is absolutely appropriate for the event she is attending, and yet she always looks modern and beautifully relaxed.”In 2010, when asked his thoughts on the Duchess of Cambridge, Karl Lagerfeld replied that Catherine, 10 years Mary’s junior and similarly lithe and polished, could be her “younger sister”. The comparison is inevitable: especially now when, like the Crown Princess, the Duchess is using her public platform to steer the press attention away from her wardrobe to focus on her other causes. “At times it can feel frustrating that what you’re wearing can overshadow the cause at hand,” says the Crown Princess. “But I’m sensing and hoping that there’s a shifting focus, that there’s less focus on the outer than there has been.” Thirteen years ago, she participated in the first-ever Global Fashion Agenda, the Danish-led international sustainability summit, which has since become a frontrunner in the environmental conversation around fashion and boasted an extraordinary list of influential speakers. “Sustainability at that time was a relatively new focus,” she says of its success. “There’s been some progress, but an enormous transformation still has to occur. I look forward to the day that, when I buy a piece of clothing, sustainability is simply a gift with purchase.”If it was fashion that first got her projected onto the world stage, recent years have seen her turning to more humanitarian work. The Crown Princess has become a powerful advocate for women’s reproductive rights, maternal health, sexual and reproductive rights in developing countries and international LGBTI+ rights. Some of her causes are obvious, others more controversial as far as the geopolitical landscape goes. “I exist in a time when, yes, these areas are still debatable and conflict-full, but it’s a human right,” she says of her decision to front the LGBTI+ organisation WorldPride. “I fundamentally believe that we all have the right to be who we are regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation. Denmark is a strong voice on this issue, and I wanted to lend my voice to the cause.” Similarly, she has taken the lead in her work for women’s rights in developing countries. “I’ve always had a strong sense of justice: that everyone should have the same opportunities, no matter where you come from,” she says. The Crown Princess has been a diligent student of her calling. In the two years before the pandemic, she undertook more than 20 working trips: she went to Kenya with the gender-equality organisation Women Deliver, to Indonesia with the United Nations Populations Fund and to Ethiopia with the Danish minister for development cooperation. A talented speaker, she delivered passionate speeches at human rights summits, and served as patron for the World Health Organisation. Last year, she went to Burkina Faso to raise awareness around the plight of women affected by issues like genital mutilation, forced marriage, underage pregnancy and education barriers. “Understanding that inequality and lack of respect for human rights were root causes for maternal mortality – that still today, a woman can risk losing life by giving birth – was where my journey started.”On home turf, the Crown Princess has completed a military education for the Danish Home Guard in which she now holds the rank of captain, and she shares her husband’s affinity for sports. A keen equestrian, she has recently taken up dressage and has two horses, including a Danish warmblood, which she rides competitively. “It’s always been a happy place for me in the stables. It’s a place where I’m just Mary. It’s very meditative.” Her favourite spots in Denmark are in nature. “I find the forests very exotic, especially in the spring when the beech trees come into leaf. The North Sea coast reminds me of Tasmania, both when it’s wild and when it’s calm.” In Copenhagen, it was always “Rosenborg Castle, with its fairytale renaissance architecture”, she says of the 1606 masterpiece that first captured her heart.The Crown Princess has found affinities between Australia and Denmark, but does say that when she first arrived in Copenhagen, she sometimes felt she was too “direct”. “I searched forever to find the word ‘please’ in the Danish language,” she recalls, but the word doesn’t exist. Instead, her Australian candour has found an outlet in her causes.“She has emerged as a very progressive representative for Denmark, which is something welcomed by many of us,” Thorning-Schmidt says. “We have always had an internationally minded royal family, but the Crown Princess has brought to the Danish monarchy a very resolute internationalism by immersing herself in work of a big-scale and global nature.” Thorning-Schmidt experienced “The Mary Effect” first-hand when she became CEO of Save the Children International. “She represents a small kingdom, and in that sense, she has to work harder to get noticed internationally. I’ve seen the international response to her on numerous occasions, and people really listen to what she has to say.” Parallels to the People’s Princess are a given, but if Mary is the Danish Diana, it’s without the sombre subtext. The royal couple have an uncomplicated public image, and are happy to demonstrate their mutual love. Perhaps it’s also a little bit easier to be a royal in Denmark compared to other countries? “I can’t answer that because I don’t know what it would be like to be a royal in another country,” the Crown Princess replies.“We do protect them a little bit,” says Thorning-Schmidt of the public’s relationship with the royal family. “If they make the odd mistake, we make allowances. And that’s fair enough. A monarchy should be surrounded by a sense of ceremony and formality, and in Denmark we’re all quite good at preserving that.” The Crown Princess paints a pleasant image of her day-to-day life in Copenhagen: “The Danes are proud of the fact that their royal family can go around freely in society. Because of that, there is a natural respect of your space. If I go into Copenhagen, or out to eat, or to the cinema with my children, I feel like we are given the space to do so.” She became a princess at the dawn of camera phones and social media scrutiny. “The positive side is that it means we can communicate more directly. On the negative side, everyone, everywhere, anytime can take a photo or a video. But what can you do? I make eye contact with people and smile. If you go for a walk and your dog wants to talk to another dog,” she says, referring to the family’s border collie, Grace, “well, you talk to the person who’s got the other dog.” How to live with social media is an area at the forefront of the royal conscience. “It is now both a tool and a problem,” she says. “Social media can reinforce problems like bullying and loneliness, but we can’t always see it as the problem because it gives some unique channels to be able to reach out.”Through the Mary Foundation, the platform and research institute she established in 2007, the Crown Princess deals with societal issues like isolation, harassment and domestic violence. “Since I can remember, I’ve found it difficult seeing what I interpret as people being alone, looking in, not understanding why they can’t be a part of something bigger than themselves. I’ve always had a curiosity to truly understand a situation and its consequences. That’s my drive for doing what I do, and the platform from where I lead.” One day, her son Prince Christian will become Crown Prince and eventually King of Denmark. The royal family has announced they don’t expect “apanage” – the Danish equivalent of Civil List privileges – for their three younger children. Reflecting on the next generation, the Crown Princess says her concerns are related to the times in which we live. “You know, we have two teenagers in the house and teenage years are very transformative and vulnerable. It’s the years when you make mistakes, and mistakes are important. Hopefully you learn from them and get on the right path. So I hope that they continue to be given the freedom and space to make those mistakes and to come through those explorative years.” From the window of her study, a trampoline is vaguely visible in the palace garden. A family photo graces a chiffonier. “We hope that they grow up to be strong and independent individuals, who will have the courage to follow their aspirations,” she says of her ambitions for her children. “It’s important that they know who they are, are proud of who they are and the family they belong to, and what that family represents to the Danes.” Is that the secret to contemporary royal life? “I don’t think there’s a secret,” Crown Princess Mary says. “It’s being in touch and being close to the people: knowing what’s happening in society; which way are we heading; what are the new trends and challenges. It’s a natural, organic process that happens as generations come and go.” When it comes to creating a modern monarchy, it seems a Tasmanian candour can often speak a Danish truth.
525  Vladimir Putin has accused the US of seeking to hold Russia back by dragging it into a conflict over Ukraine while insisting he wanted talks with Washington and Nato to continue to avoid a “negative outcome”, such as war.In his first public comments in several weeks since the US warned that Moscow was massing more than 100,000 troops on the border, the Russian president said Ukraine was being used as a “tool” by Washington.“The US is not so much concerned about the security of Ukraine — although maybe they are thinking about it somewhere in the background — but their most important objective is to contain the development of Russia. This is what it is all about,” Putin said during a press conference with Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orban in Moscow.“It can be achieved in different ways. [They can] drag us into some kind of armed conflict and with the help of their allies in Europe impose against us the very tough sanctions that the US is talking about today.”Putin again accused western powers of ignoring Russia’s security concerns and said the US and Nato had disregarded his demand for a guarantee that Kyiv would not join the transatlantic alliance.“Let’s imagine Ukraine [becomes] a Nato member and starts these military operations. Are we supposed to go to war with the Nato bloc? Has anyone given that any thought? Apparently not,” Putin said.When asked about Putin’s comments on Tuesday, Jen Psaki, White House press secretary, said that the US did not know what “decision” Putin would make but added that the “door to diplomacy remains open”.“De-escalation will of course make that diplomatic path easier,” Psaki said.The statements came amid a flurry of diplomatic activity in recent weeks aimed at de-escalating the crisis. Visiting Kyiv on Tuesday, Mateusz Morawiecki, Poland’s prime minister, said he would send arms to Ukraine to help it fend off a potential full-scale Russian invasion. His visit was followed by that of UK prime minister Boris Johnson, who renewed the UK’s support for Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky.“As we stand here, Volodymyr, more than 100,000 Russian troops are gathering on your border in perhaps the biggest demonstration of hostility towards Ukraine in our lifetimes,” said Johnson, who also accused Putin of “holding a gun” to Ukraine’s head and attempting to “redraw the security map of Europe”.Poland’s prime minister said: “Our part of Europe does not suffer from earthquakes and volcano explosions, but despite this, living close to a neighbour like Russia, we have the feeling that we live near a volcano.”Putin also said he hoped dialogue would continue. Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, and Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, spoke by phone, their first conversation since Washington sent a written response to Moscow’s security demands last week. Russia sent its own follow-up to the US submission on Tuesday, though US officials said they were awaiting a formal written response.Blinken “emphasised the US willingness, bilaterally and together with allies and partners, to continue a substantive exchange with Russia on mutual security concerns, which we intend to do in full co-ordination with our partners and allies,” the state department said.“I considered my visit a peace mission,” Orban said in Moscow. “I was able to tell the president that the European Union is unified and there is not a single EU leader who wants conflict with Russia. That is especially true to us Central Europeans.”In a Facebook post, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, suggested that a new trilateral security “format” between Ukraine, the UK and Poland would help bolster Kyiv’s defences and security. “We cannot expect security and prosperity somewhere in the future when we become members of the EU and Nato. We need them today,” Kuleba said.The Polish arms shipment came after the UK provided Ukraine with thousands of NLAW anti-tank busters and other equipment last month. The US last year provided a record $650mn in military assistance to Ukraine, on top of $2.7bn it has supplied since the war in the country’s east erupted in 2014.Earlier on Tuesday Zelensky said Ukraine would add 100,000 professional troops to its 261,000-strong armed forces, and boost army salaries over the next three years.The US and Ukraine’s other western backers fear Russia’s troop build-up could be preparation for an invasion or deeper incursions on top of Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and the fomenting of a proxy separatist war in eastern regions of the country.The US state department also ordered family members of US diplomats to leave Belarus amid growing concerns over an “unusual and concerning Russian military build-up” on Belarus’s border with Ukraine.Additional reporting by Marton Dunai in Budapest
526  Investors are betting that persistently high inflation will force the European Central Bank to raise interest rates more than once this year, in a challenge to the central bank’s insistence that it expects to freeze rates at historical lows at least until next year.Markets have this week pulled forward expectations of tighter policy, with an increase in the ECB’s deposit rate to minus 0.25 per cent — from its current rate of minus 0.5 per cent — now priced in by December, according to trading in short term funding markets.This implies that traders expect at least two 0.1 percentage point rate rises, with the shift in pricing coming before members of the bank’s governing council are due to meet on Thursday to discuss monetary policy.Markets had priced in a much smaller rise to minus 0.4 per cent by the end of the year before last week’s hawkish US Federal Reserve meeting, which triggered a fresh round of speculation that the ECB would be forced to follow the Fed this year by increasing borrowing costs.The growing conviction in markets that eurozone rates are set to rise for the first time since 2011 comes despite Christine Lagarde’s repeated rejection of calls for earlier tightening. The ECB president said last month that the central bank had “every reason not to act as quickly or as ruthlessly” as the Fed.“The ECB has stuck to the mantra of no rate hikes this year, but the market is clearly challenging that view,” said Richard McGuire, a rates strategist at Rabobank. “Investors think the ECB might get spooked by this shift in inflation.”Inflation has been exceeding the ECB’s expectations for several months and hit a record high in the eurozone of 5 per cent in December. A report due on Wednesday is expected to show that the pace of inflation eased to 4.4 per cent last month. But after readings on German, Spanish and French inflation exceeded expectations in January, economists have said price pressures seemed likely to continue overshooting ECB forecasts this year.Nadia Gharbi, senior economist at Pictet Wealth Management, predicted wage growth would increase this year after the bloc’s unemployment rate hit an all-time low of 7 per cent in December and a quarter of EU companies reported labour shortages — a new high. “It will be quite a tough period for the doves at the ECB right now,” she said.Rate-rise expectations rekindled a sell-off in eurozone bonds this week, pushing Germany’s 10-year borrowing cost — a key benchmark for assets across the currency bloc — above zero. German two-year yields, which are highly sensitive to rate expectations, have climbed sharply since last week to a six-year high of minus 0.48 per cent on Tuesday, rising above the ECB’s deposit rate for the first time since 2015.On Thursday, Lagarde is expected to be pressed on whether she still thinks eurozone inflation will fall below the ECB’s 2 per cent target in the fourth quarter and if the central bank remains “very unlikely” to raise interest rates this year.Spyros Andreopoulos, a senior European economist at BNP Paribas who used to work for the ECB, has detected recent hints that the central bank’s policymakers were worried inflation might stay higher for longer.“They are slowly changing their mind and for good reason because what we are seeing is broad-based price pressure increasing,” he said, adding that if Russia invaded Ukraine it could cause a further surge in energy prices and push eurozone inflation above 6 per cent.Longer-lasting price pressures could spur the ECB to act sooner than it currently expects, according to some investors. “If inflation stays high, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to expect [the central bank’s bond-buying programme] to stop before the end of the year and then they could potentially hike in December,” said Gareth Colesmith, head of global rates at Insight Investment.
527  Unemployment in the eurozone fell to a record low of 7 per cent at the end of last year, underlining how the region’s labour market has bounced back faster than expected from the impact of the pandemic.The number of jobless people in the bloc dropped by 185,000 in the final month of 2021, taking the total number of unemployed people to 11.5mn, Eurostat announced on Tuesday.The 7 per cent unemployment rate in December fell from a downwardly revised 7.1 per cent in November — which itself matched the previous low of March 2020, just as the pandemic hit Europe. Growing numbers of businesses in countries such as Germany and France are reporting a shortage of workers as demand for goods and services increases.The improvement in the labour market was particularly strong among young people, as the jobless rate for those aged under 25 fell to a new all-time low of 14.9 per cent, down from 15.4 per cent the previous month.Youth unemployment has long been the scourge of the European labour market and peaked at 25 per cent during the region’s debt crisis in 2013.The biggest fall in youth unemployment over the past year was in Spain, where it dropped from 41 per cent in December 2020 to 30.6 per cent, although that only took it back to pre-pandemic levels. Among the bloc’s main economies, youth unemployment has fallen the furthest below pre-crisis levels in France, declining from 21 per cent in December 2019 to 17.6 per cent last month.“Some of the decline in unemployment appears to be down to people temporarily leaving the labour force as Covid restrictions were tightened to counter the Omicron variant,” said Jessica Hinds, senior Europe economist at Capital Economics, who estimated the bloc’s labour force shrank 0.2 per cent in December.“However, that is much less than in previous periods of tighter restrictions and should not detract too much from what has been a very full recovery that contrasts with developments in the US,” she added.The drop in Europe’s jobless rate came despite the end of most short-time work schemes introduced to mitigate the economic impact of coronavirus: the European Central Bank estimated only 1.8 per cent of workers were furloughed in October, versus 20 per cent in April 2020.Eurozone businesses are confronting unprecedented and widespread shortages of workers, according to the latest quarterly survey by the European Commission.About one-quarter of manufacturing and services businesses reported lack of workers as a factor limiting production in January, the highest proportion since data was first available in 1982.Eurozone wage growth remains subdued: two-year annualised growth in pay per employee was 1.8 per cent in the third quarter.However, the EU survey indicated that “the labour market is already tight and the remaining slack will diminish further by end-2022”, said Paul Hollingsworth, chief European economist at BNP Paribas, raising the chances of more substantial pay rises.“We expect wage growth to accelerate in the second half of 2022 and in 2023 due to the current spike in inflation, the increasingly tight labour market and more labour-oriented policies,” he added.Worker shortages are most acute in Germany, where they were reported by more than a third of businesses in the services and manufacturing sectors. In France, a record high 22 per cent of businesses lacked the staff they needed. In Italy’s and Spain’s services sectors, the proportion has risen to double-digits for the first time in history, the survey showed.Labour shortages were more common for businesses producing machinery, equipment and furniture, at about 30 per cent. But a quarter of companies in most industries, including cars, food production and textiles, struggled to find enough workers.
528  Mary Sarotte was studying in Berlin when the wall came down and shared our exhilaration as one east European country after another broke free of Moscow’s control, the Soviet Union collapsed and the cold war came to an end.Sarotte is now a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington; her latest book, Not One Inch, is the third of a trilogy which covers the story from that day to this. She writes with the advantage of 30 years of hindsight and access to many new documents. So does Vladislav Zubok, whose recently published Collapse is a deeply informed account of how the Soviet Union fell apart. Both can help us understand how we have once again come to the brink of a major armed stand-off between Russia and the west.Not One Inch is a riveting account of Nato enlargement and its contribution to the present confrontation. Sarotte tells the story with great narrative and analytical flair, admirable objectivity, and an attention to detail that many of us who thought we knew the history have forgotten or never knew: the essential contribution of the Hungarians towards the fall of the wall in November 1989, for example; or Russian President Boris Yeltsin’s advance warning to President Bill Clinton that he intended to make Vladimir Putin his successor. She ends with a bleak assessment of the damage inflicted on politics today. (Sarotte draws on my reports now in British archives; Zubok on my unpublished diary.)Sarotte’s central contention is that “animosity between Moscow and Washington over Nato’s future became central to the making of a post-cold war political order that looked much like its cold war predecessor”. Three months after the wall fell James Baker, US secretary of state, suggested a hypothetical bargain to the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. Nato would “not shift one inch eastward from its present position” once it had safely taken in a reunited Germany. Those words were never recorded in a mutually agreed formula. Gorbachev’s negotiating position was far too weak for him to insist on legal language. The Americans would never have agreed so to bind their hands anyway.But the Russians, not at all surprisingly, heard what they wanted to hear. They convinced themselves that Baker’s assurance, and others like it, amounted to a moral and political commitment. But under relentless US pressure, Nato’s borders nevertheless advanced until by 2004 they were within spitting distance of Russia and Ukraine. Very many Russians firmly believed that they had been grossly double-crossed.The origins for this grievance lie a lot further back. In 1985, painfully aware that their country was failing in the competition with the US, the Soviet leaders chose Gorbachev to put it back on track. He co-operated with President Ronald Reagan to end the cold war, opened up the country and gave it a limited form of democracy. But he was unable to manage the problems of empire and the collapsing economy.Russia’s weakness was America’s opportunity. Helped by the locals, the US reunited Germany inside Nato, freed the east Europeans, and encouraged the break-up of the Soviet Union. At the end of 1991 Gorbachev handed power to Yeltsin as president of a revived Russia. It was a moment of triumph for the west. For the Russians it brought national humiliation, domestic chaos and in places actual famine.Nato had justified the Americans’ dominant position in Europe. They had no intention of giving it up. Publicly they argued that Europe’s future security depended on Nato’s continued existence. In private they dismissed suggestions that Russia might become a full member. They set up the “Partnership for Peace” to associate Russia with Nato’s work: but they made it clear that Moscow would not have an equal voice in them.American bureaucrats who believed that Nato should expand to include the whole of eastern Europe drove their ideas with ruthless effectiveness. American soldiers rightly worried that the realities were being ignored: how could Nato offer a convincing military guarantee to so many new members on Europe’s periphery? Critics warned that enlargement could destroy Russia’s attempts at reform.Clinton made genuine efforts to square the circle by offering the Russians a combination of argument, charm and bribery, but his efforts were undermined by his own domestic weakness. Sarotte says that “it is hard to avoid the reality that alliance expansion added to the burdens on Russia’s fragile young democracy when it was most in need of friends”.Eastern Europeans, bullied for centuries by their large neighbour, did not believe that Russia would long remain flat on its back. For them it was painfully obvious that only Nato membership could guarantee their future. Many in the west, fuelled by guilt for previous betrayals — Munich, Yalta, Hungary, Prague — supported their desire to join the alliance as soon as possible. So did the descendants of Poles, Balts and others who lived in places crucial to the outcome of American elections.To Russians it looked very different. They too had welcomed the end of the nuclear confrontation. Many hoped that Gorbachev’s reforms would result in a “normal country”, where the state listened to their wishes but otherwise let them get on with their lives. They believed that the west would actively support their aspirations. Now they felt they had been deliberately misled, that the Americans had conspired to break up their country. Some in Washington did indeed think that way: Sarotte and Zubok both provide evidence.Nato’s claims that it existed only to defend its members struck Russians as incredible, after America and its allies attacked first Serbia, then Afghanistan and Iraq. Many feared that Russia might be next, including my liberal Russian friends who had suffered under the Soviet regime and were glad to see it go. Western commentators still argue that most Russians had other things to worry about, such as surviving from day to day as their country fell apart. They oversimplify. The emotions were real. When Putin arrived on the scene he had little need to stoke them, though he has certainly exploited them for his own purposes.Ukraine could never have avoided getting caught in the crossfire. Sarotte records that western policymakers always understood that bringing it into Nato would eliminate the distance between the world’s most powerful military alliance and Russia itself, thus crossing the reddest of all Russia’s red lines. American hardliners nevertheless successfully inserted references to Ukraine’s membership into one Nato communique after another. Even they hardly believed that Ukraine would join in the foreseeable future.Sarotte wonders if it could have ended differently: perhaps the Partnership for Peace could have provided a path to a durable system of European security that could have also satisfied Russia. Zubok believes a more determined leader than Gorbachev could have managed the political, social and imperial problems in a way that would have left the Soviet Union intact.But as Russians say, history has no subjunctive case. We are where we are. The players could perhaps have made different choices. But they were constrained by their own characters, and by the combination of hard facts, high emotions, conflicting interests and the unyielding pressures of domestic politics. In the end the contradictions were fundamental. There was never a real hope of an alternative outcome.Now we have to deal with Putin’s Ukrainian gamble. In 1962 Nikita Khrushchev made a reckless attempt in Cuba to force the Americans to concede nuclear parity. He brought the world close to catastrophe and was compelled by US power into a humiliating retreat. Putin is now demanding a written guarantee that Nato will pull back, even though he must know that it would never pass the US Senate. Sensible commentators in Moscow point out that a military adventure in Ukraine would seriously damage Russia’s own interests. In the west many believe that we should not risk war over a country for which we have no responsibility. They dismiss the argument that abandoning yet another east European country could undermine our own security arrangements more widely.There is perhaps a chink. As he wriggled out of his Cuban escapade, Khrushchev managed to secure a verbal guarantee that America would respect Cuba’s sovereignty. America is still by far the most powerful country in the world, even though this time geography is against it. It is not beyond imagination that a determined America could secure through diplomacy rather than violence a guarantee for Ukraine at least as strong as the one Khrushchev got for Cuba.Not One Inch: America, Russia, and the Making of the Post-Cold War Stalemate by Mary Sarotte, Yale University Press, $35/£25, 568 pagesCollapse: The Fall of the Soviet Union by Vladislav Zubok, Yale University Press, £25, 560 pagesRodric Braithwaite was British ambassador in Moscow from 1988 to 1992.

529  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.The EU’s notorious troublemaker, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, is in Moscow to meet Russia’s President Vladimir Putin today, after a flurry of diplomatic contacts by EU and Nato allies seeking to keep him in line. We’ll look at the stakes and the sinuous history of Budapest seeking to stay friends with Moscow while not completely alienating Brussels.Meanwhile, in Kyiv, EU commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis went to Ukraine yesterday to show support (and remind everyone that €1.2bn are coming soon, or at least, half of that sum) — while the prime minister of the Netherlands is also headed to Ukraine after a stop in neighbouring Moldova.In Portugal, the centre-left held up surprisingly well in Sunday’s election, allowing Prime Minister António Costa to rule alone, without the disruptive far-left coalition partner that triggered the election in the first place. However, the far-right Chega party also scored better than expected, coming in third.And in Swiss-EU news, I’ll take you through the latest twist — why the German Bundesländer are throwing a spanner in the EU’s decision last year to no longer recognise Swiss market authorisation for medical devices.Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orban is set to meet Vladimir Putin, Russian president, in Moscow today, amid concerns about his ambivalent stance in the Ukraine crisis, writes Marton Dunai in Budapest.Budapest has stressed business development and stayed clear of raising any human rights issues in Russia — at the same time as Orban has received an increasing amount of heat from western partners.“Obviously, we cannot avoid talking about the security situation in Europe,” Orban said over the weekend. “We are interested in peace. Of course, Hungary is a member of Nato.as I am going to Moscow I will consult with both Nato and the (EU), as well as the key politicians who have the presidency of the Union.”Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg tweeted yesterday that he had a “good call” with Orban ahead of his trip to Moscow, urging Russia to de-escalate the situation and “choose a peaceful path”.“In times of peace [and] crisis, we are united in Nato,” Stoltenberg tweeted.Ben Wallace, the UK’s defence minister, who visited Budapest yesterday, also expressed support for Orban’s trip and said he welcomed any efforts aimed at de-escalating the conflict and standing up for the sovereignty of Ukraine.But the constructive tone masks deeper disagreements with Hungary over how to react to Russia’s aggressive stance, given that Orban’s record on standing up for Ukraine is patchy, at best.After the 2014 invasion of Crimea, Orban argued the west was shooting itself in the foot by imposing economic sanctions on Russia — although he voted in favour of the EU sanctions later on.Orban had signed a finance-and-build agreement with Russia’s nuclear monopoly Rosatom for the expansion of Hungary’s main electricity producer, the Paks nuclear power plant, weeks before the invasion.In 2017, when Ukraine passed a law restricting the use of minority languages in its schools and later further passages such as restrictions on holding public office for holders of foreign passports — such as thousands of ethnic Hungarians in western Ukraine — Budapest blocked Ukraine’s European Union and Nato membership talks.Those moves come under a stark new light as Nato sends reinforcements to Ukraine and beefs up its presence along its eastern flanks, increasing troops and equipment levels.Hungary’s foreign minister said Budapest would not send help to Ukraine under the circumstances. And despite early news of Nato deploying troops in Hungary as part of the build-up, the government signalled at the weekend that it would not take in further troops.Speaking alongside Wallace yesterday, Hungary’s defence minister Tibor Benko repeated his government’s stance that right now, there was no need for a Nato deployment. Budapest was not against Nato deploying troops in allied countries near Ukraine, Benko said, but he stressed that Hungary was able to “perform this task on its own”.Hungary’s opposition, meanwhile, decried the timing of Orban’s visit and said it was “simply treasonous to go to Moscow” in the current circumstances.Fossil fuels still accounted for 37 per cent of the bloc’s electricity production in 2021 and new renewable power plants in the EU mainly replaced expensive gas power rather than more polluting coal, according to analysis by Ember, a London-based energy think-tank. (More here)To the dismay of mainstream politicians, Chega, a far-right populist party founded less than three years ago, emerged as the third-largest political force in Portugal’s parliamentary election on Sunday, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon.If the contest between the two biggest parties — the victorious Socialists (PS) of Prime Minister António Costa and the centre-right Social Democrats (PSD) — had turned out differently, André Ventura, Chega’s vociferous leader, would now be demanding a role in government.However, Costa’s unexpected success in winning an absolute majority has ruled out the possibility of a right-of-centre majority supporting a coalition government in which Ventura had implausibly said he would seek a ministerial post.The rapid rise of Chega, whose name translates as “enough” and initially came with an exclamation mark, has unsettled Portugal’s traditional parties. Many had hoped the country would be immune to nationalist populism after enduring almost half a century of a rightwing dictatorship lasting into the 1970s.But Ventura, 39, a former TV football pundit and lawyer who began his political career as a local councillor for the PSD has tapped into public grievances over corruption, low pensions and similar issues. In an emotional victory speech in the early hours of Monday, he made clear the parliamentary style his new group of 12 MPs plans to adopt.“What a punch we’ve delivered tonight,” he said. “There’ll be no more floppy opposition to Costa and the PS from now on.” Ventura, elected in 2019, had previously been Chega’s only MP and remains its only public face.The party is affiliated with Identity and Democracy, a far-right group in the European parliament, and is supported by Santiago Abascal, leader of Spain’s hard-right Vox party, and Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s Rassemblement National, among other rightwing populist figures,Ventura, who has been fined for stigmatising Portugal’s small Roma community, upholds policies including life imprisonment for violent crimes, chemical castration for paedophiles, a single income tax rate and cutting the number of political posts by half.His party is unlikely to have much success in parliament with these issues, but is expected to make a lot of noise about them.When weighing up EU solidarity against the needs of local hospitals, Germany’s devolved health authorities are tilting towards the latter.Last month, health authorities in Germany’s 16 states replied favourably to a request from the country’s medical technology suppliers to continue to import devices authorised on the Swiss market.These include high-tech surgical devices and oxygen supply, storage and distribution systems for hospitals — particularly sought after in the pandemic. Germany is the largest market for Switzerland’s medtech sector, according to trade group MedTech Europe, which said Germany’s hospitals had been complaining about difficulties not just in purchasing new devices, but also in servicing existing machines and getting new supplies for them.“The [European Commission’s] conscious decision to leverage the medtech sector in the midst of pandemic was unfortunate,” said Jesús Rueda Rodríguez, director for international affairs with MedTech Europe.Back in May 2021, the commission pulled the plug on automatic recognition of medical devices that were authorised on the Swiss market, as a consequence of the complete breakdown in EU-Swiss talks.The commission recently said it has asked Berlin for more information and continues to stand by its decision. “That interpretation is not in line with the commission’s position,” said commission spokesperson Stefan De Keersmaecker.The federal health ministry in Berlin meanwhile is pointing to state authorities having the power to implement EU legislation in this case and says that if all dialogue fails, affected stakeholders and the commission can take legal action.
530  The US and European allies are preparing what is being described on both sides of the Atlantic as the most aggressive package of economic and financial sanctions ever assembled to punish Russian president Vladimir Putin if he approves an invasion of Ukraine.The hope in western capitals is that the mere threat of these measures will be enough to deter Putin from attacking Ukraine in the first place — and if that fails, to pound Moscow with so many economic weapons that it will weaken the Kremlin’s resolve.So what measures specifically are the US and the EU prepared to impose?In recent days, the US and the UK have escalated plans to punish Putin’s inner circle by taking aim at Russia’s economic elite and the money it has parked in the west.Senior Biden administration officials said they have now drawn up “specific sanctions packages” focused on Russian oligarchs and their family members. They would not say who would be on the list, because of concerns about “flight risk”, but the scope could be broad. US officials said some names would be drawn from a classified list of potential targets sent by Treasury to Congress in 2018.Given how many Russian oligarchs have assets and other financial interests in the UK, support from Britain has been crucial to US efforts, and senior Biden administration officials have touted their co-ordination with London on the individual sanctions packages.On Monday, the UK vowed to introduce new legislation strengthening London’s ability to target Kremlin-linked businesses and their owners in the country.The EU is also drawing up a list of individuals to be hit with personal sanctions such as asset freezes and travel bans, but has in the past demanded a higher burden of proof for inclusion in such lists than the US, given the ability for those affected to mount legal challenges in European courts.The US and the EU also want to strike at the heart of the Russian banking system and cut Moscow significantly out of the international financial system, having failed to do so following the 2014 annexation of Crimea.Russia’s largest financial institutions, including Sberbank, VTB, Gazprombank, The Russian Direct Investment Fund and Alfa Bank, are all in the line of fire.Meanwhile, the US and its allies have also been debating excluding Russia from Swift, the international payments network, which would further complicate the ability of Russian banks to interact with the west.But the EU is less supportive of this step, given the potential fallout on the service’s reputation, and how any disconnection might be perceived by third countries. One EU official said disconnecting Russia was seen “as a last resort”, and that it may be more effective to use targeted financial sanctions that, for instance, prevent lenders from converting roubles into dollars.US officials said last week there was growing “convergence” with EU allies on both the severity and the immediacy of the financial sanctions, noting that they would aim to hit both existing and new financing.Some EU states have also called for Russia’s access to the IMF’s Special Drawing Rights — which act as reserve currency — to be frozen, according to documents seen by the FT.The US and the EU have discussed imposing very stringent export controls on western technology in order to inflict as much damage as possible to Russia’s industrial base and its capacity to innovate.Traditionally, export controls have been used as a means to prevent sophisticated weaponry from getting into the hands of geopolitical adversaries. However, the US and many European countries have expanded the measures to include emerging technologies such as quantum computing and artificial intelligence.According to people familiar with the Biden admin’s thinking, one of the most potent tools the US could deploy in this realm is the so-called “foreign direct product rule”, which was used to rein in Chinese technology company Huawei. The rule would prevent third countries from exporting certain sensitive technologies containing US components to Russia.“Export controls deny something to Russia that it needs and can’t easily replace from anywhere else,” a senior Biden administration official said last week, adding: “What we’re talking about are sophisticated technologies that we design and produce that are essential inputs to Russia’s strategic ambitions.”Arguably the most politically and economically sensitive arena in which the US and the EU are preparing sanctions is the energy sector. Moscow is heavily reliant on energy exports as a source of foreign reserves, and the EU relies on Russian gas for 40 per cent of its consumption. Meanwhile, America is concerned about high energy costs stoking inflation ahead of the midterm elections.Yet the US and its allies have been debating using unprecedented measures to impose sanctions on oil and gas producers as well as Russian companies in the mining sector.Despite some uncertainty over the position of the new German government, the US and the EU have determined that if Russia decides to invade Ukraine, they would stop the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline linking Russia and Germany from becoming fully active. This would be a major blow to Moscow and could also lead to significant economic pain in Germany.However, the EU’s reliance on Moscow means there is also significant scope for potential countermeasures. Brussels is particularly concerned about a possible collapse in gas supplies in the event of a war, either because of damage to Ukrainian pipelines supplying Europe or Russia moving to restrict gas supplies.
531  “Spring is coming,” said Irish prime minister Micheál Martin last month as he scrapped almost all Covid-19 restrictions and announced that Ireland had “weathered the Omicron storm”.Away from the easing of the coronavirus pandemic, though, his fractious government has far less reason for optimism — and Martin has entered a political autumn.Having agreed that he would step down this December, he has entered his last year as Taoiseach at the helm of a coalition that has lost popularity after scandals and is struggling to show progress on intractable pre-pandemic problems such as housing and healthcare.The government’s unpopularity has prompted questions about whether the pact involving Ireland’s two traditional ruling parties — Martin’s Fianna Fáil and Leo Varadkar’s Fine Gael — as well as the Greens can last until the next elections, which are not due until February 2025.“The government is stable to the extent that none of the three parties can afford to face an election,” said Lucinda Creighton, a former Fine Gael minister and now a consultant. “But the longer they stay in government, history suggests the less popular they are going to be.They are in a rut.”Martin’s plan to depart this year is the consequence of an unprecedented arrangement hammered out after the 2020 election as a way to keep nationalist party Sinn Féin out of power. Under the deal, Martin will hand over to Varadkar, the Tánaiste or deputy prime minister. Varadkar was premier from 2017 until his party stumbled to third place at the 2020 election.But Fine Gael has been plummeting in opinion polls and has struggled to shake off a series of scandals. The most recent is “Flutegate” — a champagne celebration in the foreign ministry to toast Ireland’s winning of a UN Security Council seat in June 2020. The celebration contravened Ireland’s Covid-19 guidelines at the time.“Flutegate” comes on top of other controversies, including “Golfgate” — a parliamentary golf society gathering in 2020 that was also against Covid-19 rules. It prompted resignations from attendees in both main parties, including Phil Hogan, then an EU commissioner. Two politicians are on trial over the event, charged with organising or allowing an event that breached Covid rules. They deny the charges.Varadkar is still being investigated by police over a leaked confidential government document relating to a new agreement for doctors — a matter over which he has apologised but denied having broken the law.“The optics [of the scandals] are terrible,” said Gary Murphy, a politics professor at Dublin City University. “I don’t think the public is obsessing about these issues but they do give a narrative that will be played on by Sinn Féin.”Fine Gael’s support peaked at 37 per cent in June 2020 and has plummeted to 20 per cent while Fianna Fáil has been flatlining on 20 per cent since June, according to an Ipsos/MRBI poll for the Irish Times published in December.By contrast, support for Sinn Féin, which has positioned itself with young and increasingly middle class voters as the party of change because of its promises to resolve Ireland’s crisis of unaffordable or unavailable housing, has rocketed to 35 per cent. Access to affordable healthcare is another voter concern, polls show.An Ireland Thinks poll for the Irish Independent this month found that respondents strongly favoured unspecified repercussions for the Flutegate affair and prosecutions related to the golf society event.For the parties of the coalition, their best way of connecting with voters may be to highlight Ireland’s economic resilience during Covid-19. Tax revenues hit an all-time high last year and headline gross domestic product is expected to have grown in 2021 by at least 14 per cent, or by at least 5 per cent according to a modified measure that strips out the impact of globalised companies on Ireland’s highly open economy.The government also wants to make good on ambitious housing and infrastructure plans. According to official data last week, home completions last year were just 0.5 per cent below their level in 2020, despite the closure of some building work in the spring because of Covid, and the number of apartments built increased by nearly one-third.Ed Brophy, a former adviser to Fine Gael finance minister Paschal Donohoe, said the coalition’s strategy was to “keep out Sinn Féin as long as possible and deal with the issues that are making Sinn Féin popular”.But energy price rises, feeding into broader inflation, will also further test the government’s ability to show that better times are on the way — even without any renewed Covid-19 surge.
532  In our recent piece highlighting the city spaces that bring joy to FT correspondents and writers, we asked you, our readers, to share the places that never fail to uplift you. Here are your responses.
533  It has been snowing in the Cyclades, a group of islands usually thought of in the context of sun-drenched summer holidays. In late January the entire archipelago got covered.Snow on Syros, the most populous island and my home since 2017, means one thing for the locals: packing their excited families into cars and driving up to the nature reserve in the north of the island, preferably before the police can get there and close off the only road. The Apano Meria region has comparatively high altitudes, and being the northernmost point, also gets the most snow.Happy children build snowmen and have snowball fights, dogs roll ecstatic around them. The parents can sit back and enjoy the spectacle from the warmth of their cars with flasks of hot chocolate or krasomelo (a type of mulled wine with honey and spices). The scenery is beautiful: hills, valleys and snow-covered terraces as far as the eye can see. Here and there, grape vines and olive trees stick out from the white expanse in regular patterns. Tinos, our neighbouring island with mountains twice the size of ours, glows in the distance like some marine mirage of the Alps.The Cycladic islands are not known for white winters but it is not unheard of that Mykonos, Santorini et al spend a few days under the cover of snow. Syros locals say it happens every five to 10 years; the last time was in 2015. Still, this is rare enough though for social media to fill with photos of snow-covered streets and church domes, of rulers showing the exact depth of the snow, of pawprints and footprints and people venturing outside wearing their entire wardrobes.Rare enough also for these islands to be unprepared in terms of snow-clearing equipment and general infrastructure: Cycladic authorities have announced “mandatory holidays” for almost everyone except pharmacies and supermarkets; public transport has been intermittent these days. There are only a few inches of snow, but the advice to stay at home makes sense on Syros. Most locals get around on scooters, and the island’s slippery marble roads are a hazard even in rain.Road-clearing efforts are concentrated around vital spots (the hospital, the port) but have also tried to cover the countryside, where farmers often need help reaching their hungry, frozen livestock. The fire department is on standby and spends a few days mostly as a hospital auxiliary, making sure that emergency cases or people in need of dialysis can safely get medical attention.One problem we don’t have is electricity: until a few years ago the island relied on a local power station, and blackouts were common in extreme weather conditions, but nowadays electricity is supplied via an underwater cable from the mainland. The only potential challenge is if some part of the infrastructure on a snow-covered hill needs maintenance; indeed, electricians braving the snowstorm and climbing up poles to attend to power lines is another frequently shared image.There has also been an outpouring of solidarity, of people thinking of those less fortunate. Local pharmacies are collecting blankets, warm clothes and electric heaters for anyone in need, and they are doing so sensitively, ensuring that these supplies can be delivered or picked up anonymously (reputation is everything in small communities, in particular for the older generations).People are encouraged to try and remember if they know anyone who might be living alone and be in need of help. Yet others are advising their neighbours about how to care for the island’s many stray cats, instructing them to improvise small snow shelters or to allow the animals to take refuge in basements and sheds, and to put out more food than usual. Every winter is a tough winter for the strays, since most of the beach restaurants that they rely on for food are closed. It’s a lean few months; they really could do without the snow.On Syros we don’t have winter tyres and most of us have very limited experience of driving in icy conditions. In snow years, people can panic on the way down from their frolicking in Apano Meria. The road has a sheer drop of a few hundred metres on one side, and any sign of the car sliding can be quite scary. So they park their cars in the middle of the road, leaving the fire brigade to step in and drive everyone home. For Syros kids, it’s a once in a childhood day out: the snowman, the snowball fight and the happy ride down a mountain in a fire truck.
534  The US stock market has suffered its worst start to the year since the global financial crisis, US and European allies are preparing what is being described as the most aggressive package of economic and financial sanctions ever assembled to punish Russian president Vladimir Putin, and Italian government bonds rallied as investors welcomed the re-election of Sergio Mattarella as president.US stock markets endure worst January since global financial crisisUS and European allies ready aggressive sanctions against RussiaDraghi gains vital time for policy revamp after Italy re-elects Mattarella as presidentSony buys video game maker Bungie for $3.6bn as dealmaking accelerates
535  Russia sent a new written response to the US on the Ukraine crisis on the eve of a planned call between the two countries’ top diplomats as the diplomatic process to defuse the prospect of armed conflict in Europe yielded some signs of life.The move followed a day of high tensions at the UN Security Council, with Moscow launching a blistering attack on the US for “whipping up hysteria” over a potential invasion of Ukraine amid repeated warnings from Washington that Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, is preparing to attack.“We can confirm we received a written follow-up from Russia. It would be unproductive to negotiate in public, so we’ll leave it up to Russia if they want to discuss their response,” a US state department spokesperson told the Financial Times.“We remain fully committed to dialogue to address these issues and will continue to consult closely with our allies and partners, including Ukraine,” the official added.Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, and Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, will speak by phone on Tuesday morning, their first conversation since the US sent its own written response to Russia’s security demands last week.“There is only one individual who from the Russian side can determine what Moscow does or does not do,” Ned Price, state department spokesperson, said ahead of the call, referring to Putin. “His response is the response that matters most to us.”The US has rebuffed Russia’s demands that Nato drop its open-door policy on countries that can join the alliance, but the exchanges have also focused on other issues such as troop deployments in eastern Europe, arms control and missile placements.During Monday’s UN security council meeting, Vasily Nebenzya, Russia’s ambassador to the UN, cast doubt on US intelligence assessments that Putin has amassed 100,000 troops on Ukraine’s border.“We have never cited that figure, we have never confirmed that figure.”Nebenzya also said there was “no proof” that a Russian invasion of Ukraine was imminent.He compared the US warnings to Colin Powell’s fateful appearance at the UN in 2003, when the late secretary of state laid out evidence that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. “They didn’t find any weapons,” Nebenzya said.“They are making heroes out of those people who fought on the side of Hitler who destroyed Jews, Poles, Ukrainians and Russians,” Nebenzya said of US support for Ukraine, without elaborating.The meeting in New York came amid a ratcheting up of tensions between Moscow and the west over a possible invasion of Ukraine, with Washington threatening to impose sanctions against Putin and his inner circle in the event of a military incursion. Russia and China had voted to block the meeting from taking place.Linda Thomas-Greenfield, US ambassador to the UN, accused Russia of “attempting, without any factual basis, to paint Ukraine and western countries as the aggressors to fabricate a pretext for an attack”.“In addition to military activity, we’ve also seen a dramatic spike in cyber attacks on Ukraine in recent weeks,” she said. “Russian military and intelligence services are spreading disinformation through a state on media and proxy sites.”Thomas-Greenfield defended the push to discuss the tensions at the UN, arguing that while diplomatic exchanges between Moscow and western capitals had taken place in private it was “now time to have a meeting in public”.However, she said that while the situation was “urgent” and “dangerous”, the US remained committed to solving the crisis through peaceful diplomacy.“We seek the path of peace. We seek the path of dialogue. We do not want confrontation. But we will be decisive and swift.should Russia further invade Ukraine,” Thomas-Greenfield said.She added: “We’re offering them an opportunity to address these concerns at the negotiating table. The test of Russia’s good faith in the coming days and weeks is whether they will come to that table and stay at that table until we reach an understanding.”On the military front, US officials warned that Russia’s preparations for a possible invasion continued.John Kirby, spokesperson for the Pentagon, said the US had seen additional Russian ground forces moving into Belarus and along the Ukrainian border, even over the weekend.Kirby added the US was also closely watching increased Russian naval activity in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean.US president Joe Biden has said he is prepared to send troops to Nato members on the eastern flank of the alliance to bolster their defences. Kirby said there were “active discussions” inside the administration and within Nato about those potential moves, noting troops would only be deployed if they were requested by allied countries.
536  Newly-installed renewable power in the EU mainly replaced expensive gas power rather than more polluting coal last year, according to analysis by an energy think-tank, and still fell short of what is required to limit global warming.Coal power in Europe was down just 3 per cent in 2021 compared with 2019 pre-pandemic levels, far less than the 29 per cent fall recorded in 2019 when compared with 2017 levels, according to Ember, the London-based non-profit organisation.The polluting fuel accounted for 15 per cent of EU electricity generation last year, compared with 22 per cent in 2017.In the first half of 2021 — before the supply crunch pushed up the price of gas — newly-installed renewables predominantly replaced coal and nuclear power. But from July, the new clean power almost exclusively replaced gas.EU power sector emissions that cause climate change would need to fall 6 per cent per year to reach the net zero level needed by 2035 but were reducing at about half that rate, Ember estimated.“The current gas crisis should be a huge wake-up call,” said Charles Moore, the report’s author. “Both coal and gas need to go; and fast.”Weaning the world off coal was a key promise made at November’s UN COP26 climate summit, and is seen as a key step in reaching global net zero emissions.“Action is needed to ensure Europe’s coal phaseout stays on track,” said Moore. “Legislation is the only way to guarantee that coal plants are closed by 2030. Volatile gas prices have made it clear that you cannot rely on market forces alone.”Fossil fuels accounted for 37 per cent of the EU’s electricity production in 2021, compared with 39 per cent in 2019. Renewables generated another 37 per cent, and nuclear made up the remainder.As gas prices climbed, power generators sought to replace the fossil fuel with renewables as well as with coal. Prices rose so high that it was more profitable for power generators to switch to coal even though that meant they had to buy more allowances at higher prices under the EU’s emissions trading scheme.The price of credits traded under the scheme, which allows the holder to emit a tonne of carbon for each credit, has almost tripled over the past year to around €90 per tonne of carbon.The slowdown in the coal phaseout meant EU power sector emissions were not on track to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, according to Ember’s analysis.The International Energy Agency has estimated that being on track for that goal would require power sector emissions to reach net zero by 2035 in advanced economies.Although EU countries including Spain and Greece have closed coal power stations since 2019, that has been mostly offset by increases in the use of coal in Poland.However, the bloc’s wind and solar power generated more electricity in 2021 than gas for the first time ever.The spike in energy prices has prompted some politicians and energy industry analysts to question the shift to renewable energy. But climate change experts have rejected the connection.“I think that is completely wrong,” said Lord Adair Turner, senior fellow at the Institute for New Economic Thinking. “What we are facing is a failure to go fast enough.What’s happened tells us just how vulnerable we are to the [fossil fuel system].”
0  ANDRII YATSKEVICH went to bed on March 1st in a Ukrainian city and woke up in a Russian-controlled one. A sailor born and raised in Kherson, a town in southern Ukraine just north of Crimea, Mr Yatskevich, contacted by phone, says that he checked social media to see security-camera footage of several dozen Russian vehicles parked outside the city administration building. The mayor of Kherson had posted that residents should stay at home, and that the town would need a miracle to restore light, gas, water and heat and to collect the dead.After one week of a war that has killed more than 2,000 Ukrainian civilians, according to the Ukrainian government, Vladimir Putin now has a territorial trophy to show for it. A city of 285,000 people, Kherson is the first regional capital and by far the largest town that Russian forces have taken and held. Elsewhere his war machine has failed to make quick inroads and is already resorting to barbarism. Fresh videos on March 2nd of attacks on government buildings and in residential areas in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city, showed bloodied corpses lying in the streets, suggesting that such horrors are not an aberration but a new reality.Meanwhile in the south, Russia is seizing smaller towns along Ukraine’s southern coast. Berdyansk and Melitopol are in Russian hands. These two towns were particularly vulnerable to Russian takeovers, and not just because Crimea is nearby. Kremlin-friendly officials have held important jobs in local government since independence in 1991, and unlike in the Ukrainian-held half of the Donbas region, these places never sidelined them after 2014, says Denis Bihunov, a political scientist. In Kherson, the local police phone line rings unanswered. Rumours swirl that officers have relocated to Mykolayiv, the next town along the coast.One goal of the advance is, almost certainly, to create a “land bridge” connecting the Russian-speaking Donbas, and Russia itself, with Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. Another goal may be to take Odessa, Ukraine’s third-largest city and a major port, which would cut Ukraine off entirely from the sea. Control of the region around Kherson also gives Russia control of a canal which brought fresh water from the Dnieper river to Crimea, but which Ukraine shut off after Russia annexed the peninsula in 2014. It could also act as a waystation for an ongoing northward push along the Dnieper river towards strategically important cities like Zaporizhia and Dnipro. In Enerhodar, a town of 50,000 that is home to Europe’s largest nuclear power station, hundreds of locals assembled to block the streets as incoming Russian forces approached.To achieve its aims, Russia will need to hold its new turf. Can it do that? Russian troops will grow more vulnerable if they thin out over ever more occupied territory, leaving those holding the fort vulnerable to counter-insurgency efforts, says Rob Lee of King’s College London. Hostility toward the invaders is pervasive. One video in now-occupied Kherson shows a brave citizen running with a Ukrainian flag in each hand across the town square, metres from tanks’ turrets. In Berdyansk, social-media footage shows citizens gathering outside lines of Russian troops to chant “go home”. Others sense danger. Many residents in occupied Kherson are scared to go outside. “We have the armed forces of Ukraine and they protect us, I believe in them. Civilians being killed will not help,” texts one Kherson resident who wishes not to be named. Russian soldiers appear to have orders not to fire on civilians unless attacked. But not everywhere. In Konotop, a town in Ukraine’s north-east, Russian troops threatened to destroy the city unless it surrendered. There Russian troops shot and wounded the father of one of Mr Yatskevich’s friends, he says, as he went to protect his shop from looting by Russian troops. Worsening food shortages could make residents more desperate. The deputy mayor of Mariupol warns of an impending “humanitarian catastrophe” in his city, which has been surrounded by invading forces.These scenes in the south are an illustration of how brutal Russian tactics have become. Less than 100km to the south-east is Crimea, which Russia managed to seize in 2014 without spilling blood. Many Ukrainians with pro-Russian sympathies used to think that a rapprochement between the two countries was possible. After just one week of this war, “for  my friends that hope is already dead”, says Mr Yatskevich. Many reports suggest that the Russian rank-and-file are not happy, either. Many seem bewildered when they realise how unwelcome they are. Some have abandoned their tanks, undamaged. Western spooks say some have punctured their own fuel tanks to avoid having to advance. But the invading army is still huge, and much better equipped than Ukraine’s defenders. And it seems to have orders to bombard Ukraine into submission, city by civilian-filled city. Kherson, and several other southern Ukrainian towns around which Russian troops are fighting today, were founded on the orders of Catherine the Great. In 1793, in a tribute to her territorial conquest across Ukraine, the Russian tsarina had a commemorative medallion struck in her honour which said: “I have recovered what was torn away.” For Mr Putin, Kherson is just the first step. He will want more.
1  THE RUSSIAN attack on Grozny, Chechnya’s capital, in December 1994 was like “a great iron hand swooping down from the sky and crushing and tearing to pieces innocent people at random,” wrote Anatol Lieven, a journalist who was in the city at the time. The highest rate of fire in Sarajevo, during the Bosnian war, was 3,500 shells per day; the figure in Grozny reached 4,000 per hour. “Every morning when we got up,” recalled Mr Lieven, “a malign giant had taken another bite out of the familiar streets.” The great iron hand is now back, and it is devouring the streets of Ukraine. After botched attempts to seize Kharkiv with small detachments, Russia began bombarding the city with shells, rockets and cluster munitions—which release small bomblets over a wide area—on Monday, inflicting heavy civilian casualties. On the morning of March 1st a missile struck Freedom Square, the centre of the city, outside government offices, causing a huge fireball. Oleh Synehubov, the head of the regional government, called it a “treacherous war crime”. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, called it “naked terror”. The mayor of Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov, said his city was being “pounded” with shells, rockets and air strikes. And British defence intelligence reported that Russia had increased its use of artillery north of Kyiv and in Chernihiv, a city north-east of the capital. Kyiv itself was hit, but not as heavily as had been feared.Russia’s resort to artillery and missile fire is unsurprising. Indirect fire—hitting a target which is not in your line of sight—has been an integral part of warfare for centuries. But in the 1990s and 2000s, many Western armies began substituting precision-guided munitions for traditional artillery. Russia hung on to its guns. “Artillery has long held pride of place in the Tsarist and Soviet ground forces and [that continues] today,” wrote Lester Grau and Charles Bartles, experts on Russian military power, in a paper in 2018. Russia has almost 5,000 artillery weapons, ranging from field artillery that needs to be towed, self-propelled howitzers like the Msta, multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS) like the Grad, Uragan and Smerch, and longer-range missiles like the Iskander, which can travel up to 500km.More importantly, the ratio of artillery to other units in its combat formations is unusually high. An American brigade combat team, of around 4,000 soldiers, would have one battalion of artillery. An equivalent Russian brigade would have two battalions of self-propelled artillery, one of rocket artillery and one of anti-tank artillery (missiles are controlled by higher formations). The idea, as one US Army study of Russian forces puts it, is to produce “mass fires”—a term of art that refers, essentially, to bombardment—“to destroy hectares of enemy-occupied territory”, with the aim of stunning and softening up defenders.Destroying hectares of open territory—“deleting” a grid square, as the morbid military slang goes—can be useful if the territory in question is a field full of enemy troops and not much else. Wiping out hectares of a city is another matter. Russia’s first assault on Grozny destroyed much of the city and killed 20,000 civilians. Its second attempt, launched by Vladimir Putin in 1999, caused fewer casualties—Russia had told civilians to leave–but the aftermath was described by UN monitors as “a devastated…wasteland”. As one young Russian officer told a reporter at the time: “What rules? What Geneva Conventions?…I didn’t sign them, none of my friends signed them.” Russia got another taste of urban warfare, from a different perspective, when it intervened in the Syrian civil war on behalf of Bashar al-Assad, Syria’s dictator, in 2015. That intervention was conducted largely with air power, with ground forces playing a limited role. But its effects were not dissimilar. Human Rights Watch, an advocacy group, accused the Russian-Syrian coalition of killing more than 440 civilians during a month-long bombing campagn in Aleppo, a city in north-western Syria, between September and October 2016 alone. In one 12-hour period in May 2019, Russia’s air force allegedly bombed four hospitals in the region. In total, Russia may have killed between 14,000 and 24,000 civilians in Syria between 2015 and 2021, according to Airwars, an investigative group that tracks civilian harm in wars. In one sense, indiscriminate violence worked. Rebels no longer pose a serious threat to the Assad regime’s grip on power in Damascus. Russian forces captured Grozny, or what was left of it, in February 2000 and Mr Putin declared direct rule from Moscow and installed his chosen leader in the province in the following months. In 2009 Russia declared the end of its “counter-terrorism operation” in Chechnya. Yet a few lessons stand out. One is that bombarding a city is not a strategy in itself. “The Russians expected artillery and air strikes to lead to a decisive victory and had no contingency plans,” concludes one study of the second battle of Grozny by the RAND Corporation, a think-tank, in 2001. Troops ultimately had to go in. Things can also drag on. The first battle for Grozny lasted two months or so and the second for six weeks, in a city far smaller than Kyiv. And whether it makes sense for the Russians to destroy a city they intend to capture and govern from is another matter. In Chechnya Mr Putin solved the problem by picking a warlord and throwing money at the province to rebuild it. “I don’t know how that works in Ukraine where there are no warlords,” says Olga Oliker of the International Crisis Group, another think-tank, who wrote the RAND study. “I have a hard time seeing a Chechen scenario working.” In theory, Russia has more refined means at its disposal. In the second Chechen war, around 13% of targets, for artillery and air strikes, were found through electronic warfare—hoovering up the emissions of things like mobile phones and radios. Now there are better ways to hoover them up, and to strike with greater precision. One example of that comes from the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, which Russia first invaded in 2014 and where it has since armed and supported proxy forces. Russian forces there have used the Leer-3 electronic-warfare system, essentially a command post in a truck which controls Orlan-10 drones. The drones can pick out wireless communications and send their co-ordinates back to artillery. Most of the drones fly too high to be struck by the Stinger anti-aircraft missiles being supplied to Ukrainian troops by Western countries. That is the theory, at least. There has been little sign of Russian drone reconnaissance in the first six days of the Ukraine war. And even with such sophisticated methods, Russia’s targeting principles are “very different” from those of NATO countries, says Sam Cranny-Evans of the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank in London. Western armed forces, he says, typically need two to three “positive identifications” of a target before it can be struck. “We can’t say the same of the Russians.” On March 1st Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, warned that Mr Putin’s instinct would be to “Grozny-fy” Kyiv. Indeed Russia’s recent strikes in Kharkiv and other cities show little sign of any effort to identify enemy forces at all. “It's hard to square the use of cluster munitions in a city, where there are no military targets in that area,” says Mr Cranny-Evans, “with anything other than trying to inflict terror.”
2  A BITTER FROST descended on Kyiv on the first morning of March, and the mood grew chillier, too. For five days the Ukrainian capital has held off Russia’s massively superior armed forces. But the enemy remains near the gates, and a vast column of armoured vehicles, stretched out over 40 miles (65km) and closing in from the north-west, suggests things are about to get much worse–though its progress is being hampered by logistical problems and perhaps by Ukrainian action. In the evening a missile hit a television tower in the north-west of the city, reportedly killing a family of five and taking some services temporarily off the air. The missile may also have damaged part of the nearby memorial to the victims of the Babi Yar massacre by the Nazis. The talk in town is that residents must prepare for a siege–perhaps for a nightmare on the scale of Aleppo in 2012-16 or even Leningrad, which held out for nearly 900 days against the Nazis in 1941-44, at a horrific cost in lives.On the morning of March 1st President Volodymyr Zelensky announced he was putting an experienced soldier in charge of governing the capital. General Nikolai Zhernov, a veteran of the Donbas war in 2014, would secure supply lines, hospitals and basic services in the event that things get much worse, he said. Ukraine’s security services also issued new warnings to citizens of Kyiv, urging them to install apps to report on advancing forces. The state cyber agency said it was blocking Russian mobile numbers. It asked citizens to report any phone lost to the invaders to the phone companies for blocking.For the time being, Ukrainian authorities say the capital is not in immediate danger of being encircled, because the routes to the south-west remain clear. “The enemy is close,” said Mykola Povoroznyk, the deputy head of the city government, “but the task of avoiding a siege is achievable.” Food producers, drivers, and other essential services were doing everything to keep Kyiv going, he said. The city had set up a humanitarian hub to co-ordinate the response, but it wasn’t a situation in which they had much advance planning to call on. Until a week ago Kyiv was a peaceful European capital. “We’ve had to start from the ground up in almost every respect.” In the city’s main station, panic has set in as families try to take the last trains to safer regions in the west. Just four trains left on February 28th, zigzagging along an unusual southbound, then westbound, route through goods depots and smaller towns to avoid the fighting in the immediate outskirts. The carriages are filled to the rafters: 16, 17, 18 people in compartments that usually carry six, sleeping on the floor and on top of one another. Women, children and the elderly have priority to board. That has left a lot of angry men, with aggressive soldiers putting them back in their place. Ten minutes’ drive away from the station, the Ohmatdyt Children’s Hospital is busy. Everything has changed here since Vladimir Putin launched his war on February 24th. Mothers and babies have moved to basements with mattresses packed next to one another. According to its director, Vladimir Zhovnir, the hospital is now overstretched. Four children and two mothers have been admitted with war injuries and the life of at least one of these children still hangs in the balance. The hospital is coping for now. But doctors fret that barely any planned operations, for example for the brain tumours that Dr Pavlo Plavskyi operates on, are taking place. Parents cannot or are too frightened to travel to the hospital with their children and that, he says, means that some will die as a result. Dr Plavskyi says that many doctors, nurses and other staff have left Kyiv since February 24th, but many others have not even left the hospital and have barely slept. Maryna, a nurse, looks after critically ill babies, and normally there are eight nurses in her team giving one-to-one care. Now she says she is alone. Two nurses from her team cannot come to work because a bridge from where they lived has been blown up, and the rest have fled Kyiv. Maryna is now sleeping on a mattress on the floor next to ten babies and nine mothers, including a pair of twins. “I was on the 12th floor when I heard jets on the first day,” she says. She stayed because “the mothers can’t stay with no nurses,” and the babies need someone to insert their cannulas. On Kyiv’s streets there are queues at the few supermarkets that are still open and at pharmacies. Everything else is closed. Shelves are depleted but not empty. In the shops The Economist visited there was no bread but there was water, pasta, chocolate, cheese, salami and other food good for sieges. No supplies had arrived since the war began, said one food-store manager who did not want to be named. He hoped they would resume tomorrow. Except for main roads there is barely any traffic, and few people are on the streets. Petrol has run out and garages are closed.At one of the big international hotels, The Economist witnessed something resembling a war cabinet. In the chair was Alexei Alexeevich, 64, until February 24th a security guard but now reprising something like his former role as a major in the Soviet army. There was lots of work to do still, he reminded his colleagues in a stern baritone: taping up windows, barricading the doors, and securing whatever food supplies one could at this stage. He wouldn’t insist anyone stayed. There would be a van to the station for the staff who wanted to get out. Two of the young receptionists said they would take him up on the offer. They hope to reach Poland. “War changes people,” says Mr Alexeevich. “Nobodies become leaders, and leaders become nobodies. The well-off go out and steal, and the homeless take up arms to protect property.” He says he hopes it will not change ordinary Ukrainians, a tolerant nation at heart. But as Mr Putin dials up the terror, the danger is that it will do exactly that. Hanna Sokolova, a journalist who lived in the Kharkiv residential district hit by Russian Grad missiles on February 28th, says she has been overtaken by negative feelings of “Russophobia”. Mr Putin’s war has driven her from her home. “For the first time in my life, I understood that I’m capable of killing someone.”
3  IT IS THE dog that has yet to bark. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been fought with all sorts of high-tech weapons, from cruise missiles and helicopters to armed drones and a public-relations battle on social media. Conspicuous by its absence, though, has been something that many observers thought would be one of the defining features of a 21st-century conflict between high-tech opponents. “Cyber-attacks” aimed at Ukrainian computer systems seem to have played hardly any role. That is a puzzle. Computer systems run more and more of modern society, and are riddled with bugs and inadvertent weaknesses. These can be exploited by attackers with grave consequences in the material world. In 2015 Russian hackers managed to knock out power for around 230,000 customers in western Ukraine. The attackers repeated the trick the following year. In 2017 another Russian attack featuring a piece of malware dubbed “NotPetya” disrupted Ukrainian airports, railways and banks. The run-up to the invasion saw the websites of Ukraine’s government and banks knocked temporarily offline, and the discovery of malware designed to delete files on Ukrainian computer systems. Some attacks were mounted in the other direction. A group of Belarusian hackers opposed to the war claimed that it had disrupted the computer networks of Belarus’s railways. After the invasion began Anonymous, a diffuse fraternity of hackers, said it had broken into Russia’s defence ministry and stolen files. Hackers egged on by Ukraine used “distributed denial of service” attacks to knock Russian websites offline, including those of media companies and banks.But all that is small beer compared with what many had been anticipating. “You might have expected significant Russian hacking of core Ukrainian internet infrastructure,” says Ciaran Martin, a former boss of Britain’s National Cyber-Security Centre, which is charged with defending against big cyber-attacks. “But that hasn’t happened. Communications seem to be working mostly fine.”Theories abound. One, says Mr Martin, is that Russia may have left Ukrainian infrastructure intact because Russia, too, is making use of it. There has been evidence of logistical difficulties within Russia’s army, including armoured vehicles seemingly abandoned for lack of fuel. “It might be that Russian units are partly relying on Ukrainian networks themselves,” says Mr Martin, noting that some soldiers in modern conflicts occasionally use their own smartphones to communicate, despite the risks that can pose. Another is that large-scale, damaging attacks were attempted but failed. Ukraine’s armed forces, after all, have offered much stronger resistance than expected. Perhaps its digital defences were likewise stronger than presumed. The cyber-attacks on the power grid in particular were a “wake-up call”, says a Western official. America and its allies have been providing technical assistance for years.And once a war has started cyber-attacks may become less enticing. Missiles and bombs can take out power stations, railways and other infrastructure more quickly and more lastingly than computer code can. Big cyber-attacks need careful preparation that can often take months. That is not a problem when it comes to espionage or low-level harassment. Once battle is joined, however, that is far too slow.Less than a week into the war, though, few experts are willing to stick their necks out and say definitively that no big cyber-attacks will happen. Unlike infantry battalions, field hospitals and tank columns, cyber-attacks cannot be seen by spy satellites. The best make use of vulnerabilities defenders are unaware of—which means the first sign that a computer system has been breached is when it stops working. Absence of evidence, in the digital realm, never quite adds up to evidence of absence. That dynamic is making people jumpy, even far from the battlefield. On February 28th Toyota, a big car-maker, suspended production in its Japanese factories after a cyber-attack on one of its suppliers. The attack came shortly after Japan announced that it would join other countries in imposing economic sanctions on Russia, leading to speculation that the attack was retaliation for that decision. It may have been, though it was feeble retaliation if so. It is just as plausible, however, that it was merely a run-of-the-mill criminal attack. One of the problems with cyber-attacks is that it is often hard to be sure. 
4  “Many #Ukrainians still remember the good ol’ days, when #Soviet Ukraine was the #USSR’s breadbasket,” tweeted @Russia, a government-run Twitter account, posting a series of pictures of cheerful old-time Soviet scenes. “A lot of that, and much more, is available in #Russia’s #Crimea today.” An hour later @Ukraine responded to Russia’s message with the suggestion that it had been posted by a “toxic ex”.This exchange, in 2020, was a warm-up for a social-media war that has continued even as actual war breaks out on the ground. Ukrainian officials from the president down have posted and promoted viral content designed to attract the attention of international as well as domestic audiences. The graphics and gags may seem frivolous. But the battle for online likes and shares is part of a strategy to shape the views of Western voters—and their governments.Even before the outbreak of fighting Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, was one of the most followed heads of state. His 13.5m-strong (and rising) Instagram following is the fifth-biggest of any world leader (the top four are the heads of India, Indonesia, Brazil and America, countries with populations between five and 30 times as large as Ukraine’s). Mr Zelensky posts dozens of tweets most days, in Ukrainian and English, tagging other national leaders and getting retweets from their followers.Mr Zelensky, a former actor whose roles included an ordinary man who became president by accident, ran his election campaign almost entirely online in 2019, causing journalists to complain about his lack of availability for interviews. His rolling series of YouTube videos that treated the campaign like a reality-TV documentary left some wondering if he was ready for the job. In fact his honing of accessible, shareable clips has turned out to be an ideal preparation for what has followed.Ukrainian government officials have followed Mr Zelensky’s lead. On February 26th Mykhailo Fedorov, the vice prime minister, tweeted a direct request to Elon Musk, a billionaire entrepreneur, to set up his Starlink internet service in Ukraine. The same day Mr Musk replied that the service was now active; two days later Mr Fedorov tweeted an image of new Starlink terminals arriving by truck.The pinned tweet on @Ukraine’s account asks, in English, for crypto-currency donations, of which it had received more than $25m as of March 1st, according to Elliptic, a firm of analysts. Previously the government had directed visitors to an account on Patreon, a fundraising website more commonly used by struggling artists, where donors could sponsor the country at different “membership levels” with names such as “bullet” and “bomb”. Shortly after the invasion Patreon suspended the account, citing a rule against buying weapons. Ukraine’s lively online presence contrasts with @Russia’s more staid posts, which as war raged included a retweet of “four of the most beautiful railway stations in Russia”. Recent posts by the account have hundreds of hostile replies.Ukraine’s active presence on social media has been helped by an abundance of dramatic “content” unlike that seen in any previous war. Although Ukraine is one of Europe’s poorest and least-connected countries, three-quarters of Ukrainians aged over 13 are active on social media, according to Kepios, a research firm. Most get online using smartphones. These have generated the videos that make up the raw material of viral content, from unarmed pensioners yelling abuse at Russian soldiers to a Ukrainian motorist asking a group of stranded tank-drivers if he could tow them back to Russia. Previously, it took extraordinary luck for a camera crew to capture a moment such as the Tiananmen Square “tank man” filmed by CNN in 1989. The Ukraine conflict has already generated dozens of similarly dramatic moments, nearly all filmed by citizens with phones.Social media have also helped Ukraine’s international supporters to co-ordinate their actions. Synchronised protest marches around the world on February 27th attracted hundreds of thousands of participants. Following the announcement by the Ukrainian government of an “international legion” of volunteer fighters, amateur soldiers have posted pictures of themselves bidding farewell to loved ones at airports. A forum on Reddit called VolunteersForUkraine allows would-be fighters to swap tips on how to get involved. “I just arrived in Lviv, thanks to this [forum]”, posted one man on February 28th, with a picture of himself in a yellow anorak and tracksuit trousers, holding an assault rifle.The swing in public opinion since the beginning of hostilities has been stark. Western countries were always bound to support Ukraine rather than Russia, the aggressor. But polling suggests that public opinion has hardened since the fighting began. Polling in Britain by YouGov on February 22nd-23rd, just before the invasion, found that 69% were in favour of tougher sanctions on Russia. Two days later, after images of Russia’s attack had gone around the world, the share had risen to 77%. Those in favour of sending weapons to Ukraine rose from 46% to 60%. There is also an increased willingness to make sacrifices. Before the invasion, only 35% of Britons approved of sanctions that would increase the cost of living at home. Within two days that had increased to 45%.Opinion has also turned in other countries. Germans now approve of sending weapons to Ukraine by 45% to 37%, finds YouGov. The French are in favour by around the same margin.Public outcry has translated into policy change. On February 27th Germany announced that it would increase its defence budget to more than 2% of GDP, up from around 1.5% in 2021. Even Switzerland has found it impossible to maintain its neutrality in the face of strong public opinion. It announced on February 28th that it would freeze Russian financial assets in the country, which are reckoned to total some $11bn. Companies are also paying attention to public opinion. Disney, Sony and Warner Bros announced on February 28th that they would suspend their new cinematic releases in Russia.Social media are hardly the only causes of the turn in public opinion. But their ability to transmit first-hand accounts from ordinary people in the thick of it may make them particularly affecting, suggests Simon Kemp of Kepios. He cites Ukrainian Instagram influencers whose updates have abruptly changed from baking and make-up tips to desperate scenes of evacuation.Social networks also have the unique property that, as well as spreading information, they encourage members of the “audience” to form and express their own views, turning them more easily into participants rather than simply passive viewers. The way in which social-media users quickly coalesce around a point of view increases the pressure on their leaders to act, notes Ben Thompson, author of Stratechery, a newsletter on technology.This may make citizens, and their leaders, quicker to get involved in other countries’ problems. America waded into faraway conflicts after incidents such as the Pearl Harbour bombing or the 9/11 attacks, notes Mr Thompson. Yet in the case of Ukraine, “a similar level of outrage and demands for action are being mounted without the previously needed component of there being a specific national connection.” As social media turn consumers of news into activists, their governments may in turn become more active.
5  WHEN SOVIET-LED forces invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968, it was a straightforward affair. The invaders met little resistance, the country’s leader was whisked off to Moscow on day two and the West “just swallowed it”, notes Sergey Radchenko, a historian. “What we have today in Ukraine is playing out very differently.” The bulk of Russian forces are now 25km from the centre of Kyiv, the capital, and will probably encircle it in the coming days. Russian forces have also broken through Ukrainian lines in the south, driving west to Odessa, a major port, and north to the centre of the country, where they could cut off Ukrainian forces in eastern Ukraine. Kharkiv, which repelled attacks over the weekend, faced heavy shelling on Monday.The Russian war machine is nevertheless struggling. Things are very different from 1968. But its performance is also “worse [than] in Georgia in 2008”, says Konrad Muzyka, a defence analyst. That war led to sweeping reforms to the armed forces, but perhaps not sweeping enough. Images from Ukraine show mangled clumps of Russian armour. A video from the alleged aftermath of an ambush on one convoy near Sumy, a north-eastern city, on Sunday, shows the loss of at least a dozen armoured vehicles, including two tanks, and a self-propelled howitzer. The question is whether these troubles are temporary or indicate a deeper rot that Ukraine can exploit. Russia’s biggest problem appears to be logistics. A Western official says that Russia has particular problems with engineering units. Ukraine has blown up many bridges, and Russia has been unable to get bridging units through congested roads. Russian tanks and other vehicles lie abandoned on the roadside, either broken-down or out of fuel, suggesting supply lines are overstretched, and support units are unable to keep up. Marooned units are prime targets for ambushes. Ukrainian forces have no shortage of arms with which to strike them—in recent days, Denmark, Luxembourg and Finland became the latest European countries to say they would supply thousands of anti-tank missiles.Nor has Russia secured the skies. Western officials thought that Russian missiles would wipe out Ukraine’s air defences—a network of radars and surface-to-air missiles—in the first hours of a war. In fact, the strikes were lighter than expected, possibly to conserve low stocks of precision munitions. Perhaps as a result, Russia has not made much use of its warplanes so far, though recent footage appears to show Su-34 bombers over Kharkiv and in the south of Ukraine. The absence of air superiority has two knock-on effects. One is that soldiers lack proper fixed-wing air support—a historic weakness for Russia because of poor co-ordination between ground troops and air forces, says Guy Plopsky, an expert on the country’s air power. The other is that, because Russia is not sweeping the skies with fighter jets, Ukraine can keep more planes up—something helped by Russia’s sparing use of missiles, which means it is hitting only a few points on airfields, rather than cratering them completely. Ukraine is using its Turkish-made TB2 drones to conduct deadly strikes on unsuspecting Russian forces, who seem to have no idea what is above them. Few experts thought these drones would be usable four days into a war.  this points to deeper tactical shortcomings. In modern war different elements, including infantry, armour, artillery, air defence, engineering units and electronic warfare, are supposed to work together, each compensating for the other’s weaknesses. A tank, for instance, provides firepower for the infantry that travel with it; in turn, the infantry can dismount and hunt down anti-tank platoons. Russia is making a hash of this. In some cases, its tactics verge on the suicidal. A video reportedly taken in Bucha, a town north-west of Kyiv, shows a Russian armoured vehicle broadcasting propaganda, instructing civilians to remain calm. A man wielding a rocket-propelled grenade strolls up to the vehicle and calmly destroys it.One reason for these blunders may be the scale of the Russian deployment. During its previous invasion of Ukraine in 2014-15, Russia sent no more than a dozen or so battalion tactical groups (BTGs) of 1,000-odd troops. This time it has sent well over 100. The result is “diluted BTGs”, as one American armour officer puts it. The intelligence units that would normally pick up signals of a TB2 loitering overhead and the artillery forces that would soften up Ukrainian defenders, as they did in 2015, may not be available in sufficient numbers to deploy into every BTG. “So now you’re leavening your best ingredients into a much larger loaf,” says the officer.There are signs of poor morale in some units. Video footage shows at least one tank column hurriedly reversing after being confronted by unarmed civilians. Dima Adamsky, an expert on Russia’s armed forces at Reichman University in Israel, says he is surprised by the high numbers of young conscripts. They may be confused as to whether their Ukrainian opponents are brothers bound in “spiritual, human and civilisational ties”, as Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, put it in an essay published last summer, or instruments of drug-addled Nazis, as he thundered recently. In Berdyansk, a port city that fell to Russia on Sunday, local residents openly protested against the Rosgvardia (national guard) troops on their streets.Some Western officials and military experts conclude that Russia’s army is a paper tiger. “This isn’t a good army executing a bad plan…or out-of-context tactics,” says B.A. Friedman, a military analyst and reserve officer in the US Marine Corps. “It’s a bad army!” Others are more cautious. They say that Russian tactics may adapt in the days and weeks ahead, and that the country has mass on its side. Russia is yet to deploy a quarter of the forces on Ukraine’s border, according to American officials. One column, its southern end 27km from Kyiv’s centre, stretches over another 27km of road, according to satellite imagery. American officials also say that the Kremlin has sent fighters from the Wagner Group, a Kremlin-linked mercenary outfit, to Ukraine. Russia has so far worked much harder to avoid civilian casualties than in its air campaign in Syria and than was expected at the start of the conflict, says Mr Adamsky. But the war may be entering an “uglier stage”, he warns. That is evident in Kharkiv. Rockets and cluster munitions have begun targeting residential areas, causing widespread damage to entire blocks of flats. Images show corpses littering the street. The appearance of Su-34 bombers suggests that the city may soon be struck from the air. Mr Putin’s gamble on a quick war has failed—now he appears set on a grim one.
6  ONLY A FEW hours after the invaders were sent packing from Kharkiv, they resumed their assault. And anyone who thought Vladimir Putin’s lyrical ramblings about Ukrainians and Russians being one people meant that his men would not kill Ukrainian civilians was sadly disabused. Early in the morning of February 28th Grad missiles rained down on Ukraine’s second city, killing at least nine civilians and injuring dozens, according to Kharkiv’s mayor. Still, if Mr Putin’s aim was to cause panic and demoralise his enemy as cease-fire talks began across the border in Belarus, he failed. Among the men deploying to defend Kyiv, morale is sky-high. Russia’s immense armed forces have yet to win control of a single major urban area. Ukrainians have defended their homeland ferociously.In contrast to 2014, when war began in the east of Ukraine, social media and cheap mobile internet is generating a torrent of instant information as never before. Ukrainians are constantly sharing videos of the latest news, horror, or morale-boosting small victory. Recent viral hits have included films of groups stopping Russian convoys with barricades, a farmer towing away a Russian armoured car with his tractor and a single man pushing back a Russian tank to stop it. In the now-occupied small town of Berdyansk, videos showed a large crowd shouting “go home” at Russian soldiers. Others sang the Ukrainian national anthem. Kyiv, the capital, knows it is likely to face a new wave of attacks. And it continues to prepare for them. Standing to attention in a way that would make any sergeant major weep with frustration, new recruits to Ukraine’s Territorial Defence force lined up on February 28th before leaving in a bus for a checkpoint guarding a crossroads in Obolon, in the north of the city. The new force is designed to take up duties behind the front line, releasing regular soldiers to go and fight.“Glory to Ukraine!” boomed their commanding officer. “Glory to the heroes!” roared the recruits. “Putin!” he yelled. “Putin is a dick!” came the response, a now familiar one since the revolution of 2014.Those not being armed were being sent to make Molotov cocktails. Maryna Dymshyts, a film director, arrived in a small group carrying a plastic container with five litres of petrol. She said that after the Russian invasion started on February 24th a group of her friends and family had taken three dogs, seven cats, three children and her boyfriend’s 100-year-old great-great-grandmother to the countryside for safety and now they had returned “because we want to help.”As the Territorial Defence force bus sped to the north of Kyiv it rapidly became clear how the capital is bracing for attack. Groups of armed men could be seen by the roadside. Checkpoints have either already been erected across main roads or are being built now. At the strategic Obolon intersection trenches have been dug, while cranes were manoeuvring concrete blocks and large steel tank traps into position. Inside what had been a clinic a week ago, men bustled around carrying in bedding and supplies. On February 28th a security company offered to pay $1,000 to anyone able to prove they had taken out a tank.People are motivated by the sense that their survival is at stake, said Vasily Bondarenko, an artist in Podil, a central neighbourhood, shattered after four nights without sleep. “We don’t have an option. We don’t have the mentality of Russians and we can’t have anyone ruling over us. If we don’t resist we know we will be forever under the thumb with arrests, repression, prisons.” It was either the end of Putin or of Ukraine, he said. The cost of war on civilians is becoming apparent. Opposite the Obolon checkpoint a two-hour queue had built up outside a small outlet at the Khlibokombinat industrial bakery, one of only a few that are still operating. People said they had come there because although a few supermarkets are open, the queues there are longer and they do not have bread.Among the men who have just joined the Territorial Defence was Oleksandr Khomenko, a museum curator. He said for the past four days he and his team had been moving objects in his museum to safety. “Historically Russia has always wanted to destroy Ukrainian culture,” he said, blaming Russian troops for the destruction of some 25 paintings by Maria Prymachenko, a Ukrainian folk artist, which have just been lost in a burned museum in Ivankiv, 80km north-west of Kyiv.Meanwhile back in the centre of Kyiv the mood was more sombre among those not taking up arms. “We’re going to be next after Kharkiv,” said Galya, a waitress at one of a handful of coffee shops to open their doors after a 36-hour curfew. It was only a matter of time before Russian tanks made it into the city, she sobbed. Kyiv has become a city of tears. Her brother was caught up in the worst of the tank battles in Bucha, to the north-west, and was hunkering in a basement with his two children. But Ukrainians would not, and could not, give up. Too many boys had given their lives. Several locals expressed doubts about negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, which started on February 28th but seem unlikely to go anywhere soon. Ira, a lawyer, said gloomily that the politicians would eventually agree to split up Ukraine, which has been Mr Putin’s goal for the past eight years. Kharkiv and the East would be handed over, she predicted. Perhaps even Kyiv, too. But anything was better than the warped reality of the past few days—of men running and shooting Kalashnikovs. “Just give us the option of living,” she said. “We’ll sign up to it.”
7  “A NEW WORLD is being born before our eyes. Russia’s military operation in Ukraine has ushered in a new era…Russia is restoring its unity—the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe in our history, has been overcome. Yes, at a great cost, yes, through the tragic events of a virtual civil war…but there will be no more Ukraine, as the anti-Russia.”That triumphal article appeared on the site of Ria Novosti, Russia’s main state online news agency, on February 26th. It declared: “Russia restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together—in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians [a pre-Soviet term for Ukrainians].” Ukraine, it said, has returned to Russia. And the great leader, Vladimir Putin, “has assumed, without a drop of exaggeration, a historic responsibility” for this “solution” to “the Ukrainian question”. Presumably the publication of this screed was scheduled well in advance, on the assumption that Mr Putin’s forces would win a quick and easy victory, and someone forgot to cancel it. The day it appeared on Ria Novosti’s site, heavy fighting unfolded around Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, and Ukrainian forces repelled the Russian invaders. Ria Novosti quietly pulled the celebratory article from its site; there was nothing to celebrate. After five days of war, the Russian military machine was malfunctioning. So Russian state television cloaked it with fiction. Dmitry Kiselev, a TV anchor often known as “Putin’s mouthpiece” and who also controls Ria Novosti, doubled down during his two-hour long Sunday-night programme, mixing threats against NATO with historical Russian claims to Ukraine and fictional stories of Ukrainian outrages. “The street atrocities have become a way of life in Ukraine, with newsrooms being smashed, television studios set on fire, and television stations shut down. Now there is hope that  this medieval nightmare is a thing of the past,” he fumed.Mr Putin’s propaganda machine is now working at full throttle. Reality be damned: the Russian army is calmly fulfilling the task set by its commander-in-chief, demilitarising and “de-Nazifying” Ukraine; it has destroyed 1,067 military targets; Ukrainian soldiers are surrendering but are treated with great respect and care. “Everything was excellent. Nobody was hitting anyone,” one supposed prisoner-of-war told the Russian cameras. Grateful Ukrainians are welcoming Russian troops. Those who are not have been brainwashed.Russia is not conducting a war, Mr Putin’s flacks insist, but a nearly bloodless military operation to free its Ukrainian brothers from the vile West and its Nazi proxies in Ukraine. These “Nazis” are invisible and all the scarier for it. The audience does not see their faces, for they are a faceless, torch-bearing mass, but only their victims, who tell of atrocities: “torturing people, breaking ribs, burning, stabbing and stabbing, pulling out teeth with tongs and branding people with red-hot iron, with fiery iron, crushed skulls, mutilating”, as Mr Kiselev explains. Repetition, pumping music, kaleidoscopic montages; Russian TV is using the full range of tools to whip up nationalistic hatred. The machine has been struggling to keep reality at bay, however. The Kremlin had done nothing to prepare the public or its armed forces for the largest war in Europe since 1945. For months it was telling them that Russia was not about to invade Ukraine, and the rumour that it was reflected Western scaremongering. Some captured Russian soldiers, indeed, have appeared to be under the impression that they were taking part in a military exercise, and were surprised to have found themselves in Ukraine. Videos of Russia’s military losses are explained away as fakes; the destruction its forces are inflicting on cities like Kharkiv, in the east, as having been committed by Ukrainians. “It is hard for those who don’t know the details to make out what is happening,” a reassuring voice from Russia’s state-run Channel One told its audience on February 27th. It is far better to use information from official sources, otherwise viewers risk being told lies, it said. “Those who spread such lies want to hold the world in their hands and people in fear.” The news that the West is imposing tough sanctions on Russia, that the rouble has crashed, that interest rates have nearly doubled and that Russian aircraft are now banned from European airspace is mentioned only in passing. Sometimes it is slotted in between television commercials for foreign holidays, fast payment systems, fancy electronics or affordable mortgages; all things that will soon be harder for ordinary Russians to obtain.Yet reality keeps intruding. A flood of support for Ukraine from around the world and disgust with the Kremlin’s aggression is breaking through propaganda barriers. Although the mobile internet has been slowed down to prevent the exchange of information, accurate news is spreading within Russia. TV Rain, an independent internet television channel, is still broadcasting and so is Ekho Moskvy, a radio station. Novaya Gazeta, one of Russia’s last independent newspapers, is publishing stories about soldiers who had little idea where they were being sent. Yuri Dud, one of Russia’s most popular vloggers, wrote on February 28th to his 5m subscribers that “Putin has invaded the territory of a sovereign state and is waging war there...the Russian Ministry of Defence claims it only destroys enemy military targets with precision weapons, but in Ukraine, according to the United Nations, there are already over 100 civilians dead, hundreds wounded, over 350,000 refugees.”Unprepared for the scale of the war or its consequences, many Russians, especially middle-class and educated ones, are horrified. Despite the risk of being arrested or beaten with truncheons, anti-war protesters have massed and marched in several Russian cities. In the past five days, about 4,000 people have been detained, though most are swiftly released. Anonymous, an international hacking group, has joined the fray. It has launched denial-of-service attacks on Russian state media and posted a message on many of them: “Dear citizens. We call on you to stop this madness. Don’t send your sons and husbands to die. It is time to act–come out on the streets!” Actors, businessfolk and even some politicians are starting to speak out. Oleg Deripaska, a billionaire industrialist, posted on his Telegram channel as the war was hammering the value of his business: “Peace is very important! Talks are needed as soon as possible.” Some Communist parliamentarians have said that they were misled over the decision, a week ago, to recognise the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk in the south-east of Ukraine. What they thought was a way of avoiding war was, in fact, its pretext.But there have been no resignations by officials or ministers, so far, and the Kremlin is now trying to hold the line by accusing critics of the war of treason. “This is a difficult period in the history of our state, but united we will overcome everything,” wrote Vyachelsav Volodin, the speaker of Russian parliament. “The position of a number of cultural figures who…do not condemn the neo-Nazis [ie, the Ukrainian government] is unacceptable. This is nothing short of a betrayal of their people, and those involved in the peacekeeping operation,” he wrote. It is not clear how long Russians will choose to believe what their televisions are telling them. For some, rejecting the big lie is too frightening a prospect to contemplate. And the more people suspect what is really happening, the more vigorously Mr Putin’s propaganda machine will spin new lies, and the more brutally he may treat those who tell the truth about what he is doing to Ukraine, and to Russia. 
8  AS VLADIMIR PUTIN declared war on Ukraine in the early hours of February 24th, he warned the West to stay out of it. “Whoever tries to hinder us… should know that Russia's response…will lead you to such consequences that you have never encountered in your history,” he said. It was interpreted as a barely veiled threat to use nuclear weapons. On February 27th, several days into his war, and without much to show for the fighting so far, Mr Putin removed the veil entirely. At a televised meeting with Sergei Shoigu, his defence minister, who looked taken aback, and the chief of the general staff, General Valery Gerasimov, Mr Putin accused the West of “unfriendly economic actions”. He was referring to the heavy sanctions announced in recent days, which threaten to batter Russia’s economy, as well as “aggressive statements” about Russia. “Therefore I order the minister of defence and the chief of the general staff to transfer the deterrence forces…to a special mode of combat duty.” In effect, it suggests that Russian nuclear weapons are moving to higher readiness. This does not mean Mr Putin is preparing a nuclear strike. “Announcing it means that it is primarily a political message designed to impress us,” says Bruno Tertrais, an expert on nuclear deterrence at the Foundation for Strategic Research, a think-tank in Paris. “If he was getting ready to use nuclear weapons he would not [say so first].” Mr Putin’s aim is probably to deter the West from offering further support to Ukraine, which has so far fiercely resisted Russian ground assaults on several targets including Kyiv, the capital, and on February 27th Kharkiv, the second-largest city. In recent days that support has been increasing. On February 25th Britain held a conference with more than 25 countries, including America and Canada, at which they pledged to continue sending ammunition, anti-tank weapons and other arms to Ukraine. A day later even Germany, which had previously refused to send lethal aid, and had blocked German-made weapons from being sent by others, changed its mind. It said it would send 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles “as quickly as possible”. It also allowed the Netherlands and Estonia to send rocket-propelled grenade launchers and howitzers respectively. The next day it went even further, announcing a huge expansion in defence spending, with a special fund of €100bn ($112bn). In addition to stanching the flow of such things to Ukraine, Mr Putin may also hope to stamp out any Western debates over the idea of a no-fly zone over parts of Ukraine. His threat amounts to releasing the safety catch on a firearm. The reference to “special mode of combat duty” probably refers to the command and control of Russian nuclear forces. In peacetime, the system is thought to be incapable of transmitting launch orders, as if its circuits are disconnected, says Pavel Podvig, an expert on Russian nuclear forces at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, a think-tank in Geneva. In moments of crisis Russian officials can “bring the system into a working condition, connecting the wires”, says Mr Podvig, “so if a launch order is issued it can go through”. Once that happens, he says, the system is designed to allow a launch to occur even if Mr Putin is incapacitated—though that requires detecting a nuclear detonation on Russian soil. In addition to all that, “combat duty” might also trigger other preparations, such as nuclear-armed submarines leaving port or weapons being loaded onto bombers—things that would be visible to America and its allies through satellites and other means. Russia is estimated to have 1,588 deployed nuclear warheads and 2,889 in reserve (America has 1,644 and 1,964 respectively). Its “deterrence forces” are not just nuclear ones, though. Russia considers strategic deterrence to span nuclear and conventional forces, including missiles such as the ground-launched Iskander, sea-launched Kalibr and air-launched Kh-101 and Kinzhal. Some of these missiles are dual-capable, which means that they can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads. Many have been spotted in recent weeks. The Kinzhal was seen under a Russian warplane in Kaliningrad on February 8th and Iskanders are thought to have been used in the first wave of missile strikes on Ukraine. Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary-general of NATO, said that Mr Putin’s move was “dangerous rhetoric”. The alliance includes three nuclear powers—America, Britain and France—although France does not participate in joint nuclear planning and its forces are not formally assigned to NATO. In addition to their strategic forces, America also deploys “non-strategic” (sometimes called tactical) nuclear weapons to Europe, which have lower explosive yields. These can be carried by Belgian, German, Italian, Dutch and Turkish jets, the idea being to ensure a wider range of allies have a stake in nuclear deterrence. Western nuclear forces do not need to go on higher alert, Mr Tertrais thinks. “I see no reason for a tit-for-tat,” he says. “Quite the contrary: we must appear cool-headed and show that he [Mr Putin] is the one losing his temper.” But the risks of misperception and misunderstanding are higher in wartime, and Mr Putin’s willingness to gamble has been proven to be greater than many assumed. Jon Wolfsthal of Global Zero, an advocacy group, and a former arms-control official in the Obama administration, urges America’s chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, the country’s top military officer, to remain in regular contact with General Gerasimov—and to remind him, and his colleagues, that any resort to nuclear weapons “makes them personally accountable under the laws of war”. Mr Putin himself seems accountable to no one. In the 1950s Thomas Schelling, an economist and nuclear strategist, pointed out that the most credible threats were not those that promised an action with certainty, but left something to chance. “The threat is not quite of the form ‘I may or may not, according as I choose,’” noted Schelling, “but…‘I may or may not, and even I can’t be altogether sure.’” Mr Putin has gambled heavily. Now he is raising the stakes. 
9  IT IS UNCLEAR what Russian soldiers expected as, walking in columns behind armoured vehicles, groups of them attempted to stroll into Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city. Videos on social media, circulating from early morning on February 27th, showed them moving from at least two directions, advancing from the outskirts of the city towards the centre. Hours later the same channels were brim full of videos of abandoned vehicles and cowed, young prisoners of war. Once again, a big Russian assault had failed.Stanislav Gluzman, an IT entrepreneur who lives in the centre of Kharkiv, a city of 1.5m, said that the Russians must have thought “that Ukrainian forces would capitulate fast and people would be glad to see them.” An advance guard column, he added, had come within 450m of the city’s well-known statue to a Ukrainian national hero and poet, Taras Schevchenko, before being ambushed outside a supermarket. According to a local security official, dozens of Russians were taken prisoner. By mid-afternoon Ukrainian soldiers were laying siege to Specialised School 134, 5km from the city centre. Inside the building were Russian soldiers who had earlier fled from their armoured cars—a convoy of at least four—after they were ambushed by Ukrainian fighters. Two more soldiers were reported to have been taken prisoner. Dramatic footage shared with The Economist by a friend of a soldier fighting at the school showed Ukrainian troops shooting, a terrified young Russian prisoner and Ukrainian soldiers running across the road to unload arms and supplies from the attackers’ vehicles. Their doors open, they had been abandoned rather than stopped by any missiles. Maria Avdeeva, an analyst who also lives close to the centre, said the Russians had entered the city in small groups, but Ukrainian forces were waiting to repel them. “The Ukrainian military started to destroy them” almost immediately, she said. As evening fell the sounds of battle had receded to Kharkiv’s airport and elsewhere on the city’s outskirts. Ms Avdeeva was most struck by the sight of Russian captives seen in videos. “They look like kids! They say they were brought here from Russia’s Far East and were told they were going on a training exercise.” She added: “They were ordered to come here and they were not ready. They were not prepared for fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces. Maybe they thought Ukrainian soldiers would not fight and they could just come here easily but now, with every hour, as civilians are getting killed people are getting angrier and angrier and more united against this aggression.”Russia’s failure to take Kharkiv has bolstered Ukrainian morale, even if the city is not yet safe. Further attacks, with more troops and heavier armour, could yet prove much harder to deal with. Kharkiv is strategically important for its roads and railway connections to the rest of the country. Ms Avdeeva said that she fears Vladimir Putin, whom she said had “lost touch with reality”, might order the shelling of civilian areas in order to create panic. Meanwhile the fighting for Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, has continued. On February 26th authorities there introduced a curfew until the morning of the 28th. Those 36 hours were needed, they said, to find and take out special-forces groups that have supposedly infiltrated the city. Anyone without permission to be outside would be considered spies. Reports of mistaken identity and corpses on the streets have since emerged. The city remains under reasonably secure Ukrainian control, although Russian tanks are closing in and the prospect of encirclement is real. Overnight, Russian armoured vehicles were seen at Bucha, usually a cosy resort village to the north-west of Kyiv. Video footage suggested that at least part of the column was later destroyed by the Ukrainians. “Die in hell, you bastards,” declared one videographer, voicing an increasingly widespread sentiment among Ukrainians towards their invaders. The mauled military steel of those vehicles carried a new marking, a “V”, distinct from the “Z” that many assumed to mean Zelensky. Ukrainian authorities have suggested that the V column represented a particularly dangerous threat. “Anyone who knows its location should send data to Ukrainian defenders or if possible impede their further travel,” their message said. “It is vitally important.” So far Russian forces have been unable to take control of any of Kyiv’s airfields, despite attacking at least four of them. Battles near the Vasylkiv airbase to the south-west of Kyiv remain particularly sharp. Early on February 27th a missile ignited a fuel tank, which has since been left to burn. Another missile was reported to have hit the grounds of a nuclear-waste facility, although not the storage areas themselves. A children’s hospital in central Kyiv came under gunfire; one child was killed. It is impossible to say if the targeting was deliberate. When the attack began Natalya Tyshchuk, 36, was inside the hospital with her three-month-old prematurely born daughter. Baby in arms she took cover under the windowsill, then ran down three flights to the bomb shelter. Four terrifying nights have made this second nature. Staff have done their best to make the underground cover comfortable, she said. There are intensive-care cots there, along with food and water. The same care has not been taken elsewhere. The swift implementation of the curfew has left many people isolated, with local aid workers reporting that as many as 10,000 people are underground in Kyiv’s metro system with neither food nor water. On February 26th Ukrainian railways appealed to local businesses to supply essentials to the 600 people using Kyiv’s central station as a shelter. A few trains are still running in a western direction, with priority given to women, children and the elderly. It seems unlikely they will run for much longer. But with its two largest cities still in the government’s hands, Ukraine has survived a fourth day of Mr Putin’s war. 
10  ON THE MORNING of February 26th Volodymyr Zelensky posted a video of himself on Twitter. After a night of the worst fighting Kyiv had seen since the second world war, and of propaganda from Moscow claiming that he had fled the capital in fear, Ukraine’s president emerged from his office red-eyed and unshaven. He was holding a smartphone in his right hand as he filmed himself walking past the House with Chimaeras, a famous Kyiv landmark that serves as the presidential residence. He smiled at the camera and declared: “Good morning to all Ukrainians! There are a lot of fakes out there…[but] I am here.”Mr Zelensky looked exhausted, but happy: happy to be alive, happy that Kyiv had not fallen and happy to play the role of a national leader, holding his nerve and his country together in the darkest hour of its 30-year history as an independent state. That was not the role he had chosen, but the one that was thrust upon him when Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24th. He has carried it off with dignity, strength and a dash of humour. When America offered to airlift him to safety, he retorted: “The fight is here; I need anti-tank ammo, not a ride.”The night before, speaking in Moscow, Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, had pledged to rub out Mr Zelensky. Ukraine’s president is a native Russian-speaker of Jewish heritage. Nonetheless, seething with hatred, Mr Putin called him and his government “drug-taking Nazis”.The contrast between those two pronouncements could hardly be more striking. If, as Mr Putin once wrote, Ukraine is the anti-Russia, then Mr Zelensky is everything Mr Putin is not. He is young and charismatic. He has been embraced by his own people and by the world. And he is fighting for his country not in the name of a dark imperial fantasy, but out of the conviction that Ukraine is sovereign and independent.Mr Zelensky was born in 1978 in Kryvyi Rih, a Soviet-looking, industrial city in the south-east of Ukraine, a centre of iron mining and metallurgy. His favourite film was “Once Upon a Time in America”. To survive among the town’s knife-wielding gangs, you had to have a sense of humour, chutzpah and a posse that had your back. Mr Zelensky had  these things, in abundance. He burst onto the political scene in 2019. He was not a candidate of Ukrainian-speaking western Ukraine nor of the Russian-speaking east. Instead, he rejected the linguistic, historical and ethnic split that has long been exploited both by Ukrainian politicians and by the Kremlin. Partly as a result, he has brought the country closer together than it has been for years. Mr Zelensky was driven neither by nationalism nor ideology. Nor was he a revolutionary. He was Everyman.In a country where politics was an extension of business and where parliament was a forum in which different elites traded with each other, Mr Zelensky had one asset that trumped money, parties and television channels. He had popularity and a stage persona that appealed to people who were tired of war, scheming and the cynicism of their elites. They fell in love not so much with him, but with his fairy-tale television character, Holoborodko, a plain-talking schoolteacher who had miraculously been transformed into the president. Whereas his predecessor, Petro Poroshenko, an oligarch, donned military uniform and campaigned on the slogan of “Language, army, faith”, Mr Zelensky recorded videos with a clown’s red nose. “I challenged…our elites’ [politics]. They called me a clown. I am a clown, and I am very proud of it.” But his message was serious: they were fooling people. He was being honest.Mr Zelensky entered the real presidency with few clear plans other than to make things better. He had only a vague idea of how to do so. Some of his former aides have said that he had not expected to win.In the third year of his presidency and in the third day of the invasion, this actor-turned politician is fast becoming a hero. “Zelensky is fighting like a lion and the whole of Ukraine with him,” says Sevgil Musaeva, a Ukrainian journalist and the editor of Ukrainska Pravda, the country’s main online news site. Yet only a few weeks earlier many Ukrainians and foreigners had been treating Mr Zelensky with condescension and pity. As Russian pressure mounted and Mr Putin threatened Ukraine with war, he had seemed out of his depth. His popularity was falling, investors and oligarchs were fleeing Ukraine and foreign leaders were nudging him to compromise with the Kremlin over the humiliating Minsk accords signed by his predecessor at the barrel of a gun in 2015. Many doubted that a former comedian was the right man for a country about to be invaded.However, in the cauldron of the battle, Mr Zelensky has been saved by his gift as an actor. His ability to respond to the audience is precisely what has enabled him to embody the role of a real national leader in a time of war. He can mirror and project people’s fears, desires and dreams. Ukraine has come together after the invasion. He is as much inspired by the spirit of his people as he inspires them.Likewise, the reason he could not accede to Russia’s demands over the Minsk accords was not because he was made of steel. It was because he was flexible and astute enough to know that his country would have swept him aside if he had.Mr Zelensky is a representation of Ukraine, not as idealised myth but as reality. Like the country he leads, Mr Zelensky is far from perfect and he is often frustrating. Over the past few decades Ukraine has slowly been discovering what it is to be a democracy. Unlike Russia, it is a place where people elect their presidents and kick them out if they fail.In his presidential victory speech in 2019, Mr Zelensky nodded to this reality, and the example it set: “To all the countries of the former Soviet Union: look at us, everything is possible.” Perhaps it was that line that made him Mr Putin’s most dangerous enemy. In the same way, during the crisis today he has appealed to the Russian people who have protested against the fratricidal war that is being waged in their name: “Stop those who lie to you, who lie to us, who lie to the whole world.”His response to Mr Putin’s rambling, hour-long national address on February 21st, which amounted to a declaration of war, was short and punchy: “We don’t have time for lengthy history lectures, I am not going to talk about the past. Let me tell you about the present and the future. The internationally recognised borders of Ukraine will stay as they are. We will remain calm and confident.” The outpouring of support from the world, people as well as politicians, and their disgust at Russia’s war are keeping spirits high. Standing outside the House with Chimaeras on that bright morning, with the blue sky behind him, Mr Zelensky again sounded a defiant note: “We will be defending our country, because our weapon is truth, and our truth is that this is our land, our country, our children, and we will defend  this.” If fortune favours Mr Zelensky, it is because he carries the virtue that Mr Putin lacks: he speaks the truth for his people. 
11  WHEN RUSSIA’S president sends 190,000 troops to invade your country, which he refers to as “historically Russian lands”, one logical place of retreat stands out. That is Lviv, a city that was Polish from 1918 to 1939 and part of other central European states before that. It is a place of baroque buildings, art academies and fiercely anti-Russian sentiment. Its location, in the far west of the country, could make it the last place in Ukraine that Russia tries to conquer. That makes it appealing not just for those fleeing the rest of the country, but also for those eyeing up a potential seat for Ukraine’s government if Vladimir Putin’s forces manage to seize the capital, Kyiv.Life in Lviv is not completely untouched by the war. The town has not yet been the site of any fighting, but shops and restaurants are mostly shut and some have been boarded up. Long queues snake from every cash machine. Air-raid sirens blare during the day and a curfew begins at 10pm each night. Checkpoints have sprouted up on the city’s edges. Nerves jangled on February 26th after reports said that Russian helicopters and 60 paratroopers showed up several hundred kilometres west of Kyiv, suggesting that Russia might try to cut off Lviv from the rest of the country. Yet patriotic spirit remains strong. Ukrainian flags are draped from windows on quiet streets. A volunteer network has sprung up to assist those arriving from the rest of the country. Local university students are rolling out mattresses on their dormitory floors for compatriots with nowhere to go. The shops which remain open do so thanks to fearless workers plugging on. At SDV, a café in the city centre, the owner makes cappuccinos and operates the till with one hand while clutching her infant child in the other.Some Ukrainians fleeing the fighting have opted to retreat to small towns and villages where relatives live, in the hope that the war passes them by. But for others Lviv is a better redoubt. Russian forces may not seek to occupy it at all and, if they do, it is close to Poland, an EU and NATO country that is welcoming Ukrainian refugees. But there is just one good road to Lviv from the capital, and traffic jams extend for kilometres. Some drivers are running out of fuel en route. Other refugees have hopped onto packed trains.Yuliia Silyuk, a fresh arrival, did not have time to pack everything when she fled Kharkiv at dawn on February 24th. Now she cannot get what she needs in Lviv. “I was looking for socks but everything is closed,” she says. Ms Silyuk’s family drove for 27 hours to reach the city. “We were lucky to get here so quickly. Our colleagues left later, they are still driving,” she says. She will head on to Poland with her children, but her husband, a man of military age, is barred from leaving the country under martial law. Long-term accommodation is hard to come by. Dmytro Hidulianov, a phone sales attendant, moved to Lviv from Kyiv days before war broke out. He complains about paying rent in two places, before pausing to wonder whether anyone will be collecting rent in Kyiv on March 1st. “I tried to book an apartment, they are really hard to find,” he says. He is paying nightly to stay in a pricey hotel (by Ukrainians’ standards). Despite the squeeze, prices have risen by only 10-20%, says Mariia, an estate agent. “Not everyone makes business from this,” she says. The idea that Lviv could be a Ukrainian haven was cemented in mid-February when most big Western embassies relocated their staff from Kyiv to hotels in the city. But in recent days many have moved on again, this time across the border into Poland and Moldova. Many residents, and those arriving, hope the city is peripheral to Mr Putin’s plans for Ukraine, which centre on Kyiv as the birthplace of Slavic civilisation a millennium ago. Many big firms have sent at least some of their board members to Lviv to work. But the Ukrainian government is not yet willing to retreat. The West is worried that by staying in Kyiv, top officials risk being killed—or forced under duress to agree to concessions they would never freely accept. But Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, is refusing to budge, saying he needs anti-tank ammunition, “not a ride”. Civil-society leaders in the capital are making plans to resist any government set up by Russia. The Ukrainian government does see the value of surviving even if Kyiv falls. To that end it has dispersed ministers around the country and beyond, says a diplomat. Lviv is the strongest domestic candidate for an alternative base, but a bolthole abroad is also an option. In 1939, after Hitler’s troops stormed Warsaw, the president of Poland moved his government to Kuty, a small town now in western Ukraine. It lasted less than a week there before relocating to Paris. Some in Lviv put faith in the notion that Russia knows how hated it is in western Ukraine, and so will not seek to occupy the area. It has long been considered a stronghold of Ukrainian nationalism. In the late 19th century, notes Yaroslav Hrytsak, a historian in Lviv, when the Russian tsar on two occasions banned the speaking of Ukrainian between his subjects, many Ukrainian nationalists hopped over to Lviv, then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, where no such rules applied.But nowhere in Ukraine feels secure at the moment. “Today every city must be prepared,” says Andriy Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv, speaking mid-raid from a bunker full of children’s artwork beneath the town hall. “I don’t think Lviv is completely safe, but we are prepared,” says Irina, a pharmacist who was born in the city, from the back of a queue to withdraw cash. She has a bag packed, ready for a hasty departure. 
12  THE LAST time that Russian forces fought their way into Kyiv was the autumn of 1943, when the Red Army crossed the Dnieper river and seized the city from Nazi Germany. On November 4th that year, German defences collapsed and Soviet tanks poured into the Ukrainian capital. Almost 80 years on, Russian armoured forces are back.As the third day of the current war in Ukraine drew to a close, Russia intensified pressure on three population centres: Kyiv, the capital; Kharkiv in the north-east; and Kherson in the south. In  them, Ukrainian resistance was fierce. A large number of destroyed or abandoned Ukrainian vehicles were visible east of Kherson, though the city was said to be contested still on Saturday evening local time. There was also heavy fighting in Mykolaiv, further west, and just 110km from the key port of Odessa. Russian forces in the south also moved east towards Mariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov that is claimed by the “People’s Republic of Donetsk”, one of a pair of Russian-backed statelets in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. In Kharkiv, images and videos posted on social-media showed burnt-out Russian howitzers, with shells and cluster-munition casings lying in the street.The most important battle was, again, for Kyiv. Russia failed to seize an airport on its outskirts on February 24th, the first day of the war. The next day saw fighting on the edges of the city, probably involving Russian paratroopers and special forces. Video footage taken on February 26th indicated fighting deeper into the city. Ukraine’s government also claims to have shot down two Russian transport planes, one of them near Vasylkiv, south-west of Kyiv, as well as several warplanes (this could not be independently confirmed). Despite its impressive resistance, the city faced the prospect of imminent encirclement. Russian forces in Belarus are moving south, towards Kyiv, on several axes to the east and the west of the city. British defence intelligence said on February 26th that the bulk of those forces were now within 30km of Kyiv, having advanced 20km since the previous day. Residents of Kyiv dug trenches, prepared fortifications and built improvised tank traps. Ukrainian authorities continued to blow up bridges around the city to impede Russian incursions. Yet even as it massed forces around Kyiv, Russia’s strategy to subjugate the city remained unclear. One option would be for Russian battalion tactical groups or BTGs—the fighting formations of Russia’s ground forces—to halt on the outskirts of the city, essentially mounting a siege until Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, surrendered and ordered his troops to lay down their arms. Yet Mr Zelensky’s defiant videos from the capital’s streets, and his refusal to heed American entreaties to fall back to the western city of Lviv, suggest that he will not give up easily. For a siege to be effective it also has to block all entries and exits to a city, “otherwise you will see continued influx of weapons, supplies and reinforcements,” says Rita Konaev of Georgetown University. Russia learned that lesson during the first Chechen war, in the mid-1990s, she says: “We will be seeing a more extensive aerial and artillery bombardment campaign before anything else.” Russia may ultimately be drawn into the city to seize crucial sites and overthrow the government directly. But Kyiv has the “perfect terrain to defend”, observes Anthony King of Warwick University, the author of “Urban Warfare in the Twenty-First Century”. It is large, dense, bisected by a river, criss-crossed with roads and rail lines and has an extensive metro and sewer system that could be used by defenders, says Mr King, who adds that the only consolation for Russia is the relatively flat terrain. “It could be a terrible strategic mistake by Vladimir Putin because he’s underestimated the urban problem.” Franz-Stefan Gady of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank in London, points out that attackers in built-up areas are thought to require an advantage in manpower of six to one—a figure that originates in the Soviet experience during the second world war—far higher than that assumed for combat in open terrain. British doctrine demands ten to one. The problem for Russia is that its BTGs tend to be heavy on artillery and light on infantry, according to a study published in 2017 by an American army officer in ARMOR, the official journal of the US Army’s armoured forces. That lopsided structure can compel Russian commanders to turn to light-infantry militias. But when Russia tried that in eastern Ukraine in 2014-15, arming and aiding pro-Russian separatists, they struggled to defeat Ukrainian defenders in critical battles, including one for Mariupol. Russian commanders in that conflict often opted for “prolonged sieges”, with heavy use of artillery and rocket fire, instead of ground assaults. The Russian invasion force includes heavy mortars and artillery pieces, as well as Uragan and Smerch rocket launchers.Even Western armed forces with air superiority, large stocks of precision-guided munitions and greater sensitivity to civilian casualties have inflicted enormous damage to cities. In 2004 fighting between American forces and insurgents in Fallujah, in Iraq, damaged or destroyed 70% of the city’s buildings. When a coalition including Iraq, America and others liberated Mosul, another Iraqi city, from the Islamic State group in 2016-17, over 10,000 civilians were killed—around 3,200 of them by the coalition—and two-fifths of the civilian population had to flee. It was also lethal for those on the ground: Iraq’s army suffered 10,000 casualties.  this bodes ill for Kyiv and its inhabitants. On February 25th Mr Putin seemed to offer a pretext for attack, ominously accusing Ukrainian “neo-Nazis” of placing heavy weapons in the centre of Kyiv and Kharkiv, “acting in the same way that terrorists act all over the world—using people as shields”. The scale of fighting in Kyiv could compare to Grozny, warns Mr King, referring to the terrible damage that befell the Chechen capital—a far smaller city than Kyiv—during two wars with Russia. In the first of those battles, he notes, Chechen forces cleverly let Russians enter the city and travel to its centre—after which they unleashed mobile “hunter-killer” squads on the intruders. The first Russian armoured column that entered Grozny on New Year’s eve in 1994 lost 105 of its 120 tanks. Russian deaths probably numbered in the thousands. When the city was besieged and assaulted again several years later, in a war overseen by Mr Putin, Russian casualties were lower but several thousand civilians were killed. So far, Russia’s defence ministry has not reported a single casualty in Ukraine; the Ukrainians claim there have been large numbers. The pretence of a bloodless war is already becoming impossible to sustain. There have been numerous anti-war protests in Russia, especially in Moscow and St Petersburg, though the authorities are cracking down hard. Should the army have to battle its way bloodily though Kyiv, that would be plain for Russians, and the world, to see. 
13  IT WAS EARLY morning when a missile perforated the clear blue skies, before crashing into a high-rise in south-western Kyiv, gouging a chunk out of its upper stories, destroying several flats, and sending debris raining onto the street below. Two hours after the strike on Lobanovskyi Avenue, firemen were still struggling to extinguish fires. Miraculously, there had been no deaths, and only a handful of people had suffered light injuries. The reason was perhaps less luck than the consequence of Kyiv’s citizens disappearing en masse to basements, bomb shelters, the metro; or leaving the city altogether.The night had been hard. At its onset, President Volodymyr Zelensky warned of an imminent assault on the city. “We have to endure this,” he said. When they came, the attacks arrived from many fronts. Russian forces attempted to capture a power station in the north-western district of Troeshina. There were strikes on Ukraine’s cyber-command; but its cyber-warriors are well distributed. A Russian armoured column managed to make its way along Victory Avenue, an east-west artery leading to the centre. There were new attempts to land paratroopers and secure a base to fly in troops for a big assault. None of this was completely successful. When dawn broke, it became clear that Kyiv had survived another night.During a history-changing three days the city has turned from a vibrant European capital of 3m people into something that looks like a zombie apocalypse. Gone are the rest of the world’s problems of traffic jams, rising rents, and overbooked restaurants. Instead, people are wondering where to find food; what to do when electricity and internet go down; how to avoid being shot—either by Russian special forces or by the thousands of inexperienced and sleep-deprived Ukrainian irregulars waiting to pounce on the enemy. In the afternoon, Kyiv’s mayor Vitaly Klitschko said the situation remained “threatening,” with Russian special forces scuttling around the city; the burned-out jeeps and shattered glass offered the evidence. He announced a three-day curfew starting at 5pm; any civilians outside after that time would be presumed to be Russian infiltrators, and might be shot on sight. In an underground garage opposite the Lobanovskyi high-rise were scores of people who had spent a nervous night or who had come down to the makeshift bomb shelter in the wake of the hit. Yeva, a 17-year-old student, said that there were 16 floors in her block of flats. As the invasion started, her neighbours talked of sticking together. Now she thought that there might be only 15 people left in her entire building. Her neighbours had all fled Kyiv “like rats,” she said, contemptuously. Her family was staying put because “this is our home and this is our country.” With Russian armoured columns now 30km from the city, and advancing from at least three directions, those who have not fled have little choice but to brace and hope for the best. Overnight, Ukrainian forces blew up a key bridge on the Zhytomyr highway to impede the advance, but at the same time cutting off a crucial escape route to the west. Road signs were being taken down as a way of disorienting the invasion force. Citizens, meanwhile, were encouraged to take matters into their own hands. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, called on Ukrainians to look out for “suspicious men” who might be working as spotters for artillery strikes. He said Moscow was changing tactics—targeting residential areas, hospitals, schools and universities. Over the course of February 25th, Russian state media had streamed fake news claiming that Mr Zelensky had left the capital. But while the focus on him is understandable, Russia would be wise to expect determined resistance from many citizens even if he leaves. In a large industrial basement in central Kyiv, dozens of volunteers were clustered in groups making Molotov cocktails with which to greet the invaders. Some of them used funnels to pour petrol into wine or vodka bottles, while others added washing-up liquid or used car-oil. Some crumbled polystyrene packaging into balls. Added to the fuel, the polystyrene makes it “more efficient” explained Kuman, aged 48, who described himself as a “high-class dentist.” Like most of the others in the makeshift factory, he said this was the first time he had ever prepared explosives. Up at street level, sandbags protected the entrance to the offices of a political outfit that has its own militia affiliated with the security forces. Armed men milled around outside or lounged in chairs by a table laden with croissants and salads, waiting for a call to action. “ us are veterans of the war in Donbas,” explained Peter Kuzyk, aged 42, a local politician and publisher. He said they had seen action on February 24th on the outskirts of Kyiv, and had captured two Russian soldiers who had been turned over to the security services. Across town, past a police barricade of tyres, there was shooting and shouting beneath the Lobanovskyi Avenue block. Two men cowered on the ground in front of others aiming pistols or Kalashnikovs at them. It was a case of mistaken identity; far from being Russian infiltrators in a small white van, they appeared to be foreign students trying to escape the city. They were swiftly released. The jitters are understandable, given that the territorial defence forces now patrolling Kyiv are mostly novices. Konstantin Reutsky, 48, was an aid worker and war journalist; his commander was an architect. But all that was in a different life. He had spent the previous night taking part in a cat-and-mouse search for Russians, he said. He would stick it out to the end. A native of Luhansk, since 2014 under the control of Kremlin-backed separatists, Mr Reutsky is not going to let the Russian president push him from his home a second time. “It’s sad that things have come to this, but it was also obvious it would,” he said. “Russia will keep pushing, and keep pushing, right until Putin’s regime falls.” 
14  BELEAGUERED AND almost alone in his party’s headquarters, abandoned by its powerbrokers and most of its MPs, a bemused Pablo Casado this week suffered the implosion of his leadership of the People’s Party (PP), Spain’s mainstream conservative opposition. At a meeting that lasted into the early hours of February 24th, the party’s regional barons allowed him to save face by staying on as a figurehead until an emergency party congress on April 2nd. In return he agreed to back as his successor Alberto Núñez Feijóo, the experienced president of the region of Galicia who is the consensus choice. A smooth transition matters not just to the PP but to Spain. Vox, a newish hard-right outfit, is snapping at the PP’s heels in polls, largely because of Mr Casado’s ineffectual leadership.Listen to this story.Two things precipitated Mr Casado’s fall. The first was his decision to force an early regional election in Castilla and León. Far from a hoped-for absolute majority, the PP achieved only a pyrrhic victory; the big winner was Vox. Then Mr Casado rounded on Isabel Díaz Ayuso, the president of Madrid’s regional government and a former protégé-turned-rival. He and his abrasive deputy, Teodoro García Egea, accused Ms Ayuso of corruption over a €1.5m ($1.7m) contract for face masks early in the pandemic from which her brother earned €56,000. She said she was not involved in the contract and her brother had long worked in health procurement. A prosecutor has opened an investigation.Although Ms Ayuso was damaged by the revelation, Mr Casado had declared a war he could not win. The leader of the party’s libertarian wing, she is the party’s popular darling, having handsomely won a snap regional election last year. Several thousand of her fans demonstrated outside PP headquarters. After angry meetings Mr Casado sacrificed Mr Egea, an apparatchik widely hated in the party. But it was not enough for his critics. “I don’t know why I have to go,” Mr Casado reportedly told a colleague. “I have done nothing.” That only went to show his lack of political awareness.Mr Casado became leader at the age of just 37 when he won a party primary in 2018. An eloquent orator and an amiable man with no experience in government, he has never seemed up to the job. Instead of setting out an alternative to Pedro Sánchez’s left-wing coalition, he merely sniped at it while steering an erratic course of his own. That left Vox to benefit from widespread discontent with Mr Sánchez’s handling of the pandemic and the slowness of the economic recovery. Vox’s support has climbed to 21% in the latest polls, which give the PP 22%.Mr Feijóo is a conciliatory centrist. He has won four consecutive absolute majorities in Galicia, keeping Vox out of the regional parliament there. Many expected him to stand for the leadership in 2018, but he apparently considered the party too divided. Spanish political leaders tend to cling on despite defeat. The Socialists went through a similar bloodletting in 2016, with Mr Sánchez being ousted and then winning back his job. But there will almost certainly be no way back for Mr Casado. His parting gift to the PP has been to unite it, against himself. 
15  CLEVER ROAD cyclists who run out of puff keep up the pace by discreetly tucking themselves behind faster riders. Carried by this slipstream, it is easy to get comfortable, if not outright lazy. Why expend the effort needed to forge ahead if you can get away with this dolce vita? Occasionally laggards have to soothe the tired (and increasingly irate) front-runner with a vague pledge to “pull their weight”. That seems like a small price to pay. Only much later, perhaps ensconced in the comfort of a peloton, does the realisation dawn that staying too long in the rear means blindly following someone else down a road not necessarily of your choosing.Listen to this story.Europe is the free-rider continent. For decades its defence has been underpinned by America—leaving it in a supporting role even as war breaks out on its own borders. Economically it has piggybacked on innovation from elsewhere, keeping up with rivals, not forging ahead. Even the feel-good environmental ambitions crafted in Brussels are made possible in part by importing from afar the products once made in carbon-spewing factories Europe shut down long ago. How clever it seems to some. All this money saved and effort outsourced has made it possible to live a fine life while working 35-hour weeks and retiring in one’s prime.Defence is where criticism of Europe’s ways has been loudest—and where it is currently being most acutely felt. The combined military spending in the 34 European countries that are part of either NATO or the EU is less than half that of America’s, despite a bigger economic output and nearly twice the population. Europeans in NATO spend only 1.7% of GDP on their armed forces, well short of the 2% NATO target and the 3.5% America splurges. Big countries like Germany (1.5%), Italy (1.4%) and Spain (just 1%) slink away when the subject comes up. That is despite a swell of new military spending following America indicating it was pivoting to Asia a decade ago, not to mention the terrifying prospect of having Donald Trump be the guarantor of anything important.Worse, when it comes to gauging the ability of an army to do anything beyond its borders, a lot of Europe’s spending is wasted on dozens of redundant national schemes. Too much goes on pensions rather than on advanced kit. The run-up to the war in Ukraine demonstrated these shortcomings. It was overwhelmingly America that undertook basic military tasks such as surveillance flights. Europe was left to whinge about whether it got sufficient access to the intelligence it did little to produce.All the money not spent on guns makes for more butter. Europe could have invested the savings in pioneering innovation. But there also it has preferred to stay tucked in behind others. EU countries spend a third less on research and development than America or Japan, as a share of GDP, and are out-invested even by China nowadays. Economic theory dictates that poorer countries converge with richer ones as they learn to mimic their ways. One bit of the world persistently defies the possibilities of this “catch-up” growth: western Europeans were a quarter poorer than Americans in 1990, and remain a quarter poorer today. They work less, and enjoy the slipstream of those who toil harder.Et alors?, Europeans might ask. Plenty of them scoff at America’s cut-throat capitalist model, not to mention the Chinese one. But economists, including Daron Acemoglu, point out that such winner-takes-all systems create the conditions for innovation that Europe then adopts on the cheap. And indeed the cuddly form of capitalism embraced in Europe has markedly failed to create world-beating companies. Big tech firms are all American or, increasingly, Asian. Pharmaceutical breakthroughs are financed by the high prices paid by American patients (and backed by abundant venture capital); government-run health systems in Europe then bulk-buy the same drugs for much less. Europe has had some successes—German companies were among those pioneering mRNA vaccines—but most of the cutting-edge research in science and technology is done at universities and companies elsewhere.Even the EU’s efforts to cut its carbon footprint depend on the work done by others. The pledge by the bloc to reach “net zero” by 2050 is a fine ambition. But part of the progress already made is an illusion. Per capita emissions in Denmark, say, have fallen by about half since 2000. But the pollution it imports—in goods that used to be made there, but whose manufacturing is now outsourced to China and other places—has surged in the same period. Take the extra carbon its imports have generated in other countries into account and Danish emissions are down by just one-third, according to data from the Global Carbon Project, a research outfit. A scheme has been mooted to tax carbon emissions embedded in products brought into the bloc, but is yet to be agreed.Stuck in the wheel with youIt is the foot-dragging on defence that is garnering the most attention now. The evacuation debacle in Afghanistan in August was a reminder of Europe’s inability to do much without America. But the outbreak of war in Ukraine brings the point home, literally. It was America that took the lead in sounding the alarm, not the EU. It was also America that shuffled troops around the continent in a vain attempt to deter Russia. Emmanuel Macron of France provocatively alluded to the impending “brain death” of NATO in 2019 to spur Europeans into taking responsibility for their own defence. The French president should be thankful that the alliance seems to have snapped back to life. For all his pining for “strategic autonomy”—the idea that Europe should be able to forge its own way in the world—America is firmly in the lead, and the Europeans are united in following.Europe realises that being in the peloton has its limitations. But to be a leader requires resources and purpose. Mr Putin’s decision to go to war has stirred a sense of unity among a bundle of rival polities more often squabbling within an imperfect union. Being a follower might not seem so bad after all.

16  IT HAD BEEN billed as the trial of the century. It would spotlight Pope Francis’s determination to stamp out financial jiggery-pokery by establishing whether and how the Vatican was tricked and extorted out of tens of millions of euros in a botched property deal. Among the defendants was a “prince of the church”: Cardinal Angelo Becciu (pictured), former deputy head of the Vatican’s most exalted department, the Secretariat of State. Yet seven months after Cardinal Becciu and nine other defendants were arraigned in court in the Vatican, not a word of evidence has been heard. The main outcome from seven preliminary hearings has been awkward questions about the genial pontiff’s respect for the rule of law.Listen to this story.The case centres on the Secretariat of State’s purchase and subsequent sale of a commercial property in London—transactions in which more than €100m ($113m) in donations collected from the faithful were lost. Like previous Vatican financial scandals, this one is richly spiced with improbable detail. The latest twist to emerge is that in 2019, shortly before the scandal broke, Pope Francis signed an edict authorising the Vatican’s prosecutors to use wiretaps that were placed on Italian subjects in Italy.The edict was among four, known in Latin as rescripta, signed by the pontiff between July 2019 and February 2020 at the request of the prosecutors overseeing the investigation into the property deal. The rescripta exempted them from several limitations placed on them by the Vatican’s legal code. Unlike all previous papal rescripta, they were kept secret.The edicts are now at the heart of the courtroom wrangles that have so far delayed the case. Defence counsel have argued for the charges against their clients to be dismissed on two grounds. Firstly, that the rescripta in effect suspended the rule of law in the Vatican, vitiating any investigations conducted while they were effect. The second is that, armed with pontifical waivers, the prosecution acted with a contempt for the rules that violated the defendants’ rights to a fair trial. The prosecutors are still refusing to comply fully with an order by the presiding judge to hand over to the defence all the evidence collected. They argue that the omissions are to shield the reputations of the accused. And, of course, they have the backing, if not of God, then of the man Catholics believe is His earthly representative.
17  THE WARNINGS began early on the morning of February 25th. Russian special forces were in Kyiv, the authorities said, and they were trying to seize power. Some of the visitors might even have acquired Ukrainian military vehicles; others could be pretending to be international observers. In Podil, a historic neighbourhood in the centre of the city, where the sound of church bells was periodically interrupted by explosions and gunfire, Ukrainian forces opened fire on two military vehicles believed to be Russian. Whether they were the enemy or not is debatable. The bullet-pierced windows and the pools of blood were not. As the day thundered on, officials increased the alarm. By lunchtime Vitaly Klitschko, the mayor of the city, declared that Kyiv was moving into a new, defensive phase. The ministry of defence called on residents to stop Russian tanks with Molotov cocktails. In parts of the city, trucks were seen handing out rifles to anyone who would take them. Petro Poroshenko, a former president, gave interviews with a Kalashnikov in hand, surrounded by a dozen soldiers with machine guns and British-Swedish made NLAW anti-tank weapons. This is a real war, and the whole of the city is on edge. The fiercest fighting has been concentrated in eastern and northern districts, where Ukrainian forces were able to stop Russian tank advances, though only after retreating and destroying three bridges. In the northern suburb of Obolon, life for all but the bravest has been driven underground. Kristina Berdynskikh, a prominent Ukrainian journalist, is one of hundreds who have made the local metro station her home. Those who have hunkered down with her are cold, sad and anxious.Intensifying street battles saw the metro station fill to capacity. At one point, staff had to close the doors; they shepherded people to stops further down the line. Ms Berdynskikh saw one man rush in with his young son. They had witnessed heavy fighting as Ukrainian forces battled Russian armoured vehicles. As Ms Berdynskikh reported: “We talked about the best way of getting to Poland.” Olena, a 32-year-old photographer, explained that she had moved to her boyfriend’s flat on February 24th, thinking his district was safer than Obolon. The next morning a huge explosion blew in their front windows, sending shards of glass flying across the room. They were lucky. Flats on lower storeys of the block were destroyed. The explosion, in which no one was killed, was probably caused by part of a Russian missile that had been intercepted by Ukrainian forces. Another such interception was captured in dramatic film footage that circulated widely on social media. “It was horrible,” Olena said. “I can’t believe what is happening.” Friends are moving out of Kyiv, but she is determined to stay. Her defiance is not shared by everyone in the building. Maxim, an 18-year-old student whose home was destroyed, said that about half the block’s residents blamed the Russians for what was happening and half blamed their own government. The authorities should accept the demands of Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, he argues: “Putin is a God. He is a very strong politician.” In the city centre the streets are eerily deserted. Supermarkets and pharmacies, which had remained open on the first day of the war, have closed. The areas nearest to government buildings have been heavily fortified. Anti-aircraft systems stand opposite the presidential administration building, where President Volodymyr Zelensky is reported to be hunkering down in a deep bunker. Mr Zelensky has declared himself to be the main target for the Russian armed forces, and has vowed not to leave. The intensifying fight for the capital suggests he is right. Western intelligence assessments have long suggested that Russian forces will seek the “decapitation” of the government and the installation of a puppet regime.Many feared that Mr Zelensky, a former comedian and political novice, would prove unsuited to the task of defending a country under attack. But the charismatic president has cast himself on social media as a gritty and determined wartime leader. A selfie video posted to Facebook on February 25th shows him in Kyiv with his team huddled behind him. The message—“We are here, we are defending Ukraine”—dispelled any notion that his government might be on the run. Mr Putin was doubtless promised a short war by his generals; he has failed to achieve a lightning one. His elite paratroopers appear to be faltering in their attempt to take the Antonov airstrip in Hostomel, 10km from Kyiv’s northern suburbs. Control of it has shifted back and forth, and the landing strip has been badly damaged, making its use as a staging post for an airborne assault on central Kyiv difficult. Andriy Zagorodnyuk, who as Ukraine’s defence minister in 2019-20 was responsible for plans to defend the capital, says urban warfare offers no guarantees for Mr Putin. The city contains all kinds of hiding places for portable anti-tank weapons, he notes. But the Russian leader’s biggest error, he argues, was in his assessment of ordinary Ukrainians: “He will face severe resistance as nobody in Kyiv supports the invasion.” Mr Putin looked frustrated on February 25th as he called on Ukrainian soldiers to complete his task themselves. “Take power into your own hands!” he said. In a way, that is what they have been doing.
18  AS THE SUN set over the Kremlin on the first day of Russia’s war against Ukraine, Moscow felt tense. Black cars with tinted windows, flashing lights and police escorts zipped around the city centre. Police vans pushed ordinary cars to the side of the road. It was as though Moscow itself was coming under attack.And the “attack” did come, a couple of hours later as several thousand people, mostly young, poured onto the streets holding signs condemning the war their president had unleashed against their brothers and sisters in Ukraine. They chanted, “Net voine” (“No to war”). The same words were splashed with paint on the glass doors of the Russian state Duma, the parliament that had almost unanimously supported the invasion. The protesters’ faces were crestfallen, gripped by dismay and grief. And they were met with brutality. Helmeted riot police pushed them to the ground and bundled them into vans. Gregory Yudin, a sociologist and left-wing philosopher, was beaten and taken to a police cell before finally being transferred to hospital. On February 24th some 1,700 people were arrested, half of them in Moscow. But anti-war protests also rolled through the country from Siberia to St Petersburg, where more people were detained the following day. The protests lacked political leadership and organisation, and were not big enough to prompt the authorities to reconsider the war. But they expressed the dominant feeling among Russia’s educated class. “Pain, fury and shame–these are three words that define our attitude to what is going on,” a statement from the dwindling band of independent media outlets read. While on the surface life in Moscow carried on as normal, underneath for many there was a sense that something had changed. On the streets, people stopped to check their social media and watch video streams. In cafés, young people sat in stunned silence, shocked that their country had unleashed war on a neighbour. Journalists, artists, celebrities, rockstars and bloggers have been speaking out. “Fear and pain,” wrote Ivan Urgant, a popular host on state-owned television, on his Instagram. Monetochka (“Little coin”), a pop star, published a photo of her own face, weeping, with a sign: “So ashamed!” So far there have been no resignations among senior officials, but neither has there been any enthusiasm for war. Sergei Utkin, a security expert who had previously peddled the Kremlin's line on foreign policy, wrote on Twitter, “My country is committing a horrible crime in Ukraine that can have no justification…We all bear a part of responsibility. There is no good way out of that.”A petition against the war has gathered 500,000 signatures in a single day, and is growing. Novaya Gazeta, Russia’s main pro-opposition newspaper, came out in two languages, Russian and Ukrainian. Its editor, Dmitry Muratov, the most recent winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, wrote that Mr Putin “is spinning a nuclear button around his finger like some expensive car key chain…But we can never recognise Ukraine as an enemy. And never will.”Like the Soviet invasion of Prague in 1968, which shaped the dissident movement in the Soviet Union, the invasion of Ukraine is a departure for Russian society. The sombre, shamed mood in Moscow could hardly be more different from the euphoria that gripped it in 2014 when Mr Putin seized and annexed Crimea. Then Russian society swelled with pride. Even those who recognised that the annexation was illegal admitted that the bloodless operation had been well executed. Mr Putin’s sagging popularity rating soared. His speech in St George’s Hall in the Kremlin was interrupted repeatedly by thunderous applause, standing ovations and chants of “Russia, Russia”. There were tears of joy. Large crowds celebrated the return of Russia’s lost imperial jewel. Dissenting voices, such as that of Boris Nemtsov, a liberal opposition politician who was later murdered in a street near the Kremlin, were drowned out by the patriotic frenzy.This time opinion polls by Levada, an independent pollster, show that the country is divided, with less than half of the population supporting Mr Putin’s recognition of two Potemkin republics in Ukraine–a precursor to the war. There are no public displays of support for Mr Putin’s invasion. Government propaganda, which dominates the state television and is also disseminated through YouTube channels and radio, is markedly different from in 2014. Its tone is aggrieved and defensive, not triumphant. It seeks to diminish the scale of the war (or “military operation” in the Kremlin’s parlance). The authorities are trying to steer Russians away from other sources of information. On February 25th the Kremlin limited access to Facebook and instructed the media to rely exclusively on official sources. Footage from Kyiv, where people are sheltering in metro stations, is rare. The Russian public did not want and was not prepared for this war. Indeed, the Kremlin had repeatedly insisted that it would not go to war in Ukraine.Mr Putin’s supporters are appealing not for celebration but for stoicism. Valentina Matvienko, the president of Russia’s upper chamber of parliament, who has gushingly backed Mr Putin’s every move, is now asking people to bear with the consequences. “Yes, it won’t be easy for some time to live through [Western sanctions] but we will try to reduce their effect,” she said on February 25th. Meanwhile, Russians rushed to their banks to take out dollars. Many electronics retailers have raised their prices by 30% as a result of the slump in the value of the rouble, and people are rushing to buy while stocks last. It is presumably not how Mr Putin imagined they would mark his crowning foreign foray. 
19  WHEN RUSSIA’S war on Ukraine began before dawn on Thursday, many expected blitzkrieg. Over 150,000 Russian soldiers were poised on Ukraine’s border; warplanes were massed in Belarus; paratroopers were at the ready. Yet in many ways, the war’s first two days have been less overwhelming.The Russian missile strikes that opened the war were relatively light, not the relentless onslaught that many had predicted. There were reports of dud missiles, too. One was seen lodged in the pavement in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. Russia did not wipe out Ukraine’s air force on the ground; planes were seen aloft throughout the first day of fighting. Ukrainian soldiers made good use of their Western-supplied anti-tank weapons, taking out plenty of armoured vehicles.Russia did make important advances. Its forces made deep thrusts in the south, with heavy fighting around Kherson, a strategic city on the Dnieper river. They also surrounded Kharkiv, in the east, and took Konotop, around 200km east of Kyiv. New thrusts seemed to materialise on February 25th. Video footage appeared to show Russian forces on the move in Stolin, southern Belarus, which would indicate an advance into western Ukraine, hundreds of kilometres west of Kyiv. There were also unconfirmed reports of fighting in Odessa, a southern port. Yet it was slower going than the Kremlin might have hoped. “Moscow’s thinking on this war seems to have been coloured by war optimism,” says Michael Kofman of CNA, a research group. “It looked as though Russian forces were expecting a quicker [Ukrainian] military collapse and easier gains.” British defence intelligence said that it was unlikely that Russia had achieved “its planned Day 1 military objectives”, noting that “Ukrainian forces have presented fierce resistance across all axes of Russia’s advance.” Britain also estimated that there had been 450 Russian casualties; Ukraine’s armed forces claimed thousands, though that seems unlikely. A Russian effort to grab an airport near Kyiv with a brazen helicopter assault was not a success, with Ukraine quickly recapturing the facility. It is thought to have changed hands several times. One source says that it is now back in Russian hands, though Ukraine has destroyed the runway itself.It is clear that Kyiv is the prize. Russia approached the capital from Belarus along several axes, both east and west of the capital, in a pincer movement. Not all were successful. An attack at Chernihiv, east of the Dnieper and 130km north-east of Kyiv, is thought to have foundered. Britain says that the “bulk” of Russian forces heading for Kyiv remained more than 50km from the city centre. Some advance forces did get there. At mid-morning, Ukraine’s armed forces warned that the enemy had reached Obolon, a north-western district of Kyiv, instructing residents to convey reports of troop movements and to “neutralise the occupier” with Molotov cocktails. Ukrainian television broadcast instructions for making them. Bridges around the city were blown up to slow down the Russians’ progress.Some analysts are pessimistic about the city’s prospects. “The situation does look dire at the moment,” wrote Konrad Muzyka of Rochan Consulting. If the capital were to fall, he notes, “the expectation is that all fighting Ukrainian units will surrender and that military operations will cease. This conflict may be shorter than anyone expected.” Others are less sure.A week before the war, the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank, published a report describing the substantial penetration of Kyiv by Russian intelligence and special-forces personnel over recent months. Nick Reynolds, one of the co-authors of that report, says he is watching closely to see whether these are activated, or neutralised by Ukraine’s security services, who have been monitoring them. Though lightly-armed Russian fifth-columnists could not seize and hold strategic sites for long, the “dual threat” of tanks approaching from the outside—once they get there—and subversion within could undermine the government.Ben Barry, a former British Army officer now at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, another think-tank, warns against drawing too many lessons from the first two days of fighting. Though the Russians may not have achieved their initial objectives quickly, “neither did the British and Americans on D-Day”. What was important then, and now, he says, is that the attackers established a critical mass of forces that could not be evicted. Indeed, Russian (like Soviet) military doctrine calls for multiple “echelons” of forces, with heavy forces kept in reserve. Russia has committed only around 60 battalion tactical groups out of the 110 or so it had massed on Ukraine’s border, according to a Western official. There has been little use of cyber- or electronic-warfare or drones. Some officials suggest these have not been used because of Russian deficiencies; others suspect they are simply being held in reserve. Despite its failure to ground the Ukrainian air force and neutralise surface-to-air missiles quickly, Russia is likely to gain air superiority at some stage. That will make it hard for Ukraine’s army to concentrate forces and move reserves to weak points, because agglomerations of force can be struck from the air. Mr Barry draws a comparison to America’s “thunder run” to Baghdad in 2003. Relatively modest American armoured forces could move at will around the city because the Iraqi defenders could not concentrate enough force to stop them. That does not mean it will be easy going for Russia. Ukraine’s armed forces are concentrating in cities, giving them a stronger defensive position, says the Western official. Even with command of the skies, urban warfare would be difficult and costly for both Russians and Ukrainians. Though Russia is not averse to the indiscriminate use of force where required—see Grozny, in Chechnya, and its bombing campaign in Syria—it might have reason to be cautious. A recent social-media video from Chechnya’s leader Ramzan Kadyrov, in which he demanded Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, apologise to Vladimir Putin, his Russian counterpart, suggested he was more than ready to provide support. “​​Russia likely thought a large number of Ukrainian casualties would make it more difficult to achieve a long-term political solution,” notes Rob Lee of King’s College London.On February 25th Mr Putin urged Ukraine’s armed forces to overthrow the government and negotiate with the Kremlin. “It looks like it will be easier for us to come to terms with you than with this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis,” he said. There was little sign that Ukrainian generals were tempted. “The question,” says Mr Lee, “is what would Russia be willing to do if Ukrainians continue to resist and start an insurgency in cities?”
20  POLAND, ITS prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said this week, must be ready for “dark scenarios”. He was referring, among other things, to the possibility that millions of Ukrainians, displaced by Russia’s invasion of their homeland, might flee across the 500km border with Poland. The longer the war goes on, and the worse the fighting gets, the more likely the scenario becomes.Between one and three million Ukrainians, of a population of 44m, might try to leave their country in the coming weeks, UN agencies estimate. On February 24th and 25th, even as Russian troops closed in, the roads out of Kyiv were gridlocked with civilians attempting to escape the capital. Many were headed west, towards Poland, which unlike Ukraine is a member both of the European Union and of NATO. The governing Law and Justice (PiS) party, which is hawkish on Russia, has said it will welcome refugees from Ukraine—a remarkable contrast with its hostility to those arriving from farther afield.Poland has been readying itself for an influx. Those arriving from Ukraine will be provided with temporary accommodation, according to a government website. Eight reception points offering food, medical supplies and information have been set up close to the border. American troops stationed in Poland have come forward to help process the expected crowds. Germany has offered assistance, too. Since the invasion began on February 24th, Ukrainians have been arriving. Trains arriving from Ukraine at Przemysl, the first stop on the Polish side of the border, have been carrying as many as 600 people at a time. Others are coming on foot via the nearby crossing at Medyka. It is not clear how many have already arrived.PiS came to power in 2015 in part by opposing the admission of refugees from the Middle East, whom it presented as a danger to national security. In January it started building a fence along its border with Belarus to keep migrants out, after the government there encouraged thousands of refugees from countries including Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan to cross into Poland. If the opposition were in power, the border with Belarus would be as porous as “Swiss cheese”, claimed Mr Morawiecki earlier this month.Ukrainians are more to PiS’s liking. In recent years, 1m or so have already come to Poland. This has been good for Poland, since its businesses often struggle to find workers. It has also been good for the Ukrainians, who are attracted by the higher wages, better job opportunities, similar language and proximity to home. Since January, new rules have made it easier for citizens of Ukraine and other nearby countries to obtain temporary residence. Many Ukrainians in Poland are looking to settle there permanently, recent research shows.As a member of NATO, Poland also now seems like a safe haven. Any attack on it by Russia would trigger the alliance’s mutual-defence provisions. Fear of Russian aggression has prompted the government to increase defence spending in recent years. It now plans to raise it to 2.5% of GDP in 2024, rather than in 2030, as previously intended. It is currently budgeted at 2.2% for this year.While attention is focused on the border, cities across Poland are at the ready. When the Russian invasion began, the authorities in Krakow, a city in southern Poland, talked about taking in 17,000 Ukrainian refugees. Now Lukasz Kmita, the head of the surrounding Malopolska region, says there will be “no limits”. As the Russian onslaught intensifies, there is no telling how high the numbers might get.
21  FOR A WHILE it looked as if all was going to plan. In a move cheered by climate activists, the European Union began in 2015 to restrict the production and import of gases known as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). HFCs are widely used in refrigeration, air-conditioning and manufacturing, but they are also potent greenhouse gases. The first big shortages hit in early 2018. Prices across Europe multiplied sixfold or even more. The EU wanted to push HFC users to adopt pricey, climate-friendlier alternatives. It thought that the engineered shortage would do the trick.Listen to this story.But officials were soon scratching their heads. The high prices unexpectedly plummeted. And even though the EU tightened caps on HFCs again a year ago, prices are still not much higher than before the crunch. The reason: HFCs were being smuggled into the EU. The trafficking is still going on. The Environmental Investigation Agency, a watchdog based in London that has dispatched researchers to pose as buyers in Romania, estimates that a quarter of all HFCs in the EU are contraband. A body formed by chemical companies, the European FluoroCarbons Technical Committee (EFCTC), says the proportion may be as high as a third.Such estimates are rough. But they have not been plucked from thin air. Much can be inferred, for example, by examining officially registered trade flows. Data from Turkish sources show that in 2020 more than four times as much HFC tonnage left Turkey bound for the EU than the latter reported as imported. This suggests that plenty of tanks and canisters holding HFCs enter on the sly.The smuggling has hit some firms particularly hard. To supply greener alternatives to HFCs, Chemours, an American firm, spent around $500m on R&D and production facilities. But with illegal imports continuing to hold down HFC prices, demand for alternatives has been “stagnating” and even declining, laments Murli Sukhwani of Chemour’s European HQ in Geneva. Mr Sukhwani, who also leads the EFCTC’s investigation into the black market, says climate-friendly alternative gases cost at least twice as much as the compounds they are supposed to replace.This has miffed America. In a report last year on barriers to trade, Katherine Tai, the American trade representative, wrote that the EU’s “insufficient oversight and enforcement” of its HFC caps is hurting American chemical firms, not to mention the climate. European officials, for their part, point to the difficulty of preventing profitable contraband from crossing the bloc’s long borders.Consider the potential earnings, says Marco Buoni, president of an association of European refrigeration and air-conditioning contractors called AREA. When prices first soared, a car boot could be filled in Ukraine with canisters of an HFC blend called R404A that would sell, hours later, for ten times as much in Poland. Margins have since shrunk as legions have got in on the action. But contraband HFCs are still so valuable that canisters are sometimes given space on boats trafficking migrants from north Africa to Europe.Some trafficking is carried out by moonlighters who make border runs in their cars or hide canisters in luggage stowed on passenger coaches. But the black market is now dominated by crime syndicates that move large volumes, says the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF). Most of the contraband seems to come from China, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine.One trick is to mislabel with stickers that are later peeled off. To detect the practice, which became widespread in 2019, expensive gas-analysis equipment is needed, says an OLAF investigator. Another approach is to falsely declare that a shipment of HFCs will be subsequently exported out of the EU. These “transiting” goods are not subject to EU limits on imports, but the stuff often disappears, the investigator says, into “a very, very difficult to track” succession of warehouses across Europe. Trafficking has been exacerbated by generally light penalties. Fines of a few thousand euros have been common.The EFCTC is trying to improve enforcement. It has hired Kroll, an American firm, to gather intelligence on potential smuggling and pass it along to authorities. The team, which is based in London, uses network-analysis software to unearth hidden relationships between entities in myriad sources of data. In one success, the software drew attention to a lorry driver hauling gas from Turkey into the EU. In a video posted online, he unwisely mentioned his “friends at the border”. He was later nabbed. Recent months have seen “a lot of arrests and a lot of action”, especially involving Romania and Turkey, says Benedict Hamilton, leader of the Kroll team.But the outlook nonetheless remains grim, according to Marius Appenzeller, refrigerants manager at Westfalen Group, a gases distributor based in Münster, Germany. The firm expects trafficking to increase as the EU continues, every three years until 2030, to shrink HFC quotas. A report in December from the European Environment Agency acknowledged that HFC use had begun to grow, even without taking into account “alleged” smuggling. 
22  FOR THE past few months, rivals in April’s French presidential election have dwelt to excess on questions of national identity and immigration. This should soon shift. Emmanuel Macron, a former economy minister and one-time investment banker, is expected shortly to confirm officially that he is running for re-election. This is likely to turn the focus to the economy. Voters will be judging not only Mr Macron’s economic management since he took office in 2017, but how he and his rivals plan to improve competitiveness, job creation and incomes.Listen to this story.As the French economy rebounds, growth has exceeded expectations. After a contraction of 8% in 2020, GDP recovered to pre-pandemic levels last autumn. Growth in 2021 reached 7%, its fastest rate for over half a century, and brisker than in Germany, Italy and Spain. This was partly thanks to generous government support to keep businesses going, people in jobs and incomes protected. The injection of €100bn ($113bn), or 4% of GDP, partly from the EU’s recovery plan, has also helped.On Mr Macron’s watch, France has also become a lot more business-friendly. He has cut taxes on businesses, replaced the wealth tax with a narrower property tax, introduced a flat tax on financial income and courted foreign investors. For the past five years he has stuck to the same fiscal policy and the same finance minister: Bruno Le Maire has been in the job longer than anyone since Valéry Giscard d’Estaing in 1969-74. In 2019 Mr Macron promised that by 2025 there would be 25 French “unicorns”, or tech firms valued at over $1bn. That figure was reached three years early, in January this year.Perhaps most surprising, the French job market is doing relatively well too. Unemployment in the fourth quarter of 2021 fell to 7.2%, down from 9.2% when Mr Macron took office. This is not principally owing to government support: the number of people on furlough schemes has fallen from 8.4m in April 2020 to 420,000 in December last year. It largely reflects the strength of private-sector job creation. One reason, says Philippe Martin, of the Council of Economic Analysis, an independent advisory body, is past labour-market reforms, particularly those in 2017. Among other things these capped the cost to employers of redundancy payments. Instead of prompting more lay-offs, as some economists had feared, this has made firms more willing to hire staff on permanent contracts.The government has also invested heavily in training. The number of apprenticeships has risen from 290,000 in 2017 to a record 720,000 in 2021. The employment rate of 15-64-year-olds actually increased during the pandemic. Even older workers now stay at their desks for longer. For the 50-64-year-olds, the employment rate is at its highest level since the national statistics body started measuring it in 1975.Yet there are two weak points to Mr Macron’s economic record. The first is the state of public finances. When the pandemic took hold, he vowed to do “whatever it costs”, and he did. The government’s budget deficit was still 7% in 2021, and the level of public debt reached 115% of GDP, according to official estimates. France now belongs to the group of the most indebted countries in the euro zone, alongside Belgium, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain.France has no difficulty servicing its debt. But Mr Macron has yet to show that he has a plan to reduce it. Valérie Pécresse, the centre-right Republicans’ candidate and his most credible critic on the economy, has accused him of “burning through cash”. She promises to restore fiscal discipline and cut a net 150,000 jobs from the 5.6m-strong civil service.The other weakness is pension reform. The average effective age of retirement for men in France is 60 years, well below the 63 years in Germany and 64 years in Britain. Yet at the start of the pandemic Mr Macron shelved his ambitious plan to merge the country’s sprawling 42 pension schemes, and to raise the retirement age. The next president will have little choice but to take on this reform.Mrs Pécresse vows to raise the pension age from 62 to 65, and the far-right Eric Zemmour wants to increase it to 64. But this is not a message many French voters want to hear. Pension reform is the one policy almost guaranteed to prompt strikes and protests. Indeed most candidates on the left, including the radical Jean-Luc Mélenchon, as well as the nationalist-populist Marine Le Pen, promise instead to bring the pension age down.In the short time left to him to campaign, Mr Macron will be able to defend a reasonably good economic record. But elections are seldom won on past achievements. Voters remain sceptical about the effect on their own purses, even though average incomes grew on his watch, and they are worried about the rising cost of living and energy bills. If Mr Macron is serious about reviving the reformist spirit of his campaign in 2017, he will need to present both credible pension reform and a decent plan to fix public finances. This means telling French voters some uncomfortable truths, whatever it costs. 
23  EXHAUSTED AFTER hours of thunderous roars and wailing sirens, Kyivians fell into one of three groups as the first day of the invasion drew to a close. There were those too alarmed to stay, and those who said they would sign up to fight. Large numbers were in the first camp: the main roads around the Ukrainian capital had been jammed from early morning as throngs of residents fled the city. Ukrainians lined up with their luggage and piled onto westbound trains, some of which snaked right past the battlefields. Some brave people were in the second camp. But the majority were in the third group–and were simply hunkering down. Queues formed at cash machines and supermarkets as people stockpiled food and money. As night fell a sinister calm reigned in the almost deserted streets. Many people headed to metro stations to sleep. Turnstiles were opened to allow access to the deep platforms where people rolled out yoga mats or dozed on benches as trains carried on running as usual. Children played on tablets and pets seemed surprisingly content in their unusual sleeping arrangements. David, a 28-year-old programmer, said he had come down to Vokzalna metro because his home was close to the ministry of defence. Police patrolling underground were jumpy. When The Economist took some pictures, your correspondent was quickly collared by officers demanding first identification and then that the photographs be deleted. In one station, a group of 25 or so burly men, not wearing uniform, were congregating, some with Kalashnikovs hanging from their shoulders. There is evidence that Ukrainian forces have slowed the Russian advance in some areas, particularly in the east. But the security situation in Kyiv, where the government still resides, hangs in the balance. Russian and Ukrainian forces have battled over the Hostomel airstrip to the north-west of the capital. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, admitted his country had lost control of the Chernobyl power plant 90km to its north. He claimed that Russian troops were preparing a terrorist provocation there. “Our defenders are giving their lives so that the tragedy of 1986 will not be repeated,” he said. Those claims have not been verified. As the security situation deteriorated during the day, Kyiv turned into a city of heavy weaponry and fatigues. Internet and mobile networks are still working, but all day long they struggled under heavy loads. There may not have been the bombs that fell on other cities, but the acrid smell of burned paper and plastic from hastily destroyed documents filled the air. A plume of smoke rose from military-intelligence headquarters. Around noon, a column of armoured cars and heavy guns arrived to protect the president’s office, a Stalin-era fortress which sits atop a hill in central Kyiv. The few shops and restaurants that were open around it shut summarily. In the evening a press centre set up to deal with the stream of questions from international journalists was hastily disbanded. An attack on the government quarter was expected, a spokesman said. Vitaly Klitschko, the city’s mayor, announced a curfew from 10pm. In the central station an official told sleepers that they could not leave after that time, but anyone trying to get into the stations would be allowed in.Above ground almost all shops were closed, but supermarkets still had plenty of stock by the end of the day. Trade had been brisk, but there were no signs of panic. Queues that had built up outside pharmacies dissipated. Kyiv’s central station was full but there was no pandemonium. Most trains were running but some–to embattled Kharkiv, for example–were leaving with delays. Lurking on the edge of the station were groups of armed police. On the deserted streets of Kyiv there were armed men in balaclavas. It is to them, as well as the armed forces, to whom the defence of the capital may now fall. Two dozen were gathered outside the city hall—a throwback to the Maidan protests of 2014, when protesters drove out the unpopular, pro-Russian president. Then as now, they were angry. They said the apparent reverses on the battlefield were a result of poor planning. But while they were not great fans of either Mayor Klitcschko or of President Zelensky, a common enemy had united them. “First we’ll send these guys back where they came from—in their coffins,” said “Dima”, 33, a veteran from the eight-year-old conflict, who goes by a nom de guerre. “Only then will we deal with our own problems.” 
24  The skies around Antonov international airport in Hostomel, a north-western suburb of Kyiv, were thick with Russian mi-8 helicopters. As one came under attack by a surface-to-air missile, it released an explosive burst of flares. The air assault by Russia—perhaps one of the largest of recent decades—was a bold and brazen attempt to seize a strategic airport near Ukraine’s capital.As this article was published, the rough contours of the fighting in Hostomel and the whole of Ukraine were only just becoming discernable. At one stage, Russian troops were seen patrolling the airport. Ukrainian forces later counter-attacked, and claimed to have taken back the facility by the evening. The sounds of the fighting could be heard from several kilometres away.The battle is a pivotal one: Russian control of the airfield would allow more troops and heavier equipment to be airlifted in. Christo Grozev, the director of Bellingcat, an investigative group, said that 18 Russian transport planes had left Pskov, home of the country’s 76th Guards Air Assault Division, heading for Ukraine’s capital. These were probably carrying large numbers of paratroopers. “They’re making a move on Kyiv,” says a senior us defence official. British officials concur that Russian ground forces in Belarus are “advancing towards” Kyiv. They appear to have captured the site of the Chernobyl reactor, to the north of the capital.The struggle for Hostomel was one of the first and most important battles between Russia and Ukraine in the war launched by Vladimir Putin shortly before dawn on February 24th. It is soon likely to become the largest inter-state conflict in Europe since the Balkan wars of the 1990s. It has the potential to become much bigger still.Russia’s first attacks involved volleys of missiles against important Ukrainian military facilities, including airports and air-defence radars—a tactic designed to allow Russian warplanes to fly safely over the country. American officials say that Russia launched more than 100 cruise and ballistic missiles from Belarus, Russia and warships at sea. Around 75 aircraft, including bombers, are thought to have been involved. Russia’s defence ministry says that it attacked 11 air bases and 18 air-defence sites, among other targets. Around the same time, Russian ground forces—some of the more than 110 battalion tactical groups that Russia had amassed around Ukraine since November—crossed the border. Tracking their progress is difficult. Russia and Ukraine share much of the same Soviet-era military equipment. It is hard to distinguish a Russian tank from a Ukrainian one in the satellite imagery and mobile-phone footage that has provided a window into the Russian build-up and now the war. Even so, it soon became clear that Russian forces had made some important breakthroughs. By mid-afternoon Russian armour coming from Belgorod, one of the main staging areas in western Russia (see map), had begun to encircle Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine, in the east of the country. Russian tanks were near the city’s ring road, said its mayor, noting that there had been no civilian casualties. In the city of Okhtyrka, to the north-west of Kharkiv, video footage showed armoured vehicles in the street, buildings on fire and small-arms fire. Yet it is far from a rout. Ukraine’s army appears to have had more opportunities to employ anti-tank weapons than many supposed. America, Britain and other European allies gave Ukraine thousands of such weapons, including long-range American Javelins and shorter-range Anglo-Swedish nlaws, over the past two months. In places, these presented serious resistance to Russian advances in the north and east. It is thought that nlaws have never been used in combat before. Video footage taken around Kharkiv appears to show damaged tanks. Ukrainian officials said that Javelins and other weapons had “neutralised” an entire column of 15 t-72 tanks in Hlukhova, in the north-west of the country close to the Russian border. Ukraine’s fleet of Turkish drones, which have been used to good effect in recent wars in Libya, Syria and Azerbaijan, has also been used to mount attacks. Ukraine put up a strong fight around the airport at Hostomel, too. Ukraine’s armed forces say they shot down three out of the 34 helicopters sent by Russia. A ka-52 helicopter was pictured, damaged, on the ground after an apparent forced landing. Ukraine also paraded captured Russian personnel, whose insignia marked them out as members of the 1st Guards Tank Army, one of Russia’s most vaunted offensive units. Elsewhere, Ukraine’s armed forces claim to have secured the surrender of a reconnaissance platoon near Chernihiv, north-east of Kyiv, though this could not be verified. In the south, however, Russia’s forward thrusts seemed to meet with greater success. “Russian forces are literally pouring into Ukraine from Crimea,” said Konrad Muzyka of Rochan Consulting, who tracks Russian military movements. So rapid was their advance that some simply drove past Ukrainian units heading in the other direction. Ukraine’s ministry of defence said there was fighting around Genichesk, a port city on the Sea of Azov to the north-east of Crimea, Skadovsk, to the north-west, and Chaplinka, a little way inland. Video footage from Genichesk showed prisoner transport trucks belonging to the Rosgvardia, Russia’s national guard. There was also heavy fighting in Kherson, on the road to Odessa. Before the war, Western security sources had said that they expected Russia’s army to encircle Ukrainian forces west of the Donbas region, in eastern Ukraine, preventing them from falling back to protect the capital, and to advance on Kyiv from the south. Michael Kofman of CNA, an American research outfit, who had prepared a map of Russia’s likely axes of invasion—and which was similar to official assessments—says that “on the whole it looks relatively close as a representation of where Russian units are attempting to advance”. Mr Kofman warns that only a “fraction” of the Russian force has been committed so far. “What we’re seeing is [the] very early hours of the campaign.” British defence intelligence said that there had been “heavy casualties” on both sides. Civilian casualties are unknown, though very few have been reported so far. The war “has sent an ominous chill down my spine”, said Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross. “Now I fear increased suffering, with the potential of massive casualty numbers and extensive destruction of civilian objects like water and electricity plants, as well as mass displacement, trauma, family separation, and missing persons.”  
25  TRAFFIC ON THE Bosporus, the waterway that splits Istanbul and connects the Marmara and Black seas, has been busier than usual of late, and more dangerous. Making their way past supertankers, passenger ferries and the occasional pod of dolphins are Russian warships heading north towards Ukraine. Since the start of February, at least six Russian amphibious assault ships, as well as a Kilo-class submarine, have passed through. Russia now has four such submarines in the Black sea, each armed with missiles capable of striking targets anywhere in Ukraine.Listen to this story.Few countries are watching the war for which these weapons were deployed as anxiously as Turkey. Its government, headed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is eager to preserve a recent rapprochement with Russia. “We cannot give up” on either Russia or Ukraine, Mr Erdogan said on February 23rd. But Russia’s actions may end up forcing his hand. The following day, as Russian bombs began falling on Ukraine, Turkey’s foreign ministry called the invasion “unacceptable” and “a grave violation of international law”. It had already denounced Russia’s recognition of separatist enclaves in Ukraine. The war will test the relationship, possibly to destruction.Turkey’s most immediate concern is its economy. Mr Erdogan, who has helped drive inflation to over 48% and maimed his currency with ill-judged interest-rate cuts, is eager for lots of foreign cash from a busy tourism season, lower energy prices and some measure of regional stability. Russia’s actions in Ukraine seem to have torpedoed such prospects. Russians and Ukrainians accounted for over a quarter of foreign visitors to Turkey last year. This summer, presumably, far fewer will show up. Western sanctions against Russia, one of Turkey’s main trading partners and its main supplier of natural gas, will deal the economy a separate blow. The war has already sent shudders through Turkish markets. On February 24th the lira was headed for its worst day this year.Turkey does not want to antagonise Russia. The last time it did so, by shooting down a Russian warplane near the border with Syria in 2015, the Russian response, a mix of sanctions and threats, was robust enough to force a rare apology and a range of concessions from Mr Erdogan. What followed was a thaw in relations, marked by new energy deals, co-operation in Syria, and Turkey’s purchase of an S-400 air defence system from Russia. Russia has since tried to peel away Turkey from NATO, while Turkey, estranged from its Western partners, has looked to Russia to advance its regional interests.Remarkably, the rapprochement has survived the assassination of Russia’s ambassador to Turkey, as well as wars in Libya, Syria and Azerbaijan in which Turkey’s proxies have squared off against Russia’s. The two powers co-operate whenever possible and confront each other where necessary, though almost never directly. “It’s like capoeira,” says a European diplomat, referring to a stylised Brazilian martial art. “Each side is doing its dance, sizing up the other, but there’s always the danger they will come to blows.” When they do, one of them (usually Turkey) finds a way to scale back. When a Russian airstrike killed dozens of Turkish troops stationed in Syria in 2020, Mr Erdogan ordered a bombing campaign against Syrian regime forces, but not Russian positions. Turkey has also been silent about Russia’s antics in Belarus.But Turkey considers Ukraine a strategic partner. It opposed Russia’s annexation of Crimea, backed Ukraine’s plans to join NATO, and shared its concerns about Russia’s naval build-up in the Black sea. Turkey also sold Ukraine dozens of armed drones, vexing Mr Putin. Earlier this year, Mr Erdogan and Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, signed a new defence co-operation agreement. The war will make it difficult for Turkey to balance its commitments as a member of NATO and its warm relations with Russia, says Alper Coskun of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a think-tank in America.Turkey’s backing for Ukraine has already helped the country buff its tarnished NATO credentials. American diplomats, used to taking Turkey to task for its human-rights record, are praising its stance on Ukraine. It helps that Turkey has begun to mend fences with the UAE, Egypt and Israel,  them American allies.Russia has ways of tempering Turkey’s support for Ukraine, however. Nowhere is this as clear as in Idlib, a province in north-east Syria packed with over 3m civilians and controlled by Islamic extremists. Two years ago, Turkey, which backs the insurgents, and Russia, which backs the Syrian regime, agreed to a ceasefire. That stopped a regime offensive that would have pushed the insurgents and millions of refugees towards Turkey’s border. Since the start of the crisis in Ukraine, ceasefire violations have picked up, officials in Ankara say. This is not a coincidence. They believe Russia is weaponising the refugees against Turkey. “The Russians see Idlib as a soft spot for Turkey,” says one official. “They’re sending a message, that if we do something they don’t like [in Ukraine], they can make our lives difficult.”Mr Erdogan said earlier this year that Turkey would do whatever is necessary as a NATO member in the event of a Russian invasion. But in practice there is only so much Turkey is prepared to do for Ukraine. Recently one of the prime minister’s top advisers suggested that Turkey would not align with foreign sanctions against Russia, calling them “useless”. Instead Turkey had tried to position itself as a possible mediator between Russian and Ukraine—a notion that now seems naive. Mr Erdogan would have loved to preserve cosy ties with Russia, but the war in Ukraine is likely to prove the end of the affair. 
26  VLADIMIR PUTIN’S invasion of Ukraine, long predicted by the West and long denied by him, began before dawn on February 24th with volleys of cruise missiles, artillery and other weapons. There were explosions near Kyiv’s main airport, as well as around other cities. The scope of the attack was not immediately clear, but all the evidence pointed to a large-scale operation. Early reports, still unconfirmed, said Russian troops were advancing on the eastern city of Kharkiv. The mayor of Odessa, a big port, said his city had been attacked, but that the attack had been repelled.Having called up reservists a day earlier and declared a state of emergency, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, imposed martial law across the country. In parts of Ukraine, people woke to the sound of sirens and took to their basements; elsewhere some knelt on the streets to pray. People rushed to take cash out of ATM machines as huge traffic jams formed on the roads leading out of Kyiv. Chillingly, Mr Putin all but threatened nuclear escalation against the West after America and its allies sent additional troops to reinforce the eastern flank of NATO. Russia, Mr Putin pointed out, is one of the greatest nuclear powers in the world, adding: “A few words to those who might be tempted to interfere in the unfolding events from the outside. Anyone who tries to hinder us and...create a threat for our country and our people must know that the response will be immediate and will lead to consequences that you have never faced in your history. We are ready for any scenario. All necessary decisions in this regard have been taken. I hope you hear me.”America, which has said it will not send troops to fight in Ukraine, denounced the “unprovoked and unjustified” attack by Russia. “Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way,” said a statement from President Joe Biden. Having imposed an initial round of sanctions earlier in the week, he said he would announce further measures on February 24th. The EU, Britain and other countries look set to follow suit. A G7 video summit was called for later in the day; EU leaders are also due to discuss the crisis.Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, tweeted: “The world must act immediately. Future of Europe & the world is at stake.” He called for “devastating” sanctions on Russia, including its exclusion from the SWIFT system for international financial transactions. He also pleaded for the West to provide Ukraine with more weapons and aid. Oil and gas prices jumped, as the Brent crude benchmark rose past $100 per barrel for the first time since 2014. Global stockmarkets fell. Moscow’s exchange was suspended, following a sell-off earlier this month caused by war jitters. Civilian airliners were told to stay clear of Ukrainian airspace.Russia’s strikes began around 4:40am Kiev time, shortly after Mr Putin went on television to announce a “special military operation”. He claimed that NATO’s eastward expansion posed a threat to Russia, drawing a parallel with Nazi Germany’s attack on the Soviet Union. And he said Ukraine posed a threat, too—absurdly claiming that it was responsible for a “genocide” of Russian speakers and was seeking to acquire nuclear weapons after giving them up in 1994. He said he did not intend to occupy Ukraine, though he questioned its borders, and urged Ukrainians to lay down their weapons.Russia’s defence ministry said it was taking aim only at military targets, and had “incapacitated” Ukraine’s air defences. It denied Ukrainian claims to have shot down Russian aircraft. After weeks of fruitless diplomacy, Russia’s president proved deaf to all appeals for peace. He refused to take an eleventh-hour call from Mr Zelensky, and sent his forces into battle even as the UN Security Council was meeting in an emergency session. Ukraine’s ambassador got the last word, telling his Russian counterpart: “There is no purgatory for war criminals. They go straight to hell.”Mr Putin’s march to war became apparent from November, when America sounded the alarm about the movement of dozens of tactical battalion groups, the basic units of Russia’s army, towards Ukraine’s borders. By the eve of the invasion, he had deployed more than two-thirds of his country’s ground combat power around the country.Mr Putin long pretended they were on exercises; Mr Zelensky claimed that Russia was bluffing, hoping to prevent a panic that might destabilise his government and give Mr Putin victory without firing a shot. All that changed in the past week, when the Kremlin began claiming that Ukraine had committed “genocide” of Russian-speakers in the Donbas region and was about to seize two breakaway regions by force. There followed a series of alleged provocations—explosions in Donbas, and even incursions into Russia by Ukrainian troops. Western governments have said these were staged by Russia to manufacture a pretext for war.Then on February 21st Mr Putin held an extraordinary meeting of his senior officials, in which he asked each of them to endorse the recognition of the two republics on live television. He claimed Ukraine was an artificial creation of the Bolsheviks who ruled the former Soviet Union. That evening he delivered a blood-curdling speech, laying out the case for war. Russian troops, portrayed as peacekeepers, marched into the republics that evening (though some had been present semi-covertly for years). A day later Mr Putin clarified that he was recognising the pseudo-republics within the full extent of their claimed border, encompassing the entire “oblasts” or administrative regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, most of which lay beyond their control. That territory includes the port of Mariupol, a city of almost half a million people.On the eve of the invasion, Volodymyr Zelensky released a video appeal to Russians, telling them: “We don’t need war. Not a cold one, nor a hot one, nor a hybrid one.” He said he had tried to call Mr Putin, but was met with silence. Hours later, at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council, the secretary-general, Antonio Guterres urged Russia: “President Putin stop your troops from attacking Ukraine. Give peace a chance." All to no avail. As the council debated, Mr Putin issued his own video complaining that: “On our historic lands, a hostile anti-Russia is being created.”Russia’s assault was met with international condemnation. Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary-general, warned of “a grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security”. South Korea said it would have “no option” but to join sanctions against Russia; earlier Australia and Japan said they would do so, too. In Russia the reaction among the foreign-policy elite was one of shock. “I will support our troops, but I still consider this a big mistake, and my support of the Russian government will further decrease,” warned Dmitry Stefanovich, a defence expert. “I have no words,” said Elena Chernenko, a journalist with Kommersant, a daily newspaper. “This is a catastrophe,” wrote Sergey Utkin of the IMEMO research institute, part of the Russian Academy of Sciences. “For Russia, Ukraine and beyond.”The origins of the crisis lie in 2014, when a pro-European uprising toppled Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine’s then president, who had signed an association agreement with the European Union only to rip it up under pressure from Russia. Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, responded in the same year by annexing Crimea and invading eastern Ukraine, where he established a pair of Russian proxies—the Donetsk and Luhansk “republics”—in the Donbas region. Over the succeeding eight years, as Ukraine’s government turned to the West for political and military support, Mr Putin grew more hostile.Now that hostilities are breaking out, the most immediate question is how far Russia is prepared to go to subdue its neighbour. One possibility is that it will aim to take  the statelets’ claimed territory. A war for Donbas would be bad enough. Since January, however, Western security officials have been warning that Mr Putin is set on an even broader invasion aimed at toppling the Ukrainian government. Joe Biden, America’s president, and Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, have both said that Russia would probably aim for Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. NATO officials concur with those British and American assessments. Russian military forces in southern Belarus have crept closer to the border in recent weeks, with many organised in tactical formations that would allow a swift thrust south towards Kyiv, should Mr Putin order one. The suggestion might seem outlandish; even Western politicians familiar with the intelligence seem to disbelieve what they are hearing. After all, Ukraine’s population is over 44m, roughly double what those of Afghanistan and Iraq were when America and its allies occupied them in 2001 and 2003 respectively. Yet Western forces struggled to control both places in the face of bloody insurgencies. Even so, the Russian invasion force and those which may follow behind it, like national-guard units, “appear more than sufficient to attempt an occupation of Ukraine's eastern regions”, argues Michael Kofman, an expert on Russia’s armed forces at CNA, a think-tank.Ukraine’s eastern regions plus Kyiv amount to only 18m inhabitants, he notes, with the southern coast another 3m. That would give Russia a comparable force density ratio—the number of troops relative to the population—that America enjoyed in Iraq. Except Russia would enjoy some advantages that America did not. It knows the language, understands the terrain and would be “much more ruthless in the application of violence”, notes Jack Watling of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), another think-tank. Russia might also believe that at least some Ukrainians would greet them as friends, if not liberators. “Meeting with Ukrainian security officials there is a widespread acknowledgement that many of their colleagues—even in some quite senior positions—are working for or sympathetic to Russia,” argue Mr Watling and his colleague Nick Reynolds in a report published by RUSI on February 15th, based on extensive interviews with Ukrainian military and intelligence officials earlier that month. The report claims that Russian intelligence services dramatically expanded their activity in Ukraine over the past year, identifying locals who could serve as collaborators in an occupation—and also those who might lead a resistance movement. The second question is how America and its European allies will respond to the invasion. In recent weeks America has sent thousands of additional troops to Germany, Poland and Romania. Britain has also doubled the size of its contingent in Estonia, while Germany has reinforced Lithuania. Now NATO will have to further beef up its northern and southern flanks—on the Baltic and Black seas, respectively—says Jamie Shea, a former senior NATO official. The alliance may activate its NATO Response Force (NRF), a 40,000-strong unit that has a high-readiness, and currently French-led, brigade as its nucleus. The force has never been used before and its activation would require unanimity from all 30 allies. Though NATO will be in “permanent crisis-management mode” for some time to come, notes Mr Shea, it will also have longer-term issues to consider. The alliance’s leaders, who planned to meet for a summit in Madrid in June, will probably convene sooner. NATO officials have been writing a new “strategic concept”, a plan for the alliance’s priorities in the years ahead. American ones have been working on a national-security strategy and a nuclear-posture review. A war in Ukraine will affect all those efforts; some will have to start from scratch, reckoning with a dramatically heightened threat from Russia. In his February 21st speech Mr Putin laid out a version of history in which, by his telling, the Russian empire was egregiously broken up by the Bolsheviks into territories that became separate independent states after the cold war. Though his explicit aim was to undermine the legitimacy of Ukraine, other former Soviet republics would have cause for alarm over his irredentism—including NATO members like Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and non-NATO members like Finland, a former Russian possession. On February 22nd Finland’s foreign minister warned that Mr Putin’s actions were “based on some sort of concept of…rebuilding the Soviet Union”. All that is compounded by a de facto Russian absorption of Belarus, putting considerable Russian firepower on the border of Poland and Lithuania. That would make the slender “Suwalki gap”—a strip of land wedged between the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad and Belarus, which connects Poland to the Baltic states—even harder to defend in a war. “If Putin succeeds in Ukraine, he might decide that he needs a land bridge to link Kaliningrad to Belarus and then Russia running through Lithuania or Poland,” warns Stephen Hadley, who served as America’s national security adviser between 2005 and 2009. “That would mean a war between Russia and NATO.”Russia’s military moves and the Western response to them will create a more dangerous situation. “Neither Russia nor NATO want this crisis to escalate into a Russia-NATO conflict,” says Samuel Charap of the RAND Corporation, a think-tank. “But with huge numbers of Russian forces conducting large-scale combat operations on NATO’s doorstep, it's very easy to imagine how things could spiral out of control quickly.” Russian and NATO fighter jets, surveillance aircraft and warships will find themselves in close and constant proximity. That is a particular concern in the Black Sea, where Russia last year fired warning shots close to a British warship that entered Crimean territorial waters. To avoid misunderstanding, Mr Charap says NATO will need to make clear to Russia that such moves to reinforce eastern Europe are not a prelude to NATO military intervention in Ukraine—something for which there is no appetite.If Western countries impose heavy economic sanctions, as they have promised, Russia may hit back in ways that further raise the temperature. A particular concern is the risk of cyber-attack, whether deliberate or inadvertent. A crude but disruptive cyber-attack struck Ukrainian government websites on February 23rd. The economic consequences may be more substantial. In itself, the direct impact of sanctions on Europe’s economy will be modest. Russia is poor relative to the rest of the continent. Its exporters depend on European demand but not vice-versa. Goldman Sachs, a bank, estimates that the loss of trade caused by a 10% contraction in Russian demand would cost the euro zone only about 0.1% of its GDP, and Britain only about half that. The trouble is that some imports from Russia are crucial and scarce inputs to Europe’s production.In normal times Russia supplies 30-40% of Europe’s gas. Although that share has fallen in recent months as Europe has increased LNG imports, an additional supply squeeze—brought about by sanctions or in retaliation for them—could disrupt Europe’s industrial production. Pricier energy will cause pain for consumers, who may cut back spending elsewhere. And if financial markets take fright at the heightening of the crisis, that will cause economic damage by reducing investment.The pain for European exporters will be spread unevenly across countries. Russia is one of the top two destinations for goods exported from both Lithuania and Latvia. It is also a significant source of external demand for Finland, Greece and Bulgaria. These places would take a larger-than-average hit from a collapse in trade. Yet the security of Finland and Bulgaria is also vulnerable to a more aggressive Russian posture, so both countries may be willing to pay a high price to shore up deterrence. Then there is the human cost. In Syria, where Russia intervened in 2015, the Kremlin’s way of war involved often indiscriminate force against populated areas, including the bombing of hospitals. Civilian casualties in Ukraine are expected to be considerable. On February 21st Mr Putin promised, ominously, that “all those guilty of crimes against Russians” would be punished. Others will flee. In eastern Europe Ukraine’s neighbours are bracing themselves for a flood of refugees. In January Ukraine’s defence minister warned that a major war would cause “the sudden appearance of between 3m and 5m Ukrainian refugees”. On February 8th Poland’s deputy interior minister said that “up to a million people” might enter Poland in the worst-case scenario. Romania’s government would struggle to absorb large numbers of refugees with the capacity it currently has in place. The growth of large refugee camps in these countries, and in Hungary, could exacerbate divisions between eastern and western Europe, while fuelling right-wing populist movements. As Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary general, said on February 22nd, the “world could see a scale and severity of need unseen for many years.”Russia was not threatened by NATO or Ukraine. Its invasion of the sovereign state next door is a war of choice, conjured out of nothing by Mr Putin. History will judge him harshly. If Russia is drawn into a long-lasting partisan war, so will the Russian people.
27  UKRAINIANS WOKE up on February 24th to the worst news imaginable—if they had managed to sleep at all. Rumours had trickled out the night before that this time the long-predicted Russian invasion of all Ukraine would finally come to pass. At 4.30am came the announcement from Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, that his plan to “denazify” Ukraine was under way. Missiles almost immediately hit Boryspil airport on Kyiv’s outskirts, and air-raid sirens rang out at dawn. War has been a fixture of life for Ukrainians since Mr Putin’s first invasion, in 2014, but largely confined to its south-east. That old reality has vanished. Taking its place is a new kind of war: national and all-consuming.A blizzard of reports suggested that Russian troops have crossed from Ukraine’s south towards Kherson and from the northern border with Belarus, just 60km from Kyiv, though confirmation was hard to come by. The biggest incursion so far seems to be from the east, near Kharkiv, where there are already reports of civilian deaths and of Russian troops reaching the city outskirts. Viral images showed explosions and heavy fire elsewhere around the country, as well as several destroyed bridges. Ukraine’s defence ministry claims to have shot down six Russian planes and a helicopter near the frontline in Donbas; the Russians deny it. The government also claims to have destroyed a number of Russian tanks, and to have repulsed the initial attacks: again, this has not been confirmed. The Ukrainian government, which for so long had played down the prospect of war, is now confronting it head-on. On February 22nd the president, Volodymyr Zelensky, was still denying there would be war. On the morning of the 24th he told them it had arrived. “We are strong. We are ready for everything. We will defeat everyone, because we are Ukraine,” he said, as he imposed martial law across the whole country. The night before, Mr Zelensky had made an emotional appeal, in Russian, to the citizens of Russia, urging them to oppose the war being waged in their name.It was a sickening shift for a country that at times has shown a level of calm out of sync with the direness of its situation. And even in the early morning of the day of the attack Kyiv showed signs of a city straining for normality, with residents walking their dogs and street sellers going about their normal routines. But things soon became very different. Police and military vehicles are now patrolling the streets. Planes can be heard flying overhead. There are reports of checkpoints, a feature of the landscape in the war-torn Donbas, popping up north of Kyiv in Vyshgorod.Instructions to run to the nearest underground metro station rang out from a police car in central Kyiv, issued through the window by an officer in the passenger seat shouting into a loudhailer. Many huddled down there, in one of the deepest underground transit systems in the world, with babies in prams, clutching each other’s hands. Others passed by, hopping on and off trains, still trying to get to work. A shop selling porcelain and silver was packing up its wares for fear of looters. One hotel in the centre of the city patronised by visiting journalists received an alarming prank phone call from someone claiming to represent the Russian army: “We need 22 rooms from tomorrow. Do you have space?” Absent, so far, is the chaos that many feared of Russia using cyber-attacks to sabotage the communication infrastructure, shutting down phone and internet services. But citizens gather at tram stops to watch the latest updates, and many are stocking up on supplies anyway. One of them is Alex Pavlichenko, a cinema director. “I will get food, and especially water,” he says from the queue for an ATM. He cannot leave because he has four children and parents to worry about, “but a lot of my friends have left this morning.” Many residents now face urgent decisions that they have been putting off for weeks. The routes out of the city are closing. The government has shut down Ukrainian airspace. Even by 7am the highway from Kyiv to Lviv, a western city on the border with Poland, was clogged for kilometres. Taxi drivers are reportedly charging five times the normal price. Russian troops may yet surround the capital. Anna, a 23-year-old bartender, says her brother is urging her to leave the city immediately. She will not. “I want to fight,” she says. But first she has to move her dog and two cats to safety. In Kyiv the feeling is still that this is just a first taste of war, rather than a full blast of it in all its horror. But in the historical centre of the city Alexander Voltarnist, 27, said he would gather the women of his family and take them home, and then sign up for the army. He’s never fought before, but says he feels ready. “All I will say to the crazy maniac is that he has put his nose where it isn’t welcome.”
28  FOR WEEKS now, an invasion of Ukraine has been predicted to occur “in the coming days”. Some prophecies have even had precise times attached: at one point American officials suggested that Russia would go to war at 3am on February 16th. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, who has spent months pooh-poohing the prospect of war, ended up marking the date as a “day of unity”. Some Ukrainians were even jolly enough to wish one another an ironic “Happy Invasion Day”.As recently as February 22nd Mr Zelensky reiterated, “There will be no war.” That may be the last time he makes such a prediction. Later the same day he called up the Ukrainian army’s 200,000 reservists. The next day he declared a 30-day state of emergency. While that is not martial law, which will be imposed only after a full-blown Russian invasion, it gives the government extra powers to prepare and keep order. Perhaps more importantly, it was the clearest signal yet from the government that citizens should prepare for war. The government also urged all Ukrainian citizens to leave Russia immediately, presumably for fear of attacks on them if hostilities begin.In a speech on February 21st, Mr Putin had argued that Ukraine only exists thanks to an arbitrary administrative decision by Vladimir Lenin, who oversaw the creation of the Soviet Union’s republics after the Communists took control of imperial Russia in 1917. In Ukraine’s case, Mr Putin argued, Lenin was “severing what is historically Russian land”. The speech was meant to boost support for war at home, but Ukrainians were watching too. Come Back Alive, a fundraiser for the military, received more donations the following day than in the whole prior year.In a sure sign of impending cataclysm, Ukrainian politics, usually dysfunctional to the point of farce, has suddenly become fraternal and consensus-driven. Petro Poroshenko, the president’s political nemesis, has showed support for his speech on February 21st, in which he decried Mr Putin for recognising the self-declared “people’s republics” of Donetsk and Luhansk. The next day Mr Zelensky met with the heads of other political parties to establish a defence coalition. An overwhelming majority of lawmakers voted to give the cabinet new discretion over defence spending. The state of emergency has not attracted criticism, even though it gives the government the power to crack down on opposition protests.This might help explain, along with some uncharacteristic sunshine in February, why the mood in Kyiv is at once macabre and slightly cheerful. Elation has followed the arrival of new sanctions on Russia from the West, including the longed-for suspension by Germany of Nord Stream 2, a big gas pipeline from Russia on the verge of going into service. And it still helps that large sections of the population remain unconvinced that war is coming. “We are on the defensive,” concedes Nina, a retiree in Kyiv. “But I very much hope that war won’t happen.”The mood offers two lessons. First, whatever Lenin’s role in creating a Ukrainian national identity a century ago, Mr Putin has surely outdone him as a progenitor of Ukrainian patriotism. Ukraine is never as united as when collectively recoiling at the Russian president’s words. Second, Ukraine’s politics is not quite as combustible as many feared (or as Russia hoped). Ukrainians seem willing to cut their president some slack in an extraordinarily difficult situation, and are willing to unite in the face of a common threat. Polls show that a large share of the population expresses a willingness to take up arms and fight against a Russian occupation.Now comes the next moment in the psychological war: the task of bending to the reality of a conflict without breaking before it. Ukrainian troops on the frontlines are receiving demoralising messages from Russian cyber-warriors directly to their inboxes. Mr Zelensky may still see his task as preparing society for war without inducing an exodus of frightened citizens or an economic collapse. “He was afraid of panic. But Ukrainians do not panic,” says Oleksander Danilyuk, a former finance minister. Mr Zelensky remains in Kyiv, despite cajoling from the American government to move to Lviv, close to the Polish border in the west. Millions of Ukrainians will stay with him there, come what may.
29  Russian missiles slammed into Kyiv on the morning of February 24th. But its computer networks were already long under attack. On February 23rd, as the country was still bracing for an invasion that was expected to be imminent, the websites of Ukraine’s parliament and several government agencies were put out of action. A similar digital assault on Ukrainian government websites and banks on February 15th and 16th was quickly attributed by America, Britain and other governments to the gru, Russia’s military-intelligence agency. Last month the websites of several government ministries were defaced with the message, “Be afraid and expect the worst.”How bad could a modern cyberwar be, and will other countries be affected? “Ukraine, sadly, has been Russia’s cyber playground for years,” notes Ciaran Martin, the founding chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre, the defensive arm of gchq, Britain’s signals-intelligence agency. In 2016 suspected Russian malware disrupted Ukraine’s electricity grid and cut power to a fifth of Kyiv in the middle of a bitter winter. Inspired partly by Stuxnet, a suspected American-Israeli “worm” that disrupted Iran’s uranium-enrichment centrifuges, the attack was aimed at the protective relays which shut down electrical systems in abnormal conditions. Two years later Ukraine said it had halted a suspected Russian attempt to disrupt a chlorine plant.The latest attacks were not so sophisticated. They took the form of “distributed denial of service” (ddos)—a crude method of disruption in which a website is overwhelmed with spurious requests for information. Their impact was “minimal”, noted Chris Krebs, the former head of America’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (cisa). Their purpose, he suggests, was to “distract and confuse”, perhaps paving the way for “more severe activity”——the sort that might accompany Russia’s invasion, as it unfolds. Indeed, computer network operations—the term often used by professionals in lieu of “cyber-attack”—have been a part of wars for well over two decades.America and Britain, for instance, have spoken openly about their offensive cyber-operations during the campaign against the Islamic State (is) group in Iraq and Syria, when their intelligence agencies and armed forces disabled is drones, jammed phones, took down jihadist propaganda and sowed dissension in the group’s ranks. As its troops cross the border Russia is likely to attempt the same techniques against Ukraine, both to support its military offensive (for instance, by disabling Ukrainian air defences) and to destabilise the government in Kyiv (by, say, spreading disinformation). Western officials worry about the spillover of any cyber-conflict in Ukraine, whether accidental or deliberate. In 2017 the “NotPetya” cyber-attack on Ukraine, which irreversibly encrypted data on computers, caused $10bn-worth of damage around the world (it was widely blamed on Russia). This month cisa issued a warning to American organisations, saying that Russia could escalate “in ways that may impact others outside of Ukraine”. British firms have received similar warnings.Although Western countries have said they will not send soldiers to fight in Ukraine, they have begun to impose sanctions and and have promised further “massive” punishment. “If we’re talking about Russia being engaged in the most significant military operation since the second world war, in what it considers an existential struggle, and at the same time, the West—with every moral justification—decides to cripple the Russian economy, it’s hard for me to believe that they’re going to take that sitting down,” warns Samuel Charap, a former us State Department adviser now at the rand Corporation, a think-tank. He views a response in cyberspace as the likeliest countermeasure: “You could imagine the sort of asymmetrical response—shutting down some major Western banks for a couple of days.” America and Britain have both been helping Ukraine to harden its cyber-defences in recent months, and may assist in repelling attacks on the country. But on computer networks, the line between defence and offence is not always clear. America’s doctrine of “defend forward” means that it might be willing to defend Ukrainian networks by stopping attacks at source—that is, inside Russian networks—if necessary. “I’m a soldier—I was always taught the best part of defence is offence,” declared Ben Wallace, Britain’s defence secretary, on February 21st in response to a question from an mp about offensive cyber-capabilities.Western governments might also seek to disrupt Russian military networks, communications or “cognitive” operations such as altering data to confuse or mislead Russian forces. “The calculation may be that the Russians have overstepped the mark and that now is the time for a cyber response,” says Marcus Willett, a former deputy head of gchq. “There’s a great temptation to reach for cyber operations, because they feel more robust than sanctions but not at the level of firing missiles.” Yet that is a “fine line”, warns Mr Willett. Concepts of deterrence, signalling and escalation in cyberspace are still evolving. And in many ways, Western infrastructure is more vulnerable because so much more of it is dependent on computer networks. “If you start going against Russian networks, then the Russians may well be well placed to do similar things on us and allied networks. In terms of international law, it also opens a whole can of worms which we may not want to open at this particular juncture.” Russia and America have probed one another’s infrastructure, including such sensitive areas as power and water supplies, for years.Senior American figures say they are worried about miscalculation. Mark Warner, a Democrat who chairs the Senate’s intelligence committee, warns that norms of cyber-deterrence and escalation are poorly understood. He paints a scenario in which a Russian cyber-attack causes deliberate or inadvertent harm to civilians in Europe, prompting nato to retaliate.On balance, such risks are probably manageable, argues Mr Martin, the former British cyber defence chief, who is now at the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford University. Russia’s aim is to keep nato out of a war in Ukraine rather than drag it in, he says, so the Kremlin is likely to treat cyber-escalation in the same way it weighs up other instruments of statecraft, such as military force. Thus far, Western officials say they have seen little out of the ordinary when it comes to Russian cyber-activity against their countries. “Moscow will only launch a major disruptive cyber offensive against the West if it’s ready for escalation into some really dangerous territory,” he concludes.And even once cyber power is used, escalation is not certain. Indeed, multinational wargames conducted between 2017 and 2020 by Jacquelyn Schneider, a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, found that participants (mostly Westerners) were more likely to use cyber-operations for intelligence gathering, and to support military operations on the battlefield, than to target critical infrastructure. “We will see a lot of cyber-operations in a conflict between Russia and Ukraine,” she concludes, “but it will not be the primary factor that drives violence or leads to horizontal escalation to other countries in the region.”“Whatever the rhetoric,” says Mr Martin, “the West faces constraints on the use of its own cyber power.” America and its allies routinely lambast Russia, China, Iran and North Korea for their irresponsible behaviour in cyberspace. They would be wary of resorting to similar means, such as highly disruptive attacks on civilian infrastructure. So would the lawyers that vet these things. “What sort of cyber operation against Russia would genuinely deter it?” asks Mr Martin. “What good, for example, would taking out Russian media do? And would we seriously go as far as doing things that would put Russian civilians in harm’s way?” 
30  WESTERN COUNTRIES have moved swiftly to impose a first tranche of economic sanctions on Russia after President Vladimir Putin recognised the independence of two breakaway enclaves in eastern Ukraine and ordered Russian troops to be deployed to them. On February 22nd America, Britain and the EU rolled out measures that include restrictions on the sale of Russian debt, the freezing of assets of Russian oligarchs and their children, banks and parliamentarians—and threatened more if Russian troops attacked territory controlled by the Ukrainian government. Most striking was Germany’s unexpected decision to suspend the permitting of Nord Stream 2 (NS2), an undersea pipeline intended to carry more gas from Russia to Germany. To some, including some Republican former officials in America, the transatlantic response so far has been sure-footed, not least in the degree of diplomatic co-ordination and the use of intelligence to expose and disrupt Russia’s military plans. The question is whether the sanctions are commensurate with Russia’s attack on the sovereignty of Ukraine, and whether they can deter Mr Putin from sending the 190,000-odd troops he has amassed on Ukraine’s borders to seize more territory.On February 21st, after a bitter, history-twisting speech, Vladimir Putin signed treaties of “friendship, co-operation and mutual assistance” with the two Russian-backed breakaway statelets, the “people’s republics” of Donetsk and Luhansk. He announced that he would be sending “peacekeeping” troops to the enclaves. A day later, Mr Putin sought and quickly obtained permission from parliament to deploy troops “abroad”. Russia also announced the evacuation of its diplomats from Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. The Western sanctions are not—at least not yet—the “massive” response that the West has promised if Russia invades Ukraine. Perhaps inevitably, the debate turned on the question of what counts as an invasion. Initially, senior White House officials declined to use the i-word, noting that the planned deployment of Russian troops to Donetsk and Luhansk only formalised Russia’s barely hidden eight-year presence there. But on February 22nd President Joe Biden changed tone, describing events as “the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine”. He vowed, “I’m going to begin to impose sanctions in response, far beyond the steps we and our allies and partners implemented in 2014. And if Russia goes further with this invasion we stand prepared to go further as with sanctions.” Mr Biden ordered American troops already stationed in Europe to deploy to the Baltic region and Poland, to help buttress the defences of countries bordering Ukraine.The difficulty for the West will be to calibrate its response. It wants to demonstrate its resolve in the face of Russia’s threats and actions so far. But it also seeks to leave space for diplomacy, maintain Western unity and retain a credible deterrent against an all-out invasion. Much depends on whether Mr Putin’s recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk is an end in itself, or a step to a wider war. America and Britain are convinced it is the latter. “Every indication is that Russia is continuing to plan for a full-scale attack,” says NATO’s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg. In a televised press conference, Mr Putin was asked whether Russian troops would be deployed only to the areas controlled by the two pseudo-states, or whether they would seek to occupy all the territory to which their leaders lay claim, much of which is still in the hands of the Ukrainian government. Mr Putin endorsed their claims but would not say how far he would send his troops: “It is impossible to predict the scenario that unfolds. That will depend on the situation on the ground.”Dmitri Trenin of the Carnegie Moscow Centre, a think-tank, suggested that, after months of military build-up and high-stakes diplomacy, recognition of the statelets might have been the least risky way for Mr Putin to avoid sending his troops home empty-handed. Recognition could thus be an effort to “escalate to de-escalate”. But so vicious was Mr Putin’s rhetoric against Ukraine, a state he characterised as a Bolshevik invention, that Mr Trenin would not rule out an invasion. The overt deployment of Russian troops in Donetsk and Luhansk, he noted, raised the risk of conflict if, say, Russian troops were hurt in exchanges of fire across the front line. The hope for a diplomatic solution is receding. French officials have expressed bitterness at Mr Putin’s treatment of Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, who has long sought to entice Russia into security understandings and went to great lengths to give Mr Putin a way out of the crisis. In the early hours of February 21st Mr Macron announced that Mr Putin and Mr Biden had agreed in principle to hold another summit to avert a war. Mr Putin never confirmed this. He also said the so-called Minsk accords of 2014-15, which were supposed to settle the status of Donetsk and Luhansk and which France and Germany had tried to reinvigorate, were dead. Mr Putin also called on Ukraine to demilitarise. In a further bleak development, America’s secretary of state, Antony Blinken, cancelled a planned meeting with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, that had been scheduled for February 24th.With the West turning to sanctions, Olaf Scholz, Germany’s newish chancellor, has the opportunity to lead the European response. For weeks he has endured criticism that Germany had been too passive. Allies grouched at its refusal to arm Ukraine (bar 5,000 much-mocked helmets) and its reluctance to sign up to the most aggressive potential sanctions, such as ejecting Russia from the SWIFT international-payments system. The biggest irritant was NS2, a completed but not yet operational pipeline designed to double undersea gas deliveries from Russia to Germany. Critics, including eastern European allies as well as successive American administrations, said NS2 would turbocharge Russia’s ability to wield gas as a geopolitical weapon. And by depriving Ukraine of transit fees from an existing land-based pipeline, it risked removing one of that country’s few sources of leverage against its larger neighbour. Critics and admirers alike were surprised when Mr Scholz declared on January 22nd that he would cf the regulators assessing whether NS2 could start operations. Mr Putin’s move, said Mr Scholz, was “unilateral, incomprehensible and unjust”, and it was time to do “something very concrete” in response. To be sure, the certification of NS2 has been paused, not scrapped. Mr Scholz instructed Germany’s economy ministry to withdraw its assessment, issued in October, that NS2 did not pose a risk to the security of Europe’s energy supplies. That verdict was a precondition for regulators to begin assessing NS2. Meanwhile, Mr Scholz said, Germany would have to diversify its sources of gas (Russia accounts for slightly over half of German imports).For now, there will be no direct impact on European energy supplies. NS2 would not have come on stream until much later this year anyway. But Russia, which has always sought to insulate its energy relationship with Germany from geopolitical rows, appeared taken aback. Dmitri Medvedev, the deputy head of the national security council and a former president, threatened a “brave new world” in which Europeans would find themselves paying €2,000 ($2,266) per 1,000 cubic metres of gas. (In fact spot prices briefly exceeded that level in December.)Why did Mr Scholz act now? Mr Putin’s moves undermined the Franco-German strategy of reviving detailed negotiations over constitutional arrangements within Ukraine. The chancellor may also have wanted to forestall the risk of America intervening to kill NS2 itself, as Mr Biden had threatened to do earlier this month. And by moving now Mr Scholz has ensured a more comfortable position for Germany in discussions on sanctions within the EU. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission (the EU’s executive arm) said members had reached political agreement on a “calibrated” response, including sanctions on Russian debt, banks and people, as well as trade with the breakaway regions. Moreover, she added, “We are limiting the Russian government’s ability to raise capital on the EU’s financial markets. We will make it as difficult as possible for the Kremlin to pursue its aggressive policies.” Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister, said the decision had been unanimous, despite signs of objection from Hungary; those under sanctions will include some 350 members of the Russian parliament, who are being punished for voting to urge Mr Putin to recognise the governments in Donetsk and Luhansk.Britain, no longer a member of the EU, said it would use its “economic heft to inflict pain on Russia”. That included freezing the assets of five Russian banks accused of “bankrolling the Russian occupation”. The assets of several oligarchs—Gennady Timchenko, Russia’s sixth-richest man, and Boris and Igor Rotenberg, who are close to Mr Putin’s government—have also been frozen. Some noted dismissively that the three men had long been the subject of American sanctions. America was first to respond on February 21st by banning investment, trade and financing of the breakaway statelets, and invoked the authority to impose sanctions on anyone operating in those areas. The next day it said sanctions would be aimed at impeding secondary markets for Russian debt, isolating two big Russian banks and freezing the assets of individuals, among them family members of figures close to Mr Putin. In America’s Congress, meanwhile, there were growing demands for stronger action. Bob Menendez, the influential Democratic chairman of the Senate foreign-relations committee, said America had to stop “equivocating” over whether the invasion had started. Despite Germany’s move, he said, America should end President Biden’s waiver on sanctions on NS2 “so that it is definitely dead”. He asked: “When is it that we’re going to be clear to Putin that there are severe consequences for what you do? When he takes another bite after this bite?”Correction (February 23rd 2022): America banned investment, trade and financing in Donetsk and Luhansk on February 21st, and not, as we accidentally first wrote, January 21st.
31  Vyacheslav steshenko, a businessman in Kyiv, first noticed a drop-off in customers visiting his restaurant chains a few weeks ago. Perhaps this was normal, he thought: a new covid-19 variant was ripping through Ukraine, so people must be staying home. Then he heard from colleagues in the industry that restaurants in Lviv, Ukraine’s westernmost city, near the border with Poland, were filling up with out-of-towners “from Kyiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhia”–places closer to Russia. Next Mr Steshenko noticed that his petrol stations had sold out of 20-litre gas canisters, the largest size.Ukraine is not in the middle of a full-blown panic, Mr Steshenko stresses. But the remarkable calm shown by ordinary Ukrainians throughout the months-long crisis with Russia is starting to dissipate. The news suggesting a possible Russian invasion grows more unnerving by the day. That, in turn, is having a dire effect on the economy, which is “already being strangled”, in the words of a diplomat. Conflict with Russia cost Ukraine $280bn between 2014 and 2020, according to one estimate. But the damage from the past few months is of a different order.A spokesperson for Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, says that the crisis is costing the country $2bn-3bn a month, plus an extra $1.5bn-2bn from the sagging currency. Recent modelling by the Kyiv School of Economics (kse) indicates that if the threat of war is perceived to be high, gdp will shrink by more than 5% before any shots are fired. Indeed, the economic toll from the threat of invasion is so high some Ukrainians wonder whether the entire Russian mobilisation is intended simply to inflict economic damage.Virtually every Western country has instructed its citizens to leave Ukraine and to avoid travelling there. Expat haunts in Ukraine’s big cities have thinned out. After European insurance firms stopped covering flights to Ukraine, the national government had to stump up 16.6bn hryvnia ($580m) to keep planes coming and going. Several airlines have stopped flying anyway, in part because their staff are petrified. The doomsday atmosphere has had a predictable effect on foreign investment. Capital, foreign and domestic, is fleeing. On January 28th Mr Zelensky claimed that $12.5bn had left the country since the crisis began. Trade has also been affected, since three-fifths of Ukraine’s exports pass through the Black Sea, where the cost of insuring ships in Ukrainian waters has increased, especially since the areas were declared to be high-risk by a key London insurers’ committee on February 17th.The longer the crisis drags on, the worse all these effects will become. Business deals and investments currently on hold will be put off for good. Rising yields on government debt and corporate bonds (the yield on ten-year bonds has jumped from 6.9% in November to 10.9% now) have a compounding effect, making life ever harder for the Ukrainian treasury and big businesses alike. Workers suffering from the psychological strain may no longer feel willing or able to work as usual. Domestic demand will wilt as workers hoard cash and curb their normal leisure activities.The Ukrainian government has tried to persuade its citizens to keep calm and carry on. Officials complain that breathless Western press reports have deepened the economic gloom by spreading panic, citing headlines like “Russia planning ‘extremely violent’ operation to ‘crush’ Ukraine”. Mr Zelensky, who has described America’s communications strategy for the crisis as “very expensive for Ukraine”, proposed a “stability and reconstruction fund” during a speech on February 19th to the Munich Security Conference. Canada has offered a $400m loan. In a sign of how dire things are, the EU, which typically attaches a lot of strings to its loans, is offering €1.2bn ($1.4bn) with barely any conditions.Ukraine might have suffered even more had Mr Zelensky not played down the risk of an invasion until recently. His nonchalance may yet come back to haunt him. It may also have left millions of Ukrainians mentally unprepared for what seems to be on the way. But it kept Ukrainians going to work and living normal lives in a way that has astounded many foreign observers.Resilience has also come from the surgery that reformists performed on Ukraine’s financial industry after the Maidan revolution of 2014. That has allowed Ukraine to enter the crisis with swelling foreign reserves, a liquid banking system and national debt of less than 50% of gdp. These achievements have now been undermined.The cost of the stand-off, however, will be as nothing compared to the cost of a war, if one does occur. Russian troops are rolling into the breakaway statelets of Donetsk and Luhansk; Western countries are imposing fresh sanctions on Russia and Ukraine is threatening to sever diplomatic ties. Tensions have never been higher. Even if they ease, Ukraine will have already paid a high price. 
32  IN A MOVE that seemed to take Europe to the brink of war, Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, officially recognised the breakaway “people‘s republics” of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, and said he would deploy Russian troops to them. In a long and threatening speech he questioned the legitimacy of Ukraine’s independence and accused NATO of using it as a base from which to threaten Russia. The speech, filled with anger and resentment, provided the ideological foundations for further military action, should Mr Putin decide on it. Earlier, Mr Putin had staged a bizarre televised spectacle to clear the way for recognition of the republics. The move to broadcast an extended meeting of Russia’s national security council was unprecedented. The exchanges with the council members were just as extraordinary. From his position in a white chair, Mr Putin called on his minions, one by one, to speak their minds. He helped those having difficulty making them up. “Speak plainly,” he scolded the foreign intelligence chief, Sergei Naryshkin, who at one point appeared to misstep. “You would support it—or you do support it?” Mr Putin stressed that he had not consulted with his aides beforehand and there was only one decision-maker in the country.The pained faces of some in the room suggested that not everyone was happy with the direction of travel. Yet they unanimously hewed to what, one must assume, they knew the president wanted to hear—a line that would at best void a seven-year-old set of agreements aimed at producing peace in the Donbas region, and at worst set off a spiral of sanctions and war. Ten of the speakers urged Mr Putin to recognise the breakaway republics immediately. Only three suggested giving diplomacy a final chance. Full recognition would suggest territorial claims on areas currently controlled by Kyiv, since the breakaways claim the whole of the Donbas—and that in turn could prefigure a big new military intervention. Mr Putin then followed up the two-hour meeting with a rambling address to the nation laying out his belief that Ukraine is nothing but a creation of Russia, that Ukraine is planning a “blitzkrieg” against Donetsk and Luhansk, that NATO has consistently tricked the Russians and that Russia itself is under threat from NATO’s missiles which, he claimed, have been moved to its borders. At the end of it, he strode to yet another desk and signed treaties of “friendship, co-operation and mutual assistance” with each of the two statelets. NATO’s secretary-general swiftly condemned the move for undermining Ukraine’s sovereignty, and described Russia as seeking a pretext to invade Ukraine.Denouncing the “blatant violation of Russia‘s international commitments”, the White House announced a set of initial sanctions, among them a ban on American investment, trade, and financing of the breakaway statelets, and the authority to impose sanctions on anyone who operates in those areas of Ukraine. More measures were expected on February 22nd. These are not yet the “massive consequences” that America had promised if Russia launched another invasion. A senior White House official noted the deployment of Russian troops to the enclaves merely makes overt what has been a thinly veiled presence since 2014. America, Britain and France called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the crisis.The alarming events followed a few days in which the rhetorical temperature has been markedly heightened. “For now, the word…is war,” hollered Russia’s main news programme, which only a few weeks ago was deriding Western histrionics about a non-existent threat to Ukraine. The world may be guessing at the scale and timing of a possible Russian military incursion into Ukraine, but a form of offensive has already started, and disinformation is raging on Russia’s airwaves.The first salvo of that campaign was fired on February 18th with an explosion in a car park outside the headquarters of the self-proclaimed Donetsk republic. The car bomb—supposedly the work of Ukrainian saboteurs—was quickly followed by televised calls from the pseudo-governments of Donetsk and Luhansk to women, children and the elderly to evacuate. The metadata from the videos, awkwardly, showed that they had been recorded two days before the bombing. The blatant lies should be no surprise: Russia’s television propaganda is not subtle. In recent days television viewers both in Russia and inside the separatist areas have been told about groups of saboteurs trying to blow up critical infrastructure in Donbas and attempting to access a chemical plant making chlorine. They were told about Ukrainian shells landing in Russia itself and Ukrainian soldiers crossing the border. They saw pictures of women and crying children fleeing “genocide”—a claim Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, dismissed as “ridiculous” following his meeting with Vladimir Putin on February 15th.But Mr Putin’s national security council was happy to pick up on the narrative, building the case for war. Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister, called Ukrainian leaders Nazis, and said they were intent on attacking “Slavs and everything Russian”. Sergei Shoigu, the defence minister, said Ukraine was high on NATO weapons, had lost control of nationalistic gangs, and could even make a dirty bomb. Valentina Matviyenko, the speaker of the upper house and the only woman on the council, said that the past seven years of Ukrainian history have been a genocide against Russians. Nikolai Patrushev, the chairman of the council, cast accusations yet wider. America has staged the conflict in Ukraine to weaken Russia, he said. The aim was to dismantle the Russian Federation, no less.For many weeks, the Kremlin has refrained from making a clear argument to justify war. But the propaganda offensive now appears to be at full throttle, with claims of genocide and NATO aggression merged into one call to action: it is better, the Russian rhetoric runs, to deal with Ukraine now than to wait until it is too late. In his speech recognising the puppet statelets, Mr Putin called upon Ukraine to “stop fighting”. If it didn’t, he said, its leaders would bear “full responsibility” for what comes next. Most of what Mr Putin said was utter nonsense, but the implication that something terrible is soon to happen may not be. 
33  “BE AFRAID AND prepare for the worst,” read a coded warning left by hackers after they targeted Ukrainian state databases on January 14th. A month later, a powerful cyber-attack paralysed services at two big banks and on the defence ministry’s website. On both occasions, Russia denied involvement. But the messaging was unsubtle, coinciding as it did with the presence of more than 150,000 troops on Ukraine’s borders.America and Britain say these soldiers could soon be heading for Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. At the very least, Moscow appears to be rekindling its eight-year-old proxy conflict in the Donbas region of south-eastern Ukraine. On February 22nd the two chambers of Russia’s parliament will meet in an extraordinary session, offering a chance for Vladimir Putin, the country’s president, to present his next move. Russia could recognise the “independence” of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics, as it did in the case of Abkhazia and South Ossetia following its war with Georgia in 2008, and then use them as a bridgehead for a further push westwards.But even if Russia does not make a physical move, Ukraine stands in line for an onslaught of a different sort, from the country widely recognised as the world leader in digital warfare.Ukraine is not the easy target it was when the first Russian attacks hit its electoral systems in June 2014. It now draws on significant local expertise, and gets help from Western security services including America’s Cyber Command. Eight years of experience has made it a world leader in detecting and fixing threats. But Victor Zhora, the sleep-deprived deputy of Ukraine's own Cyber Command, says Russia is probably keeping its most dangerous tools in reserve. “They are already trying a huge variety of ways to get control over our networks and critical infrastructure,” he says. “Of course, it's only the tip of the iceberg.”Andrei Baranovich, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Cyber Alliance, an activist collective, reported that his group had found backdoors to critical parts of Ukraine’s IT and operations management within two weeks of searching in 2017. Some are even advertised for purchase on the black market: “Water canals, power stations, and even the atomic energy sector—you name it, we found a way in.” The “NotPetya” cyber-attack in 2017, considered to be the most damaging in Ukraine’s history and attributed to Russia by the White House, disabled a radiation-monitoring system at the defunct but still highly contaminated Chernobyl power plant.The ferocity of Russia’s cyber operations will depend on its wider intentions: whether the aim is to cause pain and perhaps topple Volodymyr Zelensky's government, to support a conventional military operation or both. Cyber operations could have devastating psychological effects on the Ukrainian population without a missile being fired. “Imagine the panic on Kyiv's streets if people weren't able to call one another, war or not,” says Volodymyr Omelyan, Ukraine's infrastructure minister from 2016-2019. He argues that not enough has been done to protect mobile networks.A bigger worry is that the Kremlin would shut down power, mobile and internet networks to create chaos ahead of a possible invasion. It could create scares around the country’s 15 nuclear power stations. Dmitri Alperovitch, whose CrowdStrike cybersecurity company uncovered the Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee in 2015-16, says that Moscow has the capacity to do  that. It could, he suggests, physically target the dozen data-exchange points that connect Ukraine to the internet, and use electronic-warfare capacities to jam the airwaves in places, affecting mobile phones and other radio-dependent means of communication. Satellite phones have been unavailable for purchase in Ukraine since the start of the year. In the event of a bloody war, internet outages would be particularly helpful for the Kremlin, preventing the dissemination of troop movements and atrocities. If Lenin focussed on the telegraph station, Mr Putin's generals would be as concerned by TikTok.But most cyber-security experts argue a complete communications outage would be difficult to achieve. Disabling broadband connections would, they reckon, require a risky physical operation inside Ukraine. The architecture of the country’s mobile network, with overlapping masts, also makes it resilient to nationwide disruption. “We have everything in place to protect the base network,” says Dmytro Shymkiv, a former government official who now serves as chair of the supervisory board of Kyivstar, Ukraine’s largest mobile network. “As long as Kyiv stands, we'll have a network.”It may be easier to disable crucial parts of energy, transport and supply-line infrastructure. In 2015 and 2016, Russia attacked the national grid, causing blackouts in three regions; the following year, Ukrainian air-traffic control was disrupted. Andrew Grotto, who was head of digital security for the US National Security Council at the time, says the attacks were a watershed moment. “We had always assumed Russia had the ability, but to see it used against a live target was a big deal,” he said. America sent digital-security teams to Kyiv to learn as much as they could about the emerging capabilities.In the event, Ukraine was able to restore order by switching to manual control of air traffic and power stations—something that would be extremely difficult in America. Ukraine’s relative technological backwardness turned out to be a trump card. This advantage will probably persist. “What the Ukrainians have going for them is that there aren't a load of master switches to go after,” says Mr Grotto. “The Russians could achieve some success, but it won't be like a hot knife going through butter.”
34  “MMMM, A NICE baguette from the Ardennes!” declares Valérie Pécresse, tearing off a chunk of the warm crusty loaf she has just bought at a boulangerie and popping it into her mouth. The centre-right Republicans’ presidential candidate, and head of the greater Paris region, has taken her campaign to the valleys and forests of north-eastern France on a recent weekday. In the village of Signy-l’Abbaye, no shop or café goes unvisited. As Mrs Pécresse breezes in and out, clutching her loaf, some locals seem bemused. The manager at Le Gibergeon restaurant confesses beforehand to having no idea who the visitor is, but is later charmed. “Oh yes, I recognised her from the telly,” she says. “It would be good to have a female présidente.”Listen to this story.After winning her party’s primary in December, Mrs Pécresse recorded a poll bump that made her the most serious contender against President Emmanuel Macron at France’s two-round election in April. Polls still suggest she would do about as well against the president in a run-off as would the nationalist-populist Marine Le Pen (though he is tipped to beat either), and much better than the far-right Eric Zemmour. Yet Mrs Pécresse’s first-round numbers have fallen, and her campaign has stalled. On February 13th, at a glitzy rally in Paris, she put in a wooden performance that was criticised even within her camp. The clear danger for Mrs Pécresse is that she will fail to make the run-off at all.Out in the Ardennes, with its family-run dairy and cattle farms, locals list their troubles: the price of petrol, the distance to the nearest hospital. In and out the former budget minister goes, stopping for coffee in a café and a beer in a bar. A graduate, like Mr Macron, of the Ecole Nationale d’Administration, France’s elite technocratic training college, Mrs Pécresse is well briefed, serious, and tough in debate. But she also knows how to listen. “She was self-confident, very attentive and listened a lot,” says a retired woman in the village. Later, at a town-hall meeting in an industrial warehouse 25 kilometres (16 miles) away, a participant says: “She’s much nicer than she seems on the television.”Smart, tough and nice, however, may not be enough. Mrs Pécresse is running into two difficulties as she seeks to become France’s first female president. The first is that, on stage, she does not light up a room. After a day campaigning in the Ardennes, she heads for a rally in the town of Charleville-Mézières, where Ms Le Pen topped first-round voting in 2017. A professional crowd-pumper chants “Valérie! Valérie!” as the candidate enters the hall. A mostly grey-haired audience tentatively joins in. At her Paris rally, packed with over 7,000 supporters, Mrs Pécresse gave a stilted performance. The next day she confessed to being “more at ease” in conversation.The other is her political positioning. Mrs Pécresse instinctively belongs to the moderate, pro-European centre-right and was once seen as a potential recruit to Mr Macron’s government. Yet she secured her nomination by defeating Eric Ciotti, a party right-winger, in the primary run-off. He embraces the “great replacement” theory—adopted as a slogan globally by white supremacists—that foreign populations threaten to replace the “indigenous” French. To try to keep this broad church together, Mrs Pécresse nods in Mr Ciotti’s direction. At her Paris rally she deplored Mr Macron’s “failure” to forbid athletes from competing while wearing the Muslim headscarf, and referred, albeit ambiguously, to replacement theory.Mrs Pécresse denies that she has hardened her line, arguing that she has always been proud of being on the right, and tracing her lineage to Jacques Chirac, a Gaullist former president and her mentor. She calls herself “two-thirds Merkel and one-third Thatcher”, and a feminist. “I know how to be firm, but also how to hold dialogue,” says Mrs Pécresse during a break on the Ardennes trail, dismissing Mr Macron as “Blairite”, a “left-wing liberal” and a “candidate of the cities”. Her project, she insists, bears “no similarity to Macron’s”.Yet many centre-right voters are confused. They are drawn to Mrs Pécresse’s fiscally prudent vow to curb public spending, which has soared under Mr Macron during the pandemic, as well as to trim the 5.6m-strong French civil service by a net 150,000 jobs and raise the state retirement age from 62 to 65 years. But such voters are put off by her nationalist tone on the need to “stop uncontrolled immigration”, and by her attacks on Mr Macron’s broader economic management, which she calls “calamitous”. The economy last year grew at its fastest rate for half a century.Amid these contradictions, Mrs Pécresse’s campaign is fraying. In recent days she has lost Eric Woerth, the Republicans’ former budget minister, who now backs Mr Macron, as does Natacha Bouchart, the Republicans’ mayor of Calais. At the other extreme, Guillaume Peltier, a former party vice-president, has quit for Mr Zemmour. Even Nicolas Sarkozy, the Republicans’ former president, has declined so far to offer public support for la candidate.Perhaps voters just find it difficult to relate to Mrs Pécresse, who lives in Versailles and was privately educated in the swanky Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine. Her most rebellious moment was the time she spent, rather improbably, as a teenager in Soviet youth summer camps, after falling in love with Russian literature. To this day, she can speak the language. “I’ve always been very intrepid,” she says.The risk for Mrs Pécresse is that she now loses momentum. Mr Zemmour has crept past her in two new polls. When Mr Macron confirms his candidacy, which is expected any day now, the campaign dynamics may shift again. “There’s been a lot of criticism of Macron during the pandemic,” says a retired railway worker in Signy-l’Abbaye. “He’s arrogant, but he hasn’t managed things too badly.”Mrs Pécresse, meanwhile, is off again on her campaign “à la Chirac”, a candidate who delighted in rural French life. Leaving the boulangerie in Signy-l’Abbaye, she asks the baker the secret of a good loaf. “You need patience, you need time for the flavour to develop,” he replies. Time which, for Mrs Pécresse, may be running out. 
35  MOST GOOD superhero movies have a scene in which the protagonist discovers—often after some freakish accident—that he or she has developed amazing new powers. The first attempts to use these new powers are unsatisfactory. Shirts are accidentally torn to shreds and bedrooms covered in spider-web. Given time, however, the new abilities are tamed, then mastered. Audiences soon forget how the unlikely powers were acquired and enjoy the crusade, caped or otherwise, for justice and order.Listen to this story.Politicians who dream of being superheroes imagine being able to bend foes to their will. How easy life would be if troublemakers quietly fell into line. Look at Europe today, and a superpower may be sprouting. For years Poland has been needling the European Commission, which enforces the treaties binding the 27 member states of the EU together. Since coming to power in 2015 populists in Warsaw have neutered the judiciary and placed judges firmly under the thumb of the government. For a time the commission wimpishly spluttered about the vital role of the rule of law in Europe, even as its threats and ultimatums were gleefully defied. No longer. Twice this month the Polish authorities have offered to climb down, agreeing to reverse their judicial measures in much the manner the EU has demanded.For a hint as to why Poland is suing for peace, look to high politics and lowbrow entertainment. The high politics is the sabre-rattling in Ukraine, Poland’s neighbour. Periods of geopolitical tension are no time to alienate allies; Ukraine is a refugee crisis in the making for Poland. Perhaps mindful of Russian troops posted in next-door Belarus, President Andrzej Duda earlier this month suggested Poland “should close all disputes that exist as soon as possible”. A long-running spat involving a Polish lignite mine spewing smog into the Czech Republic has been hastily settled. A media-ownership law America didn’t like was also shelved.The lowbrow bit is the story of the EU’s budding superpowers. For years the commission has faced a gap in its authority. Countries that wanted to join the club could be made to commit to liberal democratic standards, such as free speech and independent courts. This gave the EU lots of leverage: follow the rules or you stay on the outside. But once the aspirants were allowed in, as Poland was in 2004 alongside several former communist-bloc neighbours, the muscles in Brussels atrophied. There is a procedure to punish member states that flout the norms they had once signed up to, but it requires near-unanimity to impose. The biggest sanctions are a loss of voting rights in a bloc that prides itself on reaching consensus. That is less fearsome than, say, being able to strike down your enemies with lightning.As with many superheroes, it was a freakish accident of nature that gave the EU its new powers. The turning point in its case was the pandemic. One of the bloc’s responses to covid-19 was the Next Generation fund (NGEU), a €750bn ($853bn) pot of grants and loans earmarked mainly for poorer countries. Poland has long been a recipient of vast EU largesse, as anyone who has driven on its fine new highways can attest. But withholding funds that member states can tap as part of the normal union budget is complicated. When it comes to NGEU, the commission has essentially full discretion as to whether Poland is a worthy recipient. So far, it has pointedly refused to dole out any cash, even as other countries are seeing their exchequers replenished with NGEU money. That is €36bn in loans and grants that Poland could tap if Brussels says so, enough to boost Polish GDP by around 2% in the coming years.To make matters worse for Poland and the EU’s other miscreants, on February 16th the EU’s top court endorsed rules that allow the commission to withhold even old-fashioned European funds, such as those paid to boost poor regions, from members it thinks are flouting their rule-of-law obligations. That comes on top of the existing ability to levy fines on those breaking EU rules; in one such case against Poland penalties are now running at €1m a day.Pole-axedLike Peter Parker fumbling with his new web-weaving abilities, the Eurocracy needs time to adjust to these new powers. For it is not just rule-of-law violations that could be addressed. In the past Brussels railed against member states not abiding by euro-zone debt and deficit rules. The weighty rulings it produced had all the impact of a report issued by a think-tank: praised as obviously sensible, then swiftly forgotten. Now Eurocrats can ensure their recommendations are listened to, lest dollops of NGEU money be withheld. Pow!There are limits to these newfound powers. Poland has made good use of European funds, so their withdrawal would be felt by voters and make the government less popular. It is therefore keen to mollify Brussels. By contrast Hungary has squandered EU cash on projects that benefit cronies of the prime minister, Viktor Orban. A squeeze would hurt them, but affect Hungarian voters rather less. So Mr Orban has more leeway to ignore Brussels’s nagging about his serial rule-breaking. His government denounced this week’s ruling as “politically motivated”.A more humdrum constraint is whether the EU wants to use these powers at all. Eurocrats wielding such awesome authority willy-nilly might raise questions about accountability; big member states such as Germany have long pushed for a soft approach on rule-breakers. Poland has power too, or thinks it does. It has threatened to derail the bloc’s agenda. But that is mostly a hollow threat given that so much EU business is veto-proof these days.The contours of the EU’s victory against Polish judge-nobbling remain unclear. The populist government may struggle to muster a fractious parliament to endorse its climbdown. Critics deem the measures insufficient; the commission seems confident it can push for even more concessions. Poland may stay defiant. But the Eurocrats in Brussels look a lot more powerful than they did.
36  FOR SEVERAL weeks, even as they raised the alarm about Russia’s unprecedented military build-up on Ukraine’s border, Western leaders and officials emphasised that Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, had not yet made a final decision. There was still time, they said, for Mr Putin to step back from the brink. On February 18th the tone changed. Joe Biden, America’s president, said that he was “convinced”, based on intelligence, that Mr Putin’s mind was now made up. Russia would attack Ukraine “in the coming days”—and it would target Kyiv, the capital.The crisis on Ukraine’s border has simmered since October, when American officials first noticed unusual military movements that prompted them to warn, the next month, of an invasion. Now it may have come to a head. For weeks, America and its European allies have warned that Russia would seek to manufacture a pretext for war, such as a “false flag” attack which would be blamed on Ukraine. In recent days, evidence that such pretexts are being constructed has been coming thick and fast.On February 15th Mr Putin claimed, without the slightest evidence, that Ukraine’s government was perpetrating “genocide” in the Donbas, a region of south-eastern Ukraine where Russia has armed and backed proxy militias, and their self-declared “republics” in Donetsk and Luhansk. On February 18th those statelets began evacuating citizens to Russia, as the Kremlin claimed, again without evidence, that Ukraine was preparing to invade the Donbas. That evening, Russia’s state-run media circulated photos and videos of an explosion outside a government building in Donetsk and the sabotage of a gas pipeline near Luhansk. A day later both the Donetsk and Luhansk republics announced a general mobilisation for war. In Luhansk, men aged 18 to 55 were told they would not be allowed to leave. Russian media claimed that a Ukrainian shell had landed inside Russia itself.This apparently spontaneous spiral was as much theatre as crisis. The idea that Ukraine’s army, having observed exemplary restraint for months, would launch an attack while surrounded by as many as 190,000 hostile troops is fanciful. Researchers studying the videos in which the Donetsk and Luhansk leaders announced their evacuations found that the messages had, in fact, been recorded on February 16th, two days earlier, and before the escalation in shelling had begun. On February 14th Sergei Shoigu, Russia’s defence minister, told Mr Putin that the country’s “exercises”—the Kremlin’s term for the build-up—were “coming to an end” and that units would be withdrawn to barracks. Instead, in the days that followed, more forces arrived. Russia now has 110 to 125 battalion tactical groups (BTGs)—fighting formations of 1,000 or so troops equipped with artillery, air defence and logistics—deployed on the border, according to British and American defence officials.New satellite imagery published on February 18th shows large numbers of newly-arrived aircraft in Lida, in Belarus; Millerovo, a Russian air field 16km from the Ukrainian border (see below); and Valuyki, 27km from the border. Armoured vehicles belonging to Russia’s VDV airborne forces, and rigged with parachutes, have been spotted in several parts of the country. There is also evidence that Russian forces are concealing their movements. “In recent days I have seen a lot of images which show Russian troops in their camps hiding in forests, from Belarus to Soloti”, notes Konrad Muzyka of Rochan Consulting, who tracks Russian military movements. “I think Russians are doing a good job in terms of operational security”. Though Russia has consistently denied that it plans to attack Ukraine, Western security officials say that they have had insight into Mr Putin’s war plans for months, and that the Kremlin's aim is to install a pro-Russian dictatorship in Kyiv with Russian control down to the local level, backed with an occupation force if necessary.Russian units in western Russia and Crimea are expected to mount a “double envelopment”, or pincer movement, against Ukrainian troops around Donbas, where the majority of Ukraine's most sophisticated and combat-ready troops are based, shattering them and cutting them off from the west of the country—including by seizing or destroying bridges over the Dnieper. The main thrust, officials say, will probably be directed at Kyiv, by Russian forces in Belarus, accompanied by intensive use of electronic warfare and air and missile strikes on military targets and critical infrastructure. On February 17th Britain’s defence ministry published a map showing Russia’s “possible axis [sic] of invasion” consistent with these suggestions. Many Russian analysts express doubts about such grandiose plans. “I don't believe in a large-scale military march on Ukraine”, says Ruslan Pukhov, a defence expert at CAST, a think-tank in Moscow. “With such a march and any occupation of territory it is not clear what we will get out of it except more problems”. Ukraine’s armed forces have improved significantly since 2014, morale on the front line is high and they would fight. But they are lacking in air defences and are ill-prepared for the sort of sweeping combined-arms offensives and air-mobile assaults that Russia can mount. They are likely to fare poorly in the first phases of a war.However, it is far from clear that the Kremlin has a sober understanding of the degree of resistance it would then face. Less than 10% per cent of Ukrainians voted for pro-Russian parties in the last elections. Kyiv has also been preparing for an invasion for eight years, with the infrastructure of a guerrilla campaign already in place. How successful it could be depends on many factors, including the region in question. Just as important is the degree of support extended by friendly countries, such as America, Britain and Poland. “There are remarkably few historical cases of resistances that, by themselves, defeat the more powerful occupier”, notes Brian Petit, a retired American special-forces colonel, in an essay for War on the Rocks, a website. “As a rule, it takes external support to tip the scales in favour of the resistance”. Such external support may be aimed at simply bogging down Russia in a protracted and bloody occupation. Biden administration officials have suggested that the Pentagon and CIA would provide arms and other help to any Ukrainian insurgency, much as they aided the anti-Soviet mujahideen during the occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s. That may depend in part on what remains of the Ukrainian government. Poland and the Baltic states would also probably offer support. So, too, would Romania, says Jonathan Eyal of the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank, who notes that the country shares the longest—and most mountainous—border with Ukraine of any European country. “The key for Romania is Moldova”, he says. “If Ukraine falls to the Russians, Moldova is next”. Military tensions rose further as Russia began a large-scale strategic nuclear exercise on February 19th, involving cruise and ballistic missile launches to test the readiness of Russia’s air, sea and land-based nuclear forces. Though the “Grom” exercise is normally an annual event, it has been cancelled for the past two years because of the pandemic. That its resumption has coincided with the peak of this crisis is probably designed to remind America and NATO of the risks of escalation should a conflict arise—and thus the inadvisability of getting involved. Mr Putin, who is overseeing the drill, was pictured sitting with Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian president, in a command centre during the launch of a ballistic missile. A day earlier, Mr Lukashenko had repeated his offer to host Russian nuclear weapons in Belarus. At the Munich Security Conference, an annual gathering of world leaders, diplomats and spooks which began on February 18th, the crisis dominated. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, was due to attend, despite American entreaties to stay in his country. Russian pressure has forged a Western consensus on the importance of presenting the Kremlin with a common front and preparing punitive sanctions in the event of an invasion. “Transatlantic unity and cohesion have not been so palpable for a long time”, notes Jana Puglierin of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank, reflecting on the mood at Munich. That cannot have been what Mr Putin intended.Even so, most see a storm coming. Though Antony Blinken, Mr Biden’s secretary of state, plans to meet Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, in the coming days, America’s assessment that Mr Putin has already decided on war, and Mr Lavrov’s marginal role in the Kremlin’s decision-making, offer little encouragement. “For the first time in decades, we, regrettably, find ourselves on the verge of a conflict which can draw the entire continent into it”, warned Mr Lukashenko, as he sat next to an impassive Mr Putin on February 18th. America and its European allies find themselves in grim agreement. 
37  “WIND ENERGY is Schmarrn [nonsense],” exclaims Albert Köstler in his earthy Bavarian vernacular. He became hostile to wind power as mayor of the small town of Neualbenreuth, near Germany’s Czech border. Having reinvented itself as an attractive spa town, Neualbenreuth fought to prevent wind farms from spoiling the view for tourists. Now Mr Köstler’s scepticism has curdled into frustration with the pushy investors and plemplem (“crazy”) politicians who wish to stud the landscape with turbines. Bavaria’s vistas tend to inspire NIMBYism in locals, admits Roland Grillmeier, chief administrator of the nearby Tirschenreuth district. But he shares their concerns.Listen to this story.On current form, Mr Köstler has little to worry about. Last year just eight turbines were erected in Bavaria, Germany’s largest state. Indeed, where vast subsidies and legal guarantees had once turned Germany into Europe’s wind-power heavyweight, construction of turbines has lately ground to a near-halt (see chart). In the first half of 2021 coal overtook wind as the leading electricity source in Germany.That is set to change. Decarbonising German industry and energy is the guiding project of the three-party “traffic-light” coalition that took office in December. As part of its goal of turning Germany carbon-neutral by 2045, the government pledges that 80% of electricity will come from renewable sources by 2030, up from 42% today. Because demand will rise, that implies a 120-150% growth in renewables.Wind is central to that effort. The government wants to have more than 100GW of onshore wind power installed by the end of the 2020s. Account for the removal of old turbines, and that means more than doubling the current capacity, of 56GW, in eight years. By law, 2% of German territory will be set aside for wind turbines. “The face of the country is going to change,” said Robert Habeck, the Green vice-chancellor, whose climate-and-economy ministry will push the rollout. Even lobbyists are taken aback by the scale of the ambition.Hurdles lie ahead. In Germany’s federal system NIMBYs have the ear of state governments, nowhere more than in Bavaria, where since 2014 turbines have had to be placed a minimum distance of ten times their height from settlements. German industry is concentrated in southern states like Bavaria; but the northern coast is windier. Rather than scrap the “10H” rule, Markus Söder, Bavaria’s pugnacious premier, thinks Germany should invest in more north-south grid capacity.But the federal government says every state must do its bit. To press the point, Mr Habeck has embarked on an “ecological patriotism” tour of all 16, starting with a testy visit to Mr Söder in Munich. Because wind power brings revenue and rent, communities are often split. Mr Habeck says Germans should discuss his plans around their kitchen tables. Mr Grillmeier says he looks forward to a “thrilling” debate.A second problem is the bureaucratic tangles and skill shortages that clog infrastructure planning across Germany. Understaffed municipalities fearful of lawsuits are often ill-equipped to handle complex applications. Environmental checks run in circles. Even upgrading existing turbines often means a whole new approval process. The typical application takes four years, and their numbers will grow. The government vows to halve that period.Then there is the red kite, an iconic bird of prey whose flight patterns leave it peculiarly vulnerable to death by turbine. On a chilly winter day Martin Kolbe, head of the Red Kite Centre in Halberstadt, a town in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, points out a handful of the fork-tailed birds arcing gracefully over the bare trees. Birds are well protected in German law (to a fault, say wind groups). But studies still find a negative correlation between the numbers of wind turbines and red kites in a given area. Gory pictures of decapitated birds are a staple of anti-wind campaigns.More turbines will mean more dead birds. That will intensify “green-on-green” tensions between climate activists and conservationists. The government wants to shift from a legal framework that protects individual creatures to one that preserves species numbers, and to tweak the relevant EU directives. It will also enshrine a “public interest” principle giving renewables priority over animal or landscape protection. National conservation groups accept that Germany needs wind power. But their local affiliates tend to be testier. Mr Kolbe, a measured sort, says some of his conservationist peers are deeply concerned. “This will be an extremely painful discussion,” says one observer.For now Mr Habeck will treat Germany’s states as allies in his quest to get to 2%. But should some demur, the federal government could remove their powers to impose distance rules. Some expect it to convene a wind summit where state politicians will haggle over how to reach the national target. Lawsuits are likely, political bunfights certain. Yet ministers are quietly confident. “The politics of wind have changed,” says Patrick Graichen, one of Mr Habeck’s deputies. “A few years ago this was dominated by NIMBYs and protesters. Now German industry knows it needs cheap power, and the states are moving.”Germany’s Energiewende (energy transition) has been full of wrong turns and expensive missteps like the closing of its nuclear plants. But if it can get this phase right, it could prove a model for other industrialised democracies weaning themselves off fossil fuels. Mr Habeck has not tried to sugarcoat the scale of the transition. Yet Mr Köstler, for one, will take some convincing. “If I was Söder I would have sent Habeck all the way back to Berlin,” he cries. “By bicycle!” 
38  KHARKIV “COULD be occupied” by the Russians, said Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky a month ago. A few days later Joe Biden reportedly told him to “prepare for impact”, though the White House later denied the remark. On February 16th, the day that the Russians were scheduled to attack, according to one US intelligence official, the border 45 minutes’ drive north of Ukraine’s second city was being patrolled by three men and a dog. Standing five metres away from Russia, Lieutenant-Colonel Yuri Trubachev of Ukraine’s Border Guard Service said his men had seen “no activity near the border”. Meanwhile three men dressed in snow-suit camouflage and a black Labrador patrolled the dirt track along the frontier. Close to the hamlet of Zv’yazok, the border zigzags through snow-covered fields. Since 2014 the Ukrainians have dug a ditch here and built a fence, but if Russian armour suddenly appeared over the brow of the hill the dog and the three men armed with only Kalashnikovs would be somewhat outgunned. People were “terrified” when Mr Zelensky made his remark, says Denys Kobzin, director of the Kharkiv Institute for Social Research. Since then, despite a stream of videos of Russian military convoys just north of the border circulating on social media, many appear to have relaxed. Most people in this city of 1.5m people are deeply sceptical that a new all-out war is about to break out. “We have already been at war for eight years,” says Lilya, who sells salami in Kharkiv’s fancy Sumsky Market. She is referring to the low-level grinding conflict with the Russian-supported breakaway regions in the Donbas. “We are tired of worrying and most people don’t believe the Ukrainian government, the Russian government or the American government.” One reason why people in Kharkiv don’t believe in the threat of war could be that it is too awful to contemplate. Much of the city was destroyed during the second world war. Tens of thousands died in battle, starved to death or were executed by the Nazis. Today, though, not much seems to be happening on the border, or at least in the sector The Economist was allowed to visit. Ukraine’s armed and security forces say they are prepared for a Russian onslaught, and it seems unlikely that Russian forces would risk being sucked into urban warfare in an attempt to capture the city. Kharkiv is a university town and has several seats of higher education dedicated to training the next generation of policemen, soldiers and intelligence officials, all the students of which could be mobilised to fight. In 2014 pro-Russian groups stormed or besieged official buildings several times, in an attempt to seize control of the city. However, the fate of Kharkiv was sealed when Gennady Kernes, the previously pro-Russian mayor, came down on the side of Ukraine. In 2014, says Maria Avdeeva, an analyst, “people were much more frightened than they are now.” Since 2014, says Mr Kobzin, there have been big shifts in Kharkiv, which is an overwhelmingly Russian-speaking city. With friends and family just across the border, whether one was Russian or Ukrainian was not an issue that worried many until then. When forced to decide, he says, the majority opted for Ukraine. The city has changed in other ways, too. Thousands of its people now have combat experience from fighting in Donbas; scores of thousands from now separatist-held Donetsk and Luhansk have fled and settled here; and younger people, now educated in Ukrainian, not Russian, tend to be more pro-Ukrainian than older generations. In Soviet times Kharkiv, known in Russian as Kharkov, was a centre for heavy industry, including defence. In the 1990s much of that collapsed, but now the city has in good measure recovered, says Taras Danko, a professor of international business. The city used to be dominated by a few huge employers, he says, but jobs have since been created in IT, consumer goods and several other sectors. The demise of the Soviet Union and the conflict with Russia has meant that Kharkiv has had to reorient itself away from trading with its neighbour and towards Western markets. The collapse of business in the breakaway regions has also had a salutary effect on many who harbour pro-Russian feelings, he says. It is now widely understood that “we have to be part of global value-chains, and Russia is not so lucrative a market any more.”
39  VIKTOR ORBAN, Hungary’s prime minister and a hero to populists in Europe and America, faces a general election on April 3rd. Hungary’s complicated electoral system has grown more so during Mr Orban’s 12-year tenure. This is no accident: the changes are designed to keep his Fidesz party in power.Listen to this story.In 2014 the share of MPs elected from single-member constituencies was raised to 106 out of the 199 seats in parliament. (The rest are elected by proportional representation.) Single-member districts tend to favour Fidesz, the biggest party—the more so as they have often been gerrymandered. In 2018 Fidesz won 91 of them. Overall, it translated just under half of the popular vote into a two-thirds majority in parliament, a supermajority that has allowed Mr Orban and his cronies to change the constitution, pack the courts and channel billions of euros in EU aid to their allies.This year the entire opposition, from leftists to the hard right, has formed a single list to oppose Fidesz. Polls show the two sides roughly even. With the race tight, the opposition is now more worried than ever about electoral transparency. One concern is that in November the government changed the law to let voters register at any address where they receive official correspondence. This could potentially allow them to shift their registration to close districts, or even to vote twice.The National Electoral Office calls such fears groundless. It is publishing weekly updates of the number of voters who re-register, in case anything suspicious turns up. Citizens can sign up to help count the vote themselves, notes Attila Nagy, the office’s president, and all political parties can appoint members to district electoral commissions. A civic group called 20k22 is training 20,000 independent vote-counters. ODIHR, a European electoral watchdog, will send a large mission to scrutinise the campaign; it hopes to have 200 observers on election day.Yet even if fears of cheating prove overblown, Fidesz will still have an unfair edge. It has granted voting rights to ethnic Hungarian minorities in neighbouring countries. They are allowed to vote by mail, and they mostly back Fidesz. Hungarians who emigrate, however—who tend to be highly educated and to vote against Fidesz—must vote in person at consulates abroad.More important is the tilted media playing field. State broadcasters peddle Fidesz propaganda; the private media are almost entirely in the hands of Mr Orban’s allies. On election day the government will stage a referendum asking voters leading questions, such as “Do you support the unrestricted exposure of underage children to sexually explicit media content that may affect their development?” (implying the opposition do). Meanwhile billboards in Budapest portray Peter Marki-Zay, the opposition’s prime ministerial candidate, as the “Mini-Me” of a reviled former leader.For attention the opposition relies on social media and street campaigns, says Bernadett Szel, a liberal MP who lost her district in 2018 by a quarter of a percentage point. She got into parliament on her party’s proportional list, but winning her district would have given them one more seat. “We weren’t organised enough. Now we know it’s an unfair game.” 
40  TO THOSE WATCHING Russia’s long build-up of military forces around Ukraine, this week looked like the moment when they would be let slip to attack Ukraine. Some American officials predicted the moment of President Vladimir Putin’s invasion: before dawn on February 16th. But in recent days, the political signals from his underlings have suggested a desire to pull back from the brink—or at least that he is indecisive. So will it be war, or negotiations? Mr Putin still has the world guessing.On the morning of February 15th Russia’s defence ministry announced it would be pulling back some troops from the Ukrainian border. This followed comments by Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister, who said there was still scope for negotiations with the West, particularly over arms control. That appeared to mark the start of the “de-escalation” that Western countries have long demanded. Perhaps, some hoped, Russia had blinked after being faced with the united resolve of NATO allies and partners to impose “massive” economic costs on Russia if it invaded.That perception was reinforced by the State Duma, Russia’s parliament, which voted to call on the president to recognise formally the “people’s republics” of Donetsk and Luhansk, two Russian-backed self-declared statelets in the Donbas, in south-eastern Ukraine. More than 350 of the 450 deputies unexpectedly endorsed the Communist-sponsored motion. It would amount to near-annexation of the breakaway regions. Some thought it was Mr Putin’s way of declaring victory and backing down. Russia’s propagandists proclaimed that he had again wrong-footed the West.Yet the fog of diplomacy persists. At an afternoon press conference with the visiting German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, Mr Putin indicated he would not be endorsing the parliamentary vote—at least not yet. Parliamentarians had demonstrated that they understood public opinion, he said. Ukraine’s actions in the Donbas represented “genocide”—a ridiculous notion. For now, the best way of resolving the problem was for Ukraine to abide by the so-called Minsk accords of 2014-15 that sought to end the war in the eastern Donbas region. “We very much trust our partners will put the appropriate influence on the Kyiv government,” Mr Putin said. NATO’s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Russia’s apparent willingness to talk “gives grounds for cautious optimism”. But he said there was no evidence yet of de-escalation. If anything, Western sources said, Russia was still building up its forces despite the apparent movement of some units from the border region. A Russian attack on Ukraine “remains very much a possibility”, said President Joe Biden. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, was sceptical, too: “We don’t believe what we hear, we believe what we see.”Open-source sleuths say the evidence of a Russian withdrawal is limited to a single unit in Crimea. “We don’t see much sense of masses of troops getting ready to leave at the moment,” said Ruslan Leviev, an independent journalist who has documented the build-up from the start. “The advertised withdrawal mostly affects units based in regions close to Ukraine—so they won’t be going far, whatever happens.”What is more, Russia could maintain its threatening posture for weeks if not months, say Western sources. “Putin has not taken a decision either way on this,” says one. “I think he has all his options open at the moment. I don’t think he’s decided to do something. Equally, I don’t think he has decided not to do something.”Mr Putin may seek to play on the idea of a Ukrainian “genocide” of Russian-speakers in the Donbas. Under the Minsk accords, negotiated in two parts over September 2014 and February 2015, Ukraine is meant to re-absorb the breakaway regions under a “special status”. Other provisions include the withdrawal of heavy weapons, decentralisation, free elections, amnesties, and the return of control of the border to Ukraine. The accords have been responsible for holding a patchy peace since 2015, but they are fuzzy and contested, and have never been fully implemented. Privately, many in Kyiv would like to kill off the agreement, seeing it as a Trojan horse for Moscow to retain control over Ukraine, either through internal destabilisation or by a constitutional mechanism to halt the country’s shift to the Western camp. A Russian recognition of the breakaway states could have sweeping consequences. It would pave a way to formalise Russia’s military presence in eastern Ukraine. That, in turn, could be used to push the separatists’ territorial claims over the entire Donetsk and Luhansk regions, including Ukrainian-controlled cities like Mariupol, a major port and industrial hub. But by violating Ukraine’s sovereignty, it also torpedoes the Minsk accords, which might give Ukraine a means of shrugging off what it has long considered an unfair deal imposed at gunpoint. That may explain Mr Putin’s hesitation to act on the Duma’s call.For now, Russian state media played up the prospect of continued uncertainty for Ukraine. Margarita Simonyan, the combative head of the Kremlin-funded RT network, said her “boss” had shown the West he would not be forced to follow an imposed timetable. He had forced a conversation about Russian security that “nobody” was prepared to have. “We withdrew after showing people what we needed to show. Meanwhile Kyiv’s economy has been torn to shreds. A trivial matter, perhaps, but a gratifying one.”Russia’s build-up, and the predictions of an imminent invasion, have hit the Ukrainian economy hard. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, has predicted the government might need to spend up to $5bn to stabilise the economy. On February 13th the government was forced to commit nearly $600m to guarantee flights after major insurers declined fully to cover planes entering Ukrainian airspace. News of the evacuation of Western embassies—the American mission was relocated to Lviv, in western Ukraine—has meanwhile raised nervousness among the population, though there is no widespread panic.Ukrainians are living their lives in a “hyper reality”, said Volodymyr Fesenko, a political commentator. They are stuck somewhere between truth and simulation. Their reactions were reminiscent of the situation in Kyiv following the Chernobyl disaster of 1986, he said: “Back then there were those who continued to play football outside like nothing is up. But others locked themselves inside, frantically repeat-bleaching everything.” 
41  HAS RUSSIA just blinked? Or is it just closing an eye the better to aim and squeeze the trigger? After weeks of relentless military build-up by Russian forces around Ukraine, and Western threats to impose unprecedented economic pain if they invade, a choreographed scene from the Kremlin has caught the attention of Western capitals. Sitting at the end of an interminably long table, of the sort that has become de rigueur for Vladimir Putin’s diplomacy, the Russian president summoned his underlings to report on their progress. The foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, declared that the West’s response to Russia’s demands was disappointing, at times even insulting. But it had been shaken by Russia’s actions, Mr Lavrov noted, and America, in particular, had responded positively to at least some demands, notably over arms control in Europe. Talks could not drag on, but he “recommended” intensifying diplomatic contacts. “It seems to me that our possibilities are far from exhausted,” he declared, to approval from Mr Putin. Shortly thereafter Sergei Shoigu, the defence minister, said that some of Russia’s military exercises had ended and others were close to completion. Meanwhile in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, there was another sign of possible diplomatic movement. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, said that Ukraine’s membership of NATO was in practice off the table. Standing next to him Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said that joining the military alliance, though enshrined in the constitution, was “a dream”. In other words, neither man would bow to Russia’s demand for a formal guarantee that Ukraine would never join NATO. But they were more explicit than in the past in declaring that it would not happen for a long time, if ever. Whether this moves Mr Putin may become apparent when Mr Scholz visits Moscow, a week after a similar diplomatic round by President Emmanuel Macron of France. In a telephone call, President Joe Biden and the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, said there remained “a crucial window” for diplomacy. Taken together, these signals suggest it is possible to avert a looming war—should Mr Putin choose to do so. America, which has been warning that a Russian invasion could be imminent, cautiously welcomed Mr Lavrov’s comments. They matched signals he had made in private to America’s secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the State Department. But no new meetings had been set. To be credible, said Ned Price, the spokesman, Russia’s diplomatic feelers would have to be accompanied by “de-escalation”, of which there was still no sign. Indeed, Mr Putin is continuing to add to his forces around Ukraine, Western officials say. “He continues to do the things that you would expect one to do if one was planning on a major military action and that is to sharpen the readiness and to add to the capabilities of his force,” said John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman. The American embassy in Kyiv is closing, and staff are relocating to the western Ukrainian city of Lviv.Western officials talk of 14 more Russian battalion tactical groups being sent to join the 100-odd already deployed around Ukraine. They include Spetsnaz special forces and Iskander missile batteries. In the Black Sea, a Russian fleet is gathering strength, and would be able both to deploy an amphibious landing force and launch “precision fires”. The order of battle suggests a thrust from Belarus to threaten Kyiv, and an effort to encircle Ukraine’s best troops, currently deployed in the east of the country against separatist militias that control two enclaves, around the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk. In response, NATO has been sending modest forces to reassure allies in central and eastern Europe—thousands of troops in contrast with the estimated 130,000 that Russia has deployed. On February 14th hundreds of German soldiers began arriving to reinforce their presence in Lithuania, and eight more American fighter jets landed in Poland. NATO defence ministers are scheduled to discuss the crisis in Brussels on February 16th and 17th.As well as its more emollient signals Russia has also issued warnings against “provocation” by Ukraine, supposedly encouraged by Western threats and military deployments. On February 15th, the Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament, voted to recognise the breakaway regions of Ukraine, a step short of outright annexation; the proposal would be sent to Mr Putin “immediately”. Some officials in Russia suggest this might be a way out of the current crisis. In short, Mr Putin appears to be keeping all options open. He could invade Ukraine “at the drop of a hat”, say Western officials. He could keep troops deployed for an extended period as a form of armed diplomacy. And with his diplomatic overtures, he has also given himself the means of turning away from war if he deems conditions unfavourable, or thinks he has gained enough without having to take more risks. After all, Russia has always claimed to have no plan to invade Ukraine.“I like to think the Russians have blinked,” says William Taylor, a former American ambassador in Ukraine now at the United States Institute of Peace, a think-tank. “Perhaps they have examined the costs and benefits and seen that the costs are really high. But even if Mr Putin de-escalates, it will not be for ever. For as long as he’s alive he will try and try to dominate Ukraine.” Editor’s note (February 15th 2022): Since publication on February 14th this article has been updated to include the vote in Russia’s Duma to recognise the breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine.
42  A CANNON stands pointing out to sea in front of Odessa’s town hall. It is a trophy recovered from the British Royal Navy’s HMS Tiger which, during the Crimean war, ran aground here in 1854 and was then destroyed by the city’s Russian defenders. Inside the town hall, officials are now planning the defence of the Ukrainian city of 1m people, this time from the Russians. In the past week six Russian amphibious assault ships have entered the Black Sea and Odessa’s commercial ports are to be throttled this week as Russia closes maritime access for “exercises”. On February 10th The Economist was present as the city’s mayor, Gennadiy Trukhanov, presided over a meeting of local municipal and defence officials. High on the agenda was replacing defunct Soviet-era air filtration systems in the city’s 353 bomb shelters. German officials have offered help, and the mayor says he is going to ask them for these. American officials have also asked Ukraine’s mayors what they need and Odessa plans to ask for emergency communications equipment. Many officials are making plans in case all telecommunications are cut in the event of war. In the worst-case scenario Odessa’s citizens will be informed of what to do by officials armed with loudhailers and stationed on every block.Mr Trukhanov is a former soldier and clearly comfortable taking the helm in a crisis. He is however tied down by corruption charges and allegations that he is a former mafia gang member. He angrily dismisses these accusations as lies. In the meantime, he has a message for Russia’s president if he is thinking of attacking Odessa. “We have not asked anyone to come here and I would ask Mr Putin not to do it.”In 2014, when Ukraine was in the throes of revolution and Crimea had just been seized by Russia, there was a high chance that Odessa would also fall to pro-Russian separatists because there was considerable sympathy then for Russia in the city. On May 2nd of that year pro-revolution and pro-Russian demonstrators clashed and 42 of the latter died in a fire, trapped in the city’s trade-union building. The event was a turning-point in the struggle for southern Ukraine. Many pro-Russians decided that they neither wanted to die for Russia nor see their city racked by conflict.Ever since, says Viktoria Balasanian, a sociologist, pro-Russians have kept a low profile. She points out that being Russian-speaking and having an affinity with things Russian does not by any means automatically translate into wanting Odessa, which has its own strong identity, to be part of Russia. Thirty years after independence, she says pro-Russians tend to be older and nostalgic for a Soviet youth that they associate with Russia. The vast majority of younger Odessans, who have no memory of the old superpower, are proud to be Ukrainian.Artem Fylypenko, head of the Odessa branch of the National Institute for Strategic Studies, says that there were successful amphibious landings in Odessa in 1919 by White Russian forces and a Soviet diversionary attack in 1941. He says Mr Putin could try the same “but then what?” Unlike in 2014, Ukraine’s armed and other security forces are well organised and will fight—as will he.Most Odessans will be passive, though, and wait to see what happens. “If you go for a walk around the city centre, you will see that nobody is crying, everybody is relaxing and chilling,” says Viacheslav Levchenko, a software programmer. What if this calm is misplaced, and an invasion really is coming? “I will just take my passport, my family, sit in my car and go to Europe,” says Mr Levchenko.Oleg Brindak, the deputy mayor, says that up to a third of the city’s 64 city councillors hold pro-Russian views and he worries that in case of a war some might try to organise pro-Russian protests or seize buildings. But, he adds, the situation has changed since 2014. Pro-Ukrainian “patriotism” has grown and, with a nod to the breakaway Russian-supported Donetsk and Luhansk republics in the east, he says, “There will be no Odessa republic for sure.”
43  THE DRAMA started three months ago with American intelligence leaks showing a huge Russian military build-up on Ukraine’s borders. It has been unfolding ever since in a flurry of summits, marathon negotiations and constant background chatter on social media. The moment of crisis is approaching. Whether the end is war or detente, today’s suspense can surely not be sustained for long.On February 11th Jake Sullivan, President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, told American citizens that they should evacuate Ukraine within 48 hours. A war, he said, is “likely to begin with aerial bombing and missile attacks that could obviously kill civilians”, before adding that Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, has not made a final decision. Other Western governments have now issued similar warnings to their citizens. KLM, a Dutch airline, halted its flights to Kyiv on February 12th, and other carriers look set to follow suit in the hours to come. As Western citizens leave, journalists are flocking to Ukraine to arrive in time for a war that the Americans are now suggesting could begin as soon as February 16th.Russia insists that it has no intention of attacking. Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister, on February 12th accused America and its allies of waging “a propaganda campaign about ‘Russia’s aggression’ against Ukraine”. The Kremlin should be familiar with that concept. It invented the genre, after all, inventing claims about NATO’s threat to Russia and ethnic Russians in Ukraine to justify its annexation of Crimea and move into the Donbas region in south-eastern Ukraine in 2014.And it is certainly true that America and its allies are now using live intelligence as an information weapon, in the hope of deterring Russia from invading. On February 12th Mr Biden called Mr Putin, to warn him (yet again) of dire consequences should the invasion start. In his summary of the conversation, Yuri Ushakov, Mr Putin’s foreign-policy adviser, said that America’s “hysteria has reached its climax”, but also noted that the talks between the two presidents were business-like.Despite having marched its troops to the border, Russia now seems to be taken aback by the strength of the information weapon being turned against it.Over the past week The Economist has spoken to a wide range of diplomats, journalists, officials, economists and businesspeople in Russia. Few of them expected their country to go to war, and none of them wished for it. To a man and woman, they seem petrified by the consequences of such a step, were it to happen.Geopolitical tension is already hurting the Russian economy, with risk premiums reflected in bonds, stocks and currency markets, says one senior official who asked not to be named. “Russia might be less vulnerable [to external shocks] than it was before 2014, but it is still very integrated in the world economy,” the official said.Satellite images of Russia’s build-up and diplomatic warnings notwithstanding, life in Moscow and in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, is carrying on as normal. In both cities young crowds still roam in search of the latest cool bars. In Red Square children are skating on an illuminated ice-rink to the tune of “Jingle Bells”. At the weekend Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s actor-turned-president, told journalists arriving in anticipation of a war, that there was “too much information in the information space”. “We understand all the risks,” he said, but if anyone had “additional information regarding a 100%-certain invasion beginning on [February] 16th, please give us this information.”So what lies behind the latest intensification of the drama? Possibly the apparent dead-end that has been reached in talks over the status of the Donbas region. On February 10th, a day before Mr Sullivan’s statement, Russia and Ukraine had met in Berlin with representatives of France and Germany in what is known as the “Normandy format”. This is the forum for discussing the Minsk agreements, a political document forced on Ukraine in 2014 and updated in 2015, following Russia’s push into the Donbas region.In the past few years the Kremlin has issued hundreds of thousands of passports to Russian-speakers in two Russian-controlled areas, Donetsk and Luhansk. It has also been trying to oblige Ukraine to give the region a high degree of autonomy, a move that would give itself significant leverage over the whole country. Ukraine understands the dangers well and resisted this move, trying to play for time. Mr Zelensky, nudged by the West, offered to start “consultations” on drafting laws for a political settlement. But Moscow bluntly rejected what it claims is a charade.In an interview with The Economist after his return from Berlin, Dmitry Kozak, Russia’s chief negotiator and Mr Putin’s deputy chief of staff, said Russia was no longer prepared to play along with what he called a Ukrainian imitation of a peace process. After nine hours of talks between Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany, Mr Kozak said it was blatantly clear, and that written evidence has emerged, that “seven years’ worth of assurances from Ukraine and its allies, about sticking to Minsk [accords] were a bluff”. “The current Ukrainian team is not interested in a resolution to the Donbas conflict. It does not need Donbas for economic and political reasons which they are not even hiding,” he added. A simmering conflict, he argued, helps the Ukrainian government avoid responsibility for the lack of promised reforms at home and allows it to elicit aid from Western creditors and sponsors. Besides, he went on, ending the conflict would incur considerable expenses on reconstructing the ruined infrastructure and would upset a fragile balance in Ukraine's political system, to the disadvantage of the current government.Ironically, this assessment is not dissimilar to that of many Ukrainians, who feel that the reintegration of Donbas would poison the country from within. “Sometimes a negative result is a result in itself,” Mr Kozak says, adding that “We are not shutting the door, but we are not going to participate in an imitation of the peace process either. We want to resolve the issue, turn the page and move on.” While accusing Kyiv of scheming, Mr Kozak still appears optimistic that a war can be avoided.An indication of a possible way to defuse the situation without war is the news that Russia’s parliament is shortly expected to vote on a proposal, tabled by a group of loyal deputies, to appeal to Mr Putin to recognise the two self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. “This is a very serious and crucial question. We're talking about protecting the lives of our citizens and compatriots,” Vyacheslav Volodin, a powerful speaker of the Duma, said in a statement on February 11th.If Russia were to formally recognise the two self-proclaimed republics, as independent entities, or even station its troops and military infrastructure there, it would amount to something not far short of annexation, since the “republics” would be full of newly minted Russian citizens, and be unable to stand on their own feet without substantial help from Moscow.Ukraine and the West would object loudly to the redrawing of international borders by force. But the move would also lower tensions, because the immediate excuse for an Russian invasion was always likely to be a “provocation”, allegedly by Ukraine, in Donetsk or Luhansk. Even as it protested, the government in Kyiv might therefore heave a sigh of relief, and so would the rest of the world. The danger, however, is that Russia may not stop at that. 
44  “I HAVE FOUR children,” says Blanca over a midday glass of wine with olives. “None of them lives here.” There are 156 residents registered in Casarejos, down almost half from 25 years ago. Locals differ on how many children live in the village, but all use just one hand to count them.Listen to this story.Blanca is complaining to Laura Gil, a candidate for Soria Ya (“Soria Now”) in the regional elections in Castile and León, scheduled for February 13th. Soria Ya is a new party that will compete only in Soria, one of the region’s nine provinces. Allied groups will run in other provinces, too, unified loosely under the banner of España Vaciada, or “Emptied Spain”.This slogan is a twist on “Empty Spain”, a book published by Sergio del Molino, a journalist, in 2016. The parties say the countryside is not simply empty, but is being emptied by neglect that gives young people no choice but to leave in search of work and public services. The grouping was inspired by Teruel Existe (“Teruel Exists”), a party opposing depopulation in Teruel province in Aragón, next door to Castile and León. It surprised observers by coming first in Teruel in national elections in 2019, giving it an MP. That proved important: Spain’s minority government needed small parties to help install Pedro Sánchez as prime minister. Teruel Existe parlayed that into more attention for depopulation. The environment ministry is now the Ministry for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge.Soria Ya wants to imitate that success in Castile and León, where the regional president, Alfonso Fernández Mañueco of the conservative People’s Party (PP), has called early elections. Many think he did so to pre-empt the growth of España Vaciada, and to repeat the PP’s trouncing of the left last year in Madrid. If so, he may have miscalculated. Mr Mañueco is not particularly popular, and polls show Mr Sánchez’s Socialists running a close second, even though Castile and León is normally a PP fief. The new parties are also doing rather well, with Soria Ya expected to win in its province. Even if, as is likely, the PP wins the most seats in the region overall, it has little chance of securing an outright majority. That means it will have to team up with one or several other parties to form a regional government, perhaps including España Vaciada.Soria Ya says it will work with any party that promises to carry out its agenda. Its programme is almost heartbreakingly specific: add a new radiography clinic to the local hospital, upgrade a local road to a motorway and so forth. Mr Mañueco, apparently daunted by the strength of the new provincial parties, has compared them disparagingly to separatists in the Basque Country and Catalonia, who trade their occasional support of Mr Sánchez in Madrid for favours.Mr Mañueco has also tried to sound like a friend to farmers, attacking a minister in the national government for criticising “megafarms” as bad for the environment and animal welfare. But farmers are less than a quarter of the rural population, according to Vicente Pinilla of the University of Zaragoza. Country-dwellers want jobs, not hymns to tillers of the fields.In fact, Mr Pinilla argues, despite España Vaciada’s sudden prominence, depopulation is nothing new. Spain’s countryside emptied later and faster than in other countries in Europe. But young people leave farms in every fast-growing and urbanising country. In Spain the most rapid exodus was in the 1950s and 1960s, not recently. In fact, Spain’s rural population has nearly stabilised. But that masks geographical disparities: in provinces with a thriving capital city, people stay in the surrounding countryside. In those with a capital that can offer them little, they flee. Teruel Existe did best in atrophying Teruel city, Mr Pinilla points out, rather than the surrounding countryside.Ángel Ceña, Soria Ya’s leader, argues that the party is already a success, however it performs. When the Socialists and PP announced their platforms in Castile and León, they promised to grapple with depopulation, a subject he says they paid less attention to during the last election in 2019. In Casarejos, Blanca is not sure whether she will bother to vote. But she gives Ms Gil and Soria Ya credit for one thing: “You’re the only ones who come here.” 
45  THEY WERE not the sort of headlines any leader would hope to read. “Germany, NATO’s weakest link,” said the Wall Street Journal. “The ‘invisible’ chancellor heads to Washington amid fierce criticism,” offered the New York Times. As Russian troops massed on Ukraine’s border and the West fumbled for a response, Olaf Scholz, Germany’s new chancellor, stood accused by allies of being missing in action. At home Germans concerned by his reluctance to enter domestic debates detected a pattern. “Our image has been seriously damaged abroad,” says Johann Wadephul, an MP from the opposition Christian Democrats.Listen to this story.With criticism mounting, Mr Scholz has belatedly sprung into action. On February 7th he visited Joe Biden in Washington, DC. He hosted half a dozen EU leaders in Berlin this week, and on February 14th and 15th will travel to Kyiv and then Moscow for his first meeting with Vladimir Putin. Officials do not expect this sudden burst of diplomacy to bring immediate results. But it shows a sensitivity to allies’ demands for German action.The damage control was most urgent in America. Here concerns have centred on Germany’s reluctance to threaten to scrap Nord Stream 2, a new undersea Russia-Germany gas pipeline that America fears would allow the Kremlin to blackmail Europe. Mr Biden says he will kill the pipeline if Russia invades. German officials concur.But like an actor nervous of uttering “Macbeth” in a theatre, Mr Scholz refuses to let the words “Nord Stream 2” pass his lips in public. This increasingly farcical stance, designed to forestall Russian allegations that Germany is wielding energy as a weapon, wins the chancellor few friends. Nor does Germany’s stubborn denial of Ukraine’s requests for weapons.Yet on substance Germany and America are broadly aligned. The two countries have been discussing potential sanctions since last September and financial officials from the two countries now speak at least weekly. Should Russia invade, Germany would be willing to sign up to a common package. What transatlantic (and intra-EU) differences there are revolve around details, especially on the Russian gas that accounts for over half of Germany’s imports. Mr Biden, for his part, is keen to calm the storm. “Germany is completely, totally, thoroughly reliable,” he said during Mr Scholz’s visit. A group of senators who dined with the chancellor declared themselves charmed. During a TV interview Mr Scholz defended Western values with an ardour that surprised even his supporters.Germany is stepping up in Europe, too. The government will not change its mind on arms exports, but it has sent more troops to Lithuania, where Germany has led a NATO force since 2017. Emmanuel Macron has taken the diplomatic lead for Europe, but is co-ordinating with Mr Scholz. The chancellor’s team hope his visit to Moscow will pick up where the French president this week left off. The two leaders are united in trying to breathe life into the Normandy format, a diplomatic grouping that brings France and Germany together with Russia and Ukraine, thereby offering Europeans a seat at the negotiating table.These ambitions are married with frustration over the criticism laid at Germany’s door. “Maybe our allies have to come to terms with the ‘Scholz way’,” says Nils Schmid, the foreign-policy spokesman for the parliamentary group of Mr Scholz’s Social Democrats (SPD). He defines this as “short, clear statements and a refusal to be pressured into saying particular things”. During last year’s election campaign Mr Scholz presented himself as accomplished and unflappable, and so a natural heir to Angela Merkel. But Mrs Merkel had been in office for nine years when she marshalled the EU’s response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Mr Scholz has a long CV but little foreign-policy experience.Indeed, barely two months after replacing Mrs Merkel, Mr Scholz is in a tricky spot. He took office at the head of an unprecedented three-party coalition fizzing with ideas, notably on greening Germany’s industrial economy. Those plans have started to unfold, but have been overshadowed by a diplomatic crisis almost precision-engineered to test the young government’s resolve. The parties have different instincts on Russia; the SPD even has competing wings. During coalition negotiations in November no foreign-policy issue proved trickier than Russia and Nord Stream 2. “This debate has wrong-footed the government,” says a German official.Voters have noticed. Two-thirds say they are unhappy with their government’s response to the Ukraine crisis. After a narrow election win last September, the SPD has slid behind its conservative rival in polls. (The Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats, the junior coalition partners, are holding steady.) Before Mr Scholz took office half of Germans said they expected him to govern well. Now barely a fifth say he has made a good fist of things.This is despite a foreign-policy stance broadly in line with public preferences. Three-quarters of Germans do not wish to send arms to Ukraine. They support Nord Stream 2, or at least would prefer to sequester it from diplomatic rows. Few think Germany should be confrontational towards Russia. The coalition has so far defied expectations that it would prove endlessly quarrelsome. Instead, voters have grown frustrated with a leader whose reticence has been acute even by the modest standards of German chancellors. “If you order leadership from me, you will get it,” Mr Scholz once said. Germans are no doubt relieved to see him finally try. 
46  IT HAS LEFT a trail of smouldering Russian-made tanks, trucks and artillery in wars in Nagorno-Karabakh, Syria and Libya. Soon Turkey’s TB2 drone may have a chance to do so again in Ukraine, which has bought dozens of them over the past couple of years and is now bracing for a Russian invasion. On February 3rd Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, and Turkey’s, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, inked a deal to build more of them together. Some of the drones have already seen action. A TB2 destroyed a howitzer used by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine’s Donbas region in October. American officials say Russia may have been planning to fake a TB2 strike against civilians as a pretext for war.Listen to this story.Mr Erdogan sees Turkey’s drones as the harbinger of a military revolution. He wants to eliminate Turkey’s reliance on foreign suppliers and turn the country into a big arms exporter. Some of his plans are fanciful, but he has already made considerable headway. Next year Turkey expects to deliver two corvettes to Ukraine, of a model used by its own navy.Turkey’s arms industry is bigger and more self-sufficient than ever. Turnover rose from $1bn in 2002 to $11bn in 2020. Its army, the second-biggest in NATO, once relied on foreign suppliers for 70% of its needs. That is now down to 30%. Last year Turkish arms and aerospace exports reached $3.2bn, a new record.Plans to develop a homegrown defence industry first picked up steam after 1974, when America responded to Turkey’s invasion of Cyprus with an arms embargo. But they have kicked into overdrive under Mr Erdogan. Foreign pressure is again a big motivator. After Mr Erdogan purchased a missile-defence system from Russia in 2017, America banished Turkey from its F-35 stealth-fighter programme and imposed sanctions on the country’s procurement agency. Other NATO allies banned some weapons sales after Turkey attacked American-backed Kurdish rebels in Syria and supported Azerbaijan in its recent war with Armenia. Mr Erdogan now seems determined to go it alone. “We will continue,” he said last year, “until we completely free our country from foreign dependence.”Turkey’s drone programme has been the industry’s calling card. (It has also become a family affair. The head of the programme, Selcuk Bayraktar, married one of Mr Erdogan’s daughters in 2016.) At only a few million dollars a pop, the TB2s have been flying off the assembly line. Last year Poland became the first NATO member to buy them. Turkey has sold them to at least 12 other countries, including Qatar, Morocco and Ethiopia, which has used them against rebels from Tigray, its northernmost region. Evidence suggests the TB2 was responsible for an air strike that killed at least 58 civilians in Tigray in January. In Turkey’s own forever war against the guerrillas of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) in northern Iraq and Syria, the TB2 has become a routine tool. Mr Erdogan believes total victory is within reach, and rules out new peace talks.But Turkey’s ambitions go well beyond drones. The country plans to roll out its first light aircraft carrier, the 25,000-tonne  TCG Anadolu, later this year. The warship was designed with the F-35 in mind but is being refitted to carry the TB3 drone, the TB2’s more advanced cousin. Deliveries of Turkey’s first indigenous battle tank, the Altay, are scheduled to begin in 2023, though the project has been plagued by delays. Qatar, which owns 49.9% of the company that produces the tanks, has promised to purchase 100 of them. Turkey also plans to build its own submarines, unmanned attack helicopters and fighter jets.The industry has a bright future, but Mr Erdogan’s dream of self-sufficiency is unrealistic. Designing and building components like aircraft and naval engines, advanced sensors and microchips is prohibitively expensive, says Arda Mevlutoglu, a defence analyst. Foreign sanctions, which have inspired the industry’s growth, are also holding it back, disrupting procurement and exports. The most notable example is Turkey’s planned sale of 30 attack helicopters to Pakistan. The deal, worth $1.5bn, is nearing collapse because America has refused to grant Turkey an export licence for the chopper’s American-made engine.The biggest hole is the one left behind by the 100 F-35s Turkey ordered, but will not receive. Aboard the  TCG Anadolu or elsewhere, Turkey’s drones are no substitute for the advanced American fighter jets. Unfortunately for Ukraine, they are also no match for Russia’s army. The TB2s could land a few blows in the war’s early stages, says Michael Kofman of CNA, an American think-tank, but would easily be knocked out of the sky or destroyed on the ground by Russian air defences and warplanes. Conflicts with Russian proxies allowed Turkey to show off its new weapons. A Russian war with Ukraine would be a vastly tougher test. Correction (February 14th, 2022):An earlier version of this article misidentified the drone that the TGC Anadolu would carry. This has been updated. 
47  A PLAQUE ON Sarajevo’s magnificent old town hall, built under the Austro-Hungarian empire, commemorates its destruction by “Serbian criminals” in 1992. The hall has been reconstructed, but Bosnia-Herzegovina is crumbling. The country is facing its worst crisis since the end of the war in 1995.Listen to this story.The Dayton Accords that ended the fighting in Bosnia created a country composed of two main entities: the Serbian-dominated Republika Srpska (RS) and the so-called Federation, where Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) share power with Bosnian Croats. Above them was a largely toothless national government, which has gradually acquired a few more powers and a small army. A foreign “High Representative” was appointed to oversee the deal. The system helps keep the peace among Bosnia’s once-warring ethnic groups, but also provides vast opportunities for corruption.Now this structure is under threat. Milorad Dodik (pictured), the Serbian member of the country’s three-man presidency, wants to rescind powers granted by the RS to the Bosnian state. That is secession in all but name. The most explosive proposal is to recreate the RS’s army, which murdered 8,000 Bosniaks at Srebrenica in 1995. Mr Dodik’s power play started in July, after the High Representative imposed a law making it illegal to deny that the massacre at Srebrenica was genocide. Damir Arnaut, an MP, says Mr Dodik’s real aim is to “deflect debate about corruption”.Meanwhile HDZ, the main Bosnian Croat party, is threatening to scupper this year’s planned elections. For years it has objected to the fact that Bosniaks and Croats vote jointly for the Federation’s Bosnian and Croatian representatives in the presidency. Hence Zeljko Komsic, the Croat representative, is elected mainly with Bosniak votes. Mr Komsic objects to changing the electoral rules to divide the Federation’s voters by ethnicity, saying the HDZ and Mr Dodik are trying to achieve what separatist leaders failed to during the war. Those threatening Bosnia’s constitution should be arrested, he insists—seated under a portrait of Marshal Tito, the former leader of united Yugoslavia.Arguments over ethnic divisions leave Bosnia’s politicians unable to govern. The country has Europe’s second-highest death toll from covid-19 relative to population. The prime minister of the Federation is on trial for corruption relating to the procurement of sub-standard ventilators. In the RS cheap industrial oxygen was used for covid patients instead of the medical sort.On January 9th the RS’s paramilitary police marched in a parade for the republic’s 30th anniversary, though the constitutional court had ruled the holiday illegal. Looking on with Mr Dodik was the Russian ambassador. On January 5th America imposed sanctions on Mr Dodik for “attempting to dismantle” Dayton and for corruption. Individual European countries will follow suit, but not the EU as a whole, as Hungary, which supports Mr Dodik, will not allow it.The atmosphere is febrile. Some are talking of war again, although Ljubisa Cosic, the mayor of East Sarajevo, which is in the RS, says there is “no chance” of that. The border divides neighbourhoods, he says, and every day people from the RS go to work in Sarajevo while people from the capital come to ski in his constituency. Deals can be made to halt the RS’s withdrawal from national institutions, he says.Zlatko Miletic, an MP and former police chief, says the number of men under arms in Bosnia is small and that “a real war” could happen only if Serbia and Croatia get involved. Diplomats are watching Ukraine. If war breaks out there Mr Dodik, encouraged by Moscow, might ramp up his separatist drive. Bosnia has repeatedly survived crises since 1995, and will probably survive this one. But the population has shrunk from 4m in 1991 to about 3m today. Bosnians are voting with their feet. 
48  THE TREATY of Versailles, signed in 1919, is usually remembered for the humiliating punishments it heaped on Germany. But flip through the pages of the accord that ended the first world war and a lesser-known aim of the Allied powers appears: the protection of champagne. Article 275 ensured that never again would French palates have to suffer the infamy of tasting German-grown grapes passed off as Gallic fizz. Among diplomats and historians the treaty is not considered one of Europe’s finest hours, given its role in sparking the next world war. Pampered farmers are perhaps the only ones who remember it more fondly.Listen to this story.A century later, food remains the stuff of high politics in Europe. This year marks the 60th anniversary of the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy, which still manages to hijack a third of the bloc’s budget. Trade deals wanted by some member states are routinely scuppered to protect farmers in another (usually France). Now a new bunfight is gripping the continent. The European Commission in Brussels will this year propose rules that would require the nutritional qualities of all foods to be displayed on the front of their packaging. The idea is to tip off shoppers about what makes them fat. But the measure, backed by nutritionists, is being attacked by its opponents as nothing less than an assault on the European way of life.Nearly all grub sold in Europe has had to divulge its nutritional qualities (or lack thereof) since 2016. But the nagging only goes so far. The information is found on the back of the pack, written in a font size usually reserved for the finer points of insurance contracts. In 2017 French food scientists developed a system that distilled that hard-to-read data into a simple “Nutri-Score”. A standard label placed where consumers can see it would provide colour-coded grades from an acceptable A to an execrable E. Public-health officials and consumer groups laud Nutri-Score’s simplicity and have pushed for its wider use. Backed by authorities in France, Germany and Spain among others, the system has been voluntarily adopted by many retailers. The commission thinks something like it should be mandatory across the EU.The sensible push to steer consumers away from unhealthy food has run into a problem inherent in any regulation designed for 27 countries: what is backed by most ends up raising the hackles of a few. In this case the problem is Italy. Nutri-Score is unkind to many staples of Italian cuisine. A meal of prosciutto, gorgonzola and tiramisu turns out to be entirely at the wrong end of the spectrum. Even olive oil, the elixir at the heart of the country’s famed Mediterranean diet, gets only an amber light from the grading system. For Italians, ever alert to the possibility that condescending northerners are holding them to an unreasonable standard, this is provocation enough. How can their food be bad when Italy has among the lowest adult obesity rates in the rich world?Politics have helped turn the issue into a matter of national pride in Rome. Populists rail against what they call a senseless system cooked up by bloodless, tasteless technocrats. Matteo Salvini of the far-right Lega party dismisses Nutri-Score as fit only for joyless acolytes of alcohol-free wine, fake meat and edible insects. Others discern a menace to Italian agriculture, designed to benefit multinationals. Mario Draghi, Italy’s prime minister and formerly chief of Europe’s central bank, is a technocrat himself. Yet to hold his fractious coalition together, he has had to make disparaging comments about Nutri-Score, too.A crude lobbying operation complete with dodgy websites mimicking public-health agencies has popped up in opposition to Nutri-Score. It contrasts the terrible grade given to parmesan (E) with the passing mark of Coke Zero (B). How can two-thirds of the products served by KFC—a chicken outfit that owes its very existence to crispy-fried crust—be classified as no worse than mozzarella? The food-grading endeavour is painted as a ploy to undermine ancestral farming products: it is far easier to change the recipe for Coco Pops (whose formula was recently tweaked to achieve a B) than salami (a flat E).Nutri-Scorers point out that makers of processed foods, too, have lobbied against stricter labelling (though a few now endorse it, including Kellogg’s, which makes Coco Pops). Serge Hercberg, an academic who helped devise the scheme, describes it as an obvious health measure. Finding skewed comparisons is easy, but foods should be compared to alternatives in the same category: one cannot replace a can of Coke with a cup of olive oil (which, he notes, scores better than butter). Italy has a child obesity problem, and the Mediterranean diet it defends originally included rather more fruit and vegetables than makers of cured ham would like to admit. “Even if foods are ancestral, it does not mean they are good for you,” Mr Hercberg says. As for KFC, the parts of its menu that score well are wholesome: a side of cherry tomatoes, for example.Food for thoughtThe Italian griping has caught on. Farmers in France and beyond worry bad scores for their products will crimp sales. Agriculture ministries are being coaxed to pare back Nutri-Score even where it has already been adopted. A proposal to create a special category for alcohol (a black F, sadly) is being used to galvanise more opponents. Italy has developed an alternative labelling scheme so confusing that it seems aimed at making a food’s healthiness utterly unknowable. And national governments will have plenty of opportunity to hollow out the commission’s proposals, as they did when the issue of food labelling last came up a decade ago.They should not, however. For all the raucous disagreement, Nutri-Score’s fans and detractors are not so far apart. Italians are slim despite all that pecorino and gelato because they know these treats should be enjoyed in moderation. Professor Hercberg and others say much the same thing: everything is fine, if you adjust the quantities. Even a glass of Italian wine, perhaps. Salute!
49  “SHE’S THE best!” declares Adrien, a 20-year-old student, cradling a French tricolore flag. He is waiting in the winter sunshine outside a trade hall on the outskirts of the cathedral town of Reims, where a rally for Marine Le Pen is about to start. “Before making decisions,” explains Adrien, “she asks people what they think, how they live, to find the best solution to their problem.” Alexandre, a fellow student, agrees. The nationalist-populist candidate at April’s French presidential election, he adds, is focused not only on “braking mass immigration” but also on the cost of living. As for Emmanuel Macron, the president, “We detest him.”Listen to this story.Young French voters, like those in many countries, seem set to vote differently from their elders. Yet in France the split is not simply that youth are more liberal and retirees more conservative. One surprise is the enduring popularity of Ms Le Pen among the young. Only 8% of over-70s say they will back her, according to Ipsos, a polling group. Her share of the vote among under-25s is double that.Some pensioners share the fears of immigration that Ms Le Pen stirs up. Indeed over-70s are keen on Eric Zemmour, a hard-right candidate, former television commentator and polemicist, who vows to “save France” from an immigrant invasion. But they recall too that in 2017 Ms Le Pen vowed to take France out of the euro—a pledge the candidate has since given up, but which made retirees edgy about their pensions. Younger voters seem as drawn to Ms Le Pen’s promise to help with the cost of living as to her flag-waving. She promises to abolish income tax for the under-30s, as well as to cut VAT on petrol and energy bills and lower motorway tolls.The Greens’ Yannick Jadot gets some youth support. So, more improbably, does the hard left’s Jean-Luc Mélenchon. An early convert to social media, he held rallies in 2017 which featured himself in one town and his holographic image in another. This year the 70-year-old plans to repeat the same trick. Last month in the western city of Nantes Mr Mélenchon held an “immersive and olfactory” meeting, complete with the sounds and smells of the sea. Like Bernie Sanders in America, he has a grandfatherly appeal and a cult following.Among the leading candidates to make the run-off stage of the two-round election, the one the young favour least is Valérie Pécresse. Fully 28% of over-70s plan to vote for the centre-right Republicans’ nominee, a fiscally prudent cultural conservative. Her plans to raise the retirement age to 65 no longer concern this age group; her family values are reassuring. Only 8% of under-25s, however, say she will get their vote. The more socially liberal among them recall that Mrs Pécresse voted against gay marriage in parliament in 2013.As for Mr Macron, he does less well among the young than in other age groups. But past policies are beginning to bring rewards. Thanks to a big expansion of apprenticeships, youth unemployment has fallen to its lowest level for almost 15 years. The president, who has a distant relationship with youth culture, has tried to engage with it a bit more. Last year, to the consternation of traditionalists, he invited Mcfly and Carlito, two popular YouTubers, to the Elysée palace, where he took part in a game of “true or false”. The young may not be his biggest fans, but neither does anyone else eclipse him in their eyes. Among those who have decided on their vote, Mr Macron does better than any other candidate. 
50  “I DON’T BELIEVE in spontaneous miracles,” declared Emmanuel Macron shortly after boarding the presidential plane from Paris for Moscow on February 7th. The French president looked unreasonably calm ahead of one of the more testing diplomatic trips he has made since he was elected five years ago. It was a test both of his ambition to take over as Europe’s leading diplomat and of his capacity to do anything meaningful to ease tensions in the crisis over Russia and Ukraine. After five hours of late-night talks with Vladimir Putin, Mr Macron flew to Kyiv on February 8th and stood beside Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, whose country lives under the threat of invasion. Mr Macron said that he had secured a pledge from the Russian president that, as things stood, Mr Putin “would not be the cause of an escalation” of the crisis on the border with Ukraine. Promises from Mr Putin are worth what they are worth. The Kremlin was prompt to deny it had made any such commitment, and there was no publicly verifiable statement to back up his claim. As it is, Mr Macron is suspected by many Western allies of putting too much trust in the Russian leader. Yet Mr Macron, speaking on the way from Moscow to Kyiv, seemed confident that this could “block” the momentum towards war, and that it would now be “possible to make progress on negotiations” to ease tensions between Russia and Ukraine. Mr Macron is only two months away from an expected re-election bid. His week of frenzied diplomacy is in some ways the coming together, for better and for worse, of different strands that have run through his presidency, and which will be scrutinised both at home and abroad. These include his ambition to secure Europeans a place at the high table when it comes to a crisis on their doorstep—a form of strategic voice, which Mr Macron has advocated ever since taking office. Only three weeks ago, there was palpable frustration in Paris about being side-lined diplomatically in the face of the greatest military build-up the continent has seen since the end of the cold war. America and NATO have led and framed the dialogue with Mr Putin over the Russian build-up at its border with Ukraine, merely “debriefing” Europeans afterwards, as one French presidential adviser then put it. The “Normandy Format” of four-way talks between France, Germany, Ukraine and Russia, had stalled. Europe, viewed from Paris, seemed to have little say.For Mr Macron, who has long argued for a strategic dialogue with Russia, to the exasperation of NATO members close to the Russian border, this was irksome. All the more so, since the French analysis of the military situation on the Russia-Ukraine border was somewhat at odds with that of Britain and America, which declared that a Russian invasion was “imminent”. French intelligence showed the same amassing of trucks, tanks and troops on the border, and French diplomats shared the view that the situation was both worrying and volatile. But French diplomats insisted that it was not possible to deduce that an offensive was imminent. It is against this background that Mr Macron’s diplomatic tour this week has to be set. He has in the past faced criticism for his freewheeling unilateral approach. Ahead of his trip to Moscow this week, some argued that it was unhelpful to hold a separate parallel dialogue with Mr Putin outside NATO. They suspect the French president—despite his repeated protestations—of seeking to undermine the alliance. Yet Mr Macron has learned from such criticism. This time, the French president secured backing for his shuttle diplomacy from President Joe Biden, as well as Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary-general, and leaders of the Baltic states. His trip was closely co-ordinated with Germany, whose chancellor, Olaf Scholz, greeted Mr Macron in Berlin straight off the plane from Kyiv. He also spoke at length to Mr Zelensky, whom he had first met in Paris when the Ukrainian leader was campaigning for office. Mr Macron’s initiative is threefold. First, he is seeking to ease immediate tensions in order to reduce the likelihood of war. The French president afterwards described the tension in his talks with Mr Putin at the Kremlin as “palpable”, and warned that the risk of “incandescence” on European soil was still real. The French see in the Kremlin’s confirmation on February 8th that Russia would withdraw his troops after exercises in Belarus, for example, a sign that there might now be a narrow path to de-escalation.This could be an important step towards reviving, with the Germans, the Normandy Format talks. Negotiators met recently in Paris, and are due to meet again in Berlin on February 10th. Speaking in Kyiv, Mr Macron said he hoped that the four leaders themselves might be able to meet in the coming weeks. The French argue that this is now the best way to find an “off-ramp” for Mr Putin. In the longer run, Mr Macron wants to start a broader conversation about Europe’s “new security order”, particularly on its eastern flank. Many NATO allies are deeply wary of this idea, which would somehow have to allay Russia’s fears of NATO expansion, and the contours of which remain ambiguous.Nobody can accuse Mr Macron of lacking ambition. Mr Putin said wryly that the French president had “tortured” him by talking on and on for over five hours—at a vast oval table, and over a dinner of reindeer with sweet potatoes and blackberries. Mr Macron acknowledged that the Normandy Format, based on the implementation of the Minsk II accords signed in 2015, including by Ukraine, is “politically complicated”. In Kyiv, a cautious Mr Zelensky said that he “supported” France’s position, and welcomed its help. But some elements of the Minsk accords would put him in a delicate domestic situation. Indeed, the French president is treading a perilous path between his own friends’ suspicions and Mr Putin’s belligerence. Mr Putin may blithely trample over any commitments the French think he made. Mr Macron faces criticism in some quarters for even attempting to bring Mr Putin to heel, and in others for attempting to slip into the shoes of Angela Merkel, the former German chancellor, who was Mr Putin’s preferred European interlocutor. Mr Macron seems convinced that creative diplomatic thinking, backed by deterrence and sanctions, could yet help Europeans find a way to stop war on their own continent. In the meantime, Mr Macron may have bought some time, if little else. 
51  IGOR “STRELKOV” GIRKIN isn’t used to playing down the idea of a Russian advance into Ukraine. As the Russian army veteran who led the first major armed group into provincial Sloviansk in April 2014, in effect he started the war in the Donbas region. Once there, he spent the next few months urging Vladimir Putin, with increasing desperation and belligerence, to back him the whole way: to link Russian-speaking people in eastern Ukraine from Kharkiv to Odessa and recently-annexed Crimea. That would have put a vast swathe of additional territory under Russian control. But the troops never came.Now, Mr Girkin says the moment has passed. Ukraine has armed itself with modern weapons, and a ground invasion would be a huge and protracted undertaking. “There aren’t nearly enough troops mobilised, or being mobilised,” he says. “The maximum Putin is doing is a military distraction, possibly to draw troops away from an operation in the Donbas.”The former commander is one of many in Moscow who are dismissing talk of an invasion. If a big war in Europe does follow—the sort that many Western analysts believe flows logically from the deployment of a large conventional force, along with supporting infrastructure on three sides of Ukraine—most Russians will be caught off-guard. Official propaganda is not gearing up for it. The elite isn’t predicting it. An exasperated radio talk-show host confesses she has given up looking for a counter view. “Everyone I invite on says the same thing: this is Putin’s brinkmanship rather than war.”This scepticism is shared by those who helped to shape Russia’s political system. Gleb Pavlovsky, a close adviser to Mr Putin during his first two terms in power, from 2000 to 2008, says the Kremlin believes it gains much more from the threat of war than war itself. The appearance of rapid escalation is essential to making any threat effective; this is a lesson Moscow policymakers learned from the American military strategist Thomas Schelling. That does not make the threat entirely illusionary, or a bluff. “The danger is that they are not entirely in control of their red lines,” he says.For now, Russia and America continue talking, while the hardware continues to arrive. A state of “permanent negotiation”, routine talks and top-table recognition could be a goal in itself, Mr Pavlovsky suggests. What the Kremlin is not yet doing is overtly selling the idea of an invasion to its people. Officially, the country only ever fights “peacekeeping” operations. In 2008, officials said it had “compelled Georgia to peace”. In 2014, it accepted Crimea into the Russian Federation after an “overwhelming referendum in favour”. A big attack on Ukraine would require a lot more creativity. Centuries of close cultural and familial ties make it harder to create a pretext for an invasion. Even after eight years of conflict and propaganda, Russians remain split on Ukraine. Surveys by the Levada Centre, independent pollsters, suggest that nearly six in ten people are against any war with their “brotherly” neighbour. The government’s official position is in line with the majority. Late in January a spokesman for the foreign ministry described a war with Ukraine as “unthinkable”.Officials, however, said much the same thing just before the annexation of Crimea in 2014, when Mr Putin stole that long-sought jewel and boosted his approval rating to 89% (it is now back down at 69%). Many of the same local experts failed to predict that Mr Putin would launch that operation and risk international ostracism. And knowledge of how Russia’s leader of 22 years makes his decisions has, if anything, worsened since then. The present situation, though, is different from the Crimean scenario. There is no clear benefit in taking over a war-torn, hard-up and hostile country, especially if and when the body bags begin piling up. No one is attempting to argue that Ukraine belongs to Russia. The price of conflict—more sanctions and a long economic squeeze—is well understood. Drops in the stockmarket and the value of the rouble stoke public fears. Some 10% of Russians are now shareholders, a number that has grown 16-fold since Crimea. The most worried are selling up and leaving.Alexei Levinson of Levada says the Kremlin might still build a majority in favour of war if Mr Putin decides to go in. The president’s core supporters, most notably among the elderly, share his hostility to NATO and a belief that Ukraine is not a truly independent country, but a proxy of America. Such a war could be sold, and neither local criticism nor shocks to the economy would provide a significant impediment to an invasion. That is the nature of the Putin regime.As he weighs his choices, the Russian leader is unlikely to feel constrained by foreign views that war is probable and anything else would be a climb-down. What may count for more is the question of what exactly he can extract from negotiations with his American counterpart. If he were to win significant concessions, and avoid a war, Mr Putin would be applauded back home. “The one thing supporters never demand from him is honesty,” says Mr Levinson.  
52  BLOOD MAY soon be spilled in Ukraine, but will it be real or fake? On January 31st authorities arrested a group they said was planning to stage riots in Ukrainian cities. The plot allegedly involved thousands of paid anti-government protesters, smoke bombs and litres of fake blood for the cameras, with medics on the scene to simulate first aid. The goal, explained Ihor Klymenko, Ukraine’s police chief, was to shake the country with viral images of unrest and police brutality.Listen to this story.Yet two days earlier, Ukraine’s government dismissed leaks from American intelligence officials that Russia was transporting supplies of blood to its troops at the Ukrainian border to treat potential casualties of war. “The purpose of such information is to spread panic and fear in our society,” wrote the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, in a Facebook post. A rhetorical and analytical rift has opened between Ukraine and America. While the Americans warn of an imminent Russian invasion, Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, thinks the gravest threat may come from within.Mr Zelensky rejects the assessment reportedly delivered over the phone by Joe Biden, the American president, that a Russian invasion of Ukraine is “certain” and that Kyiv, the capital, could be “sacked” (America has denied the report). He has reproached foreign leaders for their dire rhetoric and suggested that Russia’s military menace is nothing new. “I’m the president of Ukraine, I’m based here, and I think I know the details deeper than any other president,” Mr Zelensky said.Many foreign diplomats express frustration with Mr Zelensky, whom they see as inexperienced and thin-skinned. They note that he demands urgent deliveries of arms from the West while pooh-poohing the prospect of a full-blown war for which those weapons would be needed. Much of Washington’s foreign-policy establishment this week descended on Kyiv, to show support but also to bypass the government and explain the risk of invasion directly to locals. Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, visited Kyiv on February 1st and weighed in to note Russia was now conducting “the biggest demonstration of hostility towards Ukraine in our lifetimes”.Petro Poroshenko, who lost power to Mr Zelensky in 2019, argues that what Mr Putin wants and what he does are different things. “Ultimately, his decisions [on war] will depend on the strength of Ukraine, its national unity and the solidarity of the West. He will only go as far as he is allowed to go. My message is: ‘Don’t trust Putin and don’t be afraid of Putin.’ Strength and resolve is the only language that works,” he said in an interview.For eight years Ukraine has been at war with Russian-backed separatists in its eastern Donbas region. The prospect of Russian escalation is a perennial threat. It does not need to occur to hurt Ukraine’s morale and discourage investment. Many Ukrainians, who take a stoical attitude to the situation, appreciate Mr Zelensky’s calm. The foreign ministry rebuked America and Britain for evacuating staff from their embassies in Kyiv, calling it “excessive caution”.Some Ukrainians mistrust America’s spies, who they think view Ukraine as a pawn in a wider struggle with Russia. The steady drip of American intelligence leaks seems to them to be serving American plans for Europe’s security, rather than helping Ukraine. But Mr Zelensky’s defenders feel the rift is overstated. They say he is simply staying positive in public while planning privately for a crisis, as any leader might. After all, America and its allies are still sending Ukraine aid, sharing intelligence and pressing Russia to back down.America sees Ukraine’s armed forces as overmatched, making a Russian occupation possible. But Ukrainians have faith in the country they have built since 2014. If Russia were to invade and establish a puppet regime, it would face not just an insurgency but—just as frustrating—an unco-operative bureaucracy. The country has purged its police force of pro-Russian officers; new applicants must explain to a commission how they would respond to illegal orders. Even for corrupt Ukrainians atop patronage networks, a Russian occupation is not enticing. In the Donbas, it has meant economic collapse. In Crimea, local elites must compete for spoils with powerful officials dispatched from Moscow. Ukrainian officials may sometimes be crooked, but that does not mean that their loyalty is for sale to Russia, declares one defence contractor in Kyiv.Yet even if Ukraine is more resilient than Americans think, Mr Zelensky is in a bind. If a full-blown invasion comes, his decision to play down the risk could cost him public trust. In negotiations in Munich next week with Russia, France and Germany, he will face pressure to implement the Minsk protocols, a deal imposed by Russia at gunpoint in 2015 which in effect gives Ukraine’s pro-Russian regions a veto over foreign policy. On January 31st the head of Ukraine’s national security council said the country would not implement the protocols, and the West should stop pushing it to do so. The Opposition Platform For Life, a Russia-friendly party, is waiting for Mr Zelensky to stumble. So is his predecessor, Mr Poroshenko, an oligarch whom Mr Zelensky’s government has charged with high treason—another reason for Western disappointment.But Ukrainians understand the difference between an imperfect president and the system he bestrides. Mr Zelensky’s statements are “irritating for us, he may be irritating for the West,” says Oleksiy Haran, a political scientist at the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. “But that is what goddamn democracy is about.” If war comes, it is Ukraine’s democracy, messy as it is, that will be at stake.
53  THE MUNICIPAL offices in the Estonian city of Narva are just a snowball’s throw from Russia. From her window Katri Raik, the mayor, can watch cars and lorries trickling through a border checkpoint. More than 80% of Narva’s residents are ethnic Russians, a legacy of the centuries during which Narva was part first of the Russian empire and then of the Soviet Union. Ethnic Russians, nearly a quarter of the population, have grown more integrated since Estonia became independent 30 years ago. Yet most send their children to Russian-language schools and rely on Russian media. “Yesterday someone on the city council said ‘U nikh v Estonii tak [That’s how it is over there in Estonia],’” says Ms Raik.Listen to this story.A former interior minister, Ms Raik was elected in December pledging to bridge the gap. A new Estonian-language school will open in September. The regional economy is now oriented towards the West. But Russia’s military build-up on the Ukrainian border is reminding Narva of where it sits. Opinion is divided along familiar lines. In several conversations, ethnic Estonians saw Russia as the aggressor, whereas ethnic Russians tended to think the risk of war exaggerated or to blame NATO. “We each know what the other thinks, so we simply don’t talk about it,” says Ms Raik.Across eastern Europe, the threat of war in Ukraine evokes long-standing fears. Most countries, Estonia included, are NATO members and face no immediate risk of incursion. But Russian and Soviet expansionism has shaped their politics for centuries. These days many eastern Europeans are at odds with the Kremlin over energy supplies or Russian-financed corruption. Others have friendlier relations, helped by trade, Russian-speaking minorities or politicians who get on with Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president. But even in such places, the crisis in Ukraine is causing problems.The Baltic countries, which were Soviet territory until 1991, are the strongest voices for deterrence and harsh sanctions. “Interdependence means you can hurt the one who is dependent on you,” says Kaja Kallas, Estonia’s prime minister, whose mother’s family was deported to Siberia under Stalin. Her government is trying to send weapons to Ukraine, but Germany has been blocking the passing-on of German-made equipment. On January 27th Latvia’s defence minister called the German stance “immoral and hypocritical”.Last summer, when Mr Putin wrote an essay claiming that Ukraine was not a legitimate nation, it rang alarms in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, because he had made similar arguments about them in the 2000s. Defence planners in these countries consider Russia an existential threat.In Romania and Bulgaria, things are more complex. Both are NATO members. But their politics are plagued by corruption, some of it tied to Russia. They have not always been enthusiastic about American policies that link anti-corruption efforts to regional security. Romanian politicians have clamoured for years for NATO to upgrade its presence, though Bulgarian ones downplay new deployments to avoid provoking voters with Russian sympathies. Still, both countries were furious when Russia demanded on January 21st that NATO pull allied forces out of their territory. On February 2nd Joe Biden instead announced the deployment of an additional 3,000 troops to the regionIt is in central Europe that attitudes towards Russia are most ambivalent. Viktor Orban, Hungary’s populist prime minister, is friendly with Mr Putin and visited him in Moscow on February 1st. He has imitated Mr Putin’s model of government by taking control of his country’s media and judiciary. He has also bought Russian nuclear power plants, struck deals for Russian gas that circumvent Ukraine and persistently called for relaxing EU sanctions. Milos Zeman, the Czech Republic’s president, is cosy with Mr Putin, too. But Petr Fiala, the new Czech prime minister, is solidly in step with NATO and the EU.Poland’s government also has some affinity with Mr Putin’s. It is conservative, religious and nationalist, and is fighting with the EU over its efforts to turn judges into political pawns. Yet it is the most fiercely anti-Russian government in Europe. The Russian empire ruled much of Poland throughout the 19th century and tried to Russify its population. In the second world war Stalin carved Poland up with Hitler and executed much of its elite. Many Poles see Russia as a country that tried to eliminate them as a nation.Eastern European countries will pay a price for isolating Russia, especially in energy. In October Moldova was forced to strike an expensive gas deal with Gazprom, and rising electricity bills nearly toppled Ms Kallas’s government in January. But only for the Baltic countries is Russia among the top five export markets. In no country is direct investment from Russia more than a tenth that from the EU, though in some pockets it plays a significant role.In Narva, for instance, about 30% of the firms in the city’s industrial zone are owned by Russians, reckons Vadim Orlov, the zone’s director. Russian businessmen want factories in a country governed by the rule of law. Why should Estonia back sanctions that could make things harder for its own Russian-owned businesses?One reason is that Russia likes to use sanctions too. Ms Kallas mentions 2007, when it retaliated for the removal of a memorial to Soviet soldiers in Tallinn by cutting off fuel supplies. Dumitru Alaiba, a Moldovan MP, recalls 2014, when Russia hit his country with an embargo after it signed an association agreement with the EU. “[We] have learned that dealing with Russia has risks,” says Ms Kallas. If the region’s ties to Russia are further weakened, Mr Putin will have himself to blame.  
54  SO KEEN ARE the French to evict any leader they vote into office that the language even has a word for it: dégagisme. No French president has been re-elected for 20 years. This April, five years after Emmanuel Macron seized the presidency in his first attempt at winning elected office, voters will decide whether to keep him on for a second term. The Economist’s election model, launched on February 2nd, suggests that they will. It puts Mr Macron’s chance of re-election at 79%. If he wins, the 44-year-old will break yet another rule of French politics.Listen to this story.Our model suggests that Mr Macron’s most serious challenger is the candidate of the centre-right Republicans, Valérie Pécresse. Yet on February 2nd it put her chances of becoming France’s first female president at only one in eight. The model gives the nationalist Marine Le Pen even worse odds: one in 17. Even this is far better than the chances for Eric Zemmour, a far-right polemicist, whose entry into the race dented Ms Le Pen’s poll numbers; his current polling average of just 13% and poor showing in hypothetical match-ups give him a 1% chance of victory. On the left, no candidate has even as much as him.To produce these results, The Economist has built a poll-based statistical forecasting model. The election will have two rounds, on April 10th and 24th. Our model, which runs 10m simulations a day, calculates the probability of each candidate reaching the second-round run-off, and of then winning that to secure the presidency. Charles de Gaulle devised this electoral system as a direct “encounter” between a candidate and the people, unfiltered by an established party. Before narrowing the choice to two, it offers outsiders the chance to try their luck against party nominees—provided they secure the 500 signatures from elected officials needed to validate their candidacy.The Economist’s model gives Mr Macron greater chances of winning than the disgruntled mood in France might suggest. He may lead in first-round polls, but the French are scarcely enamoured. Nearly half of voters tell pollsters that they will vote for a candidate from the extremes, either on the left or the right. Mr Macron detonated the previously dominant two-party structure in 2017, having launched his centrist party, now called La République en Marche. He remains a divisive figure, resented by left and right alike, and reproached for a haughty and know-it-all governing style. Anti-vax protesters regularly take to the streets. Teachers and parents have been exasperated by the complex covid-19 testing regime in schools.In January Mr Macron’s approval rating was only 38%, according to Kantar, a polling outfit. This is better at this point in his presidency than either of his two immediate predecessors, François Hollande (19%) or Nicolas Sarkozy (29%). But it is lower than that of the only two presidents to have won re-election since de Gaulle: François Mitterrand in 1988 and Jacques Chirac in 2002. Each was helped by running for re-election while in “cohabitation” with a government from the opposition, which deflected responsibility for voters’ gripes away from the president. Mr Macron enjoys no such advantage.Mr Macron’s favourable odds stem from his consistent and significant first-round poll lead, combined with his very high chances of beating either Ms Le Pen or Mr Zemmour in a run-off. Under the French system, victory in the run-off can come despite a far-from-commanding first-round score. In 2017 Mr Macron secured just 24% of the initial vote, but won 66% in the second round.Politically, Mr Macron’s base seems quite loyal. His 24% first-round score in 2017 roughly matches his showing in polls today. Those who say they will vote for him in April are more certain of their choice than are those who back Mrs Pécresse, according to Ipsos, another polling group. Mr Macron’s party has successfully occupied a broad political space, borrowing politicians from the left and the right, crushing many potential rivals and splintering the opposition. The Socialist Party, supplier of two previous Fifth Republic presidents, is a feeble version of its once grand self.Moreover, Mr Macron’s management of the economy and the pandemic has proved reasonably solid. In 2021 French GDP rebounded at a rate of 7%, its fastest growth for 52 years. Workers and firms have been protected from lay-offs and closures by generous government support. The employment rate for 15- to 64-year-olds has reached a record high. The latest wave of covid infections seems to have peaked. France’s vaccination rate for first doses is higher than in Britain and Germany, and its number of excess deaths is lower.That said, odds this favourable to Mr Macron do not mean that he will inevitably win. Were he to face Ms Le Pen or Mr Zemmour, the polls say he would beat each by a fair margin. But should his opponent be Mrs Pécresse, the race would be tighter, and could easily tighten more.Our model gives the Republicans’ nominee, who enjoyed a bump after winning the party’s primary in December before sliding back in the polls, a 32% chance of reaching the run-off. The polling averages currently give Mr Macron a six-point lead in such a match-up—a fairly narrow margin. A serious candidate who knows her brief and likes to call herself “two-thirds Merkel and one-third Thatcher”, Mrs Pécresse has been criss-crossing the country on the campaign trail. Ipsos suggests that 50% of those who back Mr Macron say that Mrs Pécresse, once considered a potential recruit to his government, would be their second choice. To be sure of defeating her in a run-off, Mr Macron would need to get out the vote on the left, which is out of her reach but might be tempted to abstain.French election campaigns can also twist in unexpected ways. Three months before the first round in 2017, only one poll suggested that the eventual victor, Mr Macron, would get to the run-off. Our model tries to allow for unexpected poll movements, but does not incorporate the possibility that Mr Zemmour fails to secure his 500 signatures and so drops out. If he did Ms Le Pen’s score would rise sharply and Mrs Pécresse’s place in the final would be very much at risk, to Mr Macron’s benefit.Indeed, a 21% chance of Mr Macron losing, our starting projection as the model goes live, is not trivial. It reflects the risk not only of a late-breaking scandal but also of polls being off by a higher-than-usual margin. Much can happen in the ten weeks before a first-round vote, as Mr Macron knows full well. But at this point the sitting president, despite the reproaches hurled his way by voters, is looking well placed to keep his job. Correction (February 2nd 2022): Due to a coding bug, an earlier version of this story displayed slightly lower odds for Valérie Pécresse and slightly higher odds for Marine Le Pen. This has been amended.
55  BLANKETS OF SNOW cover Igdir, a drab town in eastern Turkey near the border with Armenia. Mount Ararat, where Noah and his ark supposedly washed up after a spot of rain, towers over the scene. The closest big city, Yerevan, Armenia’s capital, is 30km away. But there is no going there, nor is there a way for Armenians to reach Turkey by land. The border between the two countries is closed. At the crossing outside town, Turkish soldiers stand guard opposite an unused customs building, braving the cold.Listen to this story.Happily, a thaw seems to be coming. Turkey and Armenia, divided by regional disputes and the legacy of the mass murder of Armenians by Ottoman forces over a century ago, are talking again. Flights between Yerevan and Istanbul, home to nearly  Turkey’s remaining Armenians, resumed on February 2nd, after a hiatus of two years. Weeks earlier, the two countries launched talks aimed at normalising ties. (Armenia and Turkey have never established diplomatic relations.) Armenia’s foreign minister will attend a conference in Turkey in March. The opening of the border may be next.Armenia is cut off from the east by Azerbaijan, with which it fought a war less than two years ago. It is separated from Russia, its main ally, by Georgia, and largely excluded from regional transport and energy projects. It has much to gain from direct trade with Turkey, a market of nearly 85m people. (Armenia is home to a mere 3m, and much poorer.) A reopened border could become its gateway to Europe.Places like Igdir could undoubtedly use the boost from trade, too. Turkey’s currency crisis and surging inflation, which reached an annual rate of 49% in January, have made the region, which was already one of Turkey’s least developed, even poorer. At a teahouse in Orta Alican, a village close to the border, farmers sitting around a wood stove complain they can no longer afford fertiliser, whose price has tripled in only a few months, or diesel. One of the men recently sold most of his cows because he could not afford animal feed. For some, the only way to escape poverty has been to escape altogether. Over the past year, says Davut, one of the farmers, as many as 30 men from the village, about one per household, have upped sticks, many for Europe. Davut’s own brother was recently caught by border guards in Croatia. He had sold all his possessions to pay smugglers over $8,000 for passage to France. “If I had that much money,” says Davut, “I would leave as well.”Over the past three decades, the fate of the border has hinged on events hundreds of kilometres to the east, in Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian enclave inside Azerbaijan. Turkey closed the border in 1993, out of solidarity with Azerbaijan, towards the end of a bloody war that saw Armenian forces take control of the enclave and occupy seven neighbouring Azeri districts. In the war in 2020 Azerbaijan, backed by Turkey, recaptured much of the region (see map). Armenia’s defeat means one of the main obstacles to the reopening of the border, and to Turkey’s rapprochement with Armenia in general, is now gone.Turkey and Armenia were on the verge of patching up most of their differences in 2009, before a backlash from nationalists on both sides, and from Azerbaijan too, upended the process. Things are different today. Armenia, defeated and more dependent than ever on Russia, is negotiating from a position of weakness. America and Europe, which once saw the rapprochement as a way to dilute Russian influence in the Caucasus, are less involved. Turkey itself has become more cosy with Russia. The talks in 2009 took place in Zurich. The current ones are in Moscow.Normalisation, if it happens, will not mean reconciliation. Turkey refuses to recognise the deaths of 1m or so Armenians in 1915-17 as a war crime, much less as genocide. Armenians arriving in Igdir would be aghast to spot a towering statue, featuring 40-metre swords raised to the sky, commemorating the “genocide” not of Armenians by Ottoman Turks, but the other way around. A monument to Turkish-Armenian friendship, built on another section of the border, was demolished in 2011 after Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s president, called it a monstrosity.Attitudes on the ground are less stubbornly entrenched. Locals in Igdir say that they would welcome visiting Armenians. “If the border were to open tomorrow, 99% of the people here would approve,” says Murat Yikit, the town’s former mayor. The opening would of course not transform the region’s economy or the relationship between the two countries overnight. “But it would give young people from both sides a chance to overcome past hatreds,” says Habip Eksik, a local lawmaker from the progressive Peoples’ Democratic Party. There are some good omens. Earlier this year locals in Orta Alican spotted a group of officials from Turkey’s highways directorate near the village. They turned out to be carrying out surveys for a project to widen the road leading up to the border. 
56  THE ACRONYM stuck for a decade, no matter how bitterly the countries it lumped together moaned about it. Being branded one of the PIGS—short for Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain—as the euro teetered was to be the perennial butt of bond-market bullying, Eurocrat nagging and German tabloid contempt. But look today and the bloc’s Mediterranean fringe is doing rather well. Those once stuck in the muck in the aftermath of the global financial crisis are now flying high. Southern Europeans are running their countries with the competence and reformist zeal all too often lacking in their northern neighbours. It may be a flash in the pan. But if it endures, it will come to change the nature of the EU.Listen to this story.The political stars in Europe these days are found down in what used to be termed “the periphery”. On January 30th António Costa led his Socialist party to an absolute majority in Portuguese parliamentary elections, obviating the need for ungainly coalitions of the sort now hobbling Germany. On the opposite side of both the continent and the political spectrum, Kyriakos Mitsotakis of Greece is the centre-right’s undisputed idol, recently hosting Valérie Pécresse of France as she sought to burnish her Macron-beating credentials. Between the two is Mario Draghi, who looks set for a longer stint as Italy’s prime minister after the prospect of his promotion to the presidency revealed a lack of any other politician who could hold his disparate coalition together. By bidding for the top job Mr Draghi miscalculated. But he was lucky: to be seen as the only calming force in Italy’s choppy political waters adds to the already considerable credibility he enjoys. And he may become president in a year or two.Better yet, the southerners are achieving the rare feat of combining political success with reforms to economies previously thought unreformable. Mr Costa has gained plaudits since 2015 as a lefty who also knows how to balance a budget. Italy’s technocrats are overhauling its creaking courts and overly generous pensions—necessary, urgent changes that governments of all stripes have for decades shirked. Spain, under somewhat more fractious political leadership, has made useful tweaks to its labour markets. Greece has worked on digitising a rickety bureaucracy, among many other things. All are growing faster than the EU as a whole.When Europe’s problems are pored over today, most fingers point north and east. Poland and Hungary are challenging European norms on the rule of law with as much abandon as Greece once ignored the bloc’s deficit rules. Germany is sending helmets to Ukraine when what is really needed are howitzers. Over 40% of French voters are expected to cast their ballot for extremist candidates in April, even though they have suffered none of the wrenching reforms of the sort undertaken by the dynamic southerners since the pandemic struck. The Netherlands, once an enthusiastic PIGS-baiter, only recently acquired a government following nine months of haggling. The previous one had collapsed after a benefits snafu plunged thousands into penury. Could nobody from Athens be dispatched to help them get a grip? Is it time for a visit from the troika?To austere types in Berlin or Helsinki who tormented southerners during the eurozone’s darkest hours a decade ago, the periphery’s success is evidence that tough love works. In their telling, it is the threats and badgering doled out at interminable EU summits that put southern Europe on the righteous path of tighter budgets. The beatings continued and morale improved. Reformed economies were in better shape to handle the pandemic.Tosh, say their opponents. The PIGS are airborne today because the austerity-led playbook of the 2010s has been binned in favour of solidarity. As covid-19 struck, rich countries agreed to an EU fund that will end up funnelling €750bn ($850bn) in loans and grants mainly to poor countries. It is this Next Generation (NGEU) money—Italy alone is entitled to €192bn—that is giving politicians there the space to adopt reforms they always would have supported if they could have afforded them. The Germanic cudgelling of yore merely boosted populists, which made enacting change all the harder. Now, sane politicians are back in charge.It’s a bird, it’s a plane...Convincing either side of the merits of the other is a lost cause. All agree any crowing over southern Europe’s current success is premature. Growth is high mainly because the porcine foursome slumped hardest during the pandemic. Unemployment remains high. Reforms still have a long way to go; opponents to change may simply be biding their time. Public debt levels—over 200% of GDP in Greece’s case—are worrying. PIGS are able to borrow at low rates only thanks to the ECB snapping up their bonds, a form of monetary-policy largesse that inflation may soon render untenable. Italy faces a fractious election by 2023 at the latest. A snowstorm that paralysed Athens two weeks ago acted as a reminder of the enduring limits of the state there. And what if the Mediterranean becomes, once again, the focus of a migration crisis?For now, though, the southern bloc is enjoying its time in the sun. Its reforms provide backing for its views on the future of the union’s economic governance. Arguing against the hasty return of strict deficit limits is easier if steady GDP growth makes debt seem manageable. (Not even Germany seems keen on a strict return to the old rules.) Pleading for more NGEU-type funding resonates more with Dutch voters if they feel their money has supported useful reforms in countries with which they share a currency.Convergence between north and south takes some venom out of what remain poisonous debates around who makes the EU’s rules and how they are enforced. Beyond being a good thing in itself, a fast-growing southern fringe lets both the austere and their opponents believe their pet economic policy is what created a richer Europe. While the argument drags on about why PIGS are flying, everyone can look up and enjoy the view.
