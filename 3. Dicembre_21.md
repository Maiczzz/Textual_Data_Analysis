26  The US and its allies are prepared to respond “decisively” should Russia invade Ukraine, President Joe Biden told his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Thursday amid mounting tensions at the border.The telephone call between the leaders, which was arranged at Moscow’s request, marked the latest in a string of diplomatic efforts to defuse what has been described as a “moment of crisis” as Russia amasses roughly 100,000 troops on Ukraine’s eastern frontier.It also preceded negotiations between Washington, Moscow and Nato member states planned for early January, when Russia intends to press for “security guarantees” to limit Nato’s expansion in Europe.Although Russia’s leader has previously denied any plan to invade Ukraine, Putin last week refused to rule out a military option and has previously warned that he has “all kinds” of options if his demands are not met.The US has said that several of Russia’s proposals were not up for negotiation, but it was open to discussing other Kremlin demands as it sought to deter Moscow from military action.According to a senior US administration official, the tone of the call, which lasted just under an hour, was “serious and substantive”, with both leaders acknowledging the possibility of “meaningful progress” in some areas but also others where “agreement may be impossible”.Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov said the Kremlin was “satisfied” with the conversation, calling it “frank, substantive [and] specific”, according to Interfax.Biden expressed his support for a diplomatic solution but warned of substantial costs and consequences should Russia proceed with its invasion of Ukraine.“He made clear that the United States and its allies and partners will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine,” Jen Psaki, White House press secretary, said in a statement after the call on Thursday. “President Biden reiterated that substantive progress in these dialogues can occur only in an environment of de-escalation rather than escalation.”Biden emphasised to reporters on Friday that the US would impose “severe sanctions” should Putin continue to escalate tensions at the border, stressing that he underscored Russia cannot invade Ukraine. He also warned the US would increase its presence in Europe.During the call on Thursday, Putin told Biden that sweeping sanctions would cause a “complete rupture” in relations between the two countries, Ushakov said, adding that it would be a “colossal mistake that could lead to the most serious consequences”.The telephone call also comes amid controversy around Russia’s role in Europe’s soaring gas prices. Some European officials have accused Russian gas giant Gazprom of withholding additional volumes as it aims to launch the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Europe, whose approval by German regulators is on hold.Gazprom insisted it was meeting all its contractual obligations to supply gas to Europe and said the record prices had killed demand for spot sales.Russia felt a call was needed to clarify both leaders’ positions since they last spoke on December 7, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told journalists earlier on Thursday.US and Russian officials are due to hold talks on January 10 followed by discussions between Russia and Nato on January 12 and a wider meeting between Moscow and representatives of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, expected on January 13.Biden is set to speak with Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday, according to a White House official, to discuss the ongoing situation at the border and “reaffirm” US support for the country’s “sovereignty and territorial integrity”.Ahead of the January meetings, Russia said it was aiming to secure “legally binding security guarantees” from the US, said Maria Zakharova, foreign ministry spokesperson, namely, “guarantees that Nato will not pursue eastward expansion”.Putin has described the threat of Nato’s expansion as an existential crisis for Russia and has made clear that he sees the situation in east Ukraine as unfinished business.The country witnessed a Russia-backed separatist uprising in 2014 after Moscow annexed Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula. The conflict has claimed at least 14,000 lives.Speaking ahead of the call on Thursday, Peskov said Russia was “set on dialogue” but added that the movement of its armed forces on its soil was the country’s prerogative.A senior US administration official said: “We’re going to continue to monitor very closely the movement and build-up of Russian forces on the Ukraine border and prepare ourselves for whatever decision ultimately is made by the Russian president.”
27  Olga Salo arrived for her first tactical military training exercise in a frosty pine forest outside Ukraine’s capital Kyiv wearing a pink ski jacket and dark blue jeans.On a frigid Saturday in December, when much of the world was celebrating Christmas, the 39-year-old museum guide lined up in troop formation alongside hundreds of other civilians who had volunteered to defend Ukraine’s home front in the event of a full-blown Russian invasion.Prospective and new recruits were issued with wooden replica weapons. More experienced recruits and reservists, many clad in camouflage gear, carried automatic rifles.“It’s necessary to be prepared and react properly to the worst-case scenario,” Salo said. “If we will be ready, maybe it won’t happen. I think the enemy will not attack if he knows that he will be resisted here not only by the regular army but by the population.”The rush of volunteers comes as tensions escalate amid reports that Russia has amassed 100,000 troops along its border with Ukraine, sparking fears that Moscow is preparing to invade. As part of intense diplomatic efforts to ease the crisis, US president Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin, his Russian counterpart, spoke by phone on Thursday, ahead of further negotiations in January between Washington, Moscow and Nato powers.Although Putin has previously denied any plan to invade, he said last week he was prepared to use “appropriate military-technical measures” and “react harshly to hostile steps” should Ukraine and its western backers ignore Moscow’s “red lines”. These include a freeze on further western military assistance to Ukraine, rejection of Kyiv’s bid to join Nato and a pullback of the military alliance’s forces from eastern Europe.Salo was attending one of the regular weekly exercises organised across the country by Ukraine’s Territorial Defense Forces, an offshoot of the country’s regular army set up some years ago to train hundreds of thousands of part-time reservists for a supportive role in the event of war.This year the drills were opened to new recruits, with an increasing number of ordinary citizens answering appeals on adverts across the country and social media for applicants to train and potentially join the TDF.A survey in December by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found that in the country of 44m, 58 per cent of men and almost 13 per cent of women were prepared to take up arms to defend the country against Russian troops. About 17 per cent of men and 25.5 per cent of women were prepared to fight back with other means, including protests and subversive activities.“Nobody will greet them here with flowers.They will be greeted by bullets,” Oleksiy Danilov, Ukraine’s national security chief, told the Financial Times. “There will be total resistance.”Ukraine’s regular forces are vastly outnumbered and outgunned by Russia’s 1m-strong army. The country has about 250,000 enlisted soldiers, many of whom are battling Russia-backed separatists in the far-eastern Donbas region. Poorly equipped and hesitant to shoot, Ukraine’s army was caught off-guard when the conflict broke out soon after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea.Thousands of rag-tag volunteer fighters — including scores of known football hooligans — played a critical role early in the war. Almost eight years on, Ukraine has regrouped militarily, modernising its army with precision weapons including Javelin anti-tank busters from the US and drones from Turkey. Hundreds of thousands of battle-hardened regular soldiers who have served in the conflict, which has claimed more than 14,000 lives, are well-prepared should they be called back into service.Danilov urged Ukraine’s western backers to swiftly provide the country’s regular army with more defensive weapons, including surface-to-air missiles, as a deterrent to an invasion.Russia would need to boost its potential invasion force to 500,000 to 600,000 troops to occupy about half of Ukraine, he said.On Thursday night, Biden told Putin that the US and its allies were prepared to respond “decisively” should Russia invade Ukraine.About 11,000 new TDF recruits are expected to join Ukraine’s army on a part-time basis in the new year. An undisclosed number have already signed contracts to form the core of an expanded force to protect critical infrastructure and factories, conduct special operations and operate as partisans in any fresh territory taken by Russia.Others, including Salo, are training in cities across Ukraine and could be added to a force Danilov said could total “tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands” and even “millions of people who will have the desire to defend our country”.In addition to the TDF, thousands of Ukrainians are training with dozens of non-government paramilitary formations. Some trace their roots to volunteer fighting battalions that first took up arms in 2014.Back in the pine forest outside Kyiv, recruits were drilled for hours by instructors teaching military basics, including how to use a tourniquet to stop bleeding and the importance of keeping a distance between troops while patrolling to minimise casualties if ambushed. A bang echoed in the distance, where more advanced squads practised throwing grenades.“I feel the threat,” said Vladislav, a 53-year-old auto mechanic who signed up a month earlier to refresh skills first learned while serving in the Soviet army. “If we have to retreat, we will do all possible to take the most lives of our enemies.”One of the instructors said new recruits could be ready to perform basic roles after a few weekend training sessions. He said plans included creating a territorial defence force of 5,000 in Kyiv alone.“They live here, train here, know the home environment and you don’t have to transport them to and from areas which they are less familiar with,” said Andriy, an IT industry employee and army reservist who spends his weekends training new recruits.After hours in freezing temperatures practising drills that included rolling in the snow and learning how to aim a rifle, Salo said: “It’s only cold if you stop moving.”She was ready to join the TDF forces while continuing her work as a guide at Kyiv’s museum honouring Ukraine’s 2014 revolution, which ousted pro-Russia president Viktor Yanukovich, and hoped to become an example for friends, she said.“The more that sign up,” she added, “the better defended we will be.”
28  Olaf Scholz used his first New Year’s address as chancellor to push an ambitious drive to deliver 30m doses of Covid-19 booster shots by the end of January, as Germany braced itself for an upsurge in cases of the highly infectious Omicron coronavirus variant.In his speech, which was released to media ahead of broadcast on Friday evening, Scholz urged Germans to get their booster shots “as soon as possible”.“Speed is what matters now,” he said. “We have to move faster than the virus.”He said Germany had already administered more than 30m jabs since mid-November, “probably more than in any other EU country” and would aim to deliver the same number again by the end of January.He also called on the millions of unvaccinated Germans to get the jab. Only 71 per cent of Germans are fully inoculated, a much lower proportion than in some other European countries such as Spain and Portugal, and authorities are struggling to convince a hard core of anti-vaccine holdouts.While acknowledging that some people were worried they could suffer “negative effects” from vaccination, Scholz stressed that almost 4bn people around the world had been inoculated — “without major side effects”. “And countless vaccinated people have become parents of healthy babies,” he added.Scholz’s speech marks a turning point for Germany. For the past 16 years, Germans have been addressed at New Year by Angela Merkel. But she retired after national elections in September, ushering in a new era in German politics.The election was narrowly won by Scholz’s Social Democrats, who formed an unprecedented three-way coalition with the Greens and liberals, consigning Merkel’s centre-right CDU/CSU to the opposition benches for only the third time in its history.Scholz made a reference to the change in his typically understated way. “Today we bid farewell to a year that has brought with it a host of changes,” he said. “One small change is that today I am the one speaking to you on New Year’s Eve as your Federal Chancellor.”Scholz came to power with a bold plan to green the German economy and improve social justice, but the pandemic has overshadowed his first few weeks in office. Meanwhile, often violent demonstrations by anti-vaxxers and opponents of the coronavirus restrictions continue to rock German cities.And though there has not been the same massive upsurge in Omicron infections seen in countries such as the UK and France, Germany’s numbers are ticking upwards. Official data showed there were 41,240 new coronavirus infections on Friday, compared with 35,431 a week ago.But experts say the sharp drop in testing over Christmas means the real numbers could be much worse.Germany has introduced tight new contact restrictions to combat the spread of Omicron, putting a limit on the number of people who can attend social gatherings. “Tonight we will once again have to do without big New Year’s Eve parties or grand fireworks,” Scholz said.He reiterated his plan for Germany to achieve climate-neutrality within 25 years, a goal that will involve “the greatest transformation our economy has seen in more than a century”.He said the country would become independent of coal, oil and gas and “generate at least twice as much electricity from wind, solar power and other renewable sources of energy as we do today”.Scholz also urged Germans to desist from big New Year’s Eve parties and their traditional firework displays in order to stem the spread of Covid.He said those who are still unvaccinated “are at particular risk of becoming infected and suffering from long and severe illness”.
29  On December 15, 1986, workers in the Russian provincial town Gorky (now Nizhny Novgorod) visited Andrei Sakharov’s dingy apartment to install a turquoise telephone. The physicist and peace activist had been exiled almost incommunicado at 214 Gagarin Avenue since 1980. A day later the phone rang. It was Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, ending Sakharov’s internal exile. “Thank you,” replied Sakharov, “but a few days ago, my friend Anatoly Marchenko died in Chistopol Prison. He was first on the list which I gave you. Many prisoners of conscience are in Soviet prisons, and they all must be released.”A week later, Sakharov and his wife Elena “Lusya” Bonner got off the train in Moscow. It was a historic moment: Sakharov embodied the freethinking crushed in the USSR. Would his return change the country? Swarmed by foreign correspondents, he name-checked many prisoners, but then had to run: it was Tuesday, the day his beloved physics institute FIAN held its weekly theoretical seminar.The USSR collapsed 30 years ago this week, but the spirit of Sakharov still hangs over us. The father of the Soviet thermonuclear bomb, who became the USSR’s leading dissident (he preferred “freethinker”), would have turned 100 this year. As Vladimir Putin’s army threatens Ukraine, Sakharov’s warning that a state that denies human rights to its own citizens will endanger its neighbours seems prescient. Meanwhile, this month, another Russian dissident deprived of freedom, Alexei Navalny, won the European Parliament’s Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. Only this week Russia’s Supreme Court ordered the closure of Memorial, the country’s most prominent human rights group which Sakharov helped to found.What would he make of today’s Russia (where about 60 streets and squares are named after him)? “I cannot imagine how disheartened he would have been,” says his stepdaughter Tatiana Yankelevich.Descended from a line of Orthodox priests, Sakharov grew up among the remnants of Moscow’s pre-revolutionary intelligentsia. His father Dmitri wrote popular physics books. Though the USSR was founded in 1922 when Sakharov was 19 months old, mentally he was raised almost outside it, homeschooled until age five, and again in fifth and sixth grade. Learning physics and maths from his father, Sakharov felt he “understood everything immediately”. One later colleague wrote that Sakharov “could mentally transform himself into [electrons or neutrons], as if his very skin could feel what it was to be them.” Sakharov said youthful isolation left him with “a deep dislike of socialising, which caused me to suffer”. But almost uniquely among Soviet citizens, he was taught free thinking.Relatives “disappeared” in the Great Terror of 1937, but his parents shielded him from politics, and the teenager wasn’t yet interested. In the second world war, he turned his gifts to patriotic use, inventing a new way to test bullet cores used in anti-tank guns. In 1945 he read about the American atomic bombs open-mouthed.Stalin’s secret police chief Lavrentiy Beria insisted he join the USSR’s bomb programme. That tore Sakharov away from theoretical physics. Recalling his research of summer 1947, he regretted: “Never before or since have I been so close to the highest level of science.” (This and other quotes in this article come from the centenary album Andrei Dmitrievich Sakharov, published in English next year.)He and his young family were dropped in a research centre known only as “The Installation”, in a town called Sarov that had been removed from maps, where inmates of local penal camps did the menial work.Yet bombmaking suited him, because he was a rare combination of theoretician and practical inventor, explains his biographer Gennady Gorelik. Before turning 30, Sakharov devised the “layer cake” structure of the Soviet “hydrogen bomb”, tested successfully in August 1953. Arguably this device wasn’t really an H-bomb, since most of the energy came from nuclear fission, not fusion. Either way, it was the world’s deadliest weapon, as destructive as 25 Hiroshima A-bombs. In 1955 the USSR tested a thermonuclear bomb, co-designed by Sakharov, that was four times stronger still.With so many Jewish physicists, Soviet leaders were delighted to celebrate an ethnic Russian hero. Sakharov was kissed by Brezhnev and Khrushchev, earned fortunes, and could get any leader on the phone. He was named Hero of Socialist Labour three times. Whenever he got confused at a railway ticket-office window, waving his Hero booklet (which for security reasons carried no photograph) resolved any problem.Sakharov never repented for his bombmaking. He felt he was protecting the fatherland, and by achieving nuclear parity with the US, the world, too. But he was also driven by intellectual fascination. The Installation, where he spent 18 years, was a relative oasis of free thinking, even though it was closed to outsiders. The Party accepted that physicists needed intellectual freedom to develop weapons. And so, in their equivalent of the American “atomic city” Los Alamos, scientists could chat in comfort even about news items from BBC radio, recounts Gorelik. Their library received the American Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. The work was “paradise for a physicist,” recalled Sakharov. He then still mostly believed in the Soviet system.Yet he was growing uneasy. He saw that nuclear contamination would kill untold thousands. Though the victims were anonymous individuals, many yet unborn, his ability to combine abstract with concrete thought helped him imagine them. For years Sakharov lobbied Khrushchev to end nuclear testing. The 1963 Moscow Treaty, in which the US, USSR and UK renounced above-ground tests, is partly his achievement.But once his mind strayed beyond bombmaking, it couldn’t stop. From 1966 to 1968, in what Gorelik calls a “creative surge”, he rethought his personal politics while also producing a rush of original research rare for a forty-something physicist. British physicist Norman Dombey says, “In pure physics, his major achievement was to solve the problem of how the observable universe was made out of particles rather than antiparticles, even though the laws of physics were symmetrical between particles and antiparticles.”On Constitution Day 1966, he attended his first demonstration: a few dozen dissidents met at Moscow’s Pushkin Monument, removed their hats and stood in silence to show respect for the constitution. (Half the attendees kept their hats on; they were KGB agents.) Then Sakharov, a Pushkin obsessive, read out an inscription on the Monument:Long will I be by my people beloved For awakening kind feelings with my lyre, For celebrating freedom in this cruel age And calling for mercy for those who have fallen.He had crossed over to the other side. In a 1968 essay, sensationally published in the New York Times, he warned about nuclear extermination, and called for intellectual freedom and convergence of the communist and capitalist systems. He also warned that “carbon dioxide from the burning of coal is altering the heat-reflecting qualities of the atmosphere”. Banned from military research after publication, he battled on, despite expecting failure. “If you want to be a free person, you don’t stand up for human rights because it will work, but because it is right”. His first wife Klavdia died in 1969. In the dissident movement he met Bonner, who educated him about life beyond his old bomb-making Installation. Outside a trial in Moscow in 1978, he and she each hit KGB agents. At the hearing, Bonner said she didn’t regret it, but apologised to a police chief whom she had punched accidentally. Still protected by Sakharov’s Hero status, the couple were merely fined.In 1974 Sakharov predicted a computerised “universal information system” — the internet. In 1975 Bonner collected his Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, and read out his speech that explained why peace couldn’t exist without progress and human rights. In 1980 he was stripped of his Soviet honours and exiled for protesting against the invasion of Afghanistan.His granddaughter Marina Sakharov-Liberman, who now lives in London, recalls visits to Gorky with long conversations in the woods (his apartment was bugged), and drawing ambidextrously with him (a family tradition). He once telegrammed her that her moss was blossoming. “I didn’t receive the telegram for three weeks,” she laughs. “I think the KGB was puzzling over what the cipher might mean.” Most of his physicist friends stayed loyal to him. The Nobel laureate Vitaly Ginzburg even checked on Marina’s progress in her physics studies, taking on Sakharov’s grandfatherly duties.In Gorky Sakharov staged five hunger strikes, mostly to get permission for Bonner to travel abroad for medical treatment.Freed from Gorky, he became a democratic activist. In 1988 he co-founded the Memorial Society to remember victims of Soviet repression. That year he made his first ever foreign trip, landing in the US just before the presidential election. Staying with his refugee stepdaughter Tatiana Yankelevich in Newton, Massachusetts, he watched voting at the local elementary school enthralled. But when Newton’s mayor suggested he accompany Yankelevich into the voting booth, Sakharov refused: the ballot was secret, he insisted.Soviet citizens saw in him a hitherto unknown moral purity. Elected to parliament in 1989, he said, “The people — deceived so often by hypocrisy, corruption, crime, influence-peddling, and inertia — turned out to be alive and well. God help us if their expectations are frustrated. Historically, there is never a last chance, but psychologically, for our generation, the disappointment might prove irreparable.” On December 14, 1989 he called for scrapping the constitutional article that guaranteed the Party’s “leading role”. That night Bonner found him on the floor of his apartment, dead of acute heart failure. An estimated 100,000 attended his funeral.Three decades later, the Memorial Society estimates that the number of political prisoners in Russia — some 450 — is comparable to the levels in the USSR in the late 1980s. Among the hundreds of jailed dissidents in Belarus are laureates of last year’s Sakharov’s prize. Yankelevich notes that some prison sentences for protesters are now harsher and more arbitrary than in Soviet times, perhaps because Putin cares less about western approval than Soviet leaders did.Navalny flew back to Russia in January knowing he would be jailed. He may look like a digital-savvy, catwalk-ready update of Sakharov, and he too defied the almighty state, but Sakharov’s stepdaughter and granddaughter resist comparisons. “Both are very brave but it’s like comparing vegetables and fruit,” says Yankelevich. “Navalny has evolved but that doesn’t make him a great thinker. Sakharov was a great thinker.”When Navalny’s daughter Daria accepted his Sakharov Prize in Strasbourg this month, like Bonner receiving Sakharov’s Nobel, she attacked western politicians who won’t confront Putin for “pragmatic” reasons. “Andrei Sakharov,” she remarked, “was probably one of the most non-pragmatic people on the planet.” She finished by quoting him: “My destiny has turned out to be larger than my personality. I simply tried to live up to my destiny.”Afghanistan in 1980 could become Ukraine in 2022. But Navalny surely remembers Sakharov’s return from Gagarin Avenue. “Perhaps one day,” says Sakharov-Liberman, “Russia can be the Russia of Sakharov.” 
30  French authorities have told border police to allow Britons to drive via France as they return to their homes in other EU countries after the Christmas holiday, following travel disruption caused by the sudden implementation of new Covid measures.The U-turn came two days after the French government tightened enforcement of travel restrictions that barred British people from transiting through France by car if they had no French residency papers.The measures were brought in before Christmas in response to rising coronavirus cases in the UK. French border police were on Tuesday instructed to apply them to Britons trying to drive through France to reach other EU countries.The French interior ministry said on Thursday that large numbers of British nationals who live in the EU had gone back to the UK “in good faith” and acknowledged their “trouble” in returning to the bloc in recent days.“Given the situation, police at the border with the UK have been told to exercise tolerance towards [these British nationals] to allow them to transit via France to return to their home in an EU country after the Christmas and year end holidays,” the ministry said.The guidance comes as France tries to ease border chaos after new restrictions threatened to leave a rising number of British travellers stranded.Eurotunnel, which operates the shuttle service that allows people to take their cars between Folkestone and Calais, confirmed the decision. However, it said [it] was “subject to their journey to [the] UK being completed before” December 28.The new guidance, which allows passengers travelling from the UK to return to their homes in the EU via France, takes effect immediately, the operator said.The UK government said: “The French authorities have confirmed that British nationals will face no additional restrictions while travelling through the holiday period. British nationals who are currently in the UK, but resident in the EU, will be able to return to their home through France over the New Year period without disruption. We remain in close contact with the French authorities, and will update our own travel advice with the latest information”.Under measures designed to slow the spread of Omicron, France barred British tourists from entering the country in mid-December, sparking a wave of ski holiday cancellations and causing travel disruption for anyone without French citizenship or residency papers.But Britons trying to reach other parts of the EU — including workers and residents in countries such as Belgium who had hoped to drive back through France via the Eurotunnel — were also falling foul of the rules, after fresh instructions were delivered to French border police clarifying that the measures applied to people in transit.Infections in France have recently surged to record highs driven partly by the more transmissible Omicron variant, described by ministers as sparking a “tidal wave” of cases.Daily cases in France reached more than 208,000 on Wednesday, their highest level since the start of the pandemic, marking a European record.France’s interior ministry declined to comment on the broader travel restrictions for British tourists who are still not able to visit France, or when these might end, however.Roland Moore, a public relations director and Belgian resident who was this week turned back as he tried to take his car on to the shuttle service from the UK to France, said the sudden shift in interpretations and lack of warning had been confusing after he had managed the journey in reverse earlier in December.“Seven days ago it was fine but a week later with no notice it wasn’t fine,” Moore said, adding that he understood, however, that the French had taken measures to try and tackle rising Covid cases.Moore managed to reach Belgium via the Eurostar train that also passes through France, and left his car with family in the UK.
31  In a victory for Italy’s national unity government led by prime minister Mario Draghi, the country’s parliament has formally approved a €32bn budget aimed at boosting growth.Thursday’s vote comes as the country faces a series of headwinds, including a soaring Covid-19 rate and an unsettled political landscape, with Draghi in contention to replace Sergio Mattarella as president next month, a move that could trigger elections that few lawmakers want.The budget focuses on tax cuts for companies and individuals and confirms tax credits and subsidies aimed at supporting families and businesses that were introduced by the previous government. It also allocates more than €3.5bn to mitigate the impact of rising energy prices, and several billion in tax discounts for companies that hire young people and new mothers as well as subsidised mortgages for couples buying their first home.According to the budget’s projections, Italy’s public debt, the eurozone’s second-highest after Greece, will drop to 149.4 per cent of gross domestic product, from more than 153 per cent this year, and the deficit will fall to 5.6 per cent from this year’s 9.4 per cent, amid strong economic growth and the ending of pandemic-related support for businesses and households.The tax cuts, and planned pension reforms, were criticised by trade unions and prompted a general strike this month, while the budget sparked a heated political debate as several lawmakers complained that the government had barred them from debating it or passing amendments.Members of the far-right Brothers of Italy, the largest opposition party, said on Thursday they would write to Mattarella to “denounce the fact that lawmakers were barred from discussing the budget in parliament”. The government had sought to minimise discussions and political infighting to avoid delays.The budget tensions provide a foretaste of potential political conflict over the choice of presidential nominee. The parties in parliament must nominate a replacement for Mattarella, whose term ends in February, in the coming weeks.Draghi unsettled lawmakers before Christmas when he signalled he was willing to be nominated as president. His potential resignation as prime minister could trigger elections, which would risk delaying structural reforms and investments linked to the EU’s pandemic recovery fund. Many lawmakers will also lose their jobs in the next elections after Italians voted in a 2019 referendum to cut the number of parliamentary seats by more than a third.Enrico Letta, leader of the centre-left Democratic party, warned on Thursday that if members of the governing coalition, which includes the far-right League, populist Five Star and liberal Forza Italia as well as small leftwing and centrist parties, could not agree on a cross-party presidential candidate, a government crisis would follow as the notion of a national unity administration evaporated.“The government is backed by 90 per cent of the [members of parliament]. It would be completely contradictory to narrow the camp [for the presidential election],” Letta told La Stampa, the daily newspaper.The centre-right coalition parties and the Brothers of Italy are discussing whether to back Draghi or former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who has made clear he is willing to take on the presidency but who would not receive the support from Five Star or the PD. Five Star has said it would consider a female candidate such as Senate speaker Maria Elisabetta Alberti Casellati or justice minister Marta Cartabia. Former prime minister Giuliano Amato has also been suggested as a candidate.Meanwhile, many lawmakers would prefer Draghi to stay on as prime minister until elections due in 2023, to complete structural reforms and given the uncertainty Italy is facing as the Omicron variant sparks a surge in Covid-19.Lawmakers and ministers will be watching Mattarella’s end of year address on Friday night for signs that he may reconsider his decision not to serve another term, allowing Draghi to remain in post.The government has indicated it does not expect the new wave of coronavirus infections to lead to widespread lockdowns or additional economic stimulus.But on Wednesday night it passed an emergency decree that implements a de facto lockdown for the unvaccinated. Italy recorded almost 100,000 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday and 48 deaths.
32  Gridlocked negotiations between Britain and Brussels over post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland should not drag on past February and it is time for the UK to make concessions, Ireland’s foreign minister has said.“We all know that we need to bring this discussion and negotiation to an end,” Simon Coveney told the Financial Times in an interview, highlighting the record of the UK’s new chief Brexit negotiator, foreign secretary Liz Truss, in concluding trade deals.“We have elections in Northern Ireland in May. Those elections will begin in earnest really from the end of February. So this can’t drift on for months,” he said.Truss, who took over the Brexit portfolio this month after the surprise resignation of Lord David Frost, is expected to visit Northern Ireland early next month but has signalled no change in the UK’s stance yet.Since Brexit, Northern Ireland has remained within the EU’s single market for goods because the alternative — a hard customs border on the island — was ruled out as a threat to the 1998 peace deal that ended three decades of sectarian conflict known as the Troubles.However, that meant implementing customs checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland instead. These were set out in the part of the Brexit agreement known as the Northern Ireland protocol, which is being renegotiated.The UK had made “no concessions all year; the EU has made multiple concessions and continues to do so”, Coveney said. “Let’s not pretend that both sides have compromised here. Now both sides need to compromise a little bit more.”The concessions London has extracted from Brussels would halve customs checks and slash health checks on British products destined for Northern Ireland by 80 per cent, according to Maros Sefcovic, the EU’s Brexit negotiator. The EU has also changed its law to ensure that the UK region can still continue to receive medicines from Britain. But London wants more.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has threatened to pull his Democratic Unionist party out of Northern Ireland’s power-sharing executive in January unless the Irish Sea customs border is scrapped. He argues that the protocol is undermining Northern Ireland’s status as part of the UK.The Brexit talks have shuttled between London and Brussels for weeks without progress, before being put on hold over Christmas. If they do not conclude by February, “the election in Northern Ireland will become a referendum on the protocol”, Coveney said.“I think the month of January and February really is the timeline that we’re working in, to try to bring these discussions to a close. And there’s no reason why that shouldn’t happen. Because there’s nothing new on the table here.”Truss has repeated Britain’s readiness to suspend parts of the protocol under Article 16 — a move that Coveney says would “backfire” and call into question the UK’s entire post-Brexit trade deal with the EU.On one sticking point, Truss has already repeated the latest UK position that it does not want the European Court of Justice to be the “final arbiter of disputes”. That form of words would keep it at arm’s length from the protocol while still allowing it to adjudicate on issues of EU law.The EU insists that because Northern Ireland is in the single market for goods the UK must accept ultimate oversight by the ECJ.“I don’t see how the EU can agree to removing a role for the ECJ in interpreting EU rules and regulations,” Coveney said.Ireland is not involved directly in negotiations between the EU and UK, but geographical, historical and trade ties put it in the Brexit front line. Both countries are also close allies of the US and Coveney said he hoped President Joe Biden would visit Ireland in 2022.Regarding links with London, he said: “I see my role as a candid friend. I’m not going to tell the British government what they want to hear,” he said. “I think my role has got to be to explore realistic potential solutions.”One such non-Brexit issue is the UK’s controversial plan to extend an amnesty for violent Troubles-era crimes, with legislation expected to be brought in in early January.Coveney said such a move would represent the first time since the Good Friday Agreement that one side had made a unilateral move on “something as important as legacy”.As with the protocol, Ireland was “trying to get back to a partnership approach”, he added.“For the British government to decide to move ahead on the basis of a policy that nobody supports in Northern Ireland.and that the Irish government has been very clear, both privately and publicly, that we cannot support, would be a big mistake,” Coveney said.Letter in response to this article:Find a better term for the Northern Irish Troubles / From Tomas Mac Sheoin, Ballinamore, County Leitrim, Ireland
33  Regional opinion polls show 70 per cent of parents in Denmark and Spain plan to vaccinate their younger children, but only 40 per cent in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Fewer than a third of French parents say they are willing to do so.So far, vaccination is not mandatory for children and no country has demanded five- to 11-year-olds be jabbed before taking part in any activity. But governments have taken a markedly different approach to vaccinating the young. Some, including Denmark, France, Spain, and Italy recommend all children get the jab, while the UK opts to immunise only vulnerable children. The lack of a common message means Europe may struggle to convince parents to vaccinate their children, depriving the region of a tool to fight the latest Covid surge.But differing national policies reflect the fast-evolving debate among scientists over whether children derive enough individual health benefits from the vaccine to outweigh the risk of very rare side effects. Some experts, especially in the UK, have been reluctant to push for vaccination of the young because children suffer milder Covid symptoms and are far less likely to be hospitalised. Others argue that they still need protection, especially when the spread of the virus is as high as it is now. You are seeing a snapshot of an interactive graphic. This is most likely due to being offline or JavaScript being disabled in your browser. The risk-benefit equation also depends on whether policymakers take into account the gains for society of lower transmission, such as keeping schools open and protecting older and vulnerable people.Andrew Pollard, a paediatrician and director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said the decision on whether to vaccinate five- to 11-year-olds was “finely balanced”, because very few suffered severe illness. “If you are talking about a 70-year-old, it is absolutely clear that every country believes we should be vaccinating older — and now almost all adults — because of their increased risk. But for young children, more are on the fence about whether to vaccinate or not,” he said.The EU’s medicines agency approved the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine for five- to 11-year-olds in November, following approval for older children in May. Deliveries of the lower-dose vials began to arrive this month.In the US, one of the first countries to inoculate younger children, uptake has been sluggish and varies widely from state to state. About 6m, or 22 per cent, of five- to 11-year-olds have received at least one dose since early November. Denmark, which began inoculating around the same time, has given at least one dose to 40.4 per cent of that age group.Some public health officials have urged parents to act because some children do develop serious cases of Covid and the rapidly spreading Omicron coronavirus variant could sicken more of them. On December 24, New York state said paediatric hospitalisations had risen from 22 to 109 in a two-week period in New York City, where Omicron is rife, and called on parents to “take urgent action” to vaccinate their children. Last month, Anthony Fauci, US chief medical adviser, said he had hoped parents would move faster. “What are they waiting for? The infection is here now — protect your children,” he said.In France, which started to vaccinate five- to 11-year-olds on December 22, health minister Olivier Véran argued that children would benefit on an individual basis from the jab especially as the country was experiencing an unprecedented rise in infections. When asked if he would give it to his own children, he responded: “Yes, without hesitation and as quickly as possible.”“There were 145 children in hospital last night for Covid-19 and 27 in intensive care,” Veran said. “It is true that such serious cases are very, very rare, but when it happens to your kid, the statistics do not matter.”The Haute Autorité de Santé, a panel of independent scientists which advises the French government, this month reported that 1,399 children had been hospitalised — out of 5.8m French children aged five to 11 — between March 2020 and mid-December this year. There were 238 cases needing intensive care, three deaths and 350 cases of multi-system inflammatory syndrome, a rare but dangerous complication that affects some children who get Covid. The HAS also said it had reviewed reports of side effects from the roughly 10m children up to age 14 who had so far been vaccinated globally, and found the data “still limited but reassuring in the short term”.From a European database, it identified about 30 serious adverse effect reports in children, including 12 cases of myocarditis, a rare cardiac side effect to the messenger RNA jabs that tends to affect young boys more than girls. In the US where 7m doses have been given to children, 14 cases of myocarditis were reported through December 10, and most were treated and resolved, it said.But the risk of myocarditis was higher if a child develops Covid, according to the HAS analysis, so the overall balance of risk and benefit of vaccinating children was favourable when the infection incidence rate in the community was moderate to high. When it was low, the side effect risk outweighed the benefits, especially for young boys.Even if only half of eligible children were vaccinated, the HAS estimated it would reduce infections in that age group in France by 75 per cent over three months, which would help schools stay open. Having read the HAS report, Olivier Chappe, an engineer who lives near Lyon, said he was leaning towards having his eight-year-old son vaccinated, having already let his 12-year-old daughter be jabbed. “The risk of my kids getting very sick or dying from Covid-19 is very low, but we don’t know the risks of long Covid for them,” he said. “Children will keep being infected if they’re the only ones in society not vaccinated, and who knows if the next variant will be scarier.”In Dublin, Ben Lyons, a father of two, has decided against immunising his five- and eight-year-old children.“My answer is a very vehement no,” he said. “We’re not buying into the conspiracy theories but most kids aren’t affected by Covid anyway.” Lyons, who works in a pet shop, said he was also put off because his daughter had a severe reaction to a vaccination when she was a toddler. Despite other European countries moving ahead with children’s vaccination, the UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has decided only the most clinically vulnerable should be jabbed. It only signed off on second doses for 12- to 15-year-olds in late November after anxiety began to mount over Omicron. In contrast, France started vaccinating that age group in June and Germany in August.Adam Finn, a professor of paediatrics at Bristol university who sits on the JCVI, said it was “50:50” whether the committee would give the green light to vaccination for all children in the coming months. “If we do go on immunising all children aged five to 11, we do need to be convinced that we are doing good to somebody by doing that,” he said. “And not just doing it because it’s something we can do and we’re so desperate to do something.”Additional reporting by Richard Milne in Oslo, Kiran Stacey in Washington and Joe Miller in Frankfurt
34  As Vladimir Putin threatens possible military action on Ukraine, western military analysts say Russia’s president could contemplate a wide range of scenarios — from targeted missile strikes to a limited incursion from the east or south of the country, and even a full-scale invasion backed by cyber warfare.After deploying about 100,000 Russian soldiers close to Ukraine’s northern, eastern and southern borders, Putin has warned he has “all kinds” of options if his demands over Ukraine and Nato’s activities in the former Soviet bloc are unmet.US intelligence information shared with European allies suggests Russia is preparing a possible invasion, according to US and EU officials, who gave the caveat that Putin had not yet made a final decision. The troop build-up could be aimed at securing diplomatic concessions from US president Joe Biden, they noted. The US and Russian leaders are due to speak on the phone on Thursday ahead of negotiations between Russia, the US and Nato member states in January.However, the deployment of major units and sophisticated weaponry, coupled with strident rhetoric, has raised the prospect of turning the slow-burning proxy war in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region into a full-blown conflict. More than 14,000 people have been killed since the fighting began shortly after Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula in 2014.“Putin has the best track record of using force to achieve political ends of any leader by far,” said Michael Kofman, a senior research scientist at CNA, a US policy studies non-profit organisation. “How many offensives does he have to conduct in Ukraine for people to think he’s not bluffing?”Putin has denied making plans for an invasion but has made it clear that Russia is prepared to use “appropriate military-technical measures” to “react harshly to hostile steps”.Two longtime confidants of Putin said the most likely casus belli would resemble the one that triggered the four-day war with Georgia in 2008. Russia at that time responded to Tbilisi’s attempts to secure territory held by Moscow-backed rebels with a land invasion supported by air and artillery strikes, a naval blockade and cyber attacks.Russia would frame the conflict with Ukraine as a move to protect the Russian-speaking Donbas from what it would describe as Ukrainian aggression, they said.Donbas is home to two self-proclaimed separatist statelets where Moscow has given many residents Russian citizenship in recent years. Russia has led the separatist forces throughout the conflict and used its army to overwhelm Ukraine’s forces in 2014 and 2015, prompting Kyiv to make concessions at peace talks.The scale and duration of any escalation would then depend on how quickly Ukraine capitulated to Russia’s demands, security experts say.Western intelligence officials said that by mid-December, Russia had assembled about 100,000 troops in the vicinity of the Ukrainian border, including roughly 50 highly mobile and flexible Battalion Tactical Groups. They forecast about 175,000 troops would be deployed by the end of January, when the terrain would be frozen and therefore more suitable for tanks in case of a land invasion.The current deployments lacked the full scope of logistical support necessary for a sustained operation — such as ammunition stocks, field hospitals and blood banks — but there was evidence Moscow was in the process of moving these towards the border, the western officials said.“If they want to quickly plus this up for an invasion, they can do that on short notice with relatively little warning,” said Rob Lee, a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute who researches Russia’s military. “Much of the personnel is likely still back in Siberia, but if they want to quickly get it moving, it’s much faster to fly out those guys instead of moving the equipment itself.”Russia could inflict significant damage on Ukraine’s military through aerial assaults on the front lines, military facilities and critical infrastructure, according to Dara Massicot, a senior policy researcher at the Rand Corporation.Though Russia’s air force has not flown against a hostile air defence since the Georgian war, “there’s plenty of cruise and ballistic missiles that can come into play here from either the Black Sea or from the Russian homeland, and the Ukrainian air defence system will struggle to cope”, Massicot said.A potential strike could use airborne missiles as well as heavy artillery and long-range flamethrowers, she added. “That would be incredibly devastating on Ukrainian land power,” she said.Ukraine, a country of about 41m people, has vowed to resist any Russian invasion. A poll this month by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology suggests that 58 per cent of all men are ready to take up arms against Russia in case of a deeper invasion. Some have joined makeshift civilian defence forces.But Russia’s military superiority would enable it to overrun Ukraine’s army in weeks by launching assaults on multiple fronts — including from Belarus and the Black Sea, according to CNA’s Kofman.“They’re defending the eastern flank of the largest country in Europe, and what do they have? They could very easily be cut off and isolated in the eastern part of Ukraine, which is why they may well find themselves fighting an organised retreat if faced with a multipronged attack,” Kofman said.A full-blown invasion would allow Russia to take over swaths of territory that could be used for a counter-offensive in the Donbas. It would also play to Putin’s notion that Ukraine’s Russian-speaking areas east of the Dnipro river are Moscow’s “historical territories”.Analysts consider that scenario less likely because of the enormous manpower it would require and likely significant casualties for Russian forces.But the extent of the assault would ultimately depend on how much damage Moscow had to inflict to force Ukraine to admit defeat, according to FPRI’s Lee.“They could inflict tens of thousands of casualties after a couple of days. They could significantly degrade Ukraine’s military capability in the east. But would that be enough to force Ukraine to concede? That comes down to their cost-benefit analysis,” Lee said.Additional reporting by Henry Foy in Brussels and Roman Olearchyk in Kyiv
35  The European Central Bank aims to complete a detailed assessment of how international banks manage their EU business by early next year, in a move that risks triggering a stand-off with UK regulators over the location of senior staff and capital.International banks are concerned they could face competing demands from eurozone and UK regulators over how they structure their European operations once the ECB completes its so-called desk-mapping exercise — a detailed review of how banks have set up their EU operations, including where they locate staff and capital.The assessment is designed to establish how widely banks use various techniques to transfer the risk of EU operations outside the bloc, in particular to the UK, where many had based their European operations before Brexit.One of these techniques involves using back-to-back models, which allow banks to offset EU trades with their London entities and effectively manage the risk from the UK. Another is desk-splitting, in which banks handle EU clients or assets jointly from desks both on the continent and in the UK.The assessment has already prompted high-level talks between eurozone and UK supervisors after the Bank of England expressed concern that the ECB appeared to be attempting a “hollowing out” of some big international banks’ UK-based operations, according to a person briefed on the matter.The ECB has reassured the BoE that the review is no different to similar assessments carried out by other major central banks, and it is not asking banks to move more staff or capital out of the UK than they have already agreed to, the person said.A second person familiar with the conversations said the UK regulator did not expect to be “blindsided” by fresh demands to move people and capital out of London.The subject has been a thorny issue since the UK left the EU without a trade agreement for the financial services sector in January 2020. Most international banks favour keeping as much of their investment banking and capital markets operations as they can in London to maximise efficiency.By March 2020, the ECB said banks had agreed to move more than €1.2tn of assets from the UK to their eurozone offshoots, quadrupling their size as measured by assets compared with the end of 2017.Despite this, the ECB has since stepped up its calls for banks to add hundreds of extra staff and billions of extra capital to their post-Brexit operations in continental Europe.This has led to tensions with the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority. One UK regulator told the Financial Times that while there was “really strong technical co-operation” with counterparts in Frankfurt “the politics is difficult”.“Where we have to be vigilant is to ensure requirements to move activities or resources which are [presented as] motivated by regulatory purposes aren’t cover for things that are motivated by industrial purposes,” the person said.If that occurs, UK regulators will “have a conversation with the firm and say ‘no, we don’t see that as justified’”, the person added. “We have had to do that already.we have to be pretty careful they’re not doing things that are harmful for market integrity from our point of view.”Speaking at a recent event, PRA head Sam Woods said he was “relatively sanguine” about the level of movement so far, but it would be “unacceptable” if it escalated to a point where London risked being hollowed out.The ECB has spent several months reviewing how banks with sizeable operations in the EU handle clients and assets based in the bloc. It expects to share the findings of its exercise with banks and supervisors including the BoE in the next three months. It has not decided whether any findings will be made public.Some banks expect the exercise to result in having to materially increase their presence in the EU.The Frankfurt-based institution’s position was underlined by Edouard Fernandez-Bollo, an ECB supervisory board member, last month when he said that “empty shell institutions are not acceptable in the euro area”. He added: “Activities and services involving EU clients should be carried out predominantly within the EU.”The ECB declined to comment on tensions around the exercise, as did the PRA.
36  In the Rockies west of Denver, the C Lazy U ranch has been welcoming visitors for a taste of cowboy life since the 1920s. The accommodation might have grown more luxurious (there are now 38 guest cabins as well as a spa) but the appeal remains much the same as ever: the chance to ride, hike, snowshoe or fly-fish amid wide open spaces. Yet since the pandemic hit, there has been a surge in demand. Bookings have doubled year on year. “We have way more inquiries than we can actually accommodate so our wait-list for next summer is more than 400 families long,” says Brady Johnson, the director of sales and marketing.It’s a trend being seen at ranches across the West. “The pandemic has spurred a fresh wave of excitement for this uniquely American travel experience,” says Jennifer O’Donohue, brand director at Triple Creek Ranch, a Relais & Chateaux-affiliated ranch in Montana’s Bitterroot Mountains. It started 2020 with 43 per cent of all its May to October capacity reserved; it is beginning 2022 with 76 per cent of the same period booked.Johnson puts it down to dude ranches finding themselves in “a sweet spot” for Covid-era vacations, thanks to their offer of abundant space, private cabins, low overall guest numbers, and a wider boom in interest in outdoor activities. Border closures have helped boost domestic US travel but dude ranches are now also attracting international clients — George Morgan-Grenville of the UK-based operator Red Savannah reports “buoyant demand”.Meanwhile the success of the Paramount TV series Yellowstone, starring Kevin Costner as a Montana ranch owner, has also revived many western fantasies. And those not content with holidaying on a ranch are seeking to buy their own: brokerage Hall and Hall says 2021 was their best year in the 75-year company history “by far” — culminating in the purchase, earlier this month, of the 340,000-acre Beaverhead Ranch by Rupert Murdoch.A growing environmental awareness — and a rising dislike of airports — is prompting a return to long-distance international overnight trains. Earlier this month, a new Nightjet sleeper train pulled out of Vienna Hauptbahnhof bound for Paris Gare de l’Est, the first direct rail link between the two cities since the Orient Express retired from the route in 2007. After 14 hours and traversing three countries, it arrived bang on schedule at 9.42am (although the wider timing was less good: due to Omicron-related travel restrictions, there were officials and media but no paying passengers on board). The new service is aimed at both business travellers and tourists: deluxe cabins come with en-suite showers; breakfast and a glass of sparkling wine are included in all classes.The new Vienna-Paris link is far from alone: a few days earlier another Nightjet set off on its maiden journey, from Zurich to Amsterdam, while a Zurich to Rome Nightjet is due to launch in 2022. In fact, since launching the Nightjet brand in 2016, Austrian Railways has expanded it to 20 routes linking eight countries. A fleet of new upgraded carriages is due to be introduced in 2023. Other operators are expanding sleeper services too; December also saw the launch of services from Paris to Lourdes and from Vienna to Cluj in Romania.The original Orient Express finally hit the buffers in 2009 but the name itself is making a comeback. Since 1982, the Venice-Simplon Orient Express, a private London-Venice train that’s now part of the Belmond group, has used the name under licence from French rail operator SNCF. In 2017, the hotel group Accor formed a partnership with SNCF to develop the Orient Express brand and, earlier this month, it unveiled plans for “Orient Express La Dolce Vita”. Starting in 2023, six trains will run from Rome to Paris, Istanbul and Split, each with 30 suites and cabins, one “Honour Suite” and a restaurant. Rather than recreating the Edwardian look beloved of many heritage trains, the interiors will be inspired by the 1960s and 70s, and designed by Milan-based Dimorestudio.Not to be outdone, Belmond says it will launch further French and Italian routes for its Orient Express in 2022, while it recently debuted a new carriage on another of its trains, the British Pullman. Rather than ape the Wes Anderson aesthetic, as so many luxury travel companies have done, it hired the director himself to design the carriage, an immaculate art nouveau style dining car.Private villas within the grounds of luxury hotels are enjoying a Covid-linked surge in demand, according to Jules Maury, head of Scott Dunn Private. “They offer the best of both worlds — all the services of a hotel, and a buzzy restaurant and bar you can visit if you want to, but also your own private space,” she says. “So if you do need to isolate there because new rules have been brought in, or someone tests positive, you can do so in comfort, with plenty of room, your own pool and so on. It provides a sort of insurance.” She recommends the eight “beautiful” standalone villas at Castello di Reschio in Umbria (from €16,000 per week for six people), the residences and villas at Jumby Bay in Antigua (“a firm favourite over the last year, and continuing into next”), Finca Cortesin in Andalucía and Amanzoe in the Peloponnese.Border closures meant that last year no cruise ships made it down to Antarctica during the austral summer. The resulting pent-up demand, as well as an increasing public fascination with the fragile polar environment, seems to have supercharged an existing pre-pandemic trend. (According to the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators, visitor numbers more than doubled over seven years to hit 73,991 in 2019.)Earlier this month the Roald Amundsen, a battery-hybrid ship operated by Norwegian line Hurtigruten, reached the white continent for the first time this season. The company, which runs seven “expedition cruise ships”, says its forward bookings for the next Antarctica season (in 2022/3) are 93 per cent up on the same point in December 2019; meanwhile Arctic bookings for summer 2022 are 128 per cent up on two years ago.Several other cruise ships are currently en route to Antarctica. They include Scenic Eclipse, a luxury vessel that carries just 200 people and offers helicopters and a submarine to help guests explore. Scenic says its 2022/23 Antarctic voyages are “virtually sold out” and that it has put its 2023/24 programme on sale early in a bid to keep up with demand. For those who can’t wait that long, however, Omicron-related travel restrictions mean there is some last-minute availability for this coming February (16 days, from £10,781 per person).Over the past two decades, advances in technology have made it increasingly easy to book your own flights, hotels, car rental and tours online. And then came the pandemic, and a raft of ever-changing travel restrictions, testing requirements and last-minute cancellations. Travel is more complicated than it has been in a generation, and so a helping hand — that of an expert travel agent — is suddenly at a premium once more. Virtuoso, the US-based network of agents, says it saw the number of people seeking a travel adviser grow 50 per cent in 2021 compared to the previous year.“A great many people had their fingers burnt when the pandemic hit, and it has been widely reported just how many have lost money or spent significant amounts of time ‘on hold’ to online companies,” says Gemma Antrobus, chair of the specialist travel agents group at the UK’s Association of Independent Tour Operators. “We have found that a significant amount of our new business is from clients who have never previously used an agent.” Similarly, Steppes Travel reports seeing the proportion of new clients rise over the past six months to 65 per cent of all inquiries. “Clients want to speak with someone to help them navigate the ever-changing confusion of rules,” says product director Jarrod Kyte.The superyacht’s USP — that it offers an escape from the rest of the world — has never been more relevant, and since the start of the pandemic charter and sales companies have been riding a wave of demand. Burgess, a superyacht broker with 14 offices worldwide, says every yacht in its 100-strong fleet is booked for New Year and that it’s a similar picture across the rest of the market. Burgess’s bookings for the Caribbean in February, March and April 2022 are up 60 per cent on the same period in 2021, and bookings for next summer are “unprecedented”. The most popular yacht in the company’s fleet is the 73-metre Titania, which takes up to 12 guests and is due to appear in the next series of Netflix drama The Crown. Rates start at $565,000 per week.The desire to reconnect after a long period of separation is driving a boom in holidays for big groups of extended family, often anchored around a special event. “People are making up for low-key lockdown birthdays and time apart by taking multigenerational, celebratory holidays in style,” says a spokesperson for Red Savannah, which reports high demand for villas sleeping between 14 and 28. “And it’s not just relatives,” says Jules Maury at Scott Dunn Private, “people are booking multigenerational family trips and adding groups of friends too. They just want to gather people together.”In the UK, the property rental company Unique Homestays says larger houses suitable for a multigenerational celebration are proving especially popular, particularly those with swimming pools, hot tubs or tennis courts. A third of 2022 availability at all its houses that sleep more than eight has already been taken (as against 12 per cent at the same point pre-pandemic). Most popular is Anthology Farm near Cheltenham — two 18th-century barns converted into a stylish self-catering retreat for up to 18; rates start at £7,995 per week and it is already 80 per cent booked for the coming year.Tour operators have also seen growing interest from families who want more intrepid, adventurous trips, often to remote places, after spending lockdowns close to home. “Family bookings are surging,” says a spokesperson for Black Tomato, the London and New York-based operator which started out specialising in upmarket escapes for couples but has seen family trips rise to 55 per cent of all bookings. “For the most part these families aren’t interested in cities, they’re seeking fresh air and the great outdoors.” In response the company has launched what it calls “field trips” — educational add-ons for children aged 12 and over that range from a scientist-led tour of Cern in Geneva to joining archaeologists on a dig in Cairo.They have been around for several decades but bikepacking (like backpacking, but with luggage strapped to your bike instead of your back) and gravel biking (a halfway house between road and mountain biking) have found themselves suddenly in vogue during the pandemic. “Bike sales boomed as more people looked for ways to stay healthy and active, and many took to the woods and mountains to avoid city crowds,” says Mike Lessard, tours director of the Adventure Cycling Association, a Montana-based non-profit that maps routes and runs tours in North America. For 2022, it’s offering 21 “dirt/gravel” tours — eight are new, and several have sold out already.In the UK, tour operator Saddle Skedaddle has also introduced new trips off the beaten path. “People are looking to explore more remote areas,” says Adam Walker, head of customer experience. “Gravel bikes are a great innovation because they allow people to ride on a mix of trail surfaces. They offer the benefit of a road and off-road bike in one.”And though it remains a niche at the extreme end of the bike-packing trend, growing numbers are signing up for extended, often transcontinental rides. The Adventure Cycling Association is running nine “epic tours” across the US in 2022, and though they last from 28 to 93 days, all but one are already sold out.TDA Global Cycling started off staging the Cairo-Cape Town Tour d’Afrique but now runs long-distance trips worldwide. In 2019 it notched up a record number of participants but says that total has already been exceeded for 2022 before the year has even begun. It too has added new trips to meet “unprecedented interest”, with trips in subsequent years also filing up. All 50 places on its 2023 Silk Route cycling expedition, a five-month, $26,500 adventure from Beijing to Istanbul, have already sold out, and another 33 people are on the wait list.“Particularly for these once in a lifetime trips, people are now thinking: if I am ever going to do this, then I better do it soon as the future obviously is not predictable,” says Henry Gold, TDA’s founder. “People are saying: I want to do something special. If not now, when?” 
37  The writer is a contributing columnist, based in ChicagoHis name was Jimmy. No, wait a minute: Matthew. Well, actually, Amedeo. My grandfather went by many names.Like many Italian immigrants in one of the greatest generations of European-American migration, he didn’t care what anyone called him: he just cared that all 4ft 10in of him made it to Ellis Island on the German steamship “Berlin”, eight weeks before the first world war began in 1914.Thus began my grandpa’s unromantic love affair with the American dream. “Jimmy”, as he was known at his steel mill job, went to work every day at Bethlehem Steel corporation. He watched baseball in the sitting room of the house across the tracks from the mill, in an Italian enclave of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. He grew tomatoes in the backyard. And he died when forced to retire aged 70. He never, to my knowledge, spoke a word of English — but I can’t think of anyone more American than my Grandpa Bastianelli.He would be appalled at what I am trying to do now: prove my right to become an Italian dual-citizen through him, and to pass Italian passports down to my Chinese-born children, who are naturalised Americans. In the 15 years I knew him, I never heard him say one good thing about the “old country”. I may wax lyrical about Tuscany’s cypress trees and “strade bianche”, but he preferred the steel-mill stench and iron bridges of Bethlehem.He was dead before I could tell him I had learnt Italian in the 1970s — but he would doubtless not have approved. His own children spoke not a word of his mother tongue, except for the chosen obscenity that he slung so frequently at my grandma.Like most Americans of my generation, I never thought to ask him where he was born, or when. And I know my grandma was called Lucy — my own daughter is named after her — but nothing more. Her maiden name was Shelbo, but what was that in the original Italian? And was she born in 1898, as it says on her gravestone, or 1897 (on her social security records) or 1899 (her obituary). Did either of them ever become American citizens? A 2019 poll commissioned by ancestry.com, the genealogy company, found that over 20 per cent of Americans couldn’t name even one great-grandparent: I fall into that category.I’ll need to pin all of this down to score an Italian passport with its precious right of residence in the EU. Britain may have rejoined the EU, at this rate, before I manage it. Because I’m not the only Italian-descended American trying this wheeze: Italian consulates across the US are inundated with requests, and have years-long backlogs. I heard about this first from my niece’s Italian-Chilean-American father-in-law, then discovered several other friends engaged in the same paper chase.I thought I could DIY it, until I failed to find any record of my grandparents’ marriage, death or naturalisation certificates in government archives. So I turned to My Italian Family, a leading US Italian citizenship consultant. Founder Bianca Ottone says dual citizenship takes on average three to four years: her organisation can do the full search for me (for $5,000 to $7,500). Crista Cowan, Ancestry’s corporate genealogist, says family searches like this are about more than just scoring EU residency. People turn to family history at what she calls “life moments of truth” — “and the pandemic became a life moment of truth for a large number of people”.“Family history helps us feel connected to something bigger than ourselves,” she says. That must be why I broke down in tears when I found a photo of Jimmy’s grave — which I had never seen — on Ancestry’s crowdsourced Findagrave site, and stumbled upon the death certificate of a baby uncle I never knew I had.Perhaps, one day, advances in DNA technology will help my own (adopted) children to construct a family tree that reaches back through 5,000 years of Chinese birth ancestors. But, for now, they are having a ball chasing their adoptive great-grandfather, Jimmy/Matthew/Amedeo, like the true Italian-Chinese-Americans that they are. I just hope we catch him before I join Jimmy and Lucy in Italian-American heaven. There are so many things I wish I had asked them.
38  The UK risks falling behind the EU in its protection of workers’ rights, according to the Trades Union Congress, which is calling on ministers to act on previous commitments to make employment more secure.The TUC has written to Liz Truss in her new role as chief Brexit negotiator, and to Kwasi Kwarteng, business secretary, seeking guarantees they will not dilute existing labour market standards in two reviews of EU-derived law proposed by Truss’s predecessor Lord David Frost before he stepped down.Kwarteng scrapped plans for a post-Brexit overhaul of UK employment law last year after the Labour opposition accused him of taking a “wrecking ball” to hard-won workers’ rights.But the TUC said it believed all government departments would be required to participate in the two reviews into the substance and status of retained EU law that Frost had proposed.The reviews could put at risk essential rights on holiday pay, equal pay for women and men, and equal treatment of part-time workers at risk, the TUC claimed, and might make it harder for workers to enforce their rights in court.“One year on since the UK-EU deal came into force, we risk going backwards — not forwards — on rights in the workplace,” said Frances O’Grady, the TUC’s general secretary.“While our EU counterparts push game-changing new rights for platform workers, our government is flirting with a review which endangers important workers’ rights and legal principles.”The UK’s trade deal with Brussels includes a commitment not to weaken existing labour protections. But even if these were left untouched, the TUC argued, the UK is already lagging behind the EU in important evolving areas of law, partly because of delays to a long-promised employment bill.If this legislation finally gets the go-ahead in 2022, it should include provisions mirroring some of those set out in the EU’s 2019 Work-Life Balance directive. These include better protection from redundancy for new parents, a day-one right to request flexible working and unpaid leave for carers.But it is no longer clear whether the government plans to act on previous proposals to require employers to give workers reasonable notice of shift patterns, and payment for cancelled shifts — changes the TUC said could make “a huge difference” to workers on precarious contracts.Meanwhile, the EU has set out draft legislation to create new protections for gig workers, including a presumption of employee status, and new obligations of transparency in the use of algorithmic management systems.It also plans legislation to ensure that minimum wages are set at a meaningful level, in those countries that use them, and to promote collective bargaining.The UK government’s foot-dragging on the employment bill comes as workers face a worsening outlook for living standards, with inflation likely to outpace growth in average wages over the coming year.The TUC warned on Thursday that families were “bracing themselves for a cost of living storm in 2022”, with fuel bills soaring, recent benefits cuts biting and taxes set to rise in April.
39  The World Health Organization has warned of a “tsunami of cases” of Covid-19 around the world as countries including France and the US reported record-breaking infection tallies.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director-general, used the disaster analogy to describe how the higher transmissibility of the Omicron coronavirus variant was compounding the circulation of the Delta strain.“This is and will continue to put immense pressure on exhausted health workers and health systems on the brink of collapse and again disrupting lives and livelihoods,” Tedros told reporters as the health body marked the two-year anniversary of the emergence of the pandemic.WHO officials have noted that preliminary studies from several countries showed the Omicron variant driving the surge produced less severe outcomes than previous strains, but Tedros said the world’s healthcare systems still faced a stiff test.“There is this narrative going on which is ‘it’s milder or less severe’,” Tedros said. “But we’re undermining the other side, at the same time it could be dangerous, because the high transmissibility could increase hospitalisations and deaths.”His comments came after the US seven-day rolling average of cases breached 265,000 on Tuesday, its highest daily tally since the start of the pandemic, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said: “In a few short weeks, Omicron has rapidly increased across the country and we expect will continue to circulate in the coming weeks.”In France, health minister Olivier Véran said the country was facing a two-pronged “tidal wave” with Omicron and Delta.France registered 208,000 positive cases on Wednesday, Véran said, a one-day record since the start of the pandemic. Testing has increased, he said, but the rate at which cases were spreading was unprecedented.Meanwhile, Germany recorded 13,129 cases of infection with the Omicron variant on Wednesday, a 26 per cent increase on the previous day, according to official figures released by the Robert Koch Institute, the country’s main public health agency.Karl Lauterbach, health minister, said the situation was much worse than the official data suggested, estimating that the actual incidence of coronavirus in Germany was twice or three times higher.He called the “clear increase” in cases of Omicron “concerning”, and appealed to people to celebrate New Year’s Eve in a way that did not lead to new chains of infection. “Please celebrate in small groups,” Lauterbach said.In the US, Anthony Fauci, Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, acknowledged increasingly strong evidence of “lesser severity” of Omicron, either because of greater immunity to the virus or milder intrinsic virulence, but said it was no reason for complacency.He told CNBC on Wednesday that he expected the Omicron wave in the US to peak “probably by the end of January”.Still, US health officials at the CDC have issued new guidelines shortening the quarantine timeline for people infected with the coronavirus to five days if they show no symptoms.“We know that after five days people are much less likely to transmit the virus,” Walensky said.At the WHO, Tedros lamented the slow progress in distributing vaccinations around the world.More than 90 countries globally have missed the target of vaccinating 40 per cent of their populations by year’s end because of a combination of limited supply and vaccines arriving close to the expiration date or without critical components such as syringes, Tedros said.“Forty per cent was do-able,” he added, warning aggressive booster programmes in richer countries could again cause shortages in poorer countries despite increasing supply early next year. “It’s not only a moral shame, it cost lives and provided the virus with opportunities to circulate unchecked and mutate.”A Financial Times analysis published this month showed Covid boosters in rich countries outnumbered all vaccines among poor nations. Scientists have long warned that uneven access to vaccines, coupled with high transmission, could lead to more troublesome variants.The WHO is calling for all countries to vaccinate at least 70 per cent of their populations by mid-2022.Reporting by Donato Paolo Mancini in London, James Politi in Bolzano, Sarah White in Paris and Guy Chazan in Berlin
40  US President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin will hold a telephone call on Thursday to discuss European security, the Kremlin and White House have confirmed.The call will come amid intense diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions over Ukraine, following reports that Russia has deployed 100,000 troops on its side of the border with the country and controversy around Russia’s role in Europe’s rocketing gas prices.A senior US administration official said the call had been arranged at Russia’s request and that it would take a “high level of engagement” to forge a path of “de-escalation”.Biden would present his own list of US concerns about Russia’s military build-up along the Ukrainian border, and would make clear that the US and its allies were prepared to “respond” if Russia were to invade, the official said.Putin said on Wednesday that gas prices would stabilise once the German regulator allowed supplies to flow to western Europe via the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which runs under the Baltic and bypasses Ukraine. Kyiv currently receives transit fees for Russian gas passing through its territory. Germany’s approval of Nord Stream 2 is not expected until mid-2022.Critics of the pipeline say it will increase Europe’s reliance on Russian energy supplies, and the US has earmarked it as a possible target for sanctions in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.Moscow considers Ukraine, where Russian is widely spoken and which was part of the former Soviet Union, to be within its sphere of influence. When asked last week about the possibility of an invasion of its neighbour, Putin said that the tensions had been caused by Nato overstepping acceptable boundaries with its eastward expansion towards Russia’s borders, and called for an immediate guarantee that such an expansion would stop.Although Russia’s leader has previously denied any plan to invade, he last week refused to rule out a military solution.Putin said earlier that Russian and US officials were expected to meet in January for talks on Ukraine. The senior US official said Washington would like to see “concrete progress” on the ground to make the negotiations successful. On Wednesday, Josep Borrell, the EU’s chief foreign policy official, said the bloc must be included in the negotiations.Nord Stream 2’s second pipeline was filled with gas and ready for operation, Putin said on Wednesday. “Now, of course, everything depends on our partners in Europe and Germany,” he said. “As soon as they decide on the start of the work, Europe will immediately get large additional volumes of Russian gas. This will certainly affect the price.on the spot [market]. And all the consumers buying Russian gas will immediately feel that.” Gazprom, Russia’s state-backed monopoly gas exporter, has been repeatedly accused of exacerbating Europe’s surge in gas prices by withholding volumes beyond its contractual obligations and failing to fill its European gas storage facilities. Putin last week defended the company, saying it had supplied more gas to Europe this year than in 2020 and that it had received no requests for additional volumes at current prices.Gazprom has a deal to transit 40bn cubic metres of gas via Ukraine until 2024, and has surpassed that volume this year.
41  Russian civil rights group Memorial has vowed to find legal ways to continue its work after it was forcibly dissolved by the courts this week, as concerns grew about the fate of its vast collection of artefacts and archival materials documenting Soviet-era atrocities.The historical research group, which was dissolved on Tuesday after state prosecutors accused it of breaking ‘foreign agent’ laws and suggested it was depicting the Soviet Union too negatively, also saw its affiliate, the Memorial human rights centre, liquidated on Wednesday by a Moscow court judge.The two decisions, which cap a year of crackdowns on Kremlin critics unprecedented in post-Soviet Russia, aim to outlaw an organisation that has worked since 1989 to uncover and preserve the memory of the abuses of the Soviet era, from mass executions in the 1930s to the millions of people who went through the Gulag forced labour camp system.The move has caused a public outcry, with many expressing outrage at comments by state prosecutors in the trial accusing Memorial of “creating a false image of the Soviet Union”.The group’s lawyers have said they will appeal against the court rulings, while the group’s director has vowed to continue its work within the law, as the group consists of a network of different legal entities across the country, not just the two Moscow-based organisations dissolved this week.“Memorial will exist in Russia,” Yan Rachinsky, its chair, told the Meduza news outlet after the court decision. “Memorial isn’t limited to the two organisations that the attorney-general’s office has come out against.”He added: “We will continue our activity without any fundamental changes. We have 60 organisations in Russia alone, they are all independent legal entities and they will continue their work calmly, even if today’s ruling, which runs counter to the law, is upheld in the court of appeal.”He also noted that historical research would in any case be continued by the many others working in the field.“Memorial is not an organisation, it’s not even a social movement,” the group said in a statement after the court decision. “Memorial represents the need of Russian people for the truth about their country’s tragic past, about the fate of many millions of people. No one will be able to ‘dissolve’ this need.”But the future of Memorial’s vast collection of historical artefacts and archival materials documenting Soviet-era abuses is uncertain.The collection is made up of tens of thousands of deeply personal items, many handed over to the museum by the families of victims or by survivors. Only around half has been digitised. They include letters and drawings sent home by Gulag prisoners, household items from prison life and final photographs of the executed and disappeared.Rachinsky struck a confident note about the collection’s future. He said it was also held by a different legal entity and was only in the “custody” of the Moscow headquarters that was dissolved on Tuesday. “It will need to be reorganised a little,” Rachinsky told Meduza.The profound importance of Memorial’s archive for many people in Russia was evident on Tuesday after the ruling to close it was announced. Many took to social media to share stories of their relatives who were executed or imprisoned during the Soviet period, describing how they found out about their families’ histories thanks to Memorial’s archival work.“It is simply a disgrace and a sentencing of our memory,” charity worker Inna Bublikova wrote on social media, relating the stories of relatives that were deported or forced into hard labour in Soviet times and sharing copies of their profiles in an archival database of victims compiled by Memorial.“I would never have been able to preserve their memory if it hadn’t been for the work of Memorial,” she wrote.
42  The disarray of the French left underscores how the campaign for the presidency ahead of April’s election will be fought and won on the right.Barely five years since François Hollande bowed out as France’s socialist head of state, the party’s candidate Anne Hidalgo has sunk to as low as 3 per cent in one recent opinion poll. Hidalgo’s last-ditch appeal for the multiple left-of-centre contenders to submit to a primary contest has so far been rejected by most of them.Now Christiane Taubira, a veteran politician from the French Caribbean, is considering a bid to save the honour of the left. Taubira, a former justice minister, is a respected figure. But whether she can unify the leftwing vote, including the greens, is doubtful.First-round support for all of the left-of-centre candidates amounts to only 24 per cent. The left lacks compelling leaders and fresh ideas. France’s political centre of gravity has shifted to the right in recent years, with crime, immigration and national identity rising up the agenda, even if living standards and Covid-19 have more recently returned to the fore.The election is shaping up as a battle among four candidates for right of centre voters. The novelty was the stunning rise of Eric Zemmour, the far-right polemicist, whose polling breakthrough has come largely at the expense of Marine Le Pen, fighting her third presidential campaign. Then came the surprise victory of Valérie Pécresse, in the primary for the centre right Republicans. She has since vaulted the two far-right candidates into second place in opinion polls behind Emmanuel Macron.In his book La Droite en France, published in 1954 and updated in 1982, the historian René Rémond drew up a typology based on the right’s post-revolutionary antecedents which, if inexact in its categorisations, remains remarkably pertinent today. It is divided into three currents, Rémond wrote: legitimists (or counter-revolutionaries), Orleanists and Bonapartists. Zemmour and Le Pen are legitimists or anti-liberal reactionaries. Gaullists, with their faith in the charismatic leader, are Bonapartists. Macron is an Orleanist liberal, as is the more conservative Pécresse.Postwar French politics has been shaped as much, if not more, by the divisions among these currents as by the ideological competition between left and right. Periodically, rightwing ideologues dream of uniting all three currents. Nicolas Sarkozy came closest in recent times, taking far-right and liberal votes to win in 2007. His presidency was incoherent and erratic.Zemmour, an essayist and historian, aspires to bring together legitimists and Bonapartists. For him that means paying homage to Charles de Gaulle while playing down the crimes of his second world war adversary Philippe Pétain and his collaborationist regime. He also thrives on the fuss his revisionism creates.Macron, who also celebrates de Gaulle, has every interest in keeping this rift alive. He made a point of visiting Vichy, seat of Pétain’s wartime government, earlier this month where he warned against the “manipulation” of history.Macron’s original political pitch was that he went beyond left and right, but he has governed as a liberal conservative. While his core vote includes social democrats and centrists, the bulk of his supporters are centre-right. Fifty per cent of them would back Pécresse as a second choice in the first round of an election, according to an Ipsos Sopra-Steria poll. Pécresse needs to win them over while keeping the rightwing of her party from deserting to Zemmour.She has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash the size of France’s public administration and accuses Macron of wrecking the public finances. Her pitch is very similar to that made by the conservative François Fillon five years ago before his campaign collapsed in scandal. Macron’s allies are already accusing her of being stuck in the past, too Parisian and a hostage to her party’s hard right sympathisers. But opinion polls suggest she could beat the incumbent in the second round. Macron is under pressure to promise a reformist second term. Since his party may well lose its parliamentary majority in elections in June, he would probably have to share power with the Republicans in any case.Macron would prefer a rematch against Le Pen or, even better, an easy run-off with Zemmour. He could once again present himself as a rampart against the far-right. But the French seem to have little appetite for a Manichean choice. Pécresse may yet falter. She is only narrowly ahead of her far-right rivals. But the first female conservative presidential candidate presents Macron with a fresh challenge. It would strengthen Macron’s legitimacy should he win. It is good for French democracy.
43  Deutsche Bank has been fined by the German financial regulator for failing to implement measures designed to prevent rate-rigging, a blow to the country’s largest lender, which is trying to move on from the Libor scandal.BaFin said that Deutsche Bank did not always have “effective preventive systems, controls and policies” in place to ensure the “integrity and reliability” of data relating to Euribor, the euro rate-setting mechanism comparable to Libor. The regulator imposed an €8.7m fine. The move comes less than seven years after Deutsche Bank was forced to pay a record $2.5bn in a settlement with US and UK authorities after several employees were found to have colluded to manipulate Libor, the benchmark rates that underpin trillions of dollars of loans and derivatives.The bank, which had the right to appeal, said it was accepting the fine to create “final legal certainty”. The fine is the first of its kind to be issued by BaFin in relation to legislation brought in following the Libor scandals that is designed to prevent further rate-rigging. It is also the regulator’s second-highest fine ever, after a €40m penalty over anti-money laundering weaknesses handed to Deutsche Bank in 2015. The initial fine demanded by BaFin was initially higher than the amount announced, according to two people familiar with the matter. A spokesman for Deutsche Bank confirmed that BaFin had taken action after examining the bank’s internal controls for submissions of Euribor data. The issues investigated related to a period between early 2019 and 2020, a person familiar with the matter said.But the spokesman added: “Deutsche Bank has no indication that the fined issue led to incorrect submissions to the benchmark administrator,” and said the lender had already begun to strengthen its internal system.The shortcomings were first uncovered by external auditors and then flagged to the bank, according to people with knowledge of the matter.BaFin, which has been criticised for its oversight of Wirecard and Greensill Bank, has been under pressure to provide more robust regulation of Germany’s financial system. New president Mark Branson, who was hired from the Swiss regulator Finma, started this year.In October, the regulator took the unusual step of curtailing Berlin fintech N26’s expansion plans, citing concerns about the management structure at the rapidly growing start-up.
44  After weeks of menacing words and behaviour, there is no longer much doubt that Vladimir Putin is engaged in high-stakes blackmail. After massing forces close to Ukraine, the Kremlin has issued an ultimatum: that western countries acquiesce to what amounts to a rewriting of Europe’s post-cold war security order, on its terms. Russia’s president is in effect negotiating with a gun to his neighbour’s head. He must be deterred from military action. Whether and how US president Joe Biden and European allies achieve that will have profound implications for European security and relations with powers such as China.Moscow has presented proposed treaties with the US and Nato that go well beyond earlier demands for guarantees that Nato would not expand to include Ukraine. Under Russia’s plans, Nato would need Moscow’s consent to deploy troops in former communist countries that joined the alliance after May 1997 — which could mean reversing existing deployments. Nato would face constraints on missile sites, exercises and activity in central and eastern Europe.The Kremlin will know Washington and Nato capitals cannot agree to many of its demands in their current form. So are these proposals simply a maximalist negotiating position — or a fig leaf for Putin to take military action anyway? The Russian president may in reality be ready to use phased military escalation to push western countries towards conceding.Putin may suspect a moment of western weakness, with a new German government, presidential elections in France, and a White House that fumbled some of its Ukraine diplomacy, notably by waiving US sanctions on Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. There are worrying signs Putin is trying to create a pretext to act militarily, or lure Kyiv into a trap as it did Georgia’s leadership in 2008. Putin has alleged that Ukraine plans an offensive to reclaim eastern border regions controlled by Russian-backed separatists.The twin-track strategy Biden initiated at his recent summit with Putin makes sense. But it requires careful handling, and a unity of purpose and messaging with European allies. One track is to raise the costs of aggression as far as possible by making clear the west will apply genuinely painful economic sanctions to Russia, and provide additional defensive materiel to Ukraine, if it happens.Launching a large-scale war against a fellow Slavic nation whose citizens Putin has repeatedly told Russians form “one people” with them would carry huge domestic risks — despite the hostility Russia’s propagandistic state media have whipped up against the Kyiv government. Warnings of new financial or energy-related sanctions must weigh on the Russian president’s calculus.The second track is talks over what Biden has called Putin’s security “concerns”. These must have strict ground rules. Western capitals need to make clear they will respect 21st-century norms, that European nations are free to choose their own systems and alliances. There can be no return to the great power bargaining over the heads of smaller nations to which Moscow seems to aspire. If the west is to make any concessions, Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea and occupation of Donbas must be part of talks. And to gain a seat at the table, Putin should first put down his gun — and take steps to de-escalate the situation around Ukraine.Russia’s president is playing a relatively weak hand strongly. The west should not play its own strong hand weakly. Complex and difficult diplomacy lies ahead. But Putin must be persuaded jaw-jaw, and not the alternative, is the way forward.Letters in response to this editorial comment:For Putin, suzerainty over eastern Europe is key aim / From Martin Spector, London N2, UKRussia, not the west, holds the initiative on Ukraine / From Harlan Ullman, Senior Adviser, Atlantic Council, Washington, DC, USPragmatism should prevail over principle in Ukraine / From Sir Anthony Brenton, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, UKPutin stand-off may have ramifications for Taiwan / From Ed Houlihan, Ridgewood, NJ, US
45  Capitalism, apparently, thrives through competition, and the cultural world is not exempt as an arena. Now Paris, seat of the two figureheads of luxury capitalism, LVMH’s Bernard Arnault and François Pinault of Kering, is witnessing a contest measured through museums.Arnault opened his Fondation Louis Vuitton in the Bois de Boulogne in 2014, so Pinault also needed a good address. Having abandoned the idea of an island in the Seine (former car plant, too low-rent), he found his venue in the carcass of the city’s old stock exchange, the Bourse de Commerce, situated perfectly between the Louvre and the Pompidou. Arnault had Frank Gehry; Pinault had Tadao Ando, the Japanese architect he had already worked with on two adaptive reuse projects in Venice, the Palazzo Grassi and the Punta della Dogana.The result opened in May to a more muted and much less global response, given Covid times, than Gehry’s billowing construction seven years earlier. But it is in many ways the more complex and intriguing building.The big move, one I had reservations about when I saw the model at the Ando exhibition at the Pompidou Centre in 2018, was to build a concrete cylinder inside the historic central rotunda. Entirely useless for hanging art and insanely intrusive, it seemed counterintuitive. But this overscaled sewer pipe executed in impeccable concrete is what brands this as an Ando building. With this one gesture, he takes possession, allowing the rest of the building to be treated more delicately. It is oddly ingenious.During the design phase, Ando reminisced about a visit he made to the Pantheon in Rome four decades ago, a moment when he was alone, looking up at the oculus as it admitted a disk of light which slowly moved around the walls and revealed the turning of the earth. He suggested it was a moment in which architecture contained and revealed the cosmos. It is a cliché, but that connection with the air and sky is one Ando has made on many occasions, notably in his Church of the Light (Ibaraki, Japan) and Church on the Water (Hokkaido, Japan). In Paris, tip your head up and you may see that beam of light refracted through the iron and glass dome and projected on to the walls, moving slowly round like on a sundial. Here Ando achieves his Roman moment, the connection of the interior to the heavens.This rotunda embodies a history of change and exchange. The site was occupied in the 16th century by a palace built for Catherine de Medici, then the widow of Henry II. (One freestanding column survives and has been absorbed into the building’s circumference.) In a curious anticipation of the revolutionary shift from royalty to bread, a grain exchange appeared on the site in 1763, a circular building with a courtyard open to the sky.To protect the grain from rain, a wooden roof was added in 1783, which was later replaced after a fire by François-Joseph Bélanger’s iron version, a wonder of its age. In 1885, the disused building began a transformation into the city’s commodities exchange, opening four years later on the centenary of the revolution as one of Paris’s new landmarks, along with the Eiffel Tower. Its rotunda was born again as a trading floor, crowned with a restored iron dome and paintings depicting scenes of exotic colonial riches. It is curious, at this juncture, to see bad 19th-century art depicting colonised peoples in obeisance to their French masters treated with such respect. But these too are apparently an inextricable, sacrosanct component of the building’s history.There is an argument to be had over exactly how much Ando’s gestural concrete contributes here, whether it can be simultaneously photogenic and contemporary but also banal. Experienced in situ it turns out to be more than just a gesture. The cylindrical wall has a walkway around its exterior which acts not only as circulation for the galleries but as a tool for looking at the historic building it sits in; that beautiful ironwork dome, the art below, the milling crowds and those terrible 19th-century paintings above.If Ando’s concrete will get the credit here, much of the significant work was done by others. Heritage specialist Pierre-Antoine Gatier co-ordinated the complex restoration while younger local practice NeM (Lucie Niney and Thibault Marca) made it work as an exhibition space. Also present are designer brothers Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec, who have subtly inserted their bespoke furniture and lighting designs into the corners, interstices and stairwells of the structure. The attenuated light poles in the stairwells are, for instance, wonderful — architectural in their presence, understated but elegant.The real art is installed in a dozen tapering rooms around the edges, each naturally lit and giving glimpses of both cylinder and, occasionally, the city. The galleries are well-scaled for paintings, though they have a kind of blankness to their surfaces which is at odds with the richness of the rest of the building. That globalised banal white combo of the global art interior is, however, countered by the striking nature of the works on the walls. Pinault, whose collection can veer towards the vulgar, has assembled a fine series of works for the opening from an impressively diverse set of artists, much of it representational and figurative, much of it by black artists.Pinault’s Bourse de Commerce is a project that dates from a moment when Paris was seeking billionaires to fund its next generation of grands projets. There was considerable controversy over the price the city paid to acquire it from Chamber of Commerce and Industry and about whether the luxury magnate should be allowed to take a 50-year lease on such a significant building. But the city of Paris has not had to contribute towards the estimated €160m construction cost and this urban monument is now open and accessible to the public in a way that it has never formerly been.Although the reception since opening has been largely positive, there has been a discussion, in true Parisian style, about the nature of the institution, its de facto privatisation and the increasing dominance of big business on the cultural landscape. If there is going to be discourse about wealth and inequality, culture and global capitalism, then the Bourse de Commerce — a palace, a temple of commerce, the former stock exchange, a centre of vast colonial exploitation — could well be the ideal place to have it.pinaultcollection.com
46  The EU’s trade commissioner has urged Chile’s incoming leftwing government, led by president-elect Gabriel Boric, to sign a deal with the bloc negotiated by the country’s rightwing predecessor.Valdis Dombrovskis told the Financial Times he hoped the new administration, which takes office in March and includes the Communist party, would endorse the pact. He is also pressing EU member states to do the same after France held up the deal, which updates and deepens a 2002 agreement.“We very much hope that the incoming government in Chile will endorse this modernised agreement,” Dombrovskis told the FT.“This is a good deal for both Chile and EU member states, boosting our mutual trade and doing so in a way that is sustainable — in fact, the most sustainable trade deal we will have done so far.“Strategically, it also gives the EU greater access to lithium, which will bolster our capacity to produce batteries.”He also warned EU countries, which make up the world’s largest trade bloc, against growing protectionism.“We should not lose sight of the benefits that trade deals bring for our economies, our businesses and workers, especially as we emerge from the [Covid-19] crisis,” he said.France has persuaded the European Commission, which negotiates such deals on behalf of the union, to delay the Chile deal and talks with New Zealand. President Emmanuel Macron faces an election in April and was nervous about French farmers’ reactions to cheap Chilean chicken imports, diplomats said. Chile would get an 18,000 tonne tariff-free quota for chicken — less than 0.2 per cent of EU consumption.Paris has cited sustainable development issues and agricultural sensitivities as reasons for its opposition.An EU deal with Mercosur, the South American trade bloc, has been held up because some countries want binding commitments from Brazil to protect the Amazon rainforest.Chile’s incoming president Boric is part of a broad leftwing coalition. His election ends three decades of moderate centrist governments, which have attracted investment to what today is the wealthiest nation in Latin America.Boric has unnerved investors with opposition to some mining projects. However, he said at an October meeting with diplomats in Santiago that the EU deal was hugely relevant and that he would respect the results of the negotiations if elected.Rodrigo Yáñez, director of international economic relations for the Chilean foreign ministry, said 60 per cent of the country’s economy depended on foreign trade and added that any leader must prioritise international partnerships.“The EU deal is also the greenest accord Chile will have and the environment is a key part [of Boric’s] mandate,” Yáñez, who is involved in the EU negotiations, told the FT.Boric’s team has plans for greater multilateralism, “with a Latin American vocation, respectful of human rights, international law, co-operation, international treaties and sustainability”, said senator Juan Ignacio Latorre, who was a foreign affairs spokesperson during the Boric election campaign.
47  Maurice Greig might have expected a well-earned break over Christmas, having spent 2021 struggling with the post-Brexit bureaucracy now required to export his tailor-made gentlemen’s accessories to the EU.But instead the 74-year-old owner of the Greig & Greig Partnership gave up at least part of the festive season in order to pore over UK government technical guidance for new border controls about to be introduced on imports from the EU.Starting in January, UK importers must complete customs declarations in real time; pre-notify the authorities of incoming animal and plant products; and be able to produce proof that the goods they are importing from the EU qualify for tariff-free access to the UK.“It will do my head in,” said Greig in the stockroom of his London boutique, which is filled with samples of expensive handmade leather gloves, belts and fancy-handled Italian umbrellas. “But then I’m only a very small business, I don’t have anyone else to help.” Business groups have warned that the new import controls, which were delayed by one year in order to keep trade flowing, will put considerable new pressure on small businesses in 2022 as they continue to adjust to trading outside the EU single market.Greig & Greig is one of thousands of micro enterprises that the Federation of Small Businesses trade group has warned are insufficiently prepared for the new checks after a membership survey found that only a quarter of businesses were ready.A survey from the Institute of Directors, the bosses’ organisation whose members generally represent larger businesses, found one-third were “not at all prepared” for the changes.Business groups and officials concede that it is impossible to predict exactly how the changes will affect the flow of imports from the EU, which in 2020 accounted for 50 per cent of all UK imports, worth £300bn. Senior government officials responsible for the border told MPs in November that businesses were being contacted about the changes, including on the other side of the Channel, where EU hauliers and exporters will also need to get prepared.The biggest source of concern about possible disruption comes from the requirement for lorries entering the UK to obtain an authorisation code from the UK’s goods vehicle movement service, or GVMS, prior to boarding a ferry.To obtain the code, their paperwork must be in order. From January 1 this will mean customs declarations and duty payments can no longer be deferred by up to 175 days, and animal and plant products must be pre-registered with the UK’s import of products, animals, food and feed system (IPAFFS).Jim Harra, the permanent secretary at HM Revenue & Customs, told MPs on the public accounts committee that “undoubtedly” some EU lorry drivers would be turned away because of the new system but he was “confident” they would soon adapt.From July food importers will also need their goods to be accompanied by health certificates signed off by EU vets and be ready to submit to spot checks if selected at UK border control posts.Harra said government confidence was based on the fact that hauliers had adapted to a similar French pre-declaration system in 2021, when predictions of a reasonable worst-case scenario of tailbacks of 7,000 trucks failed to materialise.Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation, said the requirement to gather customs and IPAFFS declarations, often in a tight timeframe, was likely to leave many EU hauliers “playing catch-up” in the early months of 2022.HMRC said it had been sending 14,000 letters a month to EU hauliers to prepare them for the changes. However, haulage groups in the EU told the Financial Times that they expected delays because they had been unable to pre-test the GVMS system. HMRC said it was “live proving” the system with selected organisations.Artur Kalisiak, from TLP, which represents Poland’s big transport companies, said that while it was flagging UK government webinars to its members, 90 per of Poland’s 36,000 haulage companies were small operators with 10 vehicles or less.“We get information and reminders.and we pass on this information to our members,” he said. “So our companies are aware of this. How informed other companies are is a different question.”Waberer’s, one of eastern Europe’s largest haulage groups, was more pessimistic, complaining that it had not been possible to pre-test the GVMS system ahead of the January 1 launch.“We are certain there will be logjams, because we don’t know if the UK system can handle the claims flooding them,” said a spokesperson. “There will be a lot of clueless drivers backed up at the transit points.”As well as new border controls, UK companies trading with the EU will need to show proof that their goods are eligible for tariff-free importation into the UK.Under the “rules of origin” of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, goods must typically be 50 per cent made in the UK to qualify for export to the EU tariff-free. And vice-versa for EU goods being exported to the UK.In 2021 exporters on both sides were given a one-year grace period that reduced the required documentation, but from 2022 companies on both sides of the Channel will need to provide documentary proof that their goods comply if challenged by customs authorities.In December, HMRC told UK traders that if they failed to provide “supplier declarations” for goods they risked paying penalties or being barred from using preferential tariff rates in the future.Trade groups have warned ministers that for smaller businesses the rules of origin process can be confusing and time-consuming, with many not fully appreciating the requirements.Daniel Pettitt, managing director of Wiltshire-based Heaven Scent Incense, which makes scented soaps and candles using ingredients sourced from around the world, said he was grappling with the new rules.“We’re starting to ask suppliers for declarations and we know that our products do qualify,” he said, but admitted he was not sure where the information proving this should be lodged when exporting to the EU.He added that, despite plentiful emails from the government about the coming changes, online guidance was difficult to use. “It’s like falling down a rabbit hole. You click link after link to get to some website. You just get lost.”Tanya Marriott, the owner of SoleLution, an independent shoe shop in Bristol that imports shoes from the EU, said the company was still trying to work out its legal position in the event of a dispute over duty with EU suppliers.“As a small business we’re trying to find our way. I’ve attempted to investigate via the HMRC website, and I don’t consider myself new to all this, but it’s not explained in layman’s terms,” she added.Back in London, Greig of the gentlemen’s accessories importer, is still trying to iron out this year’s problems, which include duty payments being charged erroneously on shipments that “originate” in the UK and the EU.“It’s going to be very complicated,” he said of importing his samples from the EU, “because I’m only a micro business. I don’t yet know what the rules are after January 1, but no doubt it will not be straightforward.”
48  Russia’s Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered the closure of Memorial, the country’s oldest civil rights group, after prosecutors accused the organisation of failing to properly label itself a “foreign agent” and suggested it was depicting the Soviet Union too negatively.The legal action against the group caps a year of an unprecedented crackdown on dissent by the Kremlin, including the jailing of opposition leader Alexei Navalny and pressure on activists and independent journalists as well as other political opponents of President Vladimir Putin. Two former local leaders of Navalny’s movement were detained on Tuesday.Memorial, dubbed “Russia’s conscience” by some, has worked since 1989 to document and preserve the memory of atrocities of the Soviet era, from mass executions in the 1930s to the many millions of people who went through the Gulag forced labour camp system.The group, which counts Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei Sakharov among its founding members, was accused by government prosecutors last month of breaking a law requiring it to label its publications and online posts as having been produced by a foreign agent.The government has said the law protects the country from covert foreign influence. Many NGOs, media outlets and journalists are now required to display the label on each of their tweets and posts. Memorial, which was designated as a foreign agent in 2016, has denied failing to mark its materials properly.Several court hearings over the past month have caused a public outcry, with some accusing the government of pushing for Memorial’s dissolution in an attempt to rewrite the history of the Soviet Union and present it in a different light.During Tuesday’s Supreme Court hearing, state prosecutor Aleksei Zhafyarov accused the civil rights group of being too negative about the past and suggested it was doing so on the behest of foreign donors.“Memorial creates a false image of the Soviet Union as a terrorist state,” Zhafyarov said ahead of the verdict on Tuesday, in comments reported from the courtroom by the Novaya Gazeta newspaper.“It makes us repent for the Soviet past, instead of remembering glorious history,” Zhafyarov said. It did so “probably because someone is paying for it”, Zhafyarov added. “This is the real reason that Memorial is actively trying to disassociate itself from its status as a foreign agent.”Memorial has said that despite the ruling to shut it down, it would try to continue its work, which has included extensive archival research into the activities of security services during the Soviet era, including the KGB, where Putin once worked.Putin has said that Memorial has supported extremist groups. It is an accusation also levied by authorities against the Memorial human rights centre, an affiliate group that focuses on documenting contemporary abuses and maintains a list of political prisoners. It also faces liquidation in a parallel trial in a Moscow court on Wednesday.“At the moment, we’re speechless,” the Memorial human rights centre wrote on its channel on the Telegram messenger app after Tuesday’s Supreme Court decision was announced. “The show is over, and we all feel sick,” it added, as protesters outside the courtroom chanted: “Shame! Shame!”Memorial’s lawyers have said they will appeal against the Supreme Court’s decision.
49  Germany’s highest court has demanded greater protection for disabled people in Covid-related cases of “triage” — when doctors only treat those patients with a greater chance of survival and abandon others to their fate — in a significant victory for disability campaigners.The constitutional court told Germany’s parliament to come up with a law that ensures people with disabilities are not discriminated against when it comes to the “allocation of intensive care treatments that have become scarce as a result of the pandemic”.Germany’s health minister Karl Lauterbach welcomed the judgment. “People with disabilities need the state’s protection more than anyone else, particularly in cases of triage,” he tweeted. The priority was now to vaccinate enough people to ensure that triage never happens, he added.Tuesday’s verdict goes to the heart of one of the biggest ethical dilemmas to have arisen during the Covid-19 crisis — whether medical staff working in overstretched intensive care wards should prioritise who they try to save.Doctors and nurses were often faced with heartbreaking choices, particularly in the early phase of the crisis, over how to allocate scarce resources such as ventilators. There were cases when hospitals did not have enough beds for the many seriously ill Covid-19 patients being admitted to intensive care wards. That sometimes led to triage — the grading of injuries and physical conditions based on who is more likely to survive.In March, the British Institute of Human Rights said so-called “do not attempt resuscitation” orders for disabled and elderly people were issued at a far higher rate during the early months of the pandemic, as doctors worried it would put unsustainable pressure on the NHS.Germany’s constitutional court said people with disabilities faced greater danger during the pandemic, including a higher risk of becoming infected with coronavirus and dying of Covid-19. And it said parliament had failed to take precautions to prevent these groups from being discriminated against in the provision of intensive care.This, the judges said, was a violation of article 3 of the German constitution, which dictates that “no one should be discriminated against because of a disability”.The plaintiffs were a group of nine people with disabilities and pre-existing conditions who feared that doctors might deny them treatment, focusing only on healthier patients with a better chance of survival.They took issue with the current guidelines for doctors contained in a series of “clinical-ethical recommendations” drawn up by the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine (Divi), one of the country’s biggest doctors’ organisations.These rules specify that a patient’s frailty and pre-existing conditions should play a role in determining whether he or she receives treatment. The plaintiffs worried that meant disabled people would always lose out, because of their poorer chances of survival.However, after the group filed their complaint with the constitutional court, Divi insisted that no one would ever be denied treatment on the grounds of age, an underlying illness or disability. It said the criteria would only become relevant if a patient was unlikely to survive an illness.The constitutional court ended up siding with the plaintiffs, saying Divi’s recommendations concealed a “risk” that underlying comorbidities or frailty would be seen as “negative indicators” for an intensive care patient’s chances of recovery.In its judgment, the court said that in pandemic-related triage doctors “find themselves in an extreme situation where they need to make a decision — they must decide who receives scarce intensive care treatment and who doesn’t”.“In such a situation it can be particularly challenging to take account of disabled people and not to discriminate against them,” it added. For that reason, authorities must ensure that any decision on whether or not to treat a patient “is only based on [their] current, near-term chances of survival”.
50  For Gazprom shareholders, Christmas came early this year. Cold weather throughout Europe meant heating demand rose more than in previous years. Russia’s state-owned energy group benefited from soaring natural gas prices — its most important export market and responsible for roughly half of its sales. Yet despite persistently high export prices, Gazprom’s shares are growing cheaper. This suggests investors do not believe natural gas prices can rise much higher.Executives at Gazprom likely feel unappreciated. Although Russia provides Europe with 41 per cent of its imported natural gas, the EU’s determination to move away from fossil fuels means that its product is labelled as toxic. Political spats with both the US and EU aimed at blocking the use of its latest export pipeline Nord Stream 2 have rubbed salt in the wound. Its product is simultaneously needed and derided. Yet while Gazprom has sought out new markets, including China, Europe remains a key source of hard currency.The bias has helped the company this winter. European natural gas prices jumped as a result of limited storage and surprisingly cold weather. In the UK, a decent proxy for European prices, the near term gas price exceeded $40 per million British thermal units during October.Yet Gazprom has continued to face problems, accused of holding back exports to European customers such as Germany and Italy - accusations it denies.To be fair to the company, it had domestic responsibilities to meet. During October, when European tensions over energy prices peaked, the gas producer was filling up its domestic storage. It could not pipe more gas into Europe. This is a typical scenario at that time of year.Strong third-quarter results released in late November gave a taste of the profits it made from this situation. Nine-month earnings of Rbs1.55tn ($20.9bn) top those made in any calendar year in the company’s history. European gas prices have remained buoyant in the last period of the year too, suggesting that Gazprom’s profits should climb further. Given its policy of paying out half of profits to investors, next year’s dividend yield should approach 9 per cent.Yet after a 62 per cent jump in the local share price this year, Gazprom trades at a lowly 3 times this year’s estimated ebitda. It appears as if Gazprom’s festive gift-giving has already been priced into its shares.
51  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
52  About two years ago, as the Turkish lira was continuing on its long downward slide, Batikan Erdogan created a graph that made him reassess his career choices.Seeing that his earnings in the previous five years were flat in dollar terms, he decided he needed to earn in foreign currency. But, rather than join the many people he knew who had left the country in recent years to work abroad, he found a job working from Turkey for a start-up based in Seattle.“I didn’t want to leave my family, my friends, just to move to a different country for work purposes,” he said, adding that the purchasing power of his dollar-denominated salary was also greater in Istanbul. “Earning in dollars and spending in liras is more appealing to me compared to living in Berlin and spending in euros.” The 31-year-old, who now works remotely for another US start-up, is part of a virtual brain drain in Turkey’s tech and computing sectors that has been accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic and compounded by Turkey’s economic woes. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a life-long opponent of high interest rates, ordered the central bank to repeatedly lower the cost of borrowing despite soaring inflation.As global companies and their employees have adapted to the pandemic, remote working has offered exciting opportunities for outward-looking young people — but is causing problems for Turkish businesses.Gizem Oztok Altinsac, chief economist at the Turkish business association Tusiad, said that the corporate world was “very unhappy” about it. “It’s good for young people who have huge unemployment in our country, but it’s very bad for the real sector, which needs qualified young people and cannot pay their salaries.”The phenomenon is part of a broader global trend as the pandemic has encouraged companies, especially those in the tech sector, to look beyond their immediate surroundings for new hires.“Covid has completely changed the way engineering teams are constructed,” said Vivek Ravisankar, of the Silicon Valley-based hiring platform HackerRank. “Companies have had a taste of what it means to get talent from more than a 15-mile radius and they’re not going back.”That has profound consequences for the salaries that businesses must offer. While remuneration in the past tended to be highly variable according to location, Ravisankar said that regional and global differences in pay were beginning to narrow. “I wouldn’t be surprised, the way it’s going, if [in future] there are quite close salary ranges across the world,” he said.Opposition parties say that Turkey has already suffered an exodus of talent over the past 10 years as the country has become more authoritarian under the leadership of Erdogan, as well as suffering political and economic turmoil.In a survey of young people aged 18-29 last year by the polling agency MAK and Yeditepe University, 64 per cent of respondents said they would like to leave Turkey to permanently live abroad. A majority cited the desire for a “better future” as their motivation.The Turkish lira has lost more than 80 per cent of its value against the dollar since the start of 2015, eroding the purchasing power of those earning in the local currency.Gonul Kamali, president of the Turkish Software Industrialists Association (YASAD), which represents the software sector, said that an international company might pay €5,000 or €6,000 a month to hire an eastern European software engineer — or €2,500 for a Turkish one. That compares with an average salary of about TL15,000 (around €1,180) a month for a developer with four to nine years’ experience working at a Turkish company. “It’s [a] hugely cost-effective situation for the international companies,” she said.“Software developers are winning at the end of the day, so I’m proud,” added Kamali. “But Turkish companies are suffering.”Business executives and industry representatives said Turkey’s biggest and most exciting start-ups — such as the delivery service Getir and the ecommerce platform Trendyol — are still able to hire and retain top talent. But others, including some of Turkey’s old industrial giants, have had a much harder time recruiting people with the skills that they need.Turkey’s former finance minister, Berat Albayrak, launched an initiative last year aimed at encouraging 1m young people to take up coding by offering free online courses.Mustafa Ergen, a vice-president of the opposition Deva party, said that such initiatives were welcome but argued that a much broader overhaul was needed to expand education in schools and universities and to support the country’s growing tech sector.Ergen, who also teaches entrepreneurship and has his own start-up, said that Turkey’s youthful demographics meant there was huge potential to train an army of young computer programmers and web developers. But he warned: “We should have done this 10 years ago. Every year we fail to take action, the window of opportunity is closing since our population is ageing.”Turkey’s soaring inflation means that Erdogan, the tech worker, insists that he is not “getting rich” despite his foreign currency salary. “I am keeping my purchasing power at the same level.”There are downsides to working from home, such as struggling to switch off at times. But he is happy at his company, a New York-based productivity start-up called KosmoTime, where he has worked since May as a product manager. As well as an attractive salary, it offers benefits such as trips to visit colleagues around the world.Thanks to his job, Erdogan and his fiancée hope to move from their apartment in the heart of Istanbul to the outskirts of the city so that they can have a garden for their dog, Maya. He struggles to imagine returning to work for a Turkish company. KosmoTime “earned my loyalty”, he said.
53  The eurozone’s economic recovery risks being undermined if persistently high inflation erodes consumers’ disposable income and forces the European Central Bank to withdraw its stimulus more quickly than planned, according to a Financial Times poll of economists.More than 40 per cent of the 38 economists surveyed by the FT identified inflation as a significant risk to the growth prospects of the 19 countries that share the single currency — making it the most-cited risk factor for 2022 along with the pandemic.“Inflation will eat into wages, reducing demand,” said Jesper Rangvid, finance professor at Copenhagen Business School, adding that the “ECB might also have to respond to inflation risks by raising rates, taming the [economic] upswing”.The ECB responded to mounting concern about rapidly rising prices earlier this month by announcing its €1.85tn pandemic-response scheme would stop net bond purchases in March as part of a “step-by-step” reduction of its quantitative easing policy.Inflation has risen sharply this year as the eurozone economy rebounded from the shock of the pandemic, activity restrictions were lifted and supply struggled to keep pace with demand, driving up energy costs and creating shortages of many materials. The bloc’s consumer price growth reached a record high of 4.9 per cent in November.Like most central banks, the ECB has been surprised by the persistence of upward pressure on prices. This month it sharply raised its forecast for eurozone inflation to 2.6 per cent for 2021 and 3.2 per cent for 2022 — both above its 2 per cent target.“Our economic outlook stands and falls with the inflation outlook,” said Katharina Utermöhl, senior economist for Europe at Allianz. “Should we see runaway inflation that looks set to remain above target also beyond 2022, then the ECB will have to rein in its policy stance much more abruptly than currently envisioned which could weigh on the real economy as well as fuel financial stability concerns.”The economists — who were polled by the FT before the ECB updated its forecasts this month — on average predicted that eurozone inflation would be 2.7 per cent in 2022 and 1.9 per cent in 2023. Their forecast was below that of the ECB for next year but it was above the central bank’s prediction that inflation would dip to 1.8 per cent in 2023.“The energy price surge represents a major risk,” said Fabio Balboni, senior eurozone economist at HSBC. “[By] eating into households’ purchasing power, we have estimated it could take off 0.5 percentage points from the level of GDP over the next few quarters” which would “put the ECB in a difficult place”.Producer prices rose 21.9 per cent in the year to October, the fastest pace since the euro was created more than two decades ago. This was mainly driven by a 62.5 per cent rise in energy prices, but even excluding that industrial goods prices still rose 8.9 per cent.“Runaway inflation is a more significant risk [than the pandemic],” said Nicholas Bennenbroek, international economist at Wells Fargo. “Previous waves of the Covid-19 virus have typically had short-term negative effects on growth, but have not been long lasting, a pattern we expect to continue.” However almost half of economists surveyed thought there was still a significant economic risk from coronavirus variants.The economists on average forecast the eurozone economy would grow 4 per cent next year, slightly below the 4.2 per cent forecast by the ECB.André Sapir, a professor at the Université libre de Bruxelles, said the biggest challenge for the bloc was “finding the right balance for macro policy, both fiscal and monetary, to allow for a continued recovery without uncontrolled fiscal positions and runaway inflation”.
54  Turkey’s banking regulator has filed a criminal complaint against more than 20 people, including former central bank governors, journalists and an economist, over alleged attempts to manipulate the country’s exchange rate in a move that could chill criticism of the government’s unorthodox economic policies.The Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency said on Twitter on Monday it was seeking legal action against 26 people and Twitter accounts over “their posts on social media and [through] media outlets”, amid a currency crisis that has slashed 35 per cent from the value of the lira this year.Among those accused are Durmus Yilmaz, who led the central bank between 2006 and 2011 and is now an opposition lawmaker. Rusdu Saracoglu, another former central bank governor, is also on the list posted by the banking watchdog.The regulator said its complaint was based on an article in the banking law which prohibits making statements in the media that could discredit or damage a bank’s reputation.The Turkish government frequently uses the courts to silence its critics and has launched criminal suits against journalists and social media users for their statements during previous bouts of volatility in financial markets.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has argued that a weaker lira will boost exports and economic growth and has ordered the central bank to cut interest rates despite official inflation rates above 20 per cent. He argues that high interest rates fuels inflation, contrary to mainstream economic theory.Erdogan was forced to introduce emergency measures on December 20 as the lira tumbled to a record low of 18.4 to the dollar, down 60 per cent over the year. The rescue plan, which includes state guarantees to compensate savers against the currency’s devaluation, has helped the lira recover to 11.5 against the dollar.A sharp decline in the central bank’s foreign currency reserves at the start of last week suggested that state institutions had bought billions of lira to shore up the currency. Turkey’s net foreign assets fell by $5.9bn in the first two days of last week, according to Financial Times calculations based on central bank data.The finance minister, Nureddin Nebati, said in a television interview on Monday that there had been no such interventions on December 20 and that the lira had recovered most of its losses after Turks “raced to sell their dollars” following Erdogan’s promise to protect lira deposits.Guldem Atabay, an economist who writes for the website Para Analiz and who was named by the central bank, said she had not yet been formally notified of the complaint but suspected the move related to concerns she had expressed over potential risks in the new deposit instrument. “The complaint serves as a threat to the other economists who are also drawing attention to the government’s policy mistakes,” she said. “I will continue to try to inform people about what I see, which is based on the math and science.”
55  France will require homeworking for all eligible employees for at least three days a week and ban large indoor gatherings of more than 2,000 people as it seeks to curb a new wave of Covid-19 driven largely by the highly transmissible Omicron variant.Jean Castex, the prime minister, also promised that a law to make vaccination all-but compulsory would take effect by mid-January by accelerating an earlier timetable to convert the “health pass” used for access to bars, restaurants and other public places into a “vaccine pass”. If the law is passed by parliament then people would no longer be allowed entry to such places with only a negative Covid-19 test.But the government stopped short of imposing other strict new measures such as a curfew or delaying the return to school after the Christmas holidays, ignoring calls from some public health experts in recent days that bolder action was needed.“We are in a race against the clock,” Castex said at a press conference, adding that the government’s strategy was to impose “proportionate” responses as the epidemic evolved.“Even if we do not yet see hospitals as overloaded by Omicron, the contagiousness of the variant and the speed at which it is spreading require us to go further,” he said.Countries across Europe have been reimposing restrictions on life and business in recent weeks as they battle a wave of Covid-19 infections. The region now accounts for a third of cases and a third of deaths globally, according to the World Health Organization.France logged almost 105,000 new infections on December 25, the highest level since the pandemic began, which took its incidence rate to 712, a third higher than only a week ago. Some of that was down to much higher testing levels as people took precautions before holiday gatherings but the spread is also likely being driven by the more transmissible Omicron variant that experts estimate already accounts for the majority of infections in Paris.President Emmanuel Macron’s government has so far preferred not to impose broad curbs on businesses that would damage the economic recovery. Instead it has advocated the faster rollout of booster vaccines and taken smaller steps such as making homeworking required as opposed to simply recommended, as it was before.Castex said the new homeworking rule would be discussed with unions and employers’ organisations on Tuesday, and would last at least three weeks. It has been estimated that roughly four out of 10 French jobs can be performed remotely.Other measures he announced included a rule that bans consumption of food and drinks on long-distance transport and in cinemas and theatres to prevent people from removing their masks. Bars and restaurants will be required to provide only table service.Some said the government had not gone far enough. “The health system has lost out in the arbitrage with the economy today,” said Jean-Paul Stahl, an infectious disease specialist at a Grenoble hospital, on BFM TV.Whether further new policies will be needed in the coming weeks will depend on whether French hospitals can cope with higher admissions over Christmas and afterwards. Its hospitals have been under pressure from staff shortages and absenteeism even before the full impact of Omicron. Deaths reached 1,050 in the past week — a level not seen since last April — to take the overall death toll to more than 122,500.
56  Polish president Andrzej Duda has vetoed a bill on media ownership that would have forced US conglomerate Discovery to sell its majority stake in Poland’s biggest independent broadcaster, TVN.The bill, put forward by MPs from the conservative-nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS), drew fierce criticism at home and abroad, with the US — Poland’s main security guarantor — warning that it posed a threat to media freedom and the investment climate.Duda, an ally of PiS, had previously expressed reservations about the bill, which would have prevented companies from outside the European Economic Area owning controlling stakes in Polish media groups.In an address broadcast on Monday, Duda said he had decided to use his veto, warning that the bill could breach a deal on trade relations that Poland had signed with the US.“The majority of my countrymen. don’t want more fights. And my job as president is to act in such a way as to avoid these fights,” he said. “If we signed a deal — and we did sign a deal — we have to keep it. If we don’t keep our deals with others, others won’t keep their deals with us.”Duda also said he was concerned by the bill’s implications for media pluralism.Discovery hailed Duda’s decision as a “victory for the Polish people”.“We commend the president for doing the right thing and standing up for core democratic values of a free press and the rule of law, and we want to thank all the viewers and everyone that has supported this important issue,” the company said in a statement.Bix Aliu, the US chargé d’affaires in Warsaw, also welcomed the move, and thanked Duda for “protecting the investment climate in Poland”. “Allies are stronger together,” he wrote on Twitter.PiS MPs had argued that the bill was necessary to prevent companies from undemocratic states from taking control of Polish media, with the party’s leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, at one point claiming Poland needed to protect itself from the entry of money launderers and “narco-businesses”.The bill came against a backdrop of broader pressure on the independent media since PiS took office in 2015, and was widely seen as an attack on TVN, which provides critical coverage of the government. This year Poland’s media watchdog delayed the renewal of the broadcasting licence of TVN’s main news channel, TVN24, until just four days before it was due to expire, even though the application had been submitted 19 months earlier.Duda said he generally supported the idea of limits on foreign ownership of Polish media groups, pointing out that other countries had such restrictions, and called on Poland’s parliament to consider such legislation. But he said that this should apply to future investments, not those already in existence.He noted that TVN had been granted a licence to operate in Poland, and was “carrying out its economic activity. in an entirely legal manner and one approved by the Polish state”, and questioned whether the six-month deadline that the law would have set for the company to sell its controlling stake would have allowed it to receive a fair price.
57  Lars Müller wants to create the Starbucks of cannabis: a chain of dispensaries offering the full array of marijuana-related products, from tinctures to flowers and edible gummies.“We want to build up a chain with an identical level of quality across Germany, something that exudes the professionalism of an Apple Store,” he said. “This is not going to be an opium den.”Müller is chief executive of Synbiotic, a leading player in Germany’s burgeoning cannabinoid sector that invests in everything from growers to researchers and distributors. It is an industry experiencing a high of epic proportions.The trigger was an announcement late last month from the three parties in Germany’s new coalition government that they planned to legalise cannabis. Synbiotic’s share price doubled on the news.So far, the government’s exact intentions remain hazy: it says only that it would allow the “controlled sale of cannabis to adults for recreational purposes in licensed shops”. There have been no more details, and no timetable for legislative action.But the plan could still turn out to be a game-changing precedent for the global business of growing and selling marijuana, one that will be closely watched by other countries toying with liberalising their drug laws.“In terms of population, Germany would become the largest country in the world to allow the sale of cannabis,” said Constantin von der Groeben, managing director of Demecan, a local grower. “It’s a huge opportunity for us.”If the plan goes through, Germany would join a highly select group of countries that permit the commercial sale of recreational cannabis — the only others are Canada and Uruguay, along with a handful of US states. For most big nations it is still uncharted territory.But for the German coalition partners — the left-of-centre SPD, the libertarian FDP and the unconventional Greens — legalisation was a no-brainer, one of the few causes they could easily agree on.Fiscal arguments also played a role. Decriminalisation could deliver a net benefit to the state of €4.7bn a year, including €2.8bn in tax revenues and €1.36bn in savings on police and legal costs, according to a recent study by Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf.Unsurprisingly, the coalition’s announcement triggered a wave of interest in the sector. Stefan Langer, founder of Bavaria Weed, a small producer, was featured in Bild Zeitung this month sporting a crown of hemp leaves and bulging bags of buds, under the headline: “I want to be Germany’s cannabis king”. Yet sceptics urge caution and point to Canada, where the wave of excitement unleashed by legalisation in 2018 quickly ebbed. Although 73 cannabis companies went public there from 2016-2019, the early enthusiasm faded when growth underperformed expectations.“There was just this financial hype and.too much material came on to the market,” said Müller. “Most companies are still not earning any money.”The situation in the US also played a role. “There were big expectations that [President Joe] Biden would legalise cannabis on the federal level and the fact that he hasn’t disappointed a lot of people,” said Kyle Detwiler, chief executive of Clever Leaves Holding, a Colombia-based producer. “It had a huge impact.”A Canada-style boom and bust is unlikely in Germany, however, where barriers to entry remain prohibitively high. Companies have this year been able to grow medical cannabis in Germany, where doctors have been free to prescribe it in various forms since 2017. So far, though, only three companies have a licence to cultivate: Demecan, and the German subsidiaries of Aphria and Aurora, both of Canada.All three must adhere to “good manufacturing practice”, an internationally agreed standard for pharmaceutical products. Some think it is inappropriate for recreational weed.“The GMP standard is completely excessive,” Müller said. “We need a wholly new standard that’s somewhere between food and pharma quality.” He suggested it could be modelled on Germany’s 500-year-old purity law that dictates which ingredients can be used to make beer.Demecan’s von der Groeben, in contrast, views GMP as an essential badge of quality. “We have to earn people’s trust, and we can’t gamble away that by lowering standards,” he said. “The fact cannabis makes you high means you have to make sure it’s of the highest possible quality, with no contaminants.” On the other hand, he added, some of the rules contained in Germany’s ultra-strict “narcotics handling guidelines” may have to be relaxed post-legalisation.The rules, for instance, mean that cannabis facilities in Germany tend to resemble Fort Knox, with product stored in the equivalent of high-security bank vaults. Demecan’s 5,000 square-meter facility, housed in a former abattoir near Dresden, is encased in reinforced concrete walls and ceilings and surrounded by CCTV cameras and state of the art alarm systems.“Video surveillance and burglar alarms are important, but the kinds of bunker-like systems we currently have may not be necessary,” said von der Groeben.Yet experts think caution will be the Germans’ watchword, certainly in the industry’s early phase. Berlin will be at pains to avoid incidents such as the outbreak of “vaping-associated pulmonary injury” in the US in 2019 that was associated with the use of black market vaping products.“What would happen if a gummy that’s supposed to contain 5mg of THC actually turned out to have 100mg?” said Detwiler, referring to the component of cannabis that makes users high. “What would happen to the kids who took them?”“If I were the German government I would start slow,” he continued. “I think they’re going to be very careful about this.”
58  As residents of Mainz gathered in late November for their first festive glass of mulled wine in Schillerplatz, the medieval heart of the German city, officials in the nearby City Hall realised they had even more cause for Christmas cheer.The former Roman stronghold on the banks of the Rhine had become the beneficiary of a billion-euro tax windfall, largely thanks to BioNTech, the Covid-19 vaccine developer founded in the city in 2008.“During the pandemic, Mainz became the world’s pharmacy,” said mayor Michael Ebling, who pledged to use the funds flowing from BioNTech’s pivotal role in fighting coronavirus to clear the city’s debts.Corporation taxes — some of which can be set by local German authorities — will also be cut in a bid to attract more biotechnology businesses.More than 2bn doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine have been delivered to date, and BioNTech is on track to post more than €10bn in net profit for 2021. For the nine months to the end of September, the company, which has sites in the US and other German cities such as Marburg, paid more than €3bn in taxes.Officials would not publicly confirm how much tax BioNTech paid to Mainz in the past few months. But the company, unknown even to many of the city’s 220,000 inhabitants before the pandemic, has almost single-handedly lifted Mainz’s corporation tax haul from €173m for 2020 to more than €1bn in 2021, according to several people with knowledge of the matter.Having achieved global fame for Gutenberg’s 15th-century printing press, Mainz has long since been the poor relation to neighbouring Frankfurt, Germany’s financial centre. But unlike Sindelfingen, a south-west German city that is home to a Mercedes-Benz plant and which used recent tax windfalls to install marble zebra crossings, Mainz is not going on a spending spree.“Our highest priority is to clear our cash debt [short-term loans] of €634m by the end of 2022,” finance director Günter Beck told the Financial Times. “There is a broad political consensus for this move because until the debt is paid, we have no freedom to decide on discretionary spending.”Indebted German cities in receipt of these loans can only spend money on “unavoidable” projects.The state of Rhineland-Palatinate, of which Mainz is the capital, had the highest per capita level of short-term debt in 2020, according to figures from the Bundesbank. The city itself has been enrolled in a debt relief programme for almost a decade.Now, Mainz will have a surplus of almost €1.1bn in 2021, and authorities expect a further surplus of more than €490m next year.Once its short-term debts are paid, Ebling, of the Social Democrats, aims to leverage the city’s good fortune to reduce its reliance on a single company.“We will now use our positive financial position and budget surpluses to establish a global science and biotechnology hub,” he said, promising to accelerate the transformation of a 12-hectare former barracks near BioNTech’s headquarters into a business and cultural centre. About 5,000 jobs would be created in the process, the mayor added.There should be no shortage of tenants. Thanks to BioNTech, companies from across Germany and beyond have inquired about a move to the city, according to officials.“Suddenly, we are well known in Singapore,” said Günter Jertz, chief executive of the chamber of commerce for the Rheinhessen region, which includes Mainz. For a city that used to make headlines only for its annual carnival, BioNTech’s scientific and commercial success, he added, “is priceless advertising”.Mainz is also rolling out the red carpet. Flush with cash, the city will next year lower its corporation tax by almost a third, a measure that will save companies more than €350m in 2022, according to the mayor.The reduced rate brings Mainz in line with nearby Ingelheim — home to Germany’s second-largest pharmaceutical company, Boehringer Ingelheim — and makes the city a far cheaper place to do business than neighbouring Wiesbaden or Frankfurt, both in Hesse state.The decision was taken “because we want to give something back to those who keep the economy going in Mainz”, said Beck.Did he mean BioNTech, and did the vaccine developer demand a lower rate? “No,” Beck insisted, “naturally not.”Mainz’s commercial centre, where occupancy rates have plummeted during the pandemic, needs more investment. The city is also short of housing and kindergarten places.But few have criticised City Hall’s priorities. “It’s so important that we invest in the development of the business and biotech location,” said Peter Hähner, a banker and president of the Rheinhessen chambers of commerce. “The cycle paths [can] come after that.”What is more, he said, there “could be a risk if we don’t support BioNTech, that they.go elsewhere”.There are no signs that the company, which was spun out of Johannes Gutenberg University, where founders Ugur Sahin and Ozlem Tureci were conducting cancer research, will leave the city.Last month, the company announced it would spend more than €1bn on expanding its headquarters, situated on “At the Goldmine,” a road named after a Roman archaeological find. It would also build 10 sites across Mainz and employ thousands more in the coming years, Sahin said.Several companies in the region have also benefited from Covid vaccine sales, including Germany’s Merck, which is producing lipid nanoparticles for BioNTech/Pfizer, and suppliers such as vial maker Schott.Beck, who represents the Green party, is confident such companies and newer arrivals will keep Mainz in the money. Even if that is at the expense of other, higher-taxing cities.“There was an article [in the newspaper] saying that Wiesbaden is jealous, and that Mainz is not showing solidarity,” he said. “Well, Wiesbaden has been rich for decades and Mainz was poor. There was no solidarity from Wiesbaden to Mainz either.”
59  Germany’s premium car manufacturers enjoyed record high prices for their luxury models in 2021 as a shortage of semiconductors restricted the supply of vehicles to major markets just as consumer demand was soaring.Revenues per car at BMW, Audi and Mercedes-Benz increased by an average of almost 25 per cent when compared to pre-pandemic 2019, analysis carried out by Stifel bank for the Financial Times has shown.The increase has been caused by a reversal of a decades-long trend, in which the industry produced more cars than it sold. Carmakers then offered ever higher discounts to push excess cars on to forecourts, so that sales volume targets could be reached in time for accounting deadlines.Since 2019, when the global economy weakened, manufacturers have begun to make fewer cars than they can sell, with the gap widening to roughly 4m vehicles this year. Although there was a similar deficit following the financial crisis in 2009, it was an anomaly amid years of overcapacity.“We’ve seen an inventory reduction for three years, driven by [restricted] supply,” said Daniel Schwarz, an analyst at Stifel. “That has not happened before.”As a result, revenues at Mercedes-Benz have risen from almost €38,000 per car in 2019 to more than €54,000 in 2021 up to the end of the third quarter, while Audi’s has increased from more than €46,000 to approximately €57,500, according to Stifel’s calculations.BMW, which has managed the chips crisis better than its peers, and lost less production time overall, experienced a more modest rise, from just over €36,000 per vehicle in 2019 to more than €38,000 in 2021 up to the end of the third quarter.Much of this has been achieved by manufacturers prioritising the production of more profitable models.Sales at Mercedes, for example, were down 30 per cent in the three months to the end of September, but revenues were down just 1 per cent.Analysis by Stifel shows that in just one quarter, Mercedes’ earnings before interest and taxes were boosted by €1.4bn merely by better pricing and by putting available chips into higher-end, higher-margin vehicles.With investors noticing the change, executives say they will continue to pursue this strategy even when supply constraints ease.“There is no pressure to chase volume,” Ola Kallenius, Mercedes boss, told the Financial Times this month, while Harald Wilhelm, chief financial officer, pledged to “focus on where the money sits”.“This overriding strategy of not looking downwards in [market] segments where we are but looking upwards, that will continue,” Kallenius added.Luxury carmakers were also helped by record rises in second-hand car prices. This has not only made buying new cars more attractive, but has boosted the balance sheets of the premium manufacturers’ finance arms, which run large leasing businesses.“The cars are being returned [to the manufacturer] after 12-36 months and the re-sale price is much higher than initially assumed,” said Schwarz.“From a short-term perspective, the lack of new cars today will make used cars scarce for at least the next two years,” he added. “That should support the pricing for new cars, too.”
60  By day the snow-clad hills around the Italian town of Claviere on the French border are a playground for skiers. By night they become a perilous Alpine passage for growing numbers of clandestine migrants trying to reach France through the Montgenèvre pass.“Mountains, in the snow, in rain, sun.no matter. We don’t have any choice,” said Maryam Bodaghi, a 23-year-old civil engineer from Iran, who was attempting the journey through the Alps with her husband Milad Zanghi, a Christian who Bodaghi said faced persecution at home. “We had to leave because the government is harsh for us. They want to kill my husband.” Like many of the migrants using this route, she and her husband are headed for Calais because they intend to cross the Channel and reach the UK. But first they must cross the French border. This means walking for about 15km through knee-high snow as temperatures drop to minus 10C, while hiding from the French police and watching out for avalanches. Accidents have led to amputations from severe frostbite or death by hypothermia, according to NGOs.Many migrants return cold and exhausted to the Fraternità Massi refuge in the nearby Italian town of Oulx. “I could die up there. I had snow up to my hips,” said a Moroccan man in his thirties. He was caught and turned back by the French police after walking for three hours. It was his first attempt. Most make it on their second or third try.The Montgenèvre pass is becoming a key route into France for migrants travelling on to Germany, the most common destination, or the UK. At first it was used mainly by west African men, but since spring last year it has been used more frequently by Afghans and Iranians escaping economic hardship and persecution. They have often travelled for months on foot since arriving in Europe.The Alpine crossing is just one part of an arduous journey that aid groups say often takes between two and six years. The migrants include families spanning three generations, heavily pregnant women and infants.“Recently, we had two pregnant women crossing. One was due the day after and one was due the following month,” said Sylvain Eymard, who manages Les Terasses Solidaires, a centre which hosts a migrant refuge and other NGOs in Briançon, the nearest town on the French side of the border.The centre estimates that nearly 5,500 people arrived between January and September — up by around 30 per cent from the previous record for the same nine-month period in 2018.France has increased policing in the area, sending two extra squadrons including about 220 paramilitary officers to protect the border. The growing stream of migrants is an issue for the government, which is already facing pressure from the UK to curb cross-Channel attempts after 27 people died when a boat capsized in November.President Emmanuel Macron, who hopes to secure a second term in April elections, is also trying to convince voters swayed by far-right candidates Marine Le Pen and Eric Zemmour that he can be trusted to control what many see as uncontrolled mass immigration into France.On the Italian side of the Alps, French moves to limit immigration are met with scepticism. Andrea Terzolo, the mayor of Oulx, said: “I’m very scared about the next election in France. If something changes, here can really become a new Calais.” More migrants arrive every day in his town of roughly 3,000 people, which relies heavily on tourism, and Terzolo said current policies are endangering migrants rather than reducing the flows through the region. “There are policemen, gendarmes, the army everywhere, but somehow they [the migrants] pass,” he added.The sentiment was shared by Silvia Massara, a volunteer who helps run the Fraternità Massi refuge. “People without a leg, children with a disability, really elderly people. All of them manage to cross in some way,” she said. “The people who are being turned back put their lives in danger many times instead of just once.”The mountain pass has claimed five lives and two people have been reported as missing since migrants started using the route five years ago, said NGOs. The real number could well be higher. Volunteers say the increased police presence encourages migrants to take more treacherous paths to remain hidden.“It’s getting very, very dangerous. This is a huge territory. If someone is out of the recognised way, it’s very difficult to look for them,” said Michele Belmondo, co-ordinator of the Italian Red Cross in the Susa Valley. “Sometimes we look for people in the mountains.and maybe in spring we find the bodies.”Migrants who get into difficulties can call emergency services. But they rarely have Sim cards in their phones, making the calls difficult to trace. Surrounded by trees and snow, many find it hard to describe their whereabouts.The pandemic has made the journey more difficult. Covid passes are mandatory on all public transport in Italy and on longer journeys in France. They cannot leave Briançon without proof of a negative Covid test. But snowfall, public health restrictions or stricter policing does not deter them — many have crossed a dozen borders, paid thousands of euros and taken years to get this far.Sayed Ahazia Mosolli, 36, left Afghanistan eight years ago. He crossed the Montgenèvre pass in December with his six-year-old son, who he wants to give a new life in Germany.Like Mosolli, Bodaghi and Zanghi reached Italy from the Balkans and Turkey but see the UK as their only option. They had been in Europe for months before being caught by police in Slovenia, who took their fingerprints. If they apply for asylum in another EU country such as Germany, they risk being sent back to Slovenia under European rules about the country of first arrival for an asylum seeker.“We have to go to the UK with the boats like other people,” said Bodaghi.
61  A Polish opposition politician’s mobile phone was hacked with military-grade spyware while he was running an election campaign against the ruling party, according to a cyber security monitoring group.Krzysztof Brejza’s phone was broken into 33 times between April and October 2019 ahead of national parliamentary elections, using Pegasus software produced by Israel’s NSO Group, according to the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab.Messages stolen from Brejza’s phone were subsequently doctored and then broadcast on state-controlled television before the October parliamentary election, which was won by the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS), according to the Associated Press, which first reported the allegations.The news has sparked outrage from Poland’s opposition. Tomasz Grodzki, speaker of Poland’s Senate, and like Brejza a member of the largest opposition grouping, Civic Platform, said the revelations were “scandalous and unacceptable”.“I will be demanding urgent explanations from the prime minister and leadership of the security services,” he wrote on Twitter. “I will not leave Senator Brejza alone in a clash with these authoritarian and base authorities.”John Scott-Railton, one of Citizen Lab’s researchers, wrote on Twitter that the case would be a “test of whether the European Union/European Commission is capable of addressing what appears to be a profound violation of fair elections and basic democratic norms in Poland”.Brejza said in an interview with Polsat News that the alleged hacking could have had an impact on the election result. “I am not saying that PiS would not have won the election,” he said. “But certainly, the eavesdropping on [his phone] took that half or one per cent away from Civic Coalition, and influenced the fact that PiS now has a [lower house] majority.”The revelations come amid broader concerns about the rule of law in Poland, where PiS has subjugated judges to political control and reduced the public media to a claque since coming to power in 2015.This week, the Associated Press reported that Roman Giertych, a lawyer who has represented various opposition figures, and Ewa Wrzosek, a prosecutor who has been critical of PiS’s judicial reforms, had also been hacked using Pegasus. Mateusz Morawiecki, Poland’s prime minister, said on Wednesday that it was necessary to check whether those claims were “in any way consistent with reality”, adding that it was easy to create “fake news”.Stanislaw Zaryn, spokesperson for the minister co-ordinating Poland’s security services, said on Friday that “suggestions that Polish security services use operational methods for political ends are false”.He added that the security services did not comment on individual cases, but said “operational control” was used in “justified” cases and after obtaining a court order.A spokesperson for NSO Group said that it provided its software only to intelligence and law enforcement agencies following a vetting and licensing process carried out by Israel’s defence ministry, adding that NSO did not operate the technology and was not privy to the data collected.“The company does not and cannot know who the targets of its customers are, yet implements measures to ensure that these systems are used solely for the authorised uses. It is technologically impossible to alter or manipulate the collected data by anyone,” the spokesperson said, declining to comment on whether Poland’s security services were a client of NSO.
62  A proposed EU crackdown on the ability of banks outside the EU to sell services into the bloc is intended to focus on “core” banking, a senior EU official said, in words that will ease industry concerns that Brussels is pursuing more wide-ranging restrictions.Valdis Dombrovskis, EU executive vice-president, said it would be up to the bloc’s council of ministers and the European parliament to clarify the scope of the rules as they thrash out the legislation in coming months. But he stressed that the provisions contained in legislation proposed by the commission “were designed first and foremost to cover core banking services”.He added: “The provision of core banking activities is conditional on having an establishment in a member state, meaning a branch or subsidiary.it must be said that implicitly those requirements were de facto there already.”The clampdown on cross-border sales is part of the commission’s latest rules on bank capital requirements, which will give a legal basis to the global Basel III bank capital standards. Among the provisions are new powers for regulators to require banks to turn some branches into more closely supervised subsidiaries, coupled with stricter rules on what services can be sold by non-EU groups without any physical branch or subsidiary in the union.The latter provisions have sparked the most concern among banks’ lawyers and lobbyists because the framing of the draft legislative proposals by the commission appears to stop almost all cross-border selling from non-EU countries into the bloc’s single market. That might encompass investment banking and other markets activities covered by separate rules in the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, and not only mainstream banking activities such as lending and deposit taking.Brussels’ proposals are meant to strengthen a general EU requirement that banks from elsewhere should have either a branch or a legal entity in a member state where they wish to do business.The national access regimes in Ireland and Luxembourg are among the most flexible in the EU. Luxembourg typically only requires a licence if the provider of a service is physically in the country, while Ireland allows most activities on a cross-border basis as long as they do not involve retail clients.Some bankers and lobbyists think the EU inadvertently drew the provisions contained in the Basel III package too loosely, and that it has been signalling that the door is open for the language to be narrowed.The commission intended the drafting to “implicitly” exclude markets activities covered by the Mifid regulations, which permit cross-border selling, said one lobbyist. “Anything that makes it not as aggressive would.be helpful,” said a senior executive at one large international bank.“It will now be up to member states and the European parliament to take these proposals forward to clarify the scope of application,” said Dombrovskis.The banking package, he added, “brings about clarity under which third country firms may offer banking services within the EU, which will ensure there is an equal footing for all market players, and that our supervisors have the necessary tools to protect the financial stability of the union and its member states”.The new EU provisions have also attracted close scrutiny in other jurisdictions. Sam Woods, the head of the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority, recently said the UK would not engage in a “tit-for-tat” game of restricting market access for EU groups.Additional reporting by Martin Arnold in Frankfurt
63  For much of his first year in office, Joe Biden’s foreign policy has focused on the US’s increasingly rancorous competition with Beijing — so much so that critics have accused the president of allowing China to blind his team to other simmering international crises, such as Afghanistan and Iran.Vladimir Putin, however, has made sure he will not be among the ignored. By amassing tens of thousands of troops on the Ukrainian border, the Russian president has forced the White House into what experts in the region believe is a scramble to formulate a policy on the fly.“This is becoming the worst crisis in Europe since the end of the cold war,” said Andrew Lohsen, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank.For Biden, the showdown with Putin presents a particularly thorny challenge, one that pits his long-stated goal of aggressively confronting foreign autocrats — a sharp reversal, his team argues, of his predecessor’s tendency to coddle them — with the more practical aim of avoiding a war.It is not the first time Biden’s foreign policy instincts to zealously defend young democracies in the former Soviet sphere have run up against Putin’s apparent willingness to use military force to reassert Kremlin dominance in the region, forcing him to compromise his pro-democratic principles.More than a decade ago, as chair of the Senate foreign relations committee, Biden flew to Tbilisi as Russian troops were invading Georgia, vowing to never “abandon this young democracy”.A year later, as vice-president, Biden was sent back to Tbilisi by Barack Obama to inform the Georgian government that Washington would not, in fact, provide it with defensive weaponry — a change in stance that incensed then-Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili.Critics argue that Biden has now made a similar calculation since becoming president, scrapping his pro-democracy policies to engage with bad actors in the Kremlin.Rather than directly confronting Putin early in his presidency, for example, Biden held a high-profile summit with him in Geneva — months before Volodymyr Zelensky, the pro-western president of Ukraine, was granted an Oval Office visit.As the situation in Ukraine has deteriorated, the White House has expressed a willingness to discuss Russian grievances, even though some of them, such as Nato’s eastern expansion, are regarded in Washington as settled history that can never be unwound.Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Russia who worked alongside Biden in the Obama White House, said the current administration was “choosing between bad and worse outcomes” when it came to engaging with Russia.“You’re damned if you do, and you’re damned if you don’t,” McFaul said. “If you don’t talk then, you know, Putin’s looking for a pretext for war and you don’t want to be the one that gave him that, so I think it’s appropriate to engage.”For its part, the White House insists there will be severe consequences for Putin if he follows through with his sabre-rattling by invading Ukraine.On Thursday, a senior US official reiterated that the Biden administration would issue “massive sanctions” on Russia if it invaded, as well as increasing defensive aid both to Kyiv and Nato allies in central and eastern Europe.“We and our allies are prepared to impose severe damage to Russia’s economy, and bring about exactly what it says it does not want: more Nato capabilities, not less, and closer [geographically] to Russia, not further away,” the US official said.Still, the prospect of US engagement with Russia has raised alarm in Europe. Biden was forced to reassure Zelensky earlier this month of Washington’s “unwavering commitment” to Ukraine’s territorial integrity, and Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, has said many of Russia’s demands are “very obvious non-starters”.US officials were also prompted to publicly declare that they intend to include European allies in any talks on European security.Among Russia’s demands are that Nato pledge to stop admitting allies from the former Soviet Union — Ukraine and Georgia were promised membership during a 2008 Nato summit — and that the alliance seek consent from Moscow to deploy troops in former Warsaw Pact members, most of which are now in Nato.It is also demanding that the US pledge not to set up bases in any former Soviet republics or partner with their militaries, and that both Moscow and Washington keep their bombers, naval vessels and missiles out of striking distance of each other.The US has said it will engage in diplomacy with Moscow as soon as early January, but that the agenda would be broader than the proposals published by Russia.Daniel Fried, who helped lead the US response to Russia-Ukraine issues at the state department under Obama, said Moscow’s proposals were “not serious negotiating documents”, but said it was still worth engaging with the Kremlin.Fried added: “The question is: ‘are they an ultimatum and a prelude to war, or are they designed to intimidate us into giving what Russia would otherwise have to fight a war to win?’ I don’t know the answer. But the fact that I’m asking this question is nasty.”
64  France, 13 European countries and Canada denounced “the deployment of mercenary troops” linked to Russia in the west African country of Mali as the government there battles Islamist militants who have killed thousands and displaced millions across the Sahel.In a joint statement issued on Thursday, the countries also called on Russia to “revert to a responsible and constructive behaviour in the region”.The security situation has deteriorated in Mali since June when France announced the drawdown of its forces there after a seven-year campaign known as Operation Barkhane failed to eradicate the jihadi threat in the Sahel region.French president Emmanuel Macron justified the decision by saying that France’s military, which has suffered 53 deaths in the region, can no longer compensate for the “non-work” of the Malian state. There have also been two coups d’état in the capital Bamako in less than a year, which has further strained relations between France and Mali, its former colony.Malian government officials have criticised the French for a strategy they say has worsened the conflict and for their decision to halve their 5,000-strong military presence.After the French troop drawdown, Bamako began negotiations to hire mercenaries from the Kremlin-linked private security Wagner Group, which is under US and EU sanctions.Wagner is not a legal entity but a group of connected companies reportedly linked to Evgeny Prigozhin, the Russian businessman known as “Putin’s chef”. Its fighters have been accused of war crimes and human rights violations in Libya and the Central African Republic.In a written response, Concord, Prigozhin’s group, cited the businessman as saying that he has nothing to do with any paramilitary group.He added that “there is no evidence of the presence of any Russian armed formations in Mali, and there is no trace of Russian citizens other than those who bring humanitarian aid and engage in military and technical cooperation”.With regards the CAR, Prigozhin said he had never visited the country, but that Russian instructors there had dramatically turned round the situation, and said that UN reports of misconduct by instructors were fake.In the statement, he called on European leaders to “take off your expensive suits, go to Mali or CAR and live there for a week. If you survive, you have the right to discuss the fate of those countries.”France and the other countries said they “deeply regret the choice of the Malian transitional authorities to use scarce public funds to pay foreign mercenaries instead of supporting the Malian Armed Forces and public services to the benefit of the Malian people”.France’s Operation Barkhane began in 2013 with the aim of ejecting al-Qaeda allies from the Malian city of Timbuktu. But the conflict has since broadened across several countries such as Niger and Chad as multiple armed groups loosely affiliated with al-Qaeda and Isis have mounted attacks on civilian and military targets.After meeting his Malian counterpart in Moscow last month, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said the Kremlin had no connection to the mercenary deal but that Mali was within its rights to hire Russian fighters. “If they sign agreements with the lawful governments of sovereign states, I don’t see anything negative in this,” he said.The statement was issued by France, UK, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania and Sweden.
65  Brussels’ top trade official has urged caution over EU plans to ban products made using forced labour, arguing that such a “sensitive” measure could risk a trade backlash.Valdis Dombrovskis, EU executive vice-president for trade, has written to MEPs warning that the European Commission will not rush into proposing a law on forced labour. He said it would require more than a year to produce and questioned whether a ban on products entering the EU market is an effective way to stop human rights abuses.“Banning imports from entering the EU would not automatically prevent those products from being produced with forced labour so the problem itself will not go away,” Dombrovskis said in a letter to a group of MEPs on December 22.Commission president Ursula von der Leyen announced plans in September for a law that would place a “ban on products in our market that have been made by forced labour”. The measure was read as being squarely aimed at addressing the issue of China’s persecuted Uyghur minority.But Dombrovskis’ comments signal that Brussels is stepping away from explicit import bans, for fear they will be seen as discriminatory trade measures. An EU official said a ban would require the bloc to drastically amend its customs code and would be difficult to enforce in a bloc where all 27 member states have their own customs authorities.By contrast, US lawmakers this month passed a Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act that will require companies to prove that imports from China’s Muslim-majority Xinjiang region are not made using forced labour.In his letter, Dombrovskis said the US measure “cannot be automatically replicated in the EU” and warned that a ban on non-EU imports “could be challenged by our trading partners as it risks being perceived as discriminatory” if it does not also target forced labour inside the EU.“If a ban has to be pursued, it should be a ban of all goods produced with forced labour, no matter where the forced labour took place,” says the letter.Rather than import bans, Brussels is drawing up sweeping “due diligence” legislation that will force companies to take action against potential abuses of human rights in their supply chains.This so-called corporate sustainable governance legislation is due in the first half of next year, and was an “effective way of addressing human rights violations in value chains, including forced labour”, said Dombrovskis. He also did not rule out the possibility of forcing companies to withdraw products from the market under the legislation.Supporters of a tough law on forced labour want the EU to take a stronger stance against China’s internment of more than 1m Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in labour camps in the cotton-rich region of Xinjiang. The EU, along with the US and UK, has imposed sanctions on some Chinese officials but an import ban would be the bloc’s toughest measure yet.Brussels has begun to introduce limited import bans, including on products from areas at risk of deforestation, and a law on batteries that forces companies to assess human rights risks in their supply chains.
66  Spain’s leftwing government has reached a deal with employers and trade unions on labour reforms, ending months of tough negotiations and meeting the end-of-year deadline set by Brussels for it to receive the next tranche of EU funds.“We have met our commitment to agree in 2021 on new labour legislation that restores workers’ rights,” Yolanda Díaz, Spain’s communist employment minister, said on Twitter. “This is the beginning of the end of labour market anomalies involving temporary and precarious work.”The European Commission had set Madrid a deadline of December 31 for reaching an agreement on the reforms as a condition for Spain to access €70bn of grants under the bloc’s coronavirus recovery plan. The next instalment of €14bn is due in the first quarter of 2022.The agreement, reached after months of tough negotiations, covers collective bargaining, temporary contracts, subcontracting and retraining schemes.A key provision of the pact that set up Spain’s leftwing coalition government last year was to scrap labour reforms passed in 2012 by the then conservative government. Under the 2012 reforms, severance pay had been cut and trade union negotiating powers had been limited.The government has argued that those changes are unfair to workers, especially considering Spain’s high level of unemployment. Spain has a jobless rate of more than 14 per cent and a quarter of employees are on temporary contracts.Under the new agreement, companies will maintain the right to flexible working hours, but wages will be set by sectoral, not business-wide, agreements, restoring bargaining power to trade unions.The CEOE, Spain’s main employers’ organisation, said the agreement “consolidates the current legislation that has enabled companies to increase their productivity and competitiveness”. It said the deal maintained the regulatory flexibility that allowed them to adapt to changing conditions.Critics of the new reforms had argued the 2012 legislation had helped Spain exit the deep recession that followed the European financial crisis.Under the new legislation, the improper use of temporary contracts will be penalised with fines and social security penalties. A furlough scheme introduced to soften the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on workers is also to be made permanent.“This is the first labour reform made since Spain became a democracy that restores workers’ rights,” said Mariano Hoya, deputy secretary-general of the UGT trade union confederation.
67  Vladimir Putin said the US and Russia would meet in January in Geneva for talks over Ukraine, which he said were essential to protect Moscow from what he claimed were existential threats from Nato.Speaking at his annual press conference in Moscow on Thursday, Russia’s president welcomed a “positive reaction” from the US to two sets of draft proposals on European security that Moscow published last week, which he said the sides would discuss at bilateral talks early next year.“Our American partners are telling us they’re ready to start this discussion, these negotiations,” Putin said. “Representatives from both sides have been appointed. I hope that this is the way the situation will play out.”He added: “The ball’s in their court. They need to tell us something in response.”The proposals include a request that Nato pledge to stop admitting any members from the former Soviet Union — chiefly Ukraine — and that it curb military deployments. The US has said several of these proposals are non-negotiable but that it is open to discussing other demands made by the Kremlin as it seeks ways to deter Russia from military action.Putin’s comments marked an openness to resorting to diplomacy first, in a slight softening from earlier this week when he threatened to use Russia’s military if his security demands were not met. But the Russian leader also made it clear he viewed Ukraine as an existential, unfinished issue dating back to the USSR’s collapse in 1991, claiming that parts of its neighbour were Moscow’s “historical territories”.The US has warned allies in Europe that Moscow has been massing about 100,000 troops near Ukraine’s border with an intention to launch a possible invasion, which the Kremlin first denied.But on Thursday, Putin refused to rule out another military solution to the tensions with Ukraine. Kyiv, he claimed, was planning an offensive to reclaim Donbas, the eastern border region now controlled by Russia-backed separatists, which broke away in 2014 following Moscow’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula.Oleg Nikolenko, Ukraine’s foreign ministry spokesperson, denied any intention of starting a military offensive on Donbas, where the slow-burning conflict has killed more than 14,000 people.A senior US administration official on Thursday said Washington would engage in diplomacy as soon as early January, but that the agenda would be broader than the proposals published by Moscow. The official also reiterated the threat of “massive sanctions” on Russia if it invaded Ukraine.“We and our allies are prepared to impose severe damage to Russia’s economy, and bring about exactly what it says it does not want: more Nato capabilities, not less, and closer to Russia, not further away,” the US official said.The west was working to “make Russia collapse from within”, Putin went on, and was laying the grounds for war by arming Ukraine’s military and “brainwashing the population”.“Our actions won’t depend on how the negotiations go but on whether Russia’s security is ensured unconditionally, today and in historical perspective,” he said.He added: “What’s not clear here? Are we putting missiles next to the US border? No! It’s the US that has come with its missiles to our home. They’re already at the threshold. Is it really asking too much not to put any more strike systems near our home?”Putin said Nato had “blatantly tricked” Russia by allegedly pledging to expand “not one inch eastward” in the 1990s, and was threatening Moscow further with what he claimed were plans to deploy troops and missile systems to Ukraine. Russia’s draft proposals include a demand Nato restrict all future military deployments to members that joined before 1997, when it began admitting former Communist satellite states in eastern Europe.“We need to understand how our security can be ensured,” he said. “So, without any funny business, we just put it out there by saying that Nato shouldn’t move any further east.”“You must give us guarantees — and immediately. Now.”US President Joe Biden is hoping to defuse tensions by keeping diplomatic lines open with Putin while simultaneously preparing a sanctions package and possible military aid to Ukraine that the White House hopes could deter Russia from military action.Some EU countries have balked at the US’s most stringent proposals, including proposed restrictions on Russian oil and gas imports and cutting Russian banks out of the Swift payment system.Italy’s Prime Minister Mario Draghi said on Wednesday that Nato, of which Rome is a member, had “other priorities” and that Europe, which imports about 40 per cent of its gas from Russia, could not give up Russian gas supplies.Additional reporting by Roman Olearchyk in Kyiv and Aime Williams in Washington
68  A pitch from France and Italy to revamp the EU’s budget rules so that they spur investments and drive long-term growth is likely to face a frosty reception among more fiscally conservative member states as the debate over the bloc’s fiscal outlook intensifies.Mario Draghi, Italy’s prime minister, and Emmanuel Macron, president of France, wrote in the Financial Times that debt raised to fund investments in priorities should be “favoured by the fiscal rules”.While EU member states needed to bring down their levels of indebtedness, public spending on future priorities “actually contributes to debt sustainability over the long run”, they argued in an article in the FT.“Our strategy is to curb recurrent public spending through sensible structural reforms,” they wrote. “And, just as the rules could not be allowed to stand in the way of our response to the pandemic, so they should not prevent us from making all necessary investments.”The Franco-Italian intervention comes as the European Commission engages in a public consultation over how the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) could be reformed when the rules are reimposed following a temporary suspension forced by the pandemic.Economists and some policymakers argue the existing framework is ill-suited to the heavy debt burdens and huge public spending requirements that Europe faces in the coming years and decades.France and Italy did not give details of what the new SGP should look like, but some economists have been arguing for a “golden rule” to be introduced permitting certain investments — for example in green projects — to be stripped out of deficit or debt calculations. One EU diplomat warned, however, that northern capitals would “dig in” and oppose any such carve-outs from public spending rules, favouring more incremental changes to the SGP.Rome and Paris also suggested the €800bn NextGenerationEU recovery fund — backed by an unprecedented collective borrowing effort by EU member states — could serve as a “blueprint” for future joint projects along similar lines.The discussion over specific reforms to the SGP will gather momentum early next year, and officials want it concluded in the first half of 2022 while France holds the EU’s rotating presidency.Northern EU member states remain sceptical of golden rules, worrying they may lead governments to ignore swaths of public borrowing.In a letter to the Dutch parliament earlier this month, caretaker finance minister Wopke Hoekstra pointed to European Commission staff working papers that have found that golden rules do not necessarily do an effective job at incentivising public investment, and that they are too complex.The incoming Dutch coalition has said it remains “committed to a sound and prudent macroeconomic policy and necessary reforms by member states, aimed at sustainable debt, higher economic growth and upward convergence”. The position of the new German coalition government will be critical — and officials are awaiting clearer signals. Politicians in Berlin have been discussing ways of raising funds without violating the country’s constitutional debt brake, including via off-balance sheet mechanisms — a debate that is being closely watched in other capitals.Frugal member states also made their support for NextGenerationEU conditional on it being a one-off, and they have displayed no immediate appetite for opening up a debate over the idea of creating similar schemes.A eurozone diplomat said any weakening of the SGP would undermine the case for continuing common debt issuance beyond the recovery fund by eroding trust between so-called creditor and debtor economies. “More fiscal imprudence should result in less common responsibility,” said the diplomat.Valdis Dombrovskis, executive vice-president of the European Commission, told the FT this week that he was willing to examine the idea of a “green golden rule” skewing the fiscal rules in favour of certain classes of green assets.But he also stressed that the EU’s top priority had to remain reducing overall public debt burdens. “It’s clear when we look at debt-reduction trajectories, it concerns all the public debt — not bits and pieces of public debt.”
69  At the end of the first year of new trade terms between the UK and EU, Brexit has been most notable by the absence of drama at Britain’s borders.There have been few tailbacks at the ports and little noticeable disruption to the flow of trade. But activity has been much lower than expected, even ahead of tighter import controls coming in next year, especially on food and agricultural goods.Brexit’s overall effect on the UK economy and people’s living standards appears to be negative but uncertain, according to economists.They say growth has been already hit by the new rules which kicked in on January 1 when the UK officially left the bloc. Over time, these could leave the country roughly 4 per cent worse off than it would have been had the 2016 EU referendum gone the other way, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility.The debate among economists on Brexit has rarely been about whether there would be a hit to growth and living standards, but rather how big a hit.The exact costs remain unknown because the effects have not been immediate, economists say, and are difficult to disentangle from the impact of the coronavirus crisis.One of the simplest measures to assess Brexit, say economists, is to examine the UK’s overall performance since the June 2016 referendum until now, thereby taking account of the uncertainty created by the Leave vote as well as the country’s experience since.UK growth has lagged behind the US and the eurozone. Gross domestic product in the UK was 3.9 per cent higher in the third quarter of 2021 than in the second quarter of 2016. Over the same period, however, the eurozone produced 6.2 per cent growth and the US 10.6 per cent.While the underperformance of the UK economy is not disputed, it could have many causes apart from Brexit.Economists worry that variations in counting GDP by the ONS have potentially temporarily depressed the UK number. So too are they concerned by different underlying rates of growth which have nothing to do with Brexit, and varying experiences of the Covid-19 pandemic.With these potentially confounding causes of economic weakness, analysts have attempted more direct measures of the Brexit effect, concentrating on the impact on trade.John Springford, deputy director of the Centre for European Reform think-tank, estimated the likely UK trade performance based on a model, “doppelgänger UK”, derived from the performance of similar countries.The model showed that as of October, the latest month for which data is available, UK imports and exports of goods were 15.7 per cent below the level that could have been expected had the UK not left the EU’s customs union and single market in January.The analysis points to a picture that, along with EU nationals leaving, Brexit has “made it harder for the supply side of the British economy to adapt to the reopening of [sectors after lockdown was lifted],” Springford said.He added that uncertainty and sterling’s depreciation following the referendum have left the economy on track to lose around 4 to 5 per cent of national income compared with expectations had the UK voted Remain.Julian Jessop, an independent economist and fellow at the Institute of Economic Affairs think-tank, did not disagree that Brexit has so far been a minus for the economy, even though he supported the UK decision to leave the EU.“There’s not a lot of doubt that the things you can measure have been negative,” he said.Jessop added that lower trade would lead to lower growth, but how trade activity would affect the economy was “extremely uncertain”. Still, the detrimental effects of reduced trade with the EU would diminish over time, he said.While the debate is now less heated, Springford did not dissent from the view that the overall economic hit was likely to be unclear. He said the “big question” for economists was will the trade effects translate into GDP losses.If the trade performance in goods has been negative to date, Sarah Hall, professor of economic geography at Nottingham university, thinks the effect on the UK service sector is more of “refocusing geographically” than of large losses.Her research showed that UK services exports in the second quarter of this year were 14 per cent down on two years earlier, globally, reflecting the effect of Covid-19, especially on tourism. However, exports to the EU were 30 per cent down, suggesting an amplified impact on business with the continent.Hall expects the UK will try to reorganise its service sector over time to be more of a global hub, especially in finance, and believes this has some chance of success. While the end result would be negative, she said, it would not be “apocalyptic”.Shortages of lorry drivers, farm labourers and abattoir workers have showed up teething problems in the ending of free movement of labour. However, economists have been surprised by the smooth introduction of a new visa regime to stem the losses.Jonathan Portes, professor at King’s College London, said there was no surprise that there had been a “very large fall in EU immigration” because anyone who had wanted to come to the UK would have done so before visas were required in 2021.“We’ve seen skilled work visas are substantially up on the pre-pandemic period and, in particular, the health and care visas have seen a huge take up,” he said. “There has been a swift reorientation for the NHS from EU workers to non-EU.”“I didn’t think the Home Office would be able to deliver a new system,” he added.Economists have stressed that data comparisons are still highly uncertain.New imports rules being implemented in the first half of 2022 threatened to add more friction, said Springford, but commitments from HM Revenue & Customs to prioritise trade flow over controls implied there will be only a minimal additional negative effect.“HMRC will change the procedures if the new rules are creating a lot of problems at the border,” he predicted.Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the IMF, summed up the UK position in mid-December. While acknowledging specific problems clouding the medium-term outlook, she said “we are in no position today, yet, to identify to what extent this is due to the pandemic and what role Brexit may play in it”.The OECD warned in December that Britain’s relationship with the EU was important for its economic prospects. “A worsening trade relationship with the European Union could also weigh on the economic outlook in the medium term,” it said.The advice from the outside, therefore, is that Brexit has done some harm to UK living standards and all efforts should be made to patch up its relationship with the EU to minimise further damage.
70  Some of Europe’s biggest energy users are curbing production as they warned soaring power and gas prices could lead to higher manufacturing costs and hit competitiveness.Dunkirk’s Alvance, Europe’s largest producer of aluminium, has reduced output by close to 4 per cent since early December, as outages at several nuclear power plants sparked higher electricity prices in France.Nyrstar, the zinc producer owned by commodity trader Trafigura, has said it will mothball a 150,000-tonne-a-year smelter in Auby, northern France, after Christmas because of record power prices.The company, which has curtailed production across three sites in France, Belgium and the Netherlands because of surging energy costs, said it expected the higher prices to continue.“Electricity is 35 per cent of our fixed costs, which is huge,” Xavier Constant, the director of the smelter, told France Info radio this week. The closure will last at least two months.European gas prices jumped to new records this week as reduced Russian imports increased winter demand.Gas for delivery in Europe next month, which was already trading at record levels, jumped more than 20 per cent on Tuesday to close at €181 per megawatt hour.In the UK, prices climbed 20 per cent on Tuesday to a record 450 pence per therm, although they had fallen back to trade at 348p on Thursday.Some British steelmakers are pausing production when electricity prices rise, according to trade body UK Steel.Richard Leese, chair of the Energy Intensive Users Group, warned that concerns were rife that “as inflation starts to bite, demand might subside and when it does, companies will still be left with very high operational costs”.Bankers said their phones had been “ringing hot” from commodity traders seeking additional credit lines to cover margin calls — demands for extra cash to cover trading positions in natural gas and LNG.Big commodity traders use derivatives to hedge contracts against price swings and lock-in margins. This typically involves selling futures contracts linked to TTF, Europe’s wholesale gas price.Gas is used to generate electricity and is directly used to make products such as fertiliser and plastics. Although most large companies have long-term supply contracts in place, concerns are rising that a sustained increase in prices could undermine companies’ competitiveness.Among industry bosses, Tony Smurfit, chief executive of FTSE 100 listed Smurfit Kappa, Europe’s largest paper-based packaging manufacturer, warned that further price rises for its cardboard boxes were likely.“If [prices] stay up here, it will be very inflationary for the world,” he said. “Do you apply a surcharge for energy and make that an exemption or suck it up and make it a normal course of business through a price rise?”As well as rising energy prices, which have gone up four or fivefold in recent months, companies are facing higher carbon prices, which have tripled since the start of the year.The rises have prompted some of the bloc’s biggest energy users, including steel, cement and fertiliser producers, to step up calls on governments to address “unbearably high energy prices”.In the UK, Jonathan Reynolds, shadow business secretary, called for the government to invest £3bn in the steel industry to halt a decline in jobs after analysis showed the loss of 5,500 metal workers in the past nine years.Reynolds has also called for the Treasury to intervene to protect steel and other energy-intensive industries from soaring energy prices. “The government have just put their ‘out of office’ on, complacently sitting back, while other countries have already taken action,” he said.Jacob Hansen, director-general of Fertilizers Europe, said “politicians have not really understood how serious it is”.“The energy market is not working for Europe.I worry with the [gas] prices now as many plants got back to production again [after maintenance]. I think they will reconsider what they’re doing again.”
71  The writers are prime minister of Italy and president of FranceThe EU has often been accused of doing too little, too late in a crisis. However, our collective response to the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic was neither too little nor too late. Rather, it demonstrated the power of bold action taken early. And it confirmed the benefits of policy co-ordination, across countries and institutions.To fight the crisis, EU governments have spent nearly €1.8tn to help families and businesses. The European Central Bank has unleashed a sizeable monetary stimulus to support lending. And the European Commission has suspended its fiscal rules and, together with governments, launched the Next Generation EU programme, a €750bn plan to fund investment and reforms.The recovery is well on its way. The EU economy has not yet returned to its pre-pandemic path, but it is on course to return to its pre-crisis level in the coming months. Public finances are also on the mend: the ratios between sovereign debt and gross domestic product across the EU have stabilised and are set to fall in 2022.Despite the remaining uncertainties, we must look forward and address the significant long-term challenges we face. The climate and biodiversity crises are worsening, while geopolitical and military tensions are rising. Technology has become ever more central to our wellbeing, while at the same time exacerbating existing inequalities and creating new divides. Demographic evolutions are profoundly changing the structure of our societies. In all these areas, the EU must act boldly and quickly.In Italy and France, we have already pursued ambitious reforms to protect our citizens and help them fulfil their potential, and we have already achieved tangible results. We must now go further.We must deepen the reform agenda and accompany these transformations with large-scale investment in research, infrastructure, digitisation and defence. We need an EU growth strategy for the next decade, and we must stand ready to implement it through common investments, more suitable rules and better co-ordination — not only during crises.The ability to deploy fiscal policy to protect our people and transform our economies has been, and remains, central to this strategy. Thus, together with all other EU member states, once we have defined a set of common principles and macroeconomic goals, we will then have to discuss the right way to translate these objectives into a sensible new fiscal framework.Prior to the pandemic, the EU’s existing fiscal rules were already in need of reform. They are too obscure and excessively complex. They constrained the actions of governments during crises and overburdened monetary policy. They also failed to provide incentives for prioritising key public spending for the future and for our sovereignty, including public investment.We will need a framework that is credible, transparent and capable of contributing to our collective ambition for a stronger, more sustainable and fairer Europe. There is no doubt that we must bring down our levels of indebtedness. But we cannot expect to do this through higher taxes or unsustainable cuts in social spending, nor can we choke off growth through unviable fiscal adjustment.Instead, our strategy is to curb recurrent public spending through sensible structural reforms. And, just as the rules could not be allowed to stand in the way of our response to the pandemic, so they should not prevent us from making all necessary investments.The European Commission has launched a consultation on the future of the EU’s fiscal rules, and interesting proposals are being put forward. We need to have more room for manoeuvre and enough key spending for the future and to ensure our sovereignty. Debt raised to finance such investments, which undeniably benefit the welfare of future generations and long-term growth, should be favoured by the fiscal rules, given that public spending of this sort actually contributes to debt sustainability over the long run.The Next Generation EU programme has been a success — in its assessment of public spending quality and in its mode of financing. As such, it offers a useful blueprint for the way forward. New proposals will deserve in-depth discussion, not clouded by ideology, with the aim of better serving the interests of the EU as a whole.The upcoming French presidency of the Council of the EU will have the objective of developing a shared comprehensive strategy for the future of the union.The EU must rekindle the spirit that drove the action it took at the start of the pandemic in 2020. A new growth strategy and, then, an enhanced fiscal framework along these lines would go a long way to ensuring that the EU has the means to realise its ambitions.Letters in response to this article:France’s EU presidency must back silver economy /From Michael W Hodin, Chief Executive, Global Coalition on Ageing; Managing Partner, High Lantern Group; Fellow, Harris Manchester College, University of Oxford, UKMacron and Draghi’s plan is ‘naive’ and ‘a fantasy’ / From John Turner, Dublin, Ireland
72  Europe’s thousands of pages of banking rules and directives have become so onerous to enforce they threaten regulators’ ability to see the real risks building in their financial systems, Denmark and Norway’s financial supervision chiefs have warned.In separate interviews with the Financial Times, Morten Baltzersen, head of Norway’s Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA), and Jesper Berg, head of Denmark’s counterpart, sharply criticised the breadth and complexity of banking regulation.“The [2008] global financial crisis justified more complexity in order to remove loopholes and to cope with the interconnectedness of the financial institutions,” said Baltzersen. “Over time, the pendulum has swung too much in the direction of complexity.”Berg argued: “It’s too much, and you risk getting lost in the detail as opposed to thinking about what the real risks are.”Global banking regulation was overhauled in the aftermath of the financial crisis, most fundamentally through the Basel III accord, which dramatically increased banks’ capital requirements and made regulators far more vigilant in monitoring risk. The latest version of the framework runs to 1,626 pages.The EU now has more than 80 financial services directives, which also apply to European Economic Area members such as Norway. They include several hundred pages of proposals for transposing the latest Basel measures into EU law.In the eurozone, the supervisory burden is shared by national supervisors and the European Central Bank.Baltzersen — who has headed Norway’s FSA since 2011 and oversees 300 staff supervising a broad range of financial services, including banks, auditors, accountants and real estate brokers — said the complex bank rules meant supervisors had “fewer and fewer resources for supervision [because] we have to spend so much time coping with complex legislation and legal wrangling [about regulation]”.Regulators also risked “not seeing the wood for the trees”, or identifying the true risks in their financial systems and markets, because they were overseeing so many rules, he said. The highly prescriptive nature of Europe’s regulations left “less and less room” for regulators to exercise the discretion necessary for good supervision.“Complexity has increased while prudential substance has not,” he added. Measures such as the EU decision to introduce relief for banks lending to small and medium-sized businesses were an example of capital requirements being “partially diluted, which is detrimental to financial stability”.Berg said his 400-strong agency could not supervise the implementation of the EU’s complex rules and succeed in its core function of safeguarding the Danish financial system.Denmark’s FSA took a “risk-based approach” where “we don’t waive [certain] requirements but we do not necessarily pursue and supervise all the different points in the requirement if we do not think that’s where the risks are”, he said.“My guess is that most EU supervisors, and in particular the smaller ones, have pursued a [similar strategy] as opposed to a legalistic approach over the last many years. For the larger and internationally active banks, you are likely to be much more diligent than for smaller banks,” he added.Berg said banks also bore some of the blame, since they had lobbied for additional rules to benefit their own operations.“Banks are not innocents here,” he said. “All the banks want to have regulation which suits their competitive advantage.”Part of the operational burden comes from the EU’s decision to apply Basel standards across all of its banks, not just the larger ones as is the case in the US.Isabelle Vaillant, director of prudential regulation and supervisory policy at the European Banking Authority, which creates the single banking rule book for the EU and EEA, said she did not see an issue with “overregulation” generally but that the EBA was trying to make the rules “more accessible and digestible” to less complex and less risky banks.The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has also been reviewing its regulations to see if they can be made simpler.A European Commission official said the complexity of regulation was “to a certain extent unavoidable” given how complicated finance had become.“We are aware of the administrative burden associated with regulation, which must of course be kept to the minimum possible,” the official added. “But, this is the cost of ensuring that the financial system is prudentially sound.The EU regulatory framework is subject to regular review. If needed, we will revise the rules”
73  Within hours of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announcing a new scheme that promised to guard savers from volatility in the value of the Turkish lira, the state-owned Halkbank began urging its customers to put their faith in the national currency.In a slickly produced advert, set to rousing Ottoman-inspired music, a well-known television actor walks a young friend through a museum exhibition and tells him that, just as the Turkish flag, the Turkish language and the parliament represent the country’s pride, “the Turkish lira is our power”.Erdogan hopes that the message — combined with an attractive new investment proposition — will persuade millions of Turks to turn their backs on dollars and gold and put their savings in lira. The currency, which had lost 50 per cent against the dollar before his announcement, enjoyed its strongest day’s trading in decades in the wake of the news, albeit one that came with the help of a multibillion intervention by the country’s central bank.On the streets of Ankara, the nation’s capital, Turks were unsure about the two new state-backed financial products, the government’s latest plan to bolster their battered currency.The first offers to protect lira savings by indexing them to the exchange rate, with the Treasury compensating savers if the slide in the lira outstrips the interest rate offered on their account. A second initiative, backed by the central bank, offers similar incentives for savers willing to convert their foreign currency savings into lira.Melek, a housewife who is a longstanding supporter of Erdogan’s ruling AKP party, said she would steer clear. “It’s too complicated for me, I wouldn’t consider it,” said the 60-year-old, who instead prefers to keep her savings in gold at home.With the schemes set to be rolled out in days, analysts question not just how much take up there will be but also the impact on inflation and on the public finances.“These are not typical measures you would see in other countries to stabilise the currency,” said Maxim Rybnikov, a director for sovereign ratings at the rating agency S&P. “For the government and the central bank as counterparties funding the scheme, depending on developments in the FX market, the cost could be fairly substantial.”The plans seek to tackle a long-running problem. Households have for decades been reluctant to save in lira because of high inflation and a volatile currency. Turkish banks allow savers to open accounts in dollars, euros or precious metals. Billions of dollars worth of gold are also kept “under the pillow” in people’s homes, according to government officials.The dollarisation trend, as it is known by economists, has been exacerbated during times of lira volatility.Foreign currency holdings reached a record share of more than 60 per cent of total deposits in the banking system in recent weeks after Erdogan, a lifelong opponent of high interest rates, ordered the central bank to repeatedly lower the cost of borrowing despite soaring inflation.Government officials are bullish about the appeal, in particular, of the product aimed at those who are currently holding money in lira, arguing that there are few downside risks to savers. “Anyone who is already in Turkish lira deposits will convert to this,” said one person familiar with the workings of the scheme. “It will maybe take a little bit of time.but Turkish people really adapt to new instruments very fast.”But with deposit rates lower than the current rate of inflation, Emre Akcakmak, managing director at Greenwest Consultancy in Dubai, warned that “unless the lira depreciates even more than the rate of inflation, savers will lose versus inflation.”Some Turks may also be reluctant to commit to a minimum three-month maturity requirement that penalises those who withdraw their money too soon. Data from the country’s banking regulator shows that 35 per cent of the 1.1 trillion lira in local currency deposits held by individuals at Turkish banks in October was in accounts with maturities of one month or less.Given inflation is expected to exceed 30 per cent in the months ahead, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, argued that any household with access to loans at rates close to the central bank’s policy rate of 14 per cent still “has the incentive to borrow to buy real assets or FX”. That would continue a recent trend that has seen Turks taking advantage of cheap credit to pile into other assets, including houses, cars and cryptocurrency.For now, Turks are still taking stock of the new offer.Mehmet, a tailor, saw the advantages of the scheme because the exchange rate was so volatile that it was “not clear what dollar rate is going to be” from one day to the next.One branch manager at a commercial bank in Ankara said she had received an influx of calls from customers about the new products,The bank manager, who asked not to be named, said there was a sense of “relief” among some of her customers that the freefall in the currency had been arrested, though she said many were still unsure about whether to entrust their money in the new products. She said: “I think it will take couple days for customers to decide.”A Turkish analyst at a foreign financial institution, who asked not to be named, said that the fundamental reason why citizens continued to prefer foreign currency was that they did not trust the government’s economic policies. “Why would you hold Erdogan dollars when you can hold real dollars?”
74  With up to 175,000 Russian troops massed on the Ukrainian border and Vladimir Putin warning the west not to cross his “red lines”, there’s talk of war again in Moscow. But you wouldn’t know it from my Instagram feed, which is full of selfies from flashy oligarch-funded art centres: Kremlin-connected gas magnate Leonid Mikhelson has just opened GES-2, an enormous new “house of culture”, while Putin’s inconveniently timed video summit with Joe Biden the other week meant that I had to flog my tickets to see London avant-jazz band Sons of Kemet in Garage, the museum funded by Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich.A decade or so ago, when I wrote art reviews for The Moscow Times expat newspaper as a student, Russia’s contemporary scene could have only dreamt of something like GES-2, then a decaying century-old relic. Like Tate Modern, it occupies a former power station, which Italian architect Renzo Piano has bathed in light — or at least what little light there is in Moscow in December — with floor-to-ceiling windows and glass roofing like a greenhouse.Mikhelson, one of Russia’s richest men, told Putin during a guided tour that he took it over in a “horrific” state. Now, at a price the taciturn billionaire has declined to name, it has turned into a showcase aimed to establish his V-A-C Foundation on a par with any cultural centre in Europe.The artist charged with putting V-A-C on the map is Iceland’s Ragnar Kjartansson. He has made its centrepiece a “living sculpture”, with a team of 80 Russian actors, directors, and technicians re-enacting 98 episodes of the long-forgotten US soap opera Santa Barbara. Kjartansson is known for lengthy, repetitive performances such as a 2018 Moscow concert where, backed by a jazz band, he sang the phrase “Sorrow conquers happiness” in Russian over and over again for six hours.For GES-2’s inaugural three-month run, he hit on the idea of Santa Barbara after reading an article in the journal Foreign Policy about the soap’s cult status in Russia. It was one of the first American shows allowed on Russian television following the collapse of the Soviet Union 30 years ago, and its glitz, glamour and bouffant hair-dos came to symbolise people’s yearning for a better life under capitalism. The show’s ritzy interiors, painstakingly recreated in GES-2, inspired interior decorating trends. Posh neighbourhoods in provincial backwaters were named after it — I’ve been to the Santa Barbara district on the hills overlooking Makhachkala in Dagestan, one of Russia’s poorest regions. And the show itself entered the Russian lexicon: “some kind of Santa Barbara” means an overly dramatic mess.If anything, the throwback to Russia’s turbulent first few years after communism shows how much has changed in the ensuing three decades. Putin claimed last week that he had to work as a taxi driver in the 1990s to make ends meet; now it’s Russia’s oligarchs who are the byword for the somewhat tacky largesse embodied in Santa Barbara.Russia’s artists, too, have had to adapt to suit their patrons’ taste — even if, on the evidence of GES-2, Mikhelson’s is better than most. Oleg Kulik, whose naked performances as a rabid dog epitomised the wild abandon of Russian culture in the 1990s, described the artist’s dilemma as “to bite or to lick”: whether to fight back against often oppressive masters or to seek approval from the institutions they controlled. (Kulik found himself on the receiving end of this dichotomy at a notorious exhibition in Stockholm where he snapped at visitors so aggressively, biting one man, that the police arrested him, as later immortalised in the 2017 Swedish film The Square.)Well into Putin’s time in power, the biters still set the tone. The radical street-art group Voina was even awarded a state-funded prize in 2011 for spray-painting a phallus on a St Petersburg bridge — it boldly rose, erect, to face the local security services headquarters when barges passed. But when protests against Putin’s rule broke out that winter on Bolotnaya Square, just a few minutes’ walk from GES-2, the Kremlin launched a culture war that left little space for art beyond the tame.Just across the river stands the Christ the Saviour cathedral, best known as the site of a protest by the punk art group Pussy Riot that landed two of its members in prison for “hooliganism”. The trendy Strelka bar-and-architectural-consultancy two blocks away masterminded an enormous attempt to win over Moscow’s hipsters in the mid-2010s by redesigning its streets: once completed, those expansive new sidewalks and blooming green spaces were where riot police violently broke up peaceful protests.In a way, the tension between Moscow’s emergence in the last decade as a genuinely “liveable” city, with great coffee, more green spaces and a vibrant food scene, and the parallel deterioration of political freedoms was part of what makes it such a fascinating place to be a journalist. You can gossip about the latest murky moves from the Kremlin with a source in a swanky restaurant one day and then dodge cops beating people up with rubber batons outside it the next.As of October, several Moscow restaurants now have Michelin stars — confirmation that Russia’s food scene is thriving after Putin banned most western imports in 2014 and spurred a burgeoning farm-to-table movement. Kremlin-connected types I meet drinking carob tea in coffee shops or smoking cigars in closed-door lounges constantly ask me about the “excesses” of Black Lives Matter and cancel culture in the west, but treat the way Russia’s security services are coming to permeate all corners of life as a mere inconvenience.This year, though, the stamping-out of dissent since opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s arrest in January has made things a little too stark for my comfort. At least six people I’ve interviewed in my time here are either in prison or were recently released. Several Russian journalist friends have been named “foreign agents”, a restriction that makes working in public all but impossible. The rest scan the justice ministry’s website on what we know as “fucked-up Fridays” — the day they usually put out the latest list — to see if they’ve joined their ranks. Sources decline to meet for fear of sending the wrong “signal” by being spotted with a western reporter.Most ominously, the apparatus of repression seems to have taken on a life of its own. “Why do trees grow in the woods? These things just happen,” a former official says over beers when asked who’s behind the crackdown. “It just so happens that Russia is a great place to live — if you’re a prosecutor, investigator or intelligence officer. That wasn’t Putin’s plan, but that’s how it happened.”As Putin’s warnings over Ukraine grow more ominous, I have an impromptu lunch with one of Russia’s most seasoned culture warriors. Konstantin Malofeev funds an online news network, styled as a Russian Orthodox version of Fox News, that’s a bellwether for the conservative fringe; he’s been under US and EU sanctions since 2014 over his ties to the separatists in eastern Ukraine. His growing profile indicates the centrality of nationalists, family-values-style traditionalists and religious zealots to Putin’s culture war. An avowed imperialist, Malofeev even runs a movement to restore the tsar and has just published the first book in a three-volume opus tracing Russia’s imperial mission back to the earliest empires of Assyria.With an office full of historical relics in a mall upstairs from a Michelin-starred restaurant and a rotating cast of priests on his channel, it’s easy to dismiss Malofeev as some sort of tsarist costume player. But the increasingly belligerent noises coming out of the Kremlin on Ukraine show he’s ahead of the curve. “Obviously, I support the harshest of all imperial scenarios,” he says over fish in cream sauce and roast cauliflower. “But we are completely prepared — this is the finest of sports, where we always win.”Malofeev is convinced that once Russia drives Kyiv’s western backers from the country, Ukrainians will lay down their arms and embrace their “brotherly nation” once again as it subsumes them into his imperial project. I tell him this reminds me of the Bush administration’s conviction that Iraqis would “greet us as liberators” in 2003 — a disastrous imperial adventure from which US hegemony has yet to recover. But Malofeev is unfazed. And why should he be? Compare his vision to the western-influenced ideals on show at GES-2: it’s obvious who’s winning.Max Seddon is the FT’s Moscow bureau chief
75  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
76  France has cancelled its order for Merck’s antiviral tablet, becoming the first country to do so publicly as concerns over the drug’s efficacy against coronavirus continue to mount.Merck said it was “very confident” in the drug’s clinical profile and that it was moving with “urgency” to bring molnupiravir to the world.Olivier Véran, France’s health minister, told BFM TV that France had cancelled the order “because the last studies weren’t good. It cost us nothing,” Reuters reported.Merck’s drug — which the company has outlicensed to the Medicines Patent Pool to increase supply to poorer nations — had initially shown a reduction of about 50 per cent in the risk of hospitalisation and death. But complete data, released last month, showed that the fall was in fact about 30 per cent, significantly lower.Earlier on Wednesday, the UK, which is running a molnupiravir trial with at-risk patients, said it had expanded its order by 1.75m additional courses of the drug. It had previously ordered 480,000 courses.Merck said it had supply agreements with over 30 countries. The European Medicines Agency has begun a full review of the drug after giving it an emergency nod — not an approval — that allows member states to go ahead with its use on a national basis. The results of that review are expected early next year.A person familiar with the EMA’s approval process told the Financial Times the drug had been “a bit of a disappointment” and that 30 per cent efficacy “started to be on the limits of [what is considered] benefit”. The EMA pointed to previous remarks that the full data would be considered in the coming weeks “to determine if a positive opinion can be reached next year”, but declined to comment further.France’s drug regulator earlier this month refused early access to the drug, saying, among other things, that it did not meet standards for innovation, that its study results were worse than for treatments already available, and that its impact on viral loads — how much of the virus is present in the body — had not been demonstrated.Molnupiravir was developed by Merck and Ridgeback Therapeutics.A US Food and Drug Administration panel last month narrowly voted in favour of approval, saying its use should be restricted to high-risk adults with mild to moderate symptoms amid concerns about side-effects. The FDA has not yet communicated its decision.It is not clear yet whether other European countries have privately cancelled orders, though most are betting on Pfizer’s paxlovid, another oral drug approved by the FDA on Wednesday, which has shown an 89 per cent reduction in hospitalisations or deaths, to help manage a surge in cases.France had also acted early on remdesivir, the Gilead drug whose benefit has been described as limited, restricting its use before others did.Andy Hill, a senior visiting research fellow in pharmacology at the University of Liverpool, said trial results for the drug “do not show statistically significant benefits over placebo in a simple sensitivity analysis. Several academics are finding the same results.”He said the downward revision of efficacy was a “very unusual result” that needed further investigation.The Merck trial, he noted, had recruited elderly unvaccinated patients.“In the UK, the vast majority of elderly patients have already been double-vaccinated,” he said. “This lowers their risks of hospitalisation. So it is not clear if molnupiravir can benefit these patients any more.”Merck said it continued to work with the EMA on its review and would continue negotiations on supply should the drug be authorised or approved.
77  The UK and EU have struck a deal on sharing fish stocks in 2022, while a separate dispute with France over access for its boats in British waters continues.The two sides on Wednesday decided on total catch levels of around 100 shared fish stocks in joint EU and UK waters, such as the North Sea and Irish Sea.But environmental activists said they had broken a pledge to end overfishing. Jenni Grossmann, of Client Earth, said: “Just like in pre-Brexit times, they have continued to prioritise short-term commercial interests over long-term sustainability for both fish and fishers — perpetuating the dire state of these depleted stocks.”The environmental law charity said only 40 per cent of stocks were fished sustainably.Vera Coelho, senior director of advocacy in Europe for Oceana, said: “Certain fish populations, like west of Scotland herring, Irish Sea whiting or Celtic Sea cod, will continue to be overexploited in 2022.”The deal concerns how much fish can be caught. The distribution of fishing quotas was already agreed when the UK left the bloc in January. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) signed in 2020 ensures that the UK share increases by 25 per cent between 2021-26.The UK fleet in 2022 will be allowed to catch around 140,000 tonnes of fish, estimated to be worth around £313m, based on historic landing prices, the government said. That is a drop from this year’s 160,000 tonnes and £333m.There were increases in some fisheries, such as North Sea prawns, but reductions in others, such as sole off south-west England.British fishermen remain “frustrated”, said Barrie Deas, chief executive of the National Federation of Fisherman’s Organisations. “The TCA did not take us where we needed to be,” he said.The extra stocks won from the EU after Brexit were in some cases fish that the UK industry did not want. Even where scientists sanctioned big increases, such as whiting and haddock, quota rises were more modest because of fears that endangered cod would be taken as by-catch from the same waters.But Deas was glad a deal had been done before Christmas. Talks to decide catch totals for 2021 dragged on until June, forcing fishermen to adjust their catch in the second half of the year.He said some fishermen would still be hit hard. “The UK government puts spin on the numbers. You need to look fishery by fishery. Some have increased, some reduced.” George Eustice, UK environment secretary, praised the deal.“The balanced agreement made today provides a strong foundation as we seek to deliver more sustainable fisheries management, as set out in our landmark Fisheries Act.”Eustice said the government would continue to hold discussions with the EU on sustainability and other issues.Meanwhile, France and the UK remain locked in a dispute over access to coastal waters off the UK, Jersey and Guernsey. French ministers have said dozens of boats that historically fished there have lost their right to do so despite applying for a licence to continue.France has threatened to ask Brussels to take legal action but has yet to do so, according to EU officials.The European Commission said it was still establishing the facts. “We will examine together with the French authorities the legal circumstances around every requested licence which has not been granted.”
78  The lira had fallen significantly following the latest series of interest rate cuts, but it turned sharply higher on Tuesday after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan unveiled a new savings scheme aimed at incentivising local residents to hold lira deposits.But at the same time, the country’s net foreign assets fell by $5.9bn in the first two days of this week to minus $5.1bn, according to Financial Times calculations based on central bank data. The Turkish central bank has not announced any official interventions this week and declined to comment on whether it had sold dollars to prop up the lira in recent days. But the erosion of its foreign assets suggests that this has played a significant role in the lira’s recovery.Ugur Gurses, a former central bank official, said the 50 per cent rally in the currency from Monday’s nadir was explained at least in part by a large “backdoor intervention”. A London-based analyst, who asked not to be named, said he had calculated an intervention of $6.9bn on the same days — estimates range from $5.5bn to $7bn. Turkish bankers reported a “very concerted and aggressive effort to make Erdogan’s announcement look good”, he said.Turkey’s lira hit a record low of 18.4 to the US dollar on Monday, down by 60 per cent over the year, but posted a massive rebound after Ankara announced a pair of schemes, backed by the country’s Treasury and central bank, to protect lira savings and underpin the currency by indexing them to foreign currency.Erdogan declared on Wednesday that Turkey was winning its financial battle. “We are battling against the oppression of our people with inflation and interest,” he said in a televised speech. “This time, we will achieve the results we want.”Analysts estimate that the powerful intervention at the start of the week brings total interventions by the central bank this month to between $15bn and $17bn.The scale is likely to reignite alarm among analysts about the health of Turkey’s foreign currency reserves. The bank’s war chest had recovered earlier this year after plummeting to a 20-year low after a previous attempt to defend the lira while cutting interest rates burnt through more than $100bn. The rating agency Fitch, which earlier this month changed its outlook on Turkey to “negative”, voiced concern over an announcement at the start of December that the central bank would resume interventions to support the lira. The agency warned that, if sustained, the policy “risks further undermining the already weak central bank international reserves’ composition”.Concerns about Turkey’s reserves came as analysts warned that the new savings schemes announced by the president risked further fuelling the country’s already sky-high inflation, which stood at an official rate of 21 per cent in November.Some analysts argued that the new plan amounted to a clandestine interest rate increase or currency peg and that the central bank might be compelled to print more money to cover its new obligations.The government had “thrown in the towel” on inflation and was adopting a semi-fixed exchange rate, Hakan Kara, who was chief economist at the central bank before he was fired in 2019, wrote on Twitter.“For 10 years, the demand for [low] interest rates has required pulling different instruments out of the hat,” he said. “We still don’t have a stabilising monetary policy. This system too will necessitate revision.”“You won’t have the exchange rate and inflation rate spiral that was there before, but it will still be very difficult to bring inflation back into single digits,” said Kieran Curtis, an emerging market debt manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments in London. The big difference in inflation between Turkey and the US and eurozone would weaken the lira and add to fiscal costs, he said.Investors might be encouraged to buy Turkish assets as the scheme makes capital controls less likely in the immediate future, but the amounts would be small, Curtis added. Aberdeen sold its exposure to Turkish debt in March and has not bought any since.Erdogan said those worried the lira could resume its downward march were “soft in the brain” and that regulators were pursuing legal cases against those who try to weaken the lira by encouraging people to buy foreign currency.Additional reporting by Jonathan Wheatley in London
79  Italy’s prime minister Mario Draghi has admitted that Europe has few tools to deter Russia from a military confrontation with Ukraine, as tension mounts over Moscow’s intentions towards Kyiv.Speaking at an end-of-year press conference in Rome, Draghi drew attention to the EU’s lack of its own military force and also pointed to weaknesses in any sanctions that might be directed at the Kremlin.“Do we have missiles, ships, cannons, armies? At the moment we don’t and at the moment Nato has different strategic priorities.”Draghi said economic sanctions would be the only possible means of “deterrence” but Europe was not in a position to give up Russian gas supplies. “It would not be the right moment,” he said.The EU is already feeling the pinch from a surge in energy prices, partly caused by unusually low supplies of Russian gas ahead of the winter.Moscow has about 100,000 troops on its border with Ukraine, sparking western fears that Russia is planning a possible invasion. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has spoken of “serious concern” at Nato’s own deployments and warned of “appropriate” military action if the western military alliance continues to expand toward his country’s bordersThis month Russia published security demands, including a call for Nato to rule out membership for Ukraine and seek Moscow’s permission for deployments in former Soviet countries that are now members.The US has said some of the demands are unacceptable but plans bilateral talks in January with Moscow.Draghi said Europe needed to maintain engagement with Putin, who talked this week to Emmanuel Macron, president of France, and to Olaf Scholz, German’s new chancellor.In Wednesday’s press conference, Draghi also hinted his stint as Italy’s prime minister may be coming to an end, saying his administration had hit the targets it committed to with the EU.“Our work can go on regardless of who is at the helm,” Draghi told the news conference in Rome. “As long as there is a wide convergence between parties as there is now.”The former European Central Bank president is widely seen as a leading candidate to take over as Italy’s president from Sergio Mattarella, whose seven-year term is due to end early in 2022. Draghi’s statements on Tuesday were the strongest signal he has given about his willingness to assume the presidency if lawmakers choose him.The succession is being closely watched outside Italy because of Draghi’s role at the head of a national unity government that has stabilised the economy and shored up investor confidence.If he were to move to the presidency, some observers fear a period of renewed political turmoil at a time when Italy is trying to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, with hundreds of billions of euros of EU grants and loans at stake.The Italian constitution does not envisage a second term for a sitting president, although this has happened before at the height of the European debt crisis. Mattarella, whose popularity has increased significantly over the course of the past four years, has publicly ruled out the possibility that he will stay on for another term.“This government has created the conditions for the work to continue, regardless of who is [at the helm],” Draghi told the press conference. “My personal destiny does not matter. I have no particular ambitions, I am a grandfather at the service of public institutions,” he added.Draghi’s election to the presidency would potentially trigger early elections unless there is agreement on a caretaker government to continue until the expected end of the parliamentary term in 2023. This option appears to be preferred by Draghi.“It is essential for the [parliamentary term] to continue in order to fight the pandemic, boost growth and implement the EU recovery fund,” said Draghi.The EU funds depend on Italy hitting reform commitments, which the prime minister said were being met this year.Italy’s president is chosen through a secret parliamentary ballot for which parties usually negotiate nominations, while candidates do not declare themselves.
80  President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s savings scheme has revived the lira. The Turkish currency is up a third against the dollar this week, trading at TL12.4 to the greenback on Wednesday following his proposal to compensate savers for any forex losses, a plan dubbed by some as an interest rate rise in all but name.That was enough to lure domestic money back from dollars and gold. Foreign funds will be harder to win over. Volatility, which has dogged the lira and sovereign bonds for years, is not going away. Too many risks remain; not least the president’s obtuse economic beliefs and a central bank that looks to be comfortably in his pocket. Elevated rates for 5-years CDS suggest jitters remain.Supporting the lira has proved a costly exercise, accounting for — according to Erdogan — $165bn over 2018 and 2019. This year saw a hiatus in depletion of reserves — at least until December. Including substantial interventions this week, analysts put the tally for the month to date at $15bn-$17bn.Investment has also suffered. Foreign direct investment has been falling in the past couple of years, receiving further discouragement from the deteriorating rule of law and economic mismanagement as Erdogan sought to strengthen his position in the wake of the abortive coup that failed to unseat his government. That sits uneasily with the government’s goal of securing a 1.5 per cent share of global foreign direct investment by 2023, or almost double last year’s take and higher than even the record levels of 2006.There is little to entice foreign investors. Erdogan’s refusal to raise rates — instead there have been a series of rate cuts — is fuelling inflation. Bond yields are whipsawing. Risks stalk the equity market too. Banks, often the medium for monetary policy, bear refinancing risks, deteriorating asset quality and eroded capital ratios.Some of that is already rippling out to swashbuckling foreign investors such as BBVA. The Spanish bank’s share price has slumped since unveiling its takeover bid for Garanti Bank, of which it already owns half, last month. Others will take that as a warning to steer clear.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Please tell us what you think of Turkey’s economic woes in the comments section below.
81  If you’ve read an FT story on German car companies over the past decade, chances are you will have come across a quote from Arndt Ellinghorst, one of our go-to auto analysts for all things VW, BMW and Daimler.No more. After almost a quarter of a century in the industry, most recently at Bernstein, Ellinghorst is leaving deadline-bound journalists bereft. But before he drives off into the sunset — more on which later — we couldn’t pass up the chance to elicit some final predictions.Ellinghorst’s general assessment is a depressing one. Since he did his diploma at Audi in the 1990s — and became a management trainee at VW — European auto stocks have, in his words, become the “lowest valued species among all publicly traded equities”.“Over the past 20 years their valuation has de-rated by more than 60 per cent,” says Ellinghorst. “Some of the best brands you can think of are valued to go out of business in four to five years’ time.” The price-to-earnings* ratio at the likes of BMW (which has been minting cash for years and is on track to post almost €10bn in free cash flow and record profits in 2021) lingers around 5x, while Tesla’s is in the mid triple digits. It’s a similar picture at Daimler, and VW, which has its structural problems but still houses cash-spinners Audi and Porsche.Essentially, as Ellinghorst has long emphasised, the market believes these storied companies’ enterprise value “will go to zero in four or five years” — an astonishing assessment of a sector that is responsible for almost 30 per cent of all European R&D spend. Every euro of that spend, Arndt adds “is valued at the lowest market cap of any industry. It is really traumatic”.At the same time the market has allocated more than $2tn to new mobility players, including Rivian and Nio. “Capital markets are taking the view, tech companies are taking the view, risk capital is taking the view that the future of mobility is amazing,” says Ellinghorst. “But sadly, the market has also made the judgment that traditional brands will not be part of it.”So far, so damning. The big question, however, is why.“In the US people have taken a view that these companies are just metal benders,” says Ellinghorst, while in Europe, particularly in Germany, “the market has taken a view that the influence of labour unions, the co-determined supervisory boards make these companies too slow to restructure.” Recent drama in Wolfsburg has done little to dispel this notion.But Ellinghorst also places a significant part of the blame on those sitting in boardrooms, who “treated their product with disrespect”. For years, he has been complaining that the industry has run an “overly volume centric business model”, a “stack-em-high” strategy that led to high fixed costs and higher break-even points, both hard to reduce in a cyclical downturn.Then came Tesla, and executives (with the honourable exception of BMW, a pioneer that simply rolled out the technology too early) were “not fully convinced that they could transition their brand equity into the electric world,” until Dieselgate and regulation forced their hands, he says, recalling conversations with complacent German managers.The VW brand has also recreated its complexity in the EV world, launching several similar models instead of focusing on one or two breakthrough products. VW, which will sell far fewer than the 600,000 electric vehicles it hoped to sell this year, partially due to a lack of semiconductors, “has not been convincing, both in terms of technical performance and the volume”.Even the golden goose that is China, the largest market for all German manufacturers, was never a sustainable profit pool, he argues.“The financial market has always looked at these auto exposures to China and said: ‘Guys, it’s great you make so much money in China, but you won’t keep it for very long. Maybe it’s 10 years, maybe it’s 20 years, but the Chinese use you to develop their own industry’.”That is exactly what seems to be happening. VW made €5.2bn from its Chinese joint ventures in 2015, but will make around €2.7bn this year, despite the market having grown. The company has been struggling to compete with newer domestic entrants.Given these headwinds, what, I ask, is the bull case for Germany’s auto powerhouses?Ellinghorst’s first two suggestions are unsurprising. Drastically reduce spending on combustion engines and petrol/diesel models, and be more rigorous on pricing, without which “all the restructuring is worth nothing”. His third recommendation, however, does not come from an Excel spreadsheet. “The product must be exciting and emotional,” he says. “Porsche’s Taycan (which is outselling the 911) is probably the best example. It is so far the only example.” Noticeably absent from his bull case is software, I point out.German manufacturers are at pains to point out that their future is tech. “Software will be THE differentiator to decide how successful Volkswagen will be in the NEWAUTO-world” VW boss Diess declared to an attentive LinkedIn audience earlier this month.But while software will play a role in improved pricing, in autonomous driving and over-the-air updates, Ellinghorst is less convinced that there is a “transformational revenue stream from selling new software services.”Ellinghorst leaves the scene with some of the items on his wish list being ticked off. While German automakers look even cheaper over the past 18 months, Daimler finally spun off its truck unit, and Mercedes, having realised amid the supply chain crisis that it can make far more money selling fewer cars, is among those to have given up chasing volume.But for all his notes over the years, his own direction of travel is perhaps his most telling analysis. Ellinghorst is off to join data science company QuantCo. Among other things, it uses algorithms to help auto companies improve on pricing.*Earlier error in text corrected.
82  Brussels is launching legal action against Warsaw over rulings made by Poland’s top court, which this year found key elements of EU law to be incompatible with the country’s constitution.The decision announced by the European Commission on Wednesday marks a further escalation in the rule of law battles between Poland and the EU.The commission said it was taking the action because of “serious concerns” regarding rulings by the Polish Constitutional Tribunal in July and October. These court decisions “expressly” challenged the primacy of EU law, the commission said, adding that Poland now had two months to respond to the complaint.The commission also said it had “serious doubts about the independence and impartiality” of the constitutional tribunal and that it “no longer meets the requirements of a tribunal previously established by law”.The launch of the infringement procedure is the latest in a succession of legal steps by the commission as it contests changes to Poland’s court and judicial system that the ruling Law and Justice party have said were necessary to increase efficiency.Brussels can bring infringement procedures against member states when they do not respect or fully implement EU laws. The cases start with letters and can ultimately be brought before the European Court of Justice and result in financial penalties. Brussels fears that the changes being made in Poland threaten the country’s judicial independence and the fundamental legal bonds that hold the EU together. It has been engaged in a five-year struggle with Warsaw over rule of law concerns related to judicial reforms, including an attempt to purge the Supreme Court and the introduction of a disciplinary regime that allows judges to be punished for the content of their rulings. The EU’s top court has ruled that several elements of Poland’s overhaul are incompatible with EU law.In its statement, the commission said the rulings by the tribunal were a breach of “general principles of autonomy, primacy, effectiveness and uniform application of Union law and the binding effect of rulings of the Court of Justice”, adding that they also breached rights to effective judicial protection in the EU.“We’ve tried to engage in a dialogue but the situation is not improving,” Didier Reynders, the EU’s justice commissioner, posted on Twitter. “Fundamentals of the EU legal order, notably the primacy of EU law, must be respected.”Poland’s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki hit back at the commission, saying that Brussels misunderstood the powers it had been granted. “More and more EU states realise that there must be a limit somewhere to these competences,” he told a press conference. “The development of bureaucratic centralism in Brussels is continuing and unfortunately it needs to be blocked.”Poland’s deputy justice minister Sebastian Kaleta branded the move an “attack on the Polish constitution and our sovereignty”.The stand-off between Brussels and Warsaw has already affected Poland’s bid for its share of the EU’s €800bn Next Generation recovery fund, which the commission said earlier this month would be delayed into the new year along with Hungary’s request for funds.European officials have said Poland should scrap its disciplinary chamber, change the disciplinary rules and reinstate dismissed judges as conditions for approving Warsaw’s request for pandemic recovery funding, which it submitted in May.The new year is also likely to bring an ECJ judgment that is widely expected to find that a new rule of law conditionality mechanism, which seeks to protect the bloc’s budget from violations by member states, is legally sound and compatible with EU treaties.Poland and Hungary have challenged the legality of the mechanism. If the new rules are upheld by the ECJ, it would remove a political roadblock to the commission commencing procedures against member states where there are rule of law concerns.Brussels sent letters to both Poland and Hungary last month setting out detailed lists of questions on possible breaches to the rule of law, signalling an informal step in this direction.
83  Brussels wants to take a €12bn annual slice of the EU’s emissions trading scheme (ETS) and use it to repay recovery fund debts and support vulnerable households, as the European Commission makes a pitch for fresh revenue streams from member states.Proposals from the commission would also give it the lion’s share of the new carbon border adjustment mechanism that will tax high-polluting imports, gaining another €1bn a year in revenues. And Brussels would take a chunk of reallocated taxing rights on multinationals, proposed under the recent OECD deal, yielding it up to €4bn of extra revenue.The package of new EU “own resources”, worth up to €17bn a year from 2026 onwards, would revolutionise the way the commission raises money, but is likely to encounter difficult negotiations with member states that will chafe at granting Brussels new revenue lines. Brussels argues the extra cash is necessary to repay the unprecedented borrowings that will be amassed under its €800bn pandemic recovery programme.Member states agreed last year with the commission and parliament to work towards introducing new own resources, but the sources of the funds will be controversial. The ETS is under attack from some countries that argue the surging carbon trading price — which has hit records above €90 a tonne of CO2 this month — is driving up household energy bills.The commission argued that the record price has generated an additional €11bn of profits for EU governments in 2021 from a year earlier. ETS revenues currently stay with the member states.The ETS is a central pillar of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction strategy, which aims to hit net zero emissions by 2050. Brussels wants to extend the scheme by creating a smaller carbon trading market for buildings and cars — a measure that has met fierce opposition from the likes of France and Spain and poorer countries that face rising costs from the energy transition such as Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.The own resources proposal would siphon off a quarter of the total revenue generated by the ETS and divert it to the EU budget to help pay off recovery fund debts that are due to be repaid by 2058. Brussels also wants to use money generated by the ETS to create a Social Climate Fund to compensate the poorest households who will bear the brunt of rising energy prices.Brussels estimates the fund’s size at about €24bn split over 2025-27, but the measure has come under fire from fiscally hawkish northern countries wanting to scrap the planned fund, and governments in the south arguing that the compensation should be much larger.Johannes Hahn, the EU budget commissioner, said he was confident member states would rally behind the own resources proposals. However, he said the hefty price tag on the Social Climate Fund meant that a second set of proposals would be needed in 2023 for further new own resources, to make up the full amount needed to repay the NextGenerationEU debts.The ideas on the table would, he said, include a financial transactions tax — something the EU has struggled to win political backing for since the idea was first mooted in 2011.Today’s package from the commission also sets out plans for Brussels to take 15 per cent of the money raised in the EU under the OECD deal on global taxation, struck between 137 countries in October. The deal requires the largest multinationals to pay more tax where they actually do business, and the commission estimates it will generate revenues for the EU budget of between €2.5bn and €4bn a year.Brussels is also publishing a separate directive on Wednesday that will implement the other pillar of the recent global OECD deal that introduces a global minimum corporate tax.This will set the new 15 per cent minimum effective tax rate for companies across the EU. The directive closely follows model rules released on Monday by the OECD as to how countries should implement the minimum tax. But, in a departure from the OECD, the EU plans to extend the tax to purely domestic companies with more than €750m in annual revenues, not just multinationals. This has been done to ensure the new tax does not distinguish between foreign and domestic companies in a way that would violate the bloc’s fundamental freedoms.The development makes the EU the first region to start implementing the global tax deal but, in order for the deal to come into effect by 2023 as planned, all 137 countries that have signed up to it must legislate and ratify the agreement by that date.The plan to implement the minimum tax comes alongside a crackdown on the use of shell companies to dodge tax within the EU. This is part of a broader package of measures aimed at ensuring businesses shoulder a fairer share of the costs of public services. A commission directive will aim to make it harder for businesses to set up entities that conduct little actual economic activity but are used to reduce tax bills.The flurry of proposals is part of a global effort to reduce companies’ opportunities to exploit mismatches and gaps in tax rules around the world, shifting profits to lower-tax jurisdictions and depriving finance ministries of revenue.
84  Berlin-based Delivery Hero is withdrawing from the German market for the second time in three years, citing rising rider costs and increased competition in the food delivery business in its home country.The ten-year-old company, which is Germany’s most valuable listed start-up, said it would wind down its Foodpanda brand in Europe’s largest economy, and sell a subsidiary in Japan, in order to “shift its resources to highly attractive growth opportunities in other markets”.“Despite having built up two fantastic Foodpanda teams showing great progress, it has become increasingly difficult to create true value for our ecosystem in these countries,” said chief executive Niklas Ostberg.He said the company was “facing a very different reality now than we did entering these markets”.Ostberg told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that while Delivery Hero could compete in Germany if it decided to invest more, raising capital has become expensive, and the company “doesn’t have an infinite supply of money”.Delivery Hero, which makes most of its revenues in Asia, first exited the German market in 2019 after selling its domestic business to Just Eat Takeaway.com. Other competitors, such as Deliveroo, left Germany soon after.In May, however, after Finnish rival Wolt launched in several German cities and Uber Eats said it would start a service in the country, Delivery Hero announced that it would rebuild its German operations.Half a year on, Foodpanda will leave six German cities — Cologne, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich and Stuttgart — with only a small service remaining in Berlin, to act as an “innovation hub”.The food delivery market in Germany has become more crowded, with DoorDash launching last month in Stuttgart. A plethora of grocery delivery apps, such as Gorillas, Flink and Getir, have also increased demand for riders, forcing companies to offer higher wages and incentives.“Once the impact of the dark store operators is considered, it is a market that has seen a lifetime of change in only a few months,” said Jefferies analysts.Delivery Hero has increasingly been focusing on growing markets in Asia and the Middle East. It finalised a $4bn takeover of South Korea’s Woowa earlier this year, after buying Dubai grocery app InstaShop in 2020.The group has also hedged its bets with a number of investments in rivals such as Gorrilas and Deliveroo.Shares in Delivery Hero, which are down almost 30 per cent in the year to date, rose 5 per cent in Frankfurt on Wednesday on news of the German exit.The company, which is yet to make a profit, raised €1.25bn via a convertible bond sale in September to fund new investments.
85  Good morning and, for 2021, goodbye. This will be the last Unhedged newsletter of the year. We’ll be back in your inboxes on January 5. It’s been a fun ride since the launch in May.We received a few more details on Tuesday about the policy that Turkey has used — successfully, for the past few days — to arrest the decline in the lira. As expected, individuals will receive a guarantee that their lira deposits will not depreciate against the dollar, after interest payments are included. What’s new is that this applies only to deposits of 3-12 months duration. Pull the money out early and not only is the guarantee lost, but any gains from a strengthening lira are deducted. The authorities not only want to stop citizens from selling lira for hard currency; it wants to discourage them from changing their minds later.The unanswered question is who will pay for these guarantees, should the lira keep falling. I more or less assumed the central bank would lend banks the money (that is, print it) and so the policy would be directly inflationary. But the consensus seems to be that the treasury will borrow the money. This could also be inflationary, but because Turkey has a reasonable debt-to-GDP ratio as it is, the fiscal capacity is probably there.Is the new policy sufficient to end the current crisis, or is it merely a holding action? Two points to bear in mind at the outset.First, every analyst I have spoken to pointed out that the current market in the lira is very thin. In the local market, few people will have been buying lira, and hard currency — dollars — are scarce. The offshore market is all but shut down. The prices we are seeing might not contain tons of information, and we should expect volatility.Second, though several people have written that the policy is “the equivalent of a rate increase”, I do not understand this notion. Yes, depositors effectively receive rate increases pegged to the currency, but banks won’t pay the central bank more for funding, and will not be paying for the new policy. Perhaps the idea is that, like a rate increase, this policy will encourage saving and discourage spending? But lack of savings wasn’t the problem before, it was lack of saving in lira. Maybe a clever reader can explain this to me.So, will it work? James Athey, a global bond and currency manager at Abrdn, thinks not. “The first thing I thought when I heard it was: Nixon’s price controls [of 1971]. When policymakers deal with the symptom, not the causes, it’s a fail.”Flight from the lira was the proximal, but not the ultimate, cause of the current crisis. The core problem, as another analyst put it to me, is that the independence of the Turkish central bank has been called into question by its quixotic rate-cutting. That has undercut local confidence in the currency, leading to lira depreciation and volatility. But the long-term worry is that the unstable currency discourages foreign direct investment. Turkey, which imports more than it exports, has depended on strong FDI flows to finance the difference. As the point was put in the FT on Tuesday:A global loss of confidence in Turkey as a destination for investment could have terrible effects. So it is essential that the current policy works, and for it to work, people have to believe that it will work. Writing in the FT, Mohamed El-Erian makes these suggestions for shoring up confidence:El-Erian’s prescription involves (just as table stakes) a humiliating public climbdown from Erdogan, effectively admitting he is responsible for the damage done. Could happen. But several analysts I spoke to said that there is another option available to Turkey: a hard-currency bailout from China, Russia, or perhaps even Middle Eastern countries, who might see geopolitical advantages to having Turkey in their debt.A few weeks ago Ethan pointed out that US stocks just keep on crushing their global peers, and this outperformance (which he called “American exceptionalism”) is largely explained by the 10 biggest American stocks. Here’s Ethan’s key chart:Michael Howell of CrossBorder Capital, in a recent note, looks for the causes of the US outperformance. He finds it is not driven by earnings growth; the US has trailed the rest of the world slightly in that department.Instead, a rise in price/earnings valuations of US stocks is the key. And he sees the higher valuations as functions of (a) rising liquidity in the economy (more currency and credit sloshing around) and (b) heavier portfolio allocations to stocks. As he puts it, only “two things really matter: how much money there is in the world, and how that money is deployed”.I tend to agree with Howell’s way of looking at things.He emphasises the role of portfolio allocation in the US, attributing the heavier allocations to stocks due to the youth of Americans (which makes them less interested in the safety of bonds) and to the US pensions industry (which is very good at pushing stocks, especially through index funds). He sums up:I think that Howell is on to something here, but you have to look at the liquidity side, and look at it globally. There is a lot of global savings looking for a home, perhaps because of economic inequality. And a lot of it comes to the US, because we have the most open and liquid financial markets (a point made by Michael Pettis and Matthew Klein, and also by Atif Mian, Ludwig Straub and Amir Sufi). This helps explain why US stocks, indeed US assets of all flavours, tend to be expensive.An excellent observation about the second aspect of the US market that Ethan pointed out — its top-heaviness — was recently made in the Policy Tensor’s blog (which I recommend). He looks at how a periodically rebalanced portfolio of the 10, 100 and 500 largest US stocks would have performed over time, and finds that the outperformance of the big 10 is a very recent phenomenon. For most of the past 30 years, the very biggest stocks underperformed, only to catch up, in effect, during Covid. A chart of annualised percentage returns:Policy Tensor is more worried about this phenomenon than I am:Another explanation for why bond yields are not responding to the threat of inflation: pension fund rebalancing.
86  Here’s a combination most corporate chieftains didn’t see coming: America’s top antitrust regulators and the EU’s competition watchdog have put aside their differences in the battle to end anti-competitive behaviours by the world’s largest companies.Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition chief, can barely contain her excitement as she admits that the appointment of Lina Khan to head of the US Federal Trade Commission has ushered in a new era of transatlantic co-operation between antitrust regulators.The combination is so powerful that Sean Heather, senior vice-president of international regulatory affairs and antitrust at the US Chamber of Commerce, said that the regulators’ co-operation constitutes “itself cartel behaviour”.For once, regulators are learning from the guys they’re trying to bring down as they accept the power of scale and synergies in winning cases.“I think it was really interesting that both Jonathan Kanter [the newly appointed chief of the US Department of Justice’s antitrust division], Lina Khan and I, we are different generations,” Vestager told the FT. “We have different years of experience.we have different educational backgrounds, but there’s a lot of alignment in the way that we think.”In the past, if one of the agencies took a lead on a case, the others would lose interest in the matter as they didn’t want to be the follower and preferred to win on their own.In this new era, the opposite is true. The agencies recognise that they’re understaffed, and that it’s basically impossible to scrutinise every deal on their own given the boom in dealmaking over the past decade.This new approach also means recognising one’s own limitations. Often when a regulator doesn’t have a case strong enough in their jurisdiction to block a deal, another agency holds more power elsewhere. If the agencies collaborate in the friendlier jurisdiction, they’ll have a better chance of winning a case.Some examples?Last week, Illumina took aim at the European Commission over its investigation into the biotech company’s $8bn takeover of Grail, even though Grail has no activities in Europe.And earlier this month regulators sued to block Nvidia’s acquisition of UK chip design company Arm from SoftBank, a deal valued at $82bn, following similar probes launched by the EU and UK.And last month, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority ordered Facebook’s parent company Meta to unwind its $315m acquisition of Giphy. Meta complained about the judgment, not least because it said Giphy had no concrete plans to enter the UK market.What do these three deals have in common? People with knowledge of the probes into Nvidia and Illumina told the FT that regulators in the US and Europe are in regular contact and have been sharing information about their cases.Whether this new phase of co-operation will actually halt the wave of dealmaking is unclear.A top banker told DD that it won’t do much to stop the avalanche of private equity transactions or Spac mergers (although the SEC might have different plans). A corporate lawyer was a little more concerned “[They] are complementing each other. Will this led to more deals getting blocked? Absolutely. What can’t get blocked here might be blocked in the European Union, and the guys in DC will be assisting them.”How much hype is too much hype?It’s the question facing both a group of jurors deliberating the fate of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes in a San Diego courtroom, and the Spac-spun electric truckmaker Nikola.The US Securities and Exchange Commission has made its view clear on the latter.Nikola has agreed to pay $125m to settle charges that it defrauded investors by misleading them on the capabilities of its vehicles, the regulator announced on Tuesday. It said Nikola’s founder and former chief executive Trevor Milton had given a false impression of the company’s technological prowess, production capabilities and financial outlook.The truckmaker, which went public via a Spac in June 2020 and was briefly valued higher than Ford despite not having sold a single vehicle, “neither admits nor denies the SEC’s findings”, it stipulated in accepting the fine.Milton, who resigned last year after a report by short seller Hindenburg Research first surfaced accusing the company of an “intricate fraud”, now faces charges from US federal prosecutors for his alleged misrepresentations.He isn’t accepting a smooth fall from grace. Milton asked a federal judge to throw out the indictment, arguing that the government unfairly relied on statements made before Nikola was a public company “in an attempt to criminalise promotional speech about Nikola’s products”, according to court filings cited by Bloomberg.DD readers may recall the company’s claims during the unveiling of its Nikola One prototype that it was fully functional, which prosecutors allege to be a lie, and the infamous video of a Nikola truck rolling downhill.Milton’s sweeping statements, driven by the same culture of hype and hubris that fuels plenty of Spacs and Silicon Valley start-ups, will be on full display as SEC chair Gary Gensler turns up the heat on the polarising investment vehicles.Lucid Motors, an electric car group under investigation by the SEC over disclosures and forecasts it made when it merged with a Spac run by former Citigroup investment banker Michael Klein, could be next.Despite Milton’s legal travails, Nikola is slowly attempting to recharge its reputation without him. “It’s real, I promise!” Nikola’s new chief executive joked to the FT a few months back while unveiling its first functioning vehicle set to hit production in 2023.If the truckmaker can chart a successful comeback story, Spac investors could be inspired to buy into the hype once more.Corporate heavyweight Sir Dave “Drastic” Lewis, once described to the FT as “quite simply the bloke who saved Tesco”, is set to become chair of GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer health division as it prepares to be spun off next year.Executives at the GSK unit are hoping such glowing reviews continue to ring true. The UK pharma giant is under siege by activists Elliott and Bluebell, which has cast doubt over whether chief executive Emma Walmsley is the right leader for a slimmed-down GSK.Elliott has also urged GSK to consider selling its consumer unit, rather than Walmsley’s plan to demerge. In hiring Lewis to lead the charge, the CEO has planted a firm foot down against her adversaries.While many shareholders would rather execute a spin-off rather than take the private equity money and run, that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re on her side. Some could be eager to avoid giving management a heap of cash to play with when they’re not sold on the top brass.If done properly, the split will be a win for Walmsley in defending her spot and also for executives at the consumer health division, who hope to gain a higher valuation on the business than pharma experts currently prescribe, as Lex writes.After lagging in the race to bring a Covid-19 vaccine to market, both sides of the business are hoping for a fresh start.Casino crackdown For two decades, Macau’s reigning casino king Alvin Chau was living a capitalist dream in China.

87  On his arrival in the Saharan Malian town of Timbuktu in 2013 to celebrate its liberation from Islamists with the help of French forces, France’s then president François Hollande was greeted as a hero and hailed with shouts of “Vive la France!”Less than nine years later, France has handed over its Timbuktu base to Malian forces and the mood in the west African country is one of bitterness and anxiety.Several hundred kilometres away in the capital Bamako, the French presence is still strong but Russian flags are also visible — on the dashboards of rust-bucket taxis; on sale in roadside stalls and at the occasional pro-Russian demonstration.Like the Americans and their allies in their two decades in Afghanistan, the French-led Operation Barkhane has failed to eradicate the jihadi threat in Mali and the Sahel region.Malian leaders have harshly criticised the French for a strategy they say has worsened the conflict and for their decision to halve their 5,000-strong military presence. They have turned to Russia, a shift that has consequences not just for security but also France’s influence.“The relationship is broken right now,” said Mahmoud Ould Mohamed, Mali’s interim minister of trade and commerce.Bamako is in talks to hire mercenaries from the Kremlin-linked Wagner Group, which is under US and EU sanctions and accused of war crimes. At the UN general assembly in September, Malian prime minister Choguel Maiga said France had abandoned Mali, leaving it with little choice but to seek “other partners”.The talks with Wagner have infuriated Paris. After two coups d’état in Bamako in less than a year, France says that the Malian government lacks legitimacy and that a partnership with Wagner could jeopardise a fight against the extremists who have killed thousands and displaced millions across the Sahel. The Wagner talks make clear how far relations between the two have deteriorated, say diplomats and analysts in the region.Although northern Mali is more secure than in 2013, violence has shifted into centre of the country where the majority of the 20m population lives. Targeted French killings of jihadis and joint operations with local forces have done little to quell the crisis.Extremist violence has also spread to Burkina Faso, which has seen wide swaths of the country fall from government control, and Niger, where hundreds of protesters in November blocked a 100-vehicle Barkhane convoy in frustration. French authorities are investigating reports that its Barkhane troops were responsible for the deaths of two protesters.This year was the most violent in the past decade for the three countries in terms of events such as terrorist attacks and battles, with 2,426 such incidents, compared with 244 in 2013, according to data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project. In terms of fatalities, it was the second deadliest after 2020, with 5,317 deaths across the three countries, compared with 949 in 2013. Mali alone recorded 948 violent events in 2021, against 230 in 2013.In June, French president Emmanuel Macron announced a drawdown of Barkhane forces. He has argued that the French military, which has lost 53 soldiers, can no longer compensate for the “non-work” of the Malian state. The decision came three months after the UN found that a French air strike had killed 19 civilians, including women and children, at a wedding party in central Mali. France denies that any civilians died in the bombing.At the same time, Paris has made a series of strategic decisions that have rankled the Malians. Over the past two years, it has focused on the more brutal Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) in the tri-border region between Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, instead of Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), the consortium of al-Qaeda-linked groups that accounts for the vast majority of violence in Mali.Mali was “wondering why France is focused on ISGS, which is about 10 per cent of the problem, instead of JNIM, which is 90 per cent”, said a western diplomat. A Macron adviser acknowledged that France had focused on the tri-border area, but said both groups were priority targets.Many also blame the Paris-led western intervention in Libya where jihadis lived and trained. “They [the French] came to play fireman in Mali, but they set the fire in Libya,” said Boubacar Sidiki Sylla, the national co-ordinator in Mali for Urgences Panafricanistes, an anti-French, pro-Russian group active across francophone Africa.With the lack of perceived results on the ground, resentment rooted in France’s colonial past has bubbled over. Macron has said he wants to break with Françafrique, the system of close commercial, economic and political ties that has defined the relationship since independence.But critics say that the 44-year-old leader has instead maintained a paternalistic approach, such as when he summoned his older African counterparts to a château in Pau, southwestern France, last summer to insist on their public support for the military operation in the face of rising anti-French sentiment.“He wants to be the boss.[but] we are a very proud people,” said former national assembly president Ali Nouhoum Diallo. One diplomat pointed out that the licence plates on embassy vehicles in Bamako are numbered in the order in which the countries recognised Mali’s independence, with France coming in at number 10. And yet, the diplomat said, “they demand this exaggerated respect, [which] does damage to them”.The senior Macron adviser said the problem was not France’s attitude but that the Malian junta was breaking its commitment to hold elections in February, and was clinging to power it seized illegitimately. “Trying to make all this seem like a fight between Mali and the old colonial power is a pretty crude trap that we [won’t] fall into,” the adviser said.This longstanding anti-colonial sentiment is meanwhile being exploited by Russia- and Wagner-linked groups, according to western officials, while Maiga’s fiery UN speech highlighted the contradictory nature of anti-French sentiment. “They are telling France to leave, but also attacking them for leaving,” said Michael Shurkin, an ex-CIA analyst and global programmes director at Dakar-based consultancy 14N Strategies.Moussa Mara, who served as prime minister in 2014-15, said France was a convenient bogeyman for a junta that, like its predecessors, had no plan to fight terrorism. “There are some people who think that if it doesn’t rain in Mali, it’s the fault of France,” he said. “Putting France up as [the] opponent — that’s a strategic political decision. You get applause. It creates an opportunity to delay the election.”Barkhane is the only significant counterterror force operating in the region, say analysts, and few even among France’s greatest critics believe weak domestic armies could effectively fight the jihadist threat. The UN’s 14,000-troop Mali peacekeeping operation Minusma is largely reactive.Paris has, for years, tried to internationalise the counter-terrorism effort in the Sahel, but with little success. The US provides surveillance and intelligence and the UN provides logistical support. The special forces Takuba Task Force that France has long touted as the mission’s next phase includes troops from Estonia, Portugal, Sweden and other European countries, but remains largely French.Among western allies, the reluctance to engage all out militarily is both political and practical — they recognise a reality clear to most Malians. “The conflict in Mali is not going to be resolved by military forces,” said Yeah Samake, an opposition politician. “It is more complex.”Many Malians, furthermore, want talks with the jihadis, whose aims on the ground tend to be local or criminal rather than religious or ideological. Paris disagrees.There are no Wagner fighters known to be in Mali yet, but two diplomats in Bamako and one senior Mali security source confirmed that there have been “suits on the ground” ironing out potential contract details, including surveying gold mines that might be used as payment.“People are convinced that the French are there to steal their natural resources,” said Shurkin. “Meanwhile, they want to turn to the Russians, who are explicitly there for that purpose.”With France drawing down and no one else coming in, said a western diplomat, it was little surprise Mali had reached out to Russia. “The junta is desperately asking every western country for military assistance.even the least martial European countries, but everyone says no,” said a western diplomat. “They are saying we are drowning in a sea of insecurity and we need to grab something.”Even Diallo, a harsh critic of France right back to his student days in pre-independence Senegal, has few illusions about Russian help. “Mali can work with different partners to unify the country, but thinking the Russians will come here and die for Mali? No. You’re fooling yourself.”Additional reporting by Victor Mallet in Paris
88  EU member states will still need to offer “credible” plans to cut their debts even if they are allowed extra leeway to make green investments, a top EU official said, in a challenge to countries wanting to loosen the union’s spending rules.Brussels is looking at potential reforms to the EU’s stability and growth pact, the bloc’s fiscal rule book. One idea is a green “golden rule” to allow environmental spending to be stripped out of member states’ deficits when assessing compliance with the pact. Advocates say doing so would spur the EU’s green transition.Valdis Dombrovskis, European Commission executive vice-president, indicated he was willing to consider the idea, but said budgetary incentives for green spending had to be twinned with a commitment to continue reducing overall debt burdens.“It will be important to see how we achieve credible debt-reduction trajectories to ensure building fiscal buffers to face new challenges,” he said. “It’s clear when we look at debt-reduction trajectories, it concerns all the public debt — not bits and pieces of public debt, or public debt from which some parts of public debt are being excluded.”Dombrovskis, a former Latvian prime minister, takes a tough stance on fiscal policy matters within the commission, and his views will be influential when it comes to the outcome of the discussions.Some northern European member states — generally more fiscally hawkish — fear creating precedents for excluding other categories of public spending, undermining budget discipline.The commission is consulting on reforming EU spending rules to account for the massive debt blowouts that have taken place during the pandemic. The pact is currently suspended to allow member states a freer hand to respond to the crisis.Dombrovskis said none of the process was “pre-cooked” and declined to predict what the final proposals would look like.EU capitals are making their views clear as debate intensifies. France, which will take over the EU presidency in January, is calling for reforms to incentivise public investments in key priorities such as the green transition. Italy is doing the same.Paolo Gentiloni, the EU’s economics commissioner, has also been pushing for a relaxation of the rules to permit higher public investment and loosen debt-reduction requirements. In an interview with the Financial Times this month, Gentiloni also floated the idea of a green investment fund to be set up as successor to the EU’s €800bn pandemic recovery fund.Dombrovskis said he saw a “relatively broad consensus” on the need to simplify the stability and growth pact, moving away from tough-to-measure variables such as structural budget balances.One model would set a ceiling on public spending growth and require member states to work towards a debt “anchor”. This idea, put forward by the advisory European Fiscal Board, is a “simpler way” to set budget rules, Dombrovskis said, because it uses clearer indicators. It is “certainly one of the directions [in which] we may be looking”, he said.The commissioner hinted at associated reforms of the EU’s debt-reduction rules. These are aimed at member states with debts above 60 per cent of gross domestic product and are meant to ensure that those countries cut their debt ratio by 1/20th of the overshoot each year.An increasing number of capitals accept that this would be too brutal a fiscal retrenchment for some member states. The EU’s overall public debt burden is headed to 92 per cent of GDP this year, with Italy’s forecast to hit above 150 per cent of GDP.Dombrovskis said he expected “adjustments” to the rules and said debt-reduction trajectories needed to be “credible but realistic”.
89  Commerzbank’s chief executive has agreed that state support for the lender should eventually end but added it was an important boost to progress on a restructuring that will cut staff in Germany by a third.Manfred Knof, who joined Commerzbank at the start of the year from Deutsche Bank, is aiming to cut one in three jobs at the bank in Germany by 2024 and to close almost half its branches.Berlin bailed out Commerzbank in 2009 and remains its single largest shareholder with a 15.6 per cent stake. Knof was parachuted in after a boardroom battle that led to the resignation of both the chief executive and the chair in the summer of 2020.Knof told the Financial Times that the government’s support for the restructuring had been “very helpful” for securing employee support.Commerzbank has had high costs and weak revenue growth for years and has been hit hard by low interest rates. It is one of the most important lenders to Germany’s small and medium-sized companies, and finances one-third of the country’s exports.New finance minister Christian Lindner, the leader of the pro-market Free Democrats, in the past has called for the full privatisation of the bank. He also campaigned on the wider promise of reducing the government’s influence in business and dialling down state ownership of private sector companies.“Over the medium term, I support and approve the view that a private-sector bank like Commerzbank should not have the government as a shareholder,” Knof told the Financial Times. He added that he was focused on the “here and now” and praised workers’ representatives for their constructive approach to the restructuring.In November, Commerzbank said it would make a small profit this year, despite more than €1bn in restructuring costs and a €200m hit from a botched IT project that was stopped by Knof.The finance ministry declined to comment on the future of the government’s shareholding. “The handling of the government’s stake [in Commerzbank] is decided by the interministerial steering committee,” it said in a statement.Knof told the FT that the restructuring was well on track. Some 5,200 employees have already signed voluntary redundancy agreements to leave the bank over the coming three years, from a target of cutting 10,000 jobs. By November, the bank had also ironed out the final details of a €1.9bn severance plan with unions.“Many sceptics said that it would be impossible to strike a deal within just one year,” he said, adding that this pessimism was proved wrong thanks to the “massive commitment and discipline” from unions.Knof said that the swift agreement was an “important message to the capital market and our stakeholder: the social partnership [between employers and employees] in Germany is working”. Germany’s new chancellor Olaf Scholz, a Social Democrat, in February backed Commerzbank’s turnround plan. “Everyone knows that something draconian needs to be done,” he said when he was finance minister.At the moment, a sale of the government’s stake would leave taxpayers with heavy losses: it is currently worth just €1.3bn, some 75 per cent less than what the government paid for it more than a decade ago.
90  Vladimir Putin has warned of “appropriate military-technical measures” in response to the threat of Nato’s expansion towards Russia’s borders, in a significant ratcheting up of tensions with the western alliance.The US said it would soon start diplomatic talks in an attempt to ease fears of conflict over Ukraine. Russia has deployed about 100,000 troops on its border with the country, sparking western fears of a possible invasion.Putin told a group of senior military officers on Tuesday that Moscow would “react harshly to hostile steps”. Russia published draft security proposals last week demanding that Nato and the US cut their presence in eastern Europe, agree never to admit Ukraine into the alliance and rule out ever deploying troops there.The proposals would reshape much of the entire post-cold war European security order by in effect restricting Nato military deployments to its borders before 1997, when it began to admit former communist states in eastern Europe. Russia’s demand for concessions that Nato has previously made clear are unacceptable has led many western officials and experts to fear they are a pretext for conflict.Putin said the Kremlin was “seriously concerned” about Nato deployments near Russia’s borders and the possibility of it having hypersonic weapons in Ukraine that could strike Moscow in less than 10 minutes.“If our western colleagues continue this clearly aggressive stance, we will take appropriate military-technical measures in response and react harshly to hostile steps,” Putin said. “And I want to stress that we are within our rights to do what is required to ensure Russia’s security and sovereignty.”The US on Tuesday said it was preparing talks with Putin over his security concerns. Karen Donfried, US assistant secretary of state, said bilateral negotiations would begin next month, despite alarm among EU and Nato member states that many of the demands are impossible and would weaken the western military alliance.“We are prepared to discuss those proposals that Russia put on the table. There are some things that we are prepared to work on, and that we do believe that there is merit in having a discussion,” Donfried said.“There are other things in those documents that the Russians know will be unacceptable.”Western officials have stressed the need to engage with Putin diplomatically to prevent the situation from deteriorating. Nato member states also met on Tuesday to discuss possible formats for multilateral talks with Russia, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe is preparing wider talks on the crisis.“Let me be clear: there will be no talks on European security without Europe,” Donfried added. “The key here is alliance unity and alliance cohesion.”On Tuesday, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said the US was pursuing multiple diplomatic channels, and would wait to see “where any of these conversations go”.He added: “Whether that leads to at some point another meeting between the president and President Putin, I’ll leave that for another day, but [there are] no plans to do that now.”Russia denies western claims that it is considering military steps towards Ukraine. Putin did not specify what he meant by “military-technical means” or the specific context in which Russia would deploy them.Deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov, Moscow’s official in charge of the security talks with the US and Nato, used the same phrase last week to say that Russia would be forced to deploy banned nuclear-capable ballistic missiles in Europe if the west ignored its demands.Putin claimed the US was considering an armed incursion from Ukraine into Russian territory and said Nato expansion had boxed it into a corner. “We can’t retreat any further,” he said. “Do they really think we’ll sit idly as they create threats against us?”The US has committed $450m in defensive military assistance to Ukraine so far this year as part of $2.5bn since 2014. Donfried said on Tuesday that President Joe Biden had told Putin that if Russia attacked Ukraine, the US would provide additional defensive materiel.Donfried said that alongside talks, the US and its EU allies were “poised to move in a dramatic way” if Russia took “any further military aggression against Ukraine”.The US and EU were consulting on “specific packages of sanctions”, she said, without naming measures.Asked if evicting Russia from the international Swift banking network was part of those packages, she replied: “There is no sanctions option that is off the table here, and we are talking about things that would have severe consequences for Russia’s economy and financial system.”Additional reporting by Aime Williams
91  European gas prices have surged to new record highs as flows from a key Russian pipeline stopped, spooking buyers that have been scrambling to secure supplies during a deepening energy crunch.Gas for delivery in Europe next month, which was already trading at record levels, jumped more than 20 per cent on Tuesday to close at €181 per megawatt hour.After four months in which waning confidence in Russian supply had already pushed wholesale gas prices to their highest in history, the latest price rise threatens to drive up energy bills further for households and industry across the continent and add to inflationary pressures just as temperatures are forecast to drop.In the UK, where more than two dozen energy suppliers have already gone bust this year, prices climbed 20 per cent on Tuesday to a record 450 pence per therm.“These are astounding moves,” said Tom Marzec-Manser, head of gas analytics, at consultancy ICIS, adding that traders were racing to close positions ahead of Christmas with “so many risks on the air”.As prices in Europe have pushed higher, tankers of liquefied natural gas bound for Asia have rerouted to European ports, but increased deliveries of LNG were unlikely to have an immediate impact. Wholesale European gas prices are up more than 800 per cent in 2021, initially driven by resurgent global demand and competition with Asia when governments relaxed coronavirus restrictions earlier in the year.The latest price rally came after flows through the Yamal-Europe pipeline, one of the three routes that Russia’s state-owned Gazprom uses to supply natural gas to north-west Europe, stopped as temperatures plunged in Moscow and Gazprom decided not to book export capacity.Traders said that nuclear outages in France had also helped push up prices and noted that Germany was set to close almost half of its nuclear power capacity before the end of the year.Margrethe Vestager, European Commission executive vice-president, said the energy crisis was another reason to accelerate investments into renewables to make the EU more “self-reliant”.“The faster we get to renewables, the less exposed we are to price spikes coming from imported fossil fuels,” she said.More than a third of the EU’s gas supplies come from Russia, but this year inflows have fallen. Gazprom has declined to sell additional volumes to Europe beyond those covered by long-term contracts, while letting its own storage facilities in the continent drop to unusually low levels.Gazprom lifted exports slightly in November and added some supplies to its own storage sites, but levels remain well below where they were in 2019 and 2020. Some traders fear that a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine, which hosts one of the other main pipelines into western Europe, could disrupt supplies even further over the winter.Some European politicians and industry experts have accused Russia of withholding supply to press EU leaders to approve a controversial fourth pipeline, Nord Stream 2. Gazprom has dismissed the allegation and repeatedly said that it has met all of its contracts with European buyers.“There is absolutely no connection [to Nord Stream 2]. This is a purely commercial situation,” Dmitry Peskov, Kremlin spokesman, said on Tuesday, when asked about why supply along the Yamal pipeline via Poland had stopped.High prices have been a boon for Gazprom. Famil Sadygov, deputy chair, said on Tuesday that the group expected to generate record net income of more than Rbs2tn ($27bn) for 2021 and pay a dividend in excess of Rbs45 per share.The payment will deliver a windfall to the Kremlin, which owns a 38 per cent stake in the company, with an additional 12 per cent held by two other state companies. In comparison, in 2020 Gazprom paid a dividend of Rbs12.55 per share.Additional reporting by Nastassia Astrasheuskaya
92  Ethiopia’s war in Tigray was meant to be over by Christmas. Last Christmas. Instead a year has rolled by during which all sides have committed appalling human rights abuses. Only this month, details emerged of an alleged summary execution of 49 civilians by the Tigray People’s Liberation Front. Equally credible reports have found evidence of civilian massacres and mass rapes perpetrated by Ethiopian federal troops and their Eritrean and Amhara allies.Despite a recent retreat by the TPLF that has boosted federal troops, the war, which started in November 2020, trundles on. Fortunes have oscillated wildly, with one side and then the other appearing to hold the upper hand. A few weeks ago, the TPLF, once seemingly down and out, staged a blitzkrieg comeback and threatened to march on Addis. Now it has been driven back again, partly thanks to federal air power. This week, federal troops retook Lalibela, a city of rock-hewn churches in Amhara, in what the TPLF claims was a tactical retreat aimed at preparing the ground for a ceasefire.One can only hope it is so. Before this conflict began, the east African country of 110m people was among the most promising prospects on the continent. During almost three decades of effective, if highly authoritarian, rule, a TPLF-dominated government pursued a development path pioneered in East Asia. Building on high savings and investment rates, it chalked up years of double-digit growth and impressive social advances. Ethiopia was one of the few African countries with a coherent manufacturing strategy. Once associated with famine, it had a shot at reaching middle-income status.Today Ethiopia is torn apart by ethnic hatreds and age-old vendettas. The TPLF tried to solve the “ethnic question” by giving regions more autonomy, including the right to secede. But that pact failed to hold as ethnic groups, led by the Oromo and Amhara, rebelled against Tigrayan dominance. In 2018, Abiy Ahmed, an Oromo, emerged as a supposedly conciliatory force. The hope was his premiership would graft a tolerant liberal democracy on to the TPLF’s developmental state.As prime minister, Abiy’s vision of a united Ethiopia has clashed with nationalist sentiment in the country’s 10 ethnically constituted regions. Abiy compounded his problems by purging Tigrayans from power, putting him on a collision course with TPLF diehards who refused to concede that their days running the country were over.Even if you accept the dubious premise that the TPLF are no more than terrorists, Abiy’s government has undermined its case by allowing its soldiers and their allies to run rampant. Whatever crimes the TPLF have committed, it is incumbent on government forces to abide by basic norms of warfare. Addis has even enlisted troops from Ethiopia’s old enemy, Eritrea, to help crush its own people. If there is one winner from all this, it is Isaias Afwerki, the wiley Eritrean dictator.Calls by the international community for negotiations have thus far fallen on deaf ears. Both sides think their cause is just. Until recently both sides seemed to think they could win. When the fighting eventually does end, it may be difficult to put Ethiopia back together again. Even if Abiy achieves the total victory he seems to believe possible, Tigrayans are unlikely to accept being part of a federal union.That the Ethiopian project should have so dramatically unravelled is a tragedy not only for Ethiopia but for a continent that looked to it as a plausible model of development. Those in search of an African success story will have to look elsewhere.Letter in response to this article:Ethiopia needs a new model to heal its ancient divisions / From Michael Street, Noto, Sicily, Italy
93  The writer is president of Queens’ College, Cambridge, and an adviser to Allianz and GramercyHaving tried to defy internal and external economic logic by repeatedly cutting interest rates, Turkey opted this week for a new set of unorthodox measures to stabilise its currency.Whether the authorities are more successful ultimately this time around boils down to a simple question: will Turkish households and companies view this “circuit breaker” as a bridge to a more comprehensive set of measures that address the underlying drivers of economic and financial instability or, instead, as a destination that soon proves inherently unstable?It is hard to put into words how disorderly the Turkish currency markets had become by Monday afternoon. The lira had weakened to beyond TL18 per US dollar, constituting a halving of its value in just two months.The rate of depreciation was gathering momentum, as was the chaotic nature of the trading even though the central bank was intervening, thereby depleting further its international reserves.It was just a matter of time until all this also led to another leg-up in an inflation rate already above 20 per cent. A growing part of the population were opting to protect their savings by changing lira deposits into dollars and other hard currency (what economists refer to as “dollarisation”).The proximate cause of all this was the 5 percentage points cut in domestic policy rates since September at a time when both internal and external conditions called for a hike. Inflation was rising, the currency was under pressure and global monetary policy conditions were starting to tighten, especially in the emerging world.Desperate for a circuit breaker, the authorities opted this week for a set of complex measures that are best described as an interest rate equalisation mechanism with guarantees to maintain the real value of lira deposits when measured in hard currency.In addition to lowering the incentive for further dollarisation, this approach appears to have three side-benefits of interest to the Turkish authorities. First, it avoids the impact of a partial and implicit interest rate hike on the rest of the economy. Second, because the guarantee applies to 3-12-month deposits, it encourages the lengthening of the average duration of such deposits. And third, it helps alleviate heavy and mounting inflationary pressures.All this at a time when, prior to the announcement, the currency was trading in “overshoot” territory according to most economic measures.These advantages come with considerable risks. The mechanism exposes the fiscal accounts/central bank to a large financing burden unless other measures are taken to control inflation and limit renewed pressures on the currency away from dollarisation. If the mechanism fails, it will further undermine the credibility of policymakers, making it harder for the next set of measures to take hold quickly even if they are comprehensive and appropriate.It is the still-large set of Turkish lira depositors who, within weeks, will determine the outcome. If they trust the policy response and worry little about the potential collateral damage, they will encourage others to buy the domestic currency, domestic and external. The government can help this process by credibly signalling that the latest measures are not an end in themselves but rather a bridge to a more comprehensive set of policies.This would include explicit rate hikes by the central bank which, at this point, are still necessary but no longer sufficient. Turkey will also need to seek other internal anchors, such as a tightening of fiscal policy, and perhaps also external ones, such as agreement on an IMF programme that provides both funding and external validations.All this will need to be done while avoiding the understandable temptation of capital controls that would undermine a historically powerful, and still impactful open growth model that, both economically and financially, exploits Turkey’s many “competitive edges”.Through a new set of unorthodox measures, Turkey has bought itself artificial stability. This is unlikely to translate into genuine stability unless Turkish citizens are convinced that their currency crisis has truly passed.This only happens if the government quickly shifts to a more comprehensive — and, yes, more orthodox — policy approach. Failing to do this would further erode the country’s strong economic attributes. After all, there are limits to continuously defying the laws of both economics and finance.Letter in response to this article:Turkey’s savings plan still leaves it exposed to currency risk / From Professor Gulcin Ozkan, King’s Business School, King’s College London, London WC2, UK
94  Aker BP will become Europe’s largest independent oil producer after agreeing a $14bn cash and shares deal to take over all the petroleum activities of rival Lundin Energy.The joint venture between Norway’s largest industrial company and oil major BP is paying $2.2bn in cash and issuing about $11.7bn of shares to buy out the main activities of Sweden’s Lundin, responsible for the biggest North Sea oil find in decades.Shares in Aker BP rose 6 per cent on the news on Tuesday afternoon, while Lundin’s increased 2 per cent.The deal will create a larger rival to state-controlled Equinor in Norway, the most active nation in western Europe for oil and gas thanks to generous exploration incentives and a mixture of mature regions such as the North and Norwegian Seas as well as the potential for petroleum in the Arctic.“We are now creating the exploration and production company of the future, which will offer among the lowest CO2 emissions, the lowest cost, high free cash flow and the most attractive growth pipeline in the industry, with a high dividend capacity combined with a strong investment-grade credit rating,” said Aker BP’s chief executive Karl Johnny Hersvik.The combined company will have production of about 400,000 barrels of oil and gas per day with a total resource base of 2.7bn barrels, focused on Norway. It will be the second-biggest producer in Norway and the second-biggest owner of the giant Johan Sverdrup field, both behind Equinor.The decision by the Swedish group and its controlling Lundin family shareholders to sell out of its largest and most profitable assets comes just weeks after prosecutors in Stockholm charged the chair and former chief executive with complicity in grave war crimes in Sudan.The rump Lundin Energy will retain the company’s 600GWh of renewable power assets as well as any liabilities over Sudan, even though the Swedish group vigorously contests any claim of wrongdoing against it and its officials.Chair Ian Lundin said: “Creating long-term value for shareholders has been at the core of this business for 20 years since inception and this combination of Lundin Energy and Aker BP is a unique opportunity to create a future-proof independent E&P [exploration and production] company, exposing shareholders to a business with significant scale, production growth and strong free cash flow into the next decade.”Aker will own 21 per cent of the merged company, BP 16 per cent, the Lundin family 14 per cent and other shareholders 49 per cent. Aker BP said it would increase its dividend by 14 per cent to $0.475 per share from January and aim to raise it by at least 5 per cent each year from then on, assuming oil prices remain above $40 per barrel.
95  With relations between France and the UK at their lowest ebb for decades, migration experts are wondering how the two nations can resolve an escalating cross-Channel refugee crisis that periodically descends into disaster.The scale of the challenge was highlighted last month when at least 27 people died while trying to cross to the UK in a small boat, but an ensuing very public bilateral spat showed that trust and respect between the capitals had all but evaporated.There are, however, some key policy areas where experts believe common ground could and should be found in order to alleviate the humanitarian crisis: co-ordinated border surveillance and policing, swaps of displaced people between the UK and continental Europe, and the opening of safe and legal routes to apply for British asylum from outside of the UK.Alan Manning, a labour market economist at the London School of Economics and former chair of the UK government’s Migration Advisory Committee, said it would not be “terribly easy” to reach an agreement that satisfied both sides.Events of the last month bear that out. After the recent tragedy, UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s decision to post a letter to Emmanuel Macron, French president, on Twitter, making demands that had already been rejected, temporarily blocked a collaborative approach. UK home secretary Priti Patel’s invitation to a pan-European emergency meeting in Calais was rescinded as a result.Both sides have doggedly pursued an aggressive law enforcement approach to dissuade would-be asylum seekers but France has also continually called for alternative, safe routes for people to apply for refugee status in the UK.Manning said such a request was justified, on the grounds that the UK’s share of refugees per head of population was below the world average, meaning that the country was not currently doing its “fair share”.But in his widely publicised letter, Johnson suggested the immediate return of migrants arriving in the UK from France. This offers only downsides for France, which is processing a large number of asylum applications itself amid a backdrop of hostility towards immigration that has come to the fore ahead of the presidential election next spring.The UK has also suggested that it could send soldiers to patrol the French coast along with local officials; a suggestion Paris has rejected because it would be an embarrassing affront to its national sovereignty.Speaking to fellow ministers earlier this month, France’s interior minister Gérald Darmanin, stressed an oft-repeated line by French officials and humanitarian organisations when he said the “English have to create a legal route of immigration to Great Britain”. “That is the only way, when you want to join your father, your mother, your wife, or your husband in England,” he said.The problem is there is disagreement over what such routes would look like.Paris is clear that it does not want an asylum application centre on its soil. Such a processing centre “would create a huge pull factor to France”, said one government official. Other nations and territories have also expressed reluctance to participate.Instead, the official added, the UK should create avenues for people to apply for refugee status from British consulates overseas — an option that France has adopted for some refugees from Syria and Afghanistan.Virginie Guiraudon, a leading European migration expert at Sciences Po in Paris, added that London should harness the data it already had about the people who are more eager to make asylum applications to the UK, rather than the EU, and create quotas for them.“We’re talking about Kurdish Iraqis, Iranians, some Afghans, and people from the Horn of Africa,” she said, adding that most of them were keen on the UK because they had family connections or they speak English.Other analysts point to the relatively modest number of people that the UK permits to enter on resettlement programmes from conflict-affected regions, and suggest the country would only ever allow in very few refugees under such quotas.In contrast, some 80 per cent of people launching asylum applications in the UK can expect eventually to win some form of refugee protection.Pascal Brice, former director of the French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons, a public body, said migration control centres for asylum seekers for both the EU and UK should be established at all of the EU’s external borders to handle applications.EU member states have shown some interest in such a system but are reluctant to house the centres on their own soil, according to French officials.Another idea of some interest on both sides of the Channel is for the UK to swap some displaced people — notably unaccompanied minors and people with close family ties — who arrive from mainland Europe for vulnerable individuals in Calais.Darmanin said that France was “not against” the idea. But, he said, it would only work if the exchange was “one for one”, which the UK has not accepted, and that any agreement would have to be made between the UK and the EU.The UK has instead, so far unsuccessfully, sought to reach deals with individual EU countries.Meanwhile, the UK is attempting to stem small-boat migration via aggressive policing and by making Britain more hostile to people seeking asylum.The centrepiece of this strategy is the Nationality and Borders Bill, currently making its way through parliament, which for the first time will make it a criminal offence to enter the UK by illegal means to seek asylum. Critics argue that this provision puts the UK in breach of its obligations as a signatory of the UN’s 1951 Refugee Convention.UK authorities have already prosecuted significant numbers of asylum seekers who steered small boats for the crime of facilitating illegal immigration, even though there was no suggestion they had been part of a smuggling effort. Four have had their convictions quashed on appeal.“The problem is, we don’t have the same goals,” said the French official, pointing to the safe avenues it has created for people to apply for asylum on its soil. “The UK has sold [its public] something it can’t achieve, which is stopping migration altogether.”
96  Former Ukraine president Petro Poroshenko accused the incumbent Volodymyr Zelensky of risking national unity at a time of heightened fears of a full-blown Russian invasion by trying to sideline him through a politically motivated prosecution.“Today, when all of Europe and the whole world including all of Ukraine need to unite against [Russian president Vladimir] Putin, strange things are happening in Ukraine,” Poroshenko, the leading opposition rival to Zelensky, said in a Facebook video post from Warsaw on Tuesday.Pledging to return to Ukraine in the new year, Poroshenko was speaking a day after Kyiv prosecutors and investigators charged him with treason and financing terrorism for securing coal supplies from Russian-occupied breakaway eastern regions while president from 2014 to 2019. He denies the allegations.The criminal cases against Poroshenko, a confectionery and media magnate, come amid a broader crackdown by Zelensky against oligarchs including Rinat Akhmetov, the country’s most powerful businessman.But the timing has increased concerns about national unity and stability at a time when US intelligence suspects that Russia is plotting to deepen aggression against Ukraine after having annexed Crimea and fomented a separatist war in the country’s east in 2014.“I’ve received a greeting from the president’s office that they will be understanding if I stay in Europe,” Poroshenko said in comments that describe the charges as an attempt to exile him as an opposition leader.Mocking Zelensky’s past as a comedian and film producer, Poroshenko added: “I will not give them such a gift and will return to Ukraine in the first half of January.according to my schedule, not according to the schedule of a powerful screenwriter for Zelensky.”Denying wrongdoing, Poroshenko described the case against him as “crossing of red lines”, adding “this is no longer a joke”.While abroad, Poroshenko said he was meeting Polish and other European politicians to “form a powerful coalition in support of Ukraine against Russia”. He said Russia had amassed more than 100,000 troops on Ukraine’s eastern borders “with the threat of invasion”.Ukrainian authorities on Friday tried to physically serve Poroshenko with a notice of suspicion relating to the case brought by investigators and to be heard by the general prosecutor’s office. But the MP and leader of a top opposition party rushed into his vehicle and was driven away to the airport.Ilya Novikov, a lawyer for Poroshenko, told the Financial Times that the foreign trip was pre-planned and included a meeting this weekend in Turkey with the spiritual leader of the Eastern Orthodox Church.Novikov described the case as the most recent of “100 or more criminal cases where Poroshenko’s name appears”. Ukraine had no choice, the lawyer argued, but to buy coal from the Russian-controlled eastern regions in 2014-15 to avoid power blackouts.There was no immediate comment on the case from Zelensky, who has previously made allegations about corrupt activities by Poroshenko while he was in power.“The US is closely following the case against former president Poroshenko,” the US embassy in Kyiv said in a tweet on Tuesday. “[It is] crucial that the process and outcome be based on the rule of law, not politics.”Poroshenko is polling second behind Zelensky ahead of presidential elections in 2024. The incumbent beat Poroshenko in 2019 with a landslide 73 per cent of the vote, but his popularity has since fallen by two-thirds.“The country has one issue now and so does Zelensky.and that is dealing with the gravest of all possible threats from Russia,” said James Sherr, a senior fellow of the Estonian Foreign Policy Institute at the International Centre for Defence and Security.“He has to rally the country,” added Sherr.
97  The writer is Fritz Stern Chair at the Brookings InstitutionThirty years after the outbreak of the Yugoslav wars, the western alliance is once more facing the possibility of a major armed conflict at Europe’s periphery. Vladimir Putin’s Russia has amassed an estimated 100,000 troops near the border of Ukraine. Western intelligence services and analysts are concerned that he might be preparing to invade soon.There is a spine-chilling sense of déjà-vu about it all. In most key aspects, however, today’s situation is notably worse than that of three decades ago.In the 1990s, the US was reluctant to get involved in ending the bloodshed in the Balkans. Yet once it decided to intervene, a sense of righteous responsibility as the cold war’s victor carried it through, and its European allies with it. A demoralised and nearly bankrupt post-Soviet Russia kept its distance, but diplomatic pressure from Moscow helped force the Serbian dictator Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw his forces from the breakaway province of Kosovo, ending Nato’s air war against Belgrade. Germany participated in that operation — but only after an agonising debate over whether its history permitted it to do so.Today, the Biden administration says it is firmly committed to the security of Europe and Ukraine’s sovereignty. Yet it is crippled by political polarisation and painfully aware of its limited influence over an electorate weary of war and distrustful of politics. The few hawks remaining in Washington are laser-focused on China. “Restraint” increasingly finds bipartisan favour. The tumultuous withdrawal from Afghanistan has damaged US standing in the world and sapped alliance cohesion.Russia, meanwhile, has been helping Belarus to weaponise migration into the EU. It has blown up one of its satellites with a missile, creating a debris field in low-earth orbit that menaces the space-based infrastructure of globalisation. State-owned Gazprom is not complying with its commitments to fill gas storage facilities in Germany, despite tight supplies and sharply rising prices. Putin has recently referred to combat in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, where Russia has waged a proxy war since 2014 that has claimed more than 13,000 casualties, as “genocide”. A wish list of security guarantees presented by the Kremlin to the US and Nato last week amounts to a veto on further expansion of the alliance, a removal of all US nuclear weapons in Europe, including B-61 bombs in Germany, as well as a military withdrawal from the territories of the former Warsaw Pact and Soviet Union.This is no longer just about Ukraine. In effect, Russia is demanding a sphere of interest that begins at Germany’s eastern border, and the end of nuclear sharing in Europe — unacceptable proposals for the west. Even if this is merely brinkmanship intended to bring about diplomatic negotiations or a coup in Kyiv, it is stupendously risky.But there is another 30th anniversary this year: that of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, on December 26 1991. In a recently aired documentary, Putin called this event the demise of “historical Russia”, adding that it had forced him to moonlight as a taxi driver. In an essay published in June, he denied Ukrainian nationhood. Russian prosecutors have moved to ban Memorial, the Russian human rights group dedicated to documenting the crimes of Stalinism. What if Putin the amateur historian is moving to rewrite history?Nato and the EU have responded with a generalised offer of dialogue, rejected demands for vetoes and withdrawals, and warned Russia of “massive consequences and severe costs” should it take military action against Ukraine — leaving open exactly what they mean by that. The ambiguity could be deliberate, so as not to offer a pretext for escalation. It could also be an attempt to hide divisions in Europe. Mario Draghi, Italy’s prime minister, has expressed scepticism about a possible Russian invasion, while Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania’s foreign minister, says Moscow is “really gearing up for war”.As for Germany, the time when it could plead its history as an excuse to stand aside is long past. Europe’s economic anchor nation is essential to any western effort to deter Putin. Every potential measure — sanctions on Russian entities, cutting Russia out of the Swift electronic payment system, cancelling the Nord Stream 2 pipeline — would be financially and politically costly for Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s new government.But what is the alternative? According to Putin: war in Europe, waged by a nuclear great power. The Yugoslav wars lasted a decade, and claimed an estimated 140,000 lives. The Balkans remains a troubled region.Still, Putin would do well to keep in mind that two of the six former republics of communist Yugoslavia are now in the EU. Four are in Nato. And Milosevic ended up in front of a UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
98  Turkey’s lira jumped sharply after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan unveiled a new savings scheme that analysts described as a backdoor interest rate rise that could erode the public finances.The currency has risen more than 40 per cent to trade at TL12.84 against the dollar on Tuesday, dramatically reversing course after hitting a record low of TL18.36 the previous day. The chaotic day of trading on Monday marked the most volatile day for the lira since records from Refinitiv began in the 1990s.The intense volatility was triggered by a new plan by Erdogan to lure Turkish savers away from the dollar and gold by compensating them for exchange rate losses if they hold their money in lira.Refet Gurkaynak, a professor of economics at Ankara’s Bilkent University, described the new scheme as “in effect, a powerful interest rate hike”. He said that it could bring stability to the currency but warned that it could also have “dangerous consequences”.Erdogan, a staunch opponent of high interest rates, has ordered a succession of rate cuts in recent months despite double-digit inflation.While the Turkish president has claimed that his “new economic model” will boost exports, investments and job creation, it has put huge pressure on the Turkish lira. The currency had lost about 50 per cent of its value against the dollar in the three months before Erdogan’s announcement.Wolfango Piccoli, a Turkey analyst at the consultancy Teneo, said that the savings scheme amounted to a “stealthy rate hike” — and one that would be solely determined by the exchange rate.“This huge exchange-rate-indexed interest rate hike means that taxpayers will be financing the wealthy so that they will not lose on the [foreign exchange] front,” he wrote in a note to clients, adding that the scheme would place almost all of the currency risk on the state.An exodus of foreign investors from Turkey in recent years has meant that the pressure on the lira has been driven in large part by Turkish citizens and businesses.Reluctant to save money in lira, whose value has been eroded by soaring inflation and negative real interest rates, they have flocked instead to the dollar and gold. That in turn has put further pressure on the currency.In an attempt to reverse the “dollarisation” trend, Erdogan announced late on Monday that his government would offer “a new financial alternative to citizens” that he said would alleviate their concerns about the impact of the plunging lira on their savings.The government would compensate savers, he said, for any losses if the decline in the exchange rate exceeded the interest rate offered by banks.“From now on, there will no longer be any need for any of our citizens to switch their savings from lira to foreign currency because they are concerned that the exchange rate may rise,” the Turkish president said.The Turkish Treasury said that the scheme would be open only to individuals, not businesses, and that they would be required to commit to locking their money away for a minimum of three months to benefit from the exchange rate guarantee.While it provided no details about how the initiative would be funded, analysts voiced concern that the Turkish Treasury would bear the risk of compensating savers for any exchange rate losses.While Turkey’s public finances remain strong compared with many other emerging markets, the foreign exchange component of central government debt reached 60 per cent of the total in October, up from 39 per cent in 2017. That means that, each time the lira has slid against the dollar, it has become more expensive for the government to service its debt burden.Citigroup said that, from the standpoint of the Treasury, the new scheme “may turn out to be a more costly alternative to a tighter monetary policy stance in the event that lira deposit rates fall short of a depreciation of the currency and thus adversely affecting fiscal performance”.“We believe these measures can bring temporary relief while the government tries to further implement its new economic model agenda,” said Luis Costa, a currency strategist at Citi, adding that the bank was scrapping its recommendation to bet on further lira declines.However, the scheme would do little to discourage Turkish savers from seeking non-lira assets as a hedge against rising prices, he added. “We do not see how that can fix the local currency asset issues in Turkey which arise from the [currency-led] inflation,” Costa said.Letter in response to this article:History is worrying guide to Turkey’s savings scheme / From Michael A Gavin, Ottawa, ON, Canada
99  Lina Khan’s selection as head of the US Federal Trade Commission has ushered in a new era of co-operation between regulators on both sides of the Atlantic, according to Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition chief.Vestager told the Financial Times she saw “a lot of alignment” with her American colleagues on policymaking and legal enforcement, as European regulators welcome a new age of trustbusting under US President Joe Biden.Her comments reflect a new closeness between competition regulators in the US, EU and UK as they pursue parallel cases into proposed deals by Facebook, Nvidia and Illumina. Officials in the Biden administration say such collaboration will be essential as they look to toughen America’s approach to competition law, especially in the technology sector.The transatlantic co-operation has raised alarms in US boardrooms, however, where executives have already been highly critical of Khan, who has been credited with overhauling the Democratic party’s comparatively hands-off approach to competition policy.By convincing EU authorities to take up the Biden administration’s priorities, critics argue, she has extended the power of an agency that has occasionally found itself constrained by US court rulings, most recently bringing a sweeping FTC case against Facebook.“We find it inspiring when we see the Facebook case that the FTC filed, and we follow their investigations,” Vestager told the FT about the commission’s case against the social media company.“I think it was really interesting that both Jonathan Kanter [the newly appointed chief of the US Department of Justice’s antitrust division], Lina Khan and I, we are different generations,” said Vestager, 53. “We have different years of experience.we have different educational backgrounds, but there’s a lot of alignment in the way that we think”. Despite Vestager’s warm words, some in corporate America argue that regulators are colluding to block transactions they do not like, even if they do not fall strictly under their jurisdictions.Sean Heather, senior vice-president of international regulatory affairs and antitrust at the US Chamber of Commerce, said: “International commitments direct antitrust regulators to keep their hands off deals that have zero legitimate local nexus to their jurisdiction.”He added: “‘Divide and conquer’ strategies among antitrust agencies to block mergers in order to evade a jurisdiction based review on the merits would be itself cartel behaviour.”Last week, Illumina took aim at the European Commission over its investigation into the biotech company’s $8bn takeover of Grail, even though Grail has no activities in Europe.Daniel Beard, the company’s lawyer, told a hearing at the European General Court: “If the commission is going to radically change policy, then businesses should know. Think about business certainty.”Illumina’s case is just one of three under scrutiny from regulators in the US and Europe, as the watchdogs across the Atlantic become increasingly aligned.US regulators earlier this month sued to block Nvidia’s acquisition of UK chip design company Arm from SoftBank, a deal valued at $82bn, following similar probes launched by the EU and UK.And last month, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority ordered Facebook’s parent company Meta to unwind its $315m acquisition of Giphy. Meta complained about the judgment, not least because it said Giphy had no concrete plans to enter the UK market.People with knowledge of the probes into Nvidia and Illumina told the FT regulators in the US and Europe are in regular contact and have been sharing information about their cases.Earlier this month, Khan, Kanter and Vestager met in Washington, where they launched the EU-US Joint Technology Competition Policy Dialogue. As part of that, the two sides said their aim was “co-ordinating as much as possible on policy and enforcement”, especially in the technology sector.Kanter told the FT his unit “prioritises building international relationships” that help enforce antitrust laws. “Promoting economic liberty and competitive markets is a shared goal of many international competition enforcers,” he added.“I think that 10 years ago there might have been a couple of calls during [a] case,” said an official at the DoJ. During significant cases today, “there might be a weekly call.[or] more than once a week”.“The collaboration is quite strong right now,” the official added. “This is a pretty exciting time.”William Kovacic, a former Republican chair of the FTC and now a non-executive director of the UK CMA, said: “Efforts have intensified recently for a number of reasons. Not least, when dealing with markets as new and as complex as Big Tech, it is good to be able to pool resources and share information.”In recent years, European and American regulators have been united by the shared challenge of curbing the corporate power of the big technology groups, many of which have opaque revenue streams and business models.Vestager said: “This alignment of codes when it comes to digital — it’s really important that we can get together and discuss how our real life practice can set that into motion if we have cases.”Bill Baer, visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution and former head of the DoJ’s antitrust division, said: “It’s not so much a new approach as it is a recognition that these challenges are global and getting to good outcomes requires unusually close collaboration.”Early signs of such co-operation started under the Trump administration, when the UK’s CMA blocked the proposed $360m merger between the two US-based airline software companies Sabre and Farelogix, after the DoJ had lost its own case in court.But this joint approach was patchy, and subject to the whims of the former president, who disliked many large technology companies but often bridled at the idea of European regulators taking action against them.Biden, however, has prompted a much more fundamental rethink of US competition policy by appointing three progressives to the leading antitrust roles in his administration: Khan at the FTC, Kanter at the DoJ and Tim Wu as a White House adviser.All three have argued for tougher competition enforcement, especially in the technology sector. Khan made her name as an academic by calling for Amazon to be broken up.“For years US regulators viewed their European counterparts as anti-American socialists,” said one Washington-based lobbyist. “Now arguably the Americans are to the left of the Europeans.”One Wall Street banker, who has advised on complex deals for about three decades, said: “This whole new order reverses the burden on the company. The next time you come to do a deal, it’s not up to the DoJ to tell you whether it’s good or bad.it’s up to you to prove that it does fly.”There are some signs the tougher and more co-ordinated approach has begun to have an effect.Mega takeovers in the US — deals north of $25bn or $50bn — plummeted in 2021, according to data from Refinitiv, as companies particularly in pharma and tech have shied away from taking regulatory risks.But at the same time, smaller mergers appear to be progressing unencumbered. Dealmaking hit an all-time high in 2021, with more than $5tn worth of transactions generated predominantly by private equity firms, which tend to do smaller deals that avoid regulatory attention.“The [regulatory] pendulum has shifted against corporations but we should be focusing on private equity more,” said a dealmaker at a bulge bracket investment bank.“The private equity guys don’t have any problem. In fact, they end up buying stuff on the cheap and nobody seems to care if they later fire thousands of people.”But dealmakers say that in the coming years they will have to be more conscious of what regulators on the other side of the Atlantic might think too.One corporate lawyer in the US told the FT the new era of co-operation between Brussels and Washington represented the most serious current threat to dealmaking.“[They] are complementing each other. Will this lead to more deals getting blocked? Absolutely. What can’t get blocked here might be blocked in the European Union, and the guys in DC will be assisting them.”
100  Ireland has announced the partial sale of its 71.1 per cent stake in Allied Irish Banks over six months, setting the stage for the country’s biggest bank to exit majority state ownership.The surprise announcement initially pushed AIB shares down nearly 2.5 per cent in London, but analysts and the bank said the move was a step in the right direction.“We welcome this decision. It is an important development in the process of returning the state’s investment in the group,” Colin Hunt, chief executive, said in a statement.The state sell-off of shares in the bank, which has a market value of about €5.7bn, will begin in mid-January and will be managed by Merrill Lynch. Shares will not be sold below a certain, undisclosed, price and trading will not account for more than 15 per cent of market volume.Diarmaid Sheridan, banking analyst at brokerage Davy, said he expected the sale of about a 3 per cent stake over six months. “I think this should be welcomed. It demonstrates the state is committed to pursuing the strategy of exiting [banks] that the market has been looking for.”The programme runs for an initial six-month period and can then be renewed. Analysts at Goodbody, a brokerage, said “the signalling effect. must be seen as a highly positive development”.It noted that Tuesday’s announcement would allow the government to “keep other sale options open, including accelerated bookbuilds or directed buybacks, should these opportunities present themselves”.The Irish government used a similar strategy when it announced the sale of its 13.9 per cent stake in Bank of Ireland in June. The programme was renewed in November, by which time the government stake had fallen to 9.3 per cent.“Given the thinner liquidity in AIB shares, I expect the pace of share sales to be slower than what we’ve seen at Bank of Ireland, but it is important that we make further progress on what will be a multiyear journey,” finance minister Paschal Donohoe said in a statement.“While just a small portion of the government’s shareholding is likely to be sold under the trading plan alone, it should still help marginally improve the liquidity in [its] share trading,” Goodbody said.Donohoe saw positive conditions for a sale as the bank’s performance and investor appetite for financial stock both improved.AIB was bailed out at a cost of almost €21bn between 2010 and 2011, making it the most costly of Ireland’s bank rescues after the defunct Anglo Irish Bank.Goodbody questioned whether the announcement would herald the beginning of the end for pay caps and the lack of bonuses at bailed out banks, which they say hinders their ability to hire.
101  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
102  Good morning. I made a clanger of an error on Monday, noticed by many readers, but it did lead me to take a hard look at household balance sheets, as I lay out below. But first, a few words on Turkey, where markets are forcing the government into stranger and stranger policy choices. This, from Monday’s Financial Times, is scary:That is an absolutely huge, crazy swing. In just a few hours, the lira took back a month’s worth of rapid depreciation:The scheme that appears to have set off this move in the currency seems to be a forward contract, to be offered to lira depositors, that will pay them lira compensation for any weakening against the dollar, after the impact of interest payments. Here is how Bloomberg described it:For one afternoon, at least, this intervention may have had the desired effect of stopping the wild rush for dollars (though one cannot be sure whether the government had not also encouraged the central bank or private banks to intervene in defense of the lira at the same time). That’s a good thing: a shortage of dollars caused by retail hoarding is a dangerous thing for the Turkish economy. Everything the country buys from the outside world, from energy to food, it buys in dollars. Turkish banks fund themselves in large part with international dollar debt. And the government has dollar bonds to pay.But it is hard to see how this latest policy change will stop inflation. Instead it seems likely to make it worse, because it will introduce more lira liquidity into the system if the currency should weaken. And this comes on top of another highly inflationary policy intervention last week — a 50 per cent increase in the minimum wage.The threat of a deepening inflationary spiral is causing some concern that the country might default on its debt. Again from the FT piece:What’s odd, though, given the collapse of the currency and the jejune policy tricks the government is instituting in response, it that the country’s hard currency bonds, while the are falling in value, are not completely bombed out. Indeed, they are not outside of their trading range of the past few years. Here the prices of two dollar-denominated Turkish bonds, due in 2025 and 2036:Both bonds yield about 8 per cent. These are not the prices or yields of bonds in grave danger of default, even if the probability of default has risen as indicated by the CDS prices.I talked to Unhedged’s go-to guy for emerging market currencies, Columbia Threadneedle rates strategist Edward Al-Hussainy, about what is going on. He argued that while the new policy is little more than a trick, it at least demonstrates that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government is willing to take action to protect the country’s banking system.Erdogan appears to understand that if Turkish banks cannot get hard currency funding, the country’s financial system will collapse and Turkey will default — a catastrophic event that could be a threat to his hold on power.Confusing stocks and flows is such a bad, obvious mistake that it is a bit of a joke among financial journalists. It is not funny when you commit it, however, as I did on Monday in describing this chart:The savings rate is a measure of how much income exceeds spending. It’s a flow measure. It is wrong to say, as I did, that this chart shows that the “extra cash consumers accumulated in lockdowns with help from stimulus cheques has been largely spent”. What it shows, instead, is that consumers are no longer accumulating savings at the high rates they did earlier in the pandemic.So, by way of correcting my error, what do consumers’ stocks of savings look like? They look good. Households net worth is up by about $27tn, or 24 per cent, since the end of 2019, when the pandemic began, according to Federal Reserve data:While households’ cash on hand has tripled, to $3.5tn, almost two-thirds of the improvement in balance sheets is down to stock portfolios and home equity:The aggregate improvement of household balance sheets that occurred through the course of the pandemic persists. This should help keep demand strong and prices high next year, all else being equal. What is not equal, though, is the distribution of wealth in America, and how the new wealth is spread around will affect how much it supports demand.But there is good news here, too. The Fed provides quarterly estimates of household balance sheets, sorted by wealth level. Here is how net worth and selected assets values have grown for various wealth strata:The bottom 50 per cent have seen a greater increase in their net worth, in percentage terms, than the top 50 per cent, driven in particular by increases in the value of their homes. That is good news for demand, because working class people have a greater tendency to spend the incremental dollar.Now, this may lead some readers to worry that the US has become some kind of damn socialist paradise. Let me reassure you that it has not. Here is the same chart, but showing the share of total wealth and assets by wealth level:My colleague Martin Sandbu has launched a video series about unorthodox economic ideas, Free Lunch on Film, with a fine piece on universal basic income.
103  The same four parties. The same premier. Probably mostly the same ministers. Yet the fourth ruling coalition led by liberal Mark Rutte has struck a decidedly different tone when it comes to the Netherlands’ place in the EU. The new coalition agreement suggests The Hague will no longer act as a brake on the EU but as a locomotive. Rutte, who often relished his casting as Europe’s Mr No, now intends to be in the vanguard of European integration.The Hague’s newly hatched enthusiasm for Europe bears the imprint of D66, the left-liberal pro-European party that was the big winner in the election. The big losers were the more Eurosceptic Christian Democrats. Rutte’s authority was weakened by the benefits scandal that brought down his third government and, chameleon-like, has an opportunity to reinvent himself.But the new Dutch position is also a reflection of how geopolitical uncertainty, the pandemic and Britain’s Brexit mess have “reinforced the need for solidarity and collective action” within the EU, says Catherine de Vries, professor at Bocconi University.The parsimonious Dutch who like to lecture other EU governments about fiscal discipline are turning on the spending taps. The incoming government will boost expenditure on housing, education, childcare and defence. It is creating a fund to finance decarbonisation worth a cumulative 4.3 per cent of gross domestic product and another one for rural diversification (including closing down polluting intensive farms) worth 3.1 per cent. Extra borrowing will push Dutch debt just above the 60 per cent EU limit. It is hardly the same category as Italy (155 per cent) or Greece (206 per cent), but the limit no longer seems sacrosanct. The agreement amounts to a “farewell to frugality”, according to Marcel Klok, senior economist at ING.The four coalition parties now say they are open to the “modernisation” of the EU’s fiscal rules as long as its promotes fiscal sustainability and economic convergence. It is vague, but in line with the slightly more flexible approach promised by the new German coalition government.After Britain’s departure from the EU, The Hague acted as ringleader of the so-called frugal states opposed to big EU spending, greater risk-sharing or any watering down of the bloc’s fiscal rules.Rutte’s fourth administration also wants to become an advocate of deeper integration, such as ending national vetoes in foreign policy, strengthening the role of the European parliament and creating EU-wide carbon and digital taxes. Where a sub-set of EU capitals wants to pursue an initiative, the Dutch want to be in the vanguard.The new Dutch stance is its second readjustment to post-Brexit Europe. The first was its leadership of an informal group of free-trading, economically liberal, fiscal hawkish governments, dubbed the New Hanseatic League, who needed to team up to defend their interests in place of their powerful British ally. The group shrunk to a hard core of frugals to try to block the EU dishing out recovery fund grants financed by common debt.The New Hanseatic League made sure small countries were listened to in the EU, says de Vries. But the Dutch started to ask “could you gain more by being constructive and not being some naysayer”. However, she cautions that the strong strain of Euroscepticism in Dutch politics has not disappeared.Pepijn Bergsen of Chatham House doubts there will be a fundamental Dutch shift on EU fiscal policy, but says the new coalition deal reflects a “slowly shifting consensus” on other areas of EU policy.The coalition agreement is peppered with references to EU “strategic autonomy” and how it should use its economic power strategically through investment screening, level-playing field instruments and smart industrial policy.“The Netherlands used to be this last stalwart of neoliberal, free trade, light-touch government thinking,” says Rem Korteweg of Clingendael, the Netherlands Institute for International Relations. “Even the Dutch are moving to a more confrontational, even protectionist-light approach to international economic affairs.” The Dutch are sounding a little less Dutch and a little more French.
104  As recently as this weekend, Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan reiterated his unorthodox theory that lower interest rates will generate a “new economic model” for his country.The president has said that cutting rates will bring down inflation and raise investment, employment and exports, enhancing Turkey’s independence from other countries.Yet his economic experiment of lowering interest rates in the face of inflation, rather than raising them, has plunged his country into crisis with a collapsing currency, soaring prices, companies struggling with the costs of inputs and deep hardship, particularly among the poorest.This indicates that Erdogan’s notions are deeply flawed — as does standard economic theory, which suggests higher interest rates are needed to defend a currency by deterring capital outflows, bearing down on domestic spending and demonstrating the authorities are serious in seeking to prevent an inflationary spiral.Inflation in Turkey is heading towards 30 per cent after the lira lost more than half its value against the US dollar this autumn — despite a rebound late on Monday after Erdogan announced measures to compensate holders of lira in banks in the event of further currency depreciation.Yet the economics community has itself questioned the role of hot money flows into and out of emerging economies and traditional theories, led by professor Hélène Rey of the London Business School, who noted in 2013 that emerging markets were often at the mercy of capital flows driven by the policies of the US Federal Reserve and other major central banks.The IMF has even sketched out a model in which higher interest rates could lead to higher inflation. The working paper by former IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard and colleagues noted that large capital inflows into an emerging economy — often brought about by high interest rates — can lead to “credit booms and rising output” and inflation.But although the IMF — the high priest of economic orthodoxy — publishes papers such as this, those circumstances do not apply to Turkey.The country has run persistent deficits on its current account as imports regularly exceed exports, and suffers from stubbornly high inflation: the annual rate has been in excess of 10 per cent for almost all of the past five years. This suggests an underlying price growth problem that is embedded in the system and which policy has done little to eliminate.Earlier this month the OECD in Paris said Turkey’s inflationary pressures had been further boosted this year by subsidised loans to domestic companies since the start of the pandemic, which helped fuel export-led “buoyant growth”, leaving its 2021 output higher than the OECD had expected before Covid-19 hit.The OECD also warned that Turkey was likely to be “subject to potential further pressures from wages, import costs and producer prices”.Professor Dani Rodrik of the Harvard Kennedy School said that for years Erdogan had ridden a wave of capital inflows that were attracted to Turkey by slightly higher interest rate margins.“One of the myths of financial globalisation is that it enforces macro[economic] discipline,” Rodrik said, suggesting that financial markets would ensure countries ran credible and sustainable policies that attracted foreign cash. “In Turkey, it was the opposite. Turkey’s economic experiment ran much longer than it should have, thanks to the more elastic supply of finance. The economic costs will be larger as a result.”Both Rodrik and the IMF argue that, even if higher interest rates helped attract inflows that raised spending and domestic inflation, the correct response by Ankara would have been to offset the effect with tighter policy, accepting slower growth in order to shore up longer-term stability and prevent precisely the crisis of confidence that Turkey has suffered in recent weeks.Instead, Erdogan did the opposite, aided by a handpicked central bank governor. Turkey cut its short-term policy rate from 19 per cent in September to reach 14 per cent on December 16, in a series of expansionary moves.The intention was to gradually lower the value of the Turkish lira and boost exports by increasing the competitiveness of smaller manufacturing companies, while also shifting spending from imports to domestic goods and services.Although the current account deficit has moved into surplus since August, it has come at a huge cost to the credibility of Ankara’s economic policy and the livelihoods of Turkey’s population.The official inflation rate topped 20 per cent in November with prices rising 3.5 per cent that month alone. Many observers consider this an underestimate of the true pace of inflation. Even so, it is expected to jump higher in December when the effects of the crash in the Turkish lira show up in import prices.Worse, the lira’s plunge has boosted the debts of companies and the government, which have increased their foreign currency borrowings. Turkey’s non-financial corporate debt has risen by 20 percentage points of gross domestic product since the pandemic started, the highest among emerging economies, according to OECD estimates.Even interest rate cuts no longer ease financial conditions for companies, because the financial markets now demand greater compensation for the risk. Turkish government bond yields have risen sharply as foreign and domestic investors lost confidence in the lira and sought the safety of hard currencies.With import prices soaring, the economic circumstances threaten to crush domestic demand; a recent 50 per cent rise in the minimum wage will wipe out the cost advantages of the currency depreciation, according to Tim Ash of BlueBay Asset Management.“If [Erdogan] had managed to hold [the line] when there were 10 lira to the [US] dollar, maybe they had a chance but, now inflation is out of the bag, the competitive advantage will go out of the window and we are in a devaluation inflation spiral,” Ash said.
105  Nato allies are resigned to the need to negotiate with Russia despite the impossibility of many of Moscow’s demands regarding the US-led alliance in Europe, as pressure mounts to find a diplomatic solution to rising military tension over Ukraine.Western defence officials want to avoid an outright rejection of the Kremlin’s proposals in an attempt to find areas of mutual agreement and calm a situation in which more than 100,000 Russian troops have assembled on Kyiv’s border.Russia laid out its “red lines” to Nato and the US last week, which included forthright demands for the western alliance to deny membership to Ukraine, seek consent from Moscow to deploy troops in former communist countries in Europe and avoid military deployments or exercises close to Russia’s borders.Western officials have in private rejected almost all of the demands as implausible, not credible and in contradiction to post-cold war treaties guaranteeing sovereign states’ rights to choose their defence policies.But they admit that closing the door on Moscow’s initial diplomatic offer could make the situation worse. They think the proposals are a chance for dialogue alongside threats of sanctions should Moscow take steps to endanger Ukraine.“We need to solve the current tensions on the diplomatic level,” Germany’s new defence minister Christine Lambrecht said on Sunday on a visit to German troops stationed in Lithuania — troops that Russia would like to see removed. “We will discuss Russia’s proposals.But it cannot be that Russia dictates to Nato partners their posture, and that is something that we will make very clear.”The North Atlantic Council, Nato’s decision-making body, said in response to the demands that it was “ready for meaningful dialogue with Russia.on the basis of reciprocity”.Convincing Russia to reverse its military build-up on the border with Ukraine — which US intelligence has warned could be used to invade — is Nato’s primary objective.But with the alliance ruling out any concessions that would affect its members’ security or the sovereignty of Ukraine, officials say it will be difficult to find areas where detailed negotiations could be possible.“The problem here is that if you just say no [to Moscow’s demands], then you have no space to talk,” said a senior Nato diplomat, who added that Nato and EU member states were talking about how to respond.Officials told the Financial Times there was no consensus as to how negotiations would take place or who would be involved.Larger formats, such as the Nato-Russia Council or the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), allow for a wide range of views to be aired and avoid the perception of larger countries discussing the implications for smaller ones. But a more selective negotiation format may be necessary to discuss details and achieve results.Western diplomats do not want to allow Russia to set the terms of any engagement, so negotiations will only begin after Nato and the US have agreed their own proposals for Moscow.“We will discuss these proposals that are currently on the table.with all our partners in the EU and in Nato,” said Andrea Sasse, spokeswoman for the German foreign ministry. “It is important that in our dialogue that we have [with Russia] at the moment, we remain true to our own principles. And one of them is the indivisibility of the security of all Nato member states. And that has consequences for what we can and can’t accept.”Defence ministers of the Nordic and Baltic states have uniformly rejected Russia’s demands, according to a statement on Monday.Estonian minister of defence Kalle Laanet said: “We see Russia’s aggressive stance only deepening and a further escalation of the situation is a serious threat to the security of Ukraine, but also to the whole of Europe. It is vital for our region and all allies to have a unified situational awareness and strong co-operation, which is why we will discuss the situation today and in the coming days within various formats.”Sergei Ryabkov, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, who outlined Russia’s demands on Friday, said on Monday that Moscow had so far received no response from the US.“I think they’ll try to turn this into a slow-moving process, but we need it to be urgent, because the situation is very difficult, it is acute, it tends to become more complicated,” he was quoted by state newswire RIA as saying.Later on Monday, Jake Sullivan, US national security adviser, spoke with Yuri Ushakov, foreign policy adviser to Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president.Sullivan indicated US readiness to engage in diplomacy through multiple channels, including bilateral engagement, the Nato-Russia Council and the OSCE.He said that any dialogue would have to be based on reciprocity and address the US’s concerns about Russia’s actions, and take place in full co-ordination with the US’s European allies and partners.Additional reporting by Max Seddon in Moscow
106  The currency, which has lost about 40 per cent of its value against the dollar since Erdogan ordered the central bank to start lowering borrowing costs in September, fell to a new record low of TL18.36 against the dollar on Monday. It later rallied to TL14.8 in chaotic trading late in the Turkish day after the president announced a scheme aimed at encouraging the country’s savers, who have increasingly kept their savings in dollars and gold, to hold their money in lira. However, in a sign of growing concern over the fallout from the volatile currency on the health of the broader financial system, the cost of protecting against a default on Turkish debt has climbed sharply. The spread on the five-year credit default swap has risen to 612 basis points, from about 300bp at the start of the year, according to IHS Markit data collated by Refinitiv. Trading on Turkey’s main stock exchange was halted on Monday for the second consecutive session following a 5 per cent decline for the flagship index. The Bist 100 trimmed its fall to 1.4 per cent after trading resumed.Erdogan has plunged his country of 83m people into a currency crisis by insisting on four interest rate cuts in the past four months despite rising inflation, bucking the global trend at a time when other central banks across the world are seeking to combat price instability by raising rates. The Turkish president, who rejects the economic orthodoxy that lifting interest rates helps to tackle inflation, dismissed warnings from the business world of the dangers of his approach.“Don’t expect anything else from me,” he said in a televised speech on Sunday night. “As a Muslim, I will continue to do whatever the religious decrees require,” he added, in a reference to prohibitions in Islam on usury.Earlier in the day, he also batted away suggestions that he could be forced to impose capital controls in an attempt to halt the plunge in the currency, describing the idea as “ridiculous”. The president has said Turkey is pursuing a “new economic model” that will capitalise on low rates and a competitive currency to bolster exports, investments and employment. Economists warn it will create runaway inflation and dangerous financial instability in a country that is heavily reliant on foreign financing. The official rate of annual inflation reached 21 per cent in November, and economists expect it to rise further in the months ahead as the weaker lira quickly feeds through into high prices, particularly given Turkey’s significant use of imported energy and raw materials. In his remarks on Sunday night, Erdogan acknowledged public concerns over soaring prices but painted the problems as temporary — and cast them as part of a national struggle for economic independence. “Of course we know that price rises are causing problems in the daily lives of our people. Of course we are aware of the volatility in the exchange rate, the instability in prices and the uncertainty this creates,” he said.“But we will resist these just as we resisted tutelage, terrorist organisations, putschists and global power barons. I am telling you, there is no going back.”He attacked Tusiad, the country’s largest business association, which on Saturday urged the government to return to the “established rules of economic science” to restore stability and prevent further damage to business and the public. “Hey, Tusiad and your offspring,” he said. “I’m telling you, you have one job: investment, production, employment, growth. You cannot interfere in what we are doing.” The previous day, the head of Turkey’s Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges (TOBB), which represents small and medium-sized businesses and has in the past been supportive of Erdogan’s approach, warned that the financial turbulence was “worrying and negatively affecting many of our companies”. Rifat Hisarciklioglu, TOBB’s president, called on the government to take “urgent steps” to stabilise the markets and restore a more predictable environment for business.
107  The Novavax coronavirus vaccine has been approved for use in the EU by the European Commission, boosting the fortunes of the US biotech after months of delays and manufacturing issues.The approval, which came on the heels of a recommendation from the European Medicines Agency earlier on Monday, makes the protein-based shot the fifth Covid-19 vaccine authorised for use in the bloc. It had been shown to be as much as 90.4 per cent effective in trials, including on previous variants of concern. The drugmaker is currently assessing its efficacy against Omicron.The EMA panel had concluded “by consensus” that the data on the vaccine were “robust” and met EU criteria for “efficacy, safety and quality”.Stanley Erck, Novavax’s chief executive, called the approval “a big deal”.“Two years ago we had zero manufacturing capacity,” he told the Financial Times. “We had to build it all ourselves. We’ve now done that.”Novavax is targeting production of 2bn doses in 2022, he said. The price will be tiered in three ranges based on countries’ income, from the “low-single digits” $4-$5 range, or “pretty close to cost” for the poorest nations, to the “neighbourhood of $20” a dose for high-income ones.“All the manufacturing issues that we went through have been resolved,” Erck added. “Governments could have helped by keeping all borders open.”In 2019, Novavax was facing delisting, and laid off manufacturing and quality control staff. “If we’d had manufacturing capacity at the start of the pandemic, we would have been where we are today earlier. at least by months,” he said.Shares in the New York-listed company have been volatile over the past year, as investors questioned whether the US group, which has been in business for more than 30 years, could successfully bring its first vaccine to market after the drugmaker delayed regulatory submissions amid manufacturing issues.The stock jumped as much as 12 per cent before markets opened on the initial announcement recommending use of the inoculation as a two-shot vaccine for all adults in Europe, though was down 5 per cent in early market trading.Novavax said the approval “would deliver the first protein-based vaccine to the EU during a critical time when we believe having choice among vaccines will lead to increased immunisation”.The bloc has agreed a deal for up to 200m doses of the shot, also known as Nuvaxovid, which the European Commission has said can be diverted to poorer countries. The initial supplies, in January, will come from India’s Serum Institute then from other parts of the company’s global supply chain, the company said.Erck repeated that he expected the completion of the company’s submission to the US Food and Drug Administration by the end of the year. It has procurement deals in place with the UK, where it has submitted an application to regulators, and the US for 60m and 110m doses, respectively.The vaccine is given as two doses 21 days apart and can be stored at conventional fridge temperature.Novavax also has a commitment, in partnership with the Serum Institute, to the global vaccine access scheme Covax for 1.1bn doses. The World Health Organization gave that version of the shot, known as Covovax, an emergency use listing on Friday, paving the way for its rollout globally. It also approved the so-called originator product, Nuvaxovid, on Monday, Novavax said.
108  Liz Truss, the UK’s new Brexit negotiator, will be faced with exactly the same dilemma as her predecessor, Lord David Frost: compromise with Brussels or risk a trade war, diplomats in Brussels have said.Several welcomed Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s decision to hand his foreign secretary the role in the hope that she and her team would try to forge a broader, more positive relationship with the EU. But they warned that to achieve success would require a more emollient British approach.“It’s good the Foreign Office is getting involved again,” said one EU diplomat. “Let’s give her the benefit of the doubt but I fear more of the same.”Weeks of talks over the Northern Ireland protocol, which governs trade with the region, remain unresolved, with Frost repeatedly warning he could trigger Article 16 of the protocol to suspend large parts of it, which would spark retaliation by the EU.Officials in Brussels have said this could range from tariffs on British goods entering the bloc to the suspension of the post-Brexit trade deal.“Our position.particularly on the protocol, does not change depending on who is holding the position on the other side,” European Commission chief spokesman Eric Mamer told reporters on Monday.The EU believes its proposals to cut customs and health checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland would substantially reduce trade disruption, caused by both sides’ wish to avoid a trade border on the island of Ireland. It also maintains that the UK should implement a deal it agreed only two years ago, rather than undermine it.“We do hope for a constructive partner who re-establishes trust in the UK,” another diplomat said. “At the same time, we need to be prepared for a Frost 2.0 style of confrontation.”“She is a politician where Frost was not, so perhaps she can get something out of a space where he was more destructive,” said another EU official. “But Boris Johnson calls the shots, so domestic UK politics will always dictate what happens.”Johnson only last week approved a big climbdown in the UK position that diplomats say could pave the way for a deal.He accepted that the European Court of Justice would continue to play a role in the operation of the protocol in return for a scaling back of checks at Irish Sea ports in Great Britain for trade with Northern Ireland.In a separate dispute, the UK gave French boats more licences to fish in its waters, although Paris said it was too few and it would ask Brussels to take legal action.Truss, who was handed the Europe portfolio the day after Frost resigned on Saturday, said on Twitter that she would talk to EU negotiator Maros Sefcovic on Tuesday — despite talks being paused until January 10.Some Tory Eurosceptics believe that Truss, a former Remainer with prime ministerial ambitions, will take a tough stance in negotiations to prove her mettle to the Tory rightwingers who could ultimately decide who succeeds Johnson as prime minister.“She’ll be no less tough than Frost,” said one Tory MP. A Whitehall insider added: “Liz has been one of the most hawkish ministers on the protocol.”Asked if Truss’s appointment would see a change in the UK position, Downing Street declined to comment.Other Tory MPs said Truss would stick to the course set by Johnson and that, as foreign secretary, she was aware that US president Joe Biden’s administration would react badly to any further ructions on the Northern Ireland issue.“She’s got no choice but to compromise,” said one former minister. “We can’t afford to have another year of toxic messing around.”George Osborne, former chancellor, said of his former ministerial colleague: “The capable Liz Truss now has the tools to be the most powerful foreign secretary for many decades.”While Truss will have broad responsibility for EU relations, Tory Eurosceptics believe most of the line-by-line negotiating on the protocol will be done by her newly appointed deputy, Chris Heaton-Harris, who becomes Europe minister.Heaton-Harris, a former MEP and former chair of the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Conservative MPs, is viewed by Tory backbenchers as a brake against any significant new concessions in negotiations.Peter Bone, a Tory Eurosceptic, said Heaton-Harris was “a determined Brexiter” and, as a part-time football referee, would be “more than willing to show the EU a red card if necessary”.
109  Russia expelled two German diplomats on Monday in a tit-for-tat measure after a judge in Berlin accused the Kremlin of “state terrorism” for ordering the murder of a Chechen rebel in 2019.The Russian foreign ministry said in a statement that it had declared the diplomats personae non gratae after Germany ordered the expulsion of two Russian diplomats last week over the incident.Berlin’s regional court sentenced Russian national Vadim Krasikov, 56, to life in prison for shooting Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, a Georgian citizen of Chechen origin who once fought in an insurgency against Moscow, in broad daylight in the Kleiner Tiergarten, a Berlin park.“The German ambassador was informed of declaring two diplomatic employees of the German embassy to Russia personae non gratae as a symmetric response to the aforementioned unfriendly decision by the German government,” the ministry said.“It was also stressed that the Russian side will invariably respond proportionately to any of Berlin’s potential confrontational attacks against us in the future,” it said.The Khangoshvili murder is threatening to inflame Berlin’s ties with Moscow just as the new German coalition government, which took office more than a week ago, is wrestling with how to deal with an increasingly insurgent Russia.Although Olaf Scholz, chancellor, hinted that he would pursue a conciliatory Ostpolitik with Moscow, Annalena Baerbock, foreign minister, has suggested toughening Germany’s stance on Russia, including possibly denying permission for the contentious Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.Baerbock said after the verdict that the murder was a “grave breach of German law and the sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Germany”.Germany and Russia had previously each expelled two of the other’s diplomats after the execution-style killing of Khangoshvili who was walking to a mosque in 2019.Angela Merkel, Germany’s former chancellor, had said there would be consequences for Russia if the court determined that the Kremlin had ordered the murder.Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, denied any involvement in the killing but said that Khangoshvili, considered a terrorist by Moscow’s FSB domestic security agency, was a “bandit” and a “bloodthirsty and brutal man”.Germany’s allies in the US and EU are also concerned that Russia may be planning to invade Ukraine after massing about 100,000 troops near its border and making a series of exorbitant demands of Nato. The west has vowed to place crippling sanctions on Russia should it use force against Ukraine.“This step is not a surprise but, in the opinion of the German government, it is completely gratuitous,” the German foreign ministry said.Khangoshvili’s murder “represents a grave violation of Germany’s sovereignty”, the ministry added, saying that the decision to expel the diplomats “once again places strain on the relationship”.
110  Germany’s new coalition government has picked Joachim Nagel, a top executive at the Bank for International Settlements, as successor to Jens Weidmann at the helm of the country’s central bank.Christian Lindner, finance minister, described Nagel as an “experienced personality” who would ensure “continuity”. At a time of heightened concern about inflation, “monetary policy stability in the Bundesbank tradition is important”, he added, describing the appointment as a “good signal to the German people and to Europe”.Described by those who know him as a “central banker’s central banker”, Nagel is virtually unknown outside financial circles and has not played an active role in the German public debate about the European Central Bank’s strategy.But experts believe he will continue to uphold the Bundesbank’s “hawkish” stance on eurozone monetary policy, a position advanced with tireless consistency by Weidmann, who announced in October that he was standing down as president of Germany’s central bank after 10 years in the role.The Bundesbank chief is a member of the ECB’s 25-person governing council and, as a representative of the eurozone’s biggest economy, plays a key role in setting ECB policy.Nagel will “maintain a traditional Germanic anti-inflation message”, said David Marsh, a historian of the euro and head of OMFIF, a think-tank. His appointment “may signal a more emollient style and tone at the German central bank, but no shift in fundamental policy”.Nagel takes charge at a sensitive time for Germany, with inflation at a 30-year high of 6 per cent and the coronavirus pandemic darkening prospects for the country’s economy.Economists warned last week that Germany risks sliding into recession this winter after its main indicator of business confidence slumped to its lowest point since February and the Bundesbank slashed its growth forecasts.The announcement on Nagel comes two weeks after the Financial Times broke the news that he was in pole position to get the Bundesbank job.Though he is not regarded as a world authority on monetary policy, the 55-year-old is seen as a career “Bundesbanker” with a deep knowledge of the central bank’s internal workings and a mastery of international financial markets.He has the “necessary monetary policy expertise and, as a native of the Bundesbank, stands for the regulatory tradition of this institution”, said Jan Holthusen, head of research at DZ Bank.Nagel also accomplished the rare feat of pleasing all parties in Germany’s complex new coalition government. His party affiliation — he is a Social Democrat — made him palatable to Olaf Scholz, the SPD chancellor, while his orthodox views on monetary policy endeared him to finance minister Lindner, who is leader of the liberal — and fiscally hawkish — FDP.A native of Karlsruhe who earned a doctorate in economics at the city’s Institute of Technology, Nagel advised the SPD on economic policy during the 1990s, spent a year in Washington doing research and joined the Bundesbank in 1999. In 2010 he was made a member of its management board, responsible for markets and IT.In 2016 he moved to state-owned development bank KfW, where he later led the bank’s work on supporting emerging markets. In 2020 he switched to the Bank for International Settlements, where he was deputy head of banking.While at the KfW Nagel was chair of KfW Ipex Bank, a subsidiary which has been criticised over its role in the Wirecard affair. The bank provided a €100m unsecured loan to Wirecard in 2018 and extended it in 2019, a time when media reports of suspicious activity at the company were rife. In September last year, German police raided Ipex’s offices as part of a criminal investigation into employees who approved the original loan.However, MPs looking into Ipex’s role as part of an investigation into Wirecard’s collapse found that the bank’s board was only informed about the loan to the disgraced payments company in 2020 — days before it filed for insolvency — and had played no role in awarding or extending it.Nagel will succeed a man who emerged as one of the most vocal critics of the ultra-loose monetary policy pursued by the European Central Bank. Weidmann fought an often lonely battle at the governing council against its bond-buying and negative interest rate policies.Comments from earlier in Nagel’s career indicate that he shares these conservative views. Shortly after the ECB started its quantitative easing policy of buying vast amounts of government bonds in 2015, Nagel warned in an interview with German newspaper Börsen-Zeitung of the “key danger” of an “intermingling of monetary policy and fiscal policy”.Echoing concerns often expressed by Weidmann, Nagel said: “There is a risk that the budgetary consolidation required in some euro countries will be put on the backburner,” which he said “could then increase political pressure on the ECB council to postpone an interest rate hike that is necessary from a monetary policy point of view”.One other economist believed to have been in the running for the top job at the Bundesbank was Isabel Schnabel, a director at the ECB. But she is one of only two woman on the ECB’s governing council, and officials worried that its gender balance would become even more lopsided if she were to leave.Another name mentioned was Marcel Fratzscher, a former ECB official and head of the DIW, an economic think-tank based in Berlin, who is considered close to the Social Democrats.“It’s good that people with too little critical distance to the ECB weren’t able to prevail in the race for the job of Bundesbank chief,” said Friedrich Heinemann, an economist at the Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research. “This will dash the hopes of those in southern Europe that the Bundesbank would send a dove with sympathy for bond-buying into the ECB governing council.”Karsten Junius, chief economist at Basel-based Bank J Safra Sarasin, said he hoped Nagel’s appointment would allow the Bundesbank “to criticise the monetary policy of the ECB less from the edge, but rather help shape it and explain it better in Germany”.Despite Weidmann’s disagreements with his counterparts at the ECB, he was last week chosen to continue his role on the ECB’s audit committee as an external member after he steps down from the Bundesbank.
111  Italian luxury fashion company Zegna went public in New York on Monday after combining with a US special purpose acquisition company at an estimated enterprise value of $3.1bn.The Spac was launched by European private equity group Investindustrial and is chaired by former UBS chief executive Sergio Ermotti. Its deal with Zegna was first reported by the Financial Times in July and initially valued the combined company at $3.2bn.“We are very proud to be the first Italian fashion company to be listed in New York,” said Gildo Zegna, the third generation of the family to run the company since its founding in 1910, in an interview at Zegna’s Manhattan flagship store on the Friday before the listing.Amid choppy conditions on markets, the company was up 8 per cent, at $10.96 in early New York trading on Monday.The listing will deliver gross proceeds of $761m to invest in Zegna and Thom Browne, another brand it controls. It also opens the door to additional acquisitions. The Zegna family will own a nearly 66 per cent stake in the combined company.There has been a wave of consolidation in the luxury industry. Deals in the past 12 months include LVMH’s purchase of Tiffany & Co, Etro and Off-White; Kering has bought Danish eyewear maker Lindberg and Richemont acquired leather goods brand Delvaux.In 2019, Zegna told the FT he had no interest in taking the company public. But the pandemic has made it difficult for independent brands to compete with larger, cash-rich fashion conglomerates.In 2020, sales at Zegna dropped 23 per cent from the year before to €1bn and it swung to a net loss of €45m, from a profit of €38m. In an investor presentation, the company forecast that its performance would recover to near pre-pandemic levels in 2021.“The market of luxury is very challenging,” Zegna said. “We are competing with conglomerates. [We did it] to get stronger.”“Now I can rely on additional resources.to take our shot if we have another [acquisition] opportunity, and I think I can tell you we have other opportunities.”Zegna said he was most keen to buy more of the company’s suppliers, but would also look at other fashion brands. “As raw materials are getting scarce [and] expensive, as there is stress to the supply chain regardless of where you are, to control [the supply chain] is very, very important strategically,” he said. If there are opportunities to buy suppliers “we are going to do it”, he added.The company also wants to concentrate on organic growth in its menswear business, which in recent years has shifted away from suits to luxury leisurewear as workplaces have become more casual.Zegna himself no longer wears suits in interviews; meeting the FT, he wore a thick cashmere overshirt over a thin polo neck, stretchy knit trousers, all in shades of grey, and a pair of Zegna trainers. “We’ve transformed the perception of the brand from a tailored luxury brand into a sportswear luxury brand. I used to wear a nice suit and tie.but once you start wearing this stuff, you become addicted.”The company is also planning to invest further in its textile business — it supplies fabrics to rivals including Chanel and Tom Ford — and in Thom Browne, which it bought for $500m in 2018 and has since expanded into women’s and childrenswear.Last week, it unveiled a new name and logo, dropping its founder’s name Ermenegildo from Ermenegildo Zegna.Gildo, who is 66, said he feels he has “to serve for another few years”.“The next generation is stepping up. I’ve got three good fellows in the fourth generation. One is marketing, [my oldest son] Edo.Angelo, the younger one, who is head of Zegna retail America.And then Francesco, my nephew, is head of retail in Europe. So, who knows?”
112  Since the UK left the EU single market on January 1 this year the Financial Times has been tracking the fortunes of three small British companies as they adjust to trading under new rules set out in the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.Twelve months into the post-Brexit regime, the three companies — a tea maker, a haulier and a manufacturer — reflect on a year of continuous upheaval.For Kiran Tawadey, owner of the Hampstead Tea company, it has been a heartbreaking decision but on January 1 she will shut down her UK manufacturing operation as a result of border bureaucracy brought in by Brexit. Five full-time employees will be made redundant.Putting sentiment aside, Tawadey says that the decision to close the small packing plant in Milton Keynes after 10 years was a commercial no-brainer as exporting her probiotic teas to Europe had just become too expensive and unreliable after Brexit.Last June Tawadey opened a subsidiary in the Netherlands to reliably service her growing list of EU clients that include the French supermarket chain Monoprix, Italian grocery giant Esselunga and German organic health food retailer Alnatura.Using a Dutch logistics hub enabled Tawadey to import her organic teas into the EU in bulk, clearing customs in one go and avoiding the need to grapple with 27 different VAT and national customs authorities. Shutting her UK plant was simply the next logical step.“Our EU business is flying at the moment and we just felt we need to focus on delivering to customers via our third party logistics centre in Holland,” she said. “Having our own factory in the UK became too complicated.”The final decision came in October when her warehouse manager “saw the writing on the wall” and quit his job, and then the landlord asked for a 40 per cent rent increase. The combination of skills shortages and rising costs made the decision.“We couldn’t hire a new manager or a forklift driver; costs in the UK were going through the roof. It all suddenly became clear,” she said.Tawadey will now outsource the blending and packing of her loose teas to a third-party contractor, possibly inside the EU, as she concentrates on expanding her business out of continental Europe, including to the rest of the world.She recounted how on a recent visit to a trade fair in Malmo, Sweden, the direction of travel for UK businesses exporting to the EU was clear. “The first question was ‘do you have an EU operation, because we can’t buy your product from the UK’. The minute we said we were EU-based, we were inundated with interest,” she said.She added that clients in Japan, Australia and the rest of the world are now also increasingly requesting to be serviced out of the EU hub, preferring Rotterdam to using UK ports. In time, Tawadey says, she can see her entire operation moving to the EU, and servicing UK clients by exporting back to her home country.Looking back on the year she now feels quite optimistic for her business, which made more than £100,000 net profit in 2020 but may only just break even this year thanks to Brexit disruption in the first half of the year alongside the investment costs of setting up in the Netherlands and the general escalating costs of raw materials and transportation.However, Tawadey believes that growing sales in the EU in 2022 and the trimming of the UK cost base will lead to renewed profits next year. “I’ve got over the emotional rollercoaster about it all. We have to be pragmatic,” she concludes. “I just don’t know whether the powers-that-be in London know, or even care, about what is happening.”Paul Jackson, of Chiltern Distribution, was optimistic that Brexit would provide opportunities for his Peterborough-based haulage company, which specialises in temperature-controlled products such as medicines and fresh fruit.After 2016 Jackson invested more than £1m in new staff and software to streamline deliveries of citrus fruits from Spain and pharmaceuticals from European manufacturing hubs. Some 40 per cent of his business was EU trade.But a year into the new regime Jackson says that his EU business has collapsed to “almost zero” and his fleet of 50 articulated lorries and sprinter vans is almost entirely deployed in the UK.He blames a British government decision to relax post-Brexit rules that had restricted the number of pick-ups and drop-offs EU drivers can perform in the UK — so called “cabotage” — leaving them free to undercut more expensive UK drivers.With lower wages and extended-range lorries equipped with 1,300-litre fuel tanks filled with cheap diesel, EU drivers were now able to operate on UK roads at much lower costs than UK drivers.As a result, Jackson said that delivery rates to and from Europe, which had attracted a premium in the first three months of the year as EU drivers stayed away from the UK to avoid getting caught up in border delays, were no longer attractive.“In a nutshell, we’ve got all the worst bits of Brexit and none of the good things. There’s been no advantages from our perspective,” he said. “The promises that were made around borders, and EU hauliers not being allowed into the UK — that there would be a level playing field — well, that’s not happened.” The only minor upside of Brexit, Jackson said, had been a 20 per cent increase in pick-ups of loads from Portsmouth as a growing number of EU shippers sent unaccompanied trailers in order to bypass border issues.Jackson concluded that Chiltern would not be making new investments ahead of the UK government introducing new controls on imports from the EU to the UK in 2022. “We’ll not be making the same mistake twice,” he said. “We’ll just wait and see.”Mandy Ridyard wants the government to finally deliver what was promised before Brexit: a set of good trade deals with major export markets in countries, such as the US, that matter to the UK manufacturing industry.“We want to take advantage of trade deals,” said Ridyard, financial director at Produmax, which makes aerospace components near Shipley, West Yorkshire.Instead, her company has spent the year faced with more red tape than ever before as she tried to navigate new border controls when supplying factories in Northern Ireland, which make up about a fifth of Produmax’s sales.This has meant additional costs for the business, which employs 74 people, contrasting with the “global Britain” vision of free trade projected by Brexit campaigners ahead of the UK’s exit from the EU.“We have an extra internal border now. There is a lot of extra paperwork — and a lot of extra cost that goes with it,” Ridyard said.She added that it “doesn’t seem right” that moving products to Northern Ireland involves the same procedures as shipments to the Philippines, another major market for Produmax.“[It’s] now treated as a foreign country. There is a knock on cost as it just means more HMRC paperwork. There is always a cost,” she said, referring to the UK tax authority.Twelve months after Brexit, the impact has just been a “hassle” with none of the upside, she added.Ridyard’s other concern is the prospect of further shortages of labour and skills caused by the pandemic and by Brexit deterring workers from the EU from working in the supply chain. “This is a worry for the hauliers trying to get goods to us.”
113  European energy prices surged again on Monday as temperatures dropped and flows of natural gas through a key Russian pipeline fell to the lowest level in more than a month.Derivatives linked to TTF, Europe’s wholesale gas price, rose as high as €148.50 per megawatt hour on Monday, up from a record high closing price of €136/MWh last week. The latest jump threatens to keep pushing up energy bills for millions of households across the continent just as weather forecasts anticipated temperatures below zero degrees Celsius in several European cities.Energy costs have soared this year as the rebounding global economy drove up demand and, in Europe, calls for additional gas deliveries from Russia went unanswered. European gas prices have jumped more than 600 per cent since January and are now exceeding record highs set in October.Low storage levels, competition from Asia for liquefied natural gas cargoes and doubts over Russia’s intentions have continued to push European prices higher, according to Laurent Ruseckas at IHS Markit, a consultancy.Flows through the Yamal-Europe pipeline, one of the three routes Russia’s state-owned Gazprom uses to supply piped natural gas to north west Europe, dropped to 6 per cent of capacity on Saturday and 5 per cent on Sunday.The Yamal route through Poland, which is the smallest of the three pipelines, is currently responsible for roughly 10 per cent of Russian gas supply into north west Europe, analysts said. Still, the drop in booked volumes on the pipeline had an immediate price impact.“The market is in a febrile state, so these things come out and the prices are affected significantly and immediately,” Ruseckas said.He added it was impossible to know for certain what was behind the fall. Gazprom has generally declined to sell additional gas volumes to Europe this year on the spot market, but has repeatedly said it has met all of its contracts with European buyers.Gazprom supplies gas “according to customer requests in full compliance with contractual obligation”, it said on Monday.European and US officials have accused Moscow of playing politics with supply and withholding gas to put pressure on the EU to, among other objectives, approve the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline through the Baltic Sea.Gazprom has kept its underground storage facilities in Germany and Austria at levels significantly lower than in previous years, despite public statements from Russian president Vladimir Putin that the company would increase supply.Ronald Smith, senior oil and gas analyst at BCS in Moscow, said the drop in supply on the Yamal route could be explained by unseasonably cold temperatures, which have reached minus 25 Celsius in western Russia and close to minus 50C in East Siberia.“It is possible that cold weather here in Russia is limiting Gazprom’s export capacity to an extent and/or they are working to keep Russian storage as full as possible,” he said.Gas flows via the two other routes to north west Europe had remained stable, with a slight increase in supply via TurkStream, the Black Sea pipeline running from Russia to Turkey and on to southern Europe, said Mitch Jennings, analyst at Sova Capital.
114  The writer is a former editor of The Economist and author of ‘Good Italy, Bad Italy’As a fine economist, Mario Draghi knows the theory of the second best. Under a perfect outcome, he would stay as prime minister of Italy for the full five years of the national recovery and resilience plan of mainly EU-funded public investments and reforms that he has put in place since he took office in February. But if the perfect outcome is unattainable, it is right to go for the best imperfect solution. That is for Draghi to be elected as president of the republic by the Italian parliament in late January, and then oversee matters as head of state for the next seven years.This option is second best because a further, much-discussed idea — of Draghi staying as prime minister until 2023, when the next general election must be held — is an illusion. His considerable progress during his 10 months in office has depended on a ceasefire between the broad set of parties in his coalition, with only the far-right Brothers of Italy in opposition. After January, that ceasefire might hold for a further six months at most before election fever takes hold.Six months with his hands on an increasingly wobbly steering wheel versus seven years as an exalted traffic cop: that is the real choice facing Draghi, who has yet to confirm he is willing to be president, and Italy’s parliamentarians. Sergio Mattarella, the retiring head of state, has repeatedly ruled out the possibility of serving part of a second term. But even if he were to be persuadable, this would only postpone the issue and raise the risk that someone other than Draghi would eventually be chosen to succeed him.This isn’t the ideal way to revitalise a country that has stagnated for most of the 30 years since Draghi, as director-general of the Treasury, helped steer Italy out of a 1992 public debt crisis that saw the lira ejected from the then European exchange rate mechanism and led to decades of fiscal constraints. A textbook reform effort would require 10 years in office, helped by a stable political base.In the real, always volatile world of Italian politics, Draghi’s government has already achieved a lot. The plan to spend €191.5bn of money from the EU Next Generation Fund, plus €30.6bn of Italy’s own funds, has won praise. Its investments in infrastructure, the energy transition and digitalisation aim to satisfy criteria Draghi himself laid down in August 2020 while a private citizen, when he said extra public debt could be justified only if it stood to raise the economy’s productive potential.The difficulty is that to do so requires not just that the money be well spent. It also needs to be accompanied by deep, sustained reforms to public administration, justice and the tax system. Private investors must come to believe that such changes are permanent. A high risk is that this burst of public investment will buy Italy several good years, after which it will stagnate again.Some of those reforms have begun, with an array of laws passed this year. But Italy has never suffered a shortage of new laws. What has been lacking has been consistent, coherent implementation of reforms. A few more months of Draghi as premier would be helpful for that, but not transformational.What is needed is for the equilibrium in Italian politics to be shifted towards the long-term acceptance and implementation of such reforms, so that they can endure through successive governments. That is a tall order, but the strict conditions imposed by the European Commission on each tranche of EU funds will give it a chance. Even better, however, would be for the terms of public debate to be reset, in a sustained and coherent way, by a head of state held in high regard at home and abroad. In other words, by President Draghi.For decades, Italy’s presidency was marginal and mainly ceremonial in function. But as political parties have fragmented in recent times, presidents have used the role’s limited powers — dissolution of parliament, designation of prime ministers, approval of cabinets — increasingly effectively. The latest two, Giorgio Napolitano and Mattarella, have acted like a blend of non-executive chair and secular pope.If he does ascend to the Quirinale in February, there likely remains sufficient support in parliament for a new, interim government to be formed, probably under one of his current non-political ministers: what politicos are calling a governo fotocopia, as close to Draghi’s administration as possible. It would be weak and probably unable to pass much new legislation. But it could carry out an important job of public communication while doing more of the detailed work needed to spend the EU money well. Then all would be to play for in a 2023 election, overseen by President Draghi.
115  A female Deutsche Bank trainee accused a male colleague of sexual assault and another of sexual harassment, triggering an investigation that led to the dismissal of one of the men.Germany’s largest lender alerted criminal prosecutors to the allegations soon after they were made in February 2021. The bank’s own probe did not substantiate the most serious allegations but found that both men had exchanged inappropriate text messages and photos with the woman.The more senior of the men, who was fired, had also improperly secured the trainee preferential treatment at work, according to documents seen by the Financial Times.Deutsche Bank’s investigation and the subsequent dismissal come amid changing attitudes in a country that has been slow to embrace the MeToo movement, which started in the US four years ago.Thirteen per cent of female employees in Germany experience sexual harassment at work, according to a 2019 study on behalf of the Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency.Julia Viohl, who specialises in German labour law at Berlin-based law firm Vangard, said there remained barriers to employers taking swift action in harassment cases.“Under German labour law, an employee who is harassing cannot be fired automatically,” she said, adding that only grave violations can be punished by immediate dismissal. Moreover, German courts sometimes ruled in favour of the accused harasser. “I can only shake my head about some recent rulings.”At Deutsche Bank, the investigation was launched after the female trainee disclosed the allegations in a lawsuit related to her own dismissal. The FT is not revealing the identities of those involved due to legal constraints.One of the men, who is still under investigation by Deutsche Bank and criminal prosecutors, had a romantic relationship with the trainee before she applied to join the bank.The woman alleged that he helped her get the job, including disclosing a case study used to assess candidates. She said that he mentally abused and threatened her and forced her into sex, including sadomasochism. Both the man and the woman took photos and videos of the interactions, some of which were submitted to court.This banker was temporarily suspended but has now returned to work, pending the outcome of a wider probe into his behaviour. He has denied all wrongdoing and said that all sexual encounters were consensual. He did not respond to a request for comment.A criminal probe against the more senior male employee was dropped after prosecutors concluded that there was insufficient evidence of criminality. However, Deutsche Bank fired him after an internal investigation found evidence of other misconduct, people familiar with the matter said.The criminal prosecutor and lawyers for the trainee and the fired employee declined to comment.The woman was in her late twenties when she started as a trainee at Deutsche Bank. She did not report to either of the accused employees. The more senior manager, who is significantly older than her, added the trainee as a contact on LinkedIn a few months after she had joined, and she then sent him an innocuous chat message, according to people familiar with the matter.The senior manager told Deutsche Bank that he added the woman to his LinkedIn contacts only after she was automatically suggested by the social network’s algorithm.Days after an initial exchange of messages on LinkedIn, the senior manager arranged to have dinner with the trainee at an expensive restaurant. The dinner did not ultimately take place but a few months later both met for the first time over a coffee in a public space, and some months later at least once in the woman’s apartment, which was paid for by Deutsche Bank.Eight months after their first contact, the senior manager and the woman started to discuss sexual preferences in messages. The senior employee then sent the woman explicit photos. On at least one occasion, the trainee had encouraged him to do so, according to chat messages.The senior manager confirmed the authenticity of the chats as well as the fact that he had urged the woman to delete the messages, according to people familiar with the matter.Deutsche Bank’s probe found evidence that the senior manager had illicitly interfered with the woman’s training programme, according to people familiar with the matter. After the trainee expressed desire to spend time at a particular Deutsche Bank division, he forwarded an email to colleagues in the relevant business unit, asking if they were interested in hosting her.After a negative response, the senior employee turned to a colleague who worked in human resources. This person enabled the plan while pointing out that the posting was “unusual” and not part of the ordinary training schedule, documents seen by the FT show.The woman told Deutsche Bank that the senior employee had tried to kiss her against her will on two occasions. She also said that she felt pressured to have sex with him, which she refused, and later suspected he was responsible for her dismissal.The lender’s probe did not find evidence that the senior manager was involved in the termination decision, and the court dismissed the woman’s lawsuit over unfair dismissal and unfair treatment.The senior manager denied the kissing attempts and all other allegations of wrongdoing. He acknowledged during the probe that he had, on one occasion, insisted that a chat about her career take place in her apartment.The bank, whose executive board discussed the case, dismissed the senior employee over alleged tampering with internal processes and the sharing of inappropriate content with a junior employee. He is challenging his dismissal in court.A person familiar with the case told the FT that the bank believed that this employee had “crossed a line” and displayed a serious “lack of judgment”.The human resources employee involved in arranging the trainee’s unusual internal move was also reprimanded by Deutsche Bank.“Where necessary and appropriate, we have taken action and will continue to do so in the future,” the bank told the FT, adding that it promoted a “speak-up culture to encourage any employee experiencing discrimination, harassment, or unfair treatment to report any such experiences”.
116  Representatives of Europe’s biggest logistics companies have hit out at “systematic” problems at Deutsche Bahn, whose freight business has become so unreliable that German manufacturers are having to use trucks to transport key supplies instead.Volkswagen and steelmaker Saarstahl are among those who have been affected by disruption at the state-owned railway operator, the companies said, worsening the supply chain problems already affecting industrial production in the country.According to Deutsche Bahn’s half-year report, only 71 per cent of freight trains in Germany were on time between January and June, compared to 80 per cent a year earlier. Over the past weeks, widespread engineering works, combined with driver shortages and rolling stock and ageing track infrastructure, have brought freight transport in Germany almost to a halt, people familiar with the matter told the Financial Times.In an attempt to handle the rising congestion, Deutsche Bahn has prioritised passenger trains over freight.The company said it was in a “close, solution-oriented exchange with rail freight customers in order to find individual solutions for all sectors”.The escalating problems add to the challenges facing the new German government, which wants to increase rail from 18 to 25 per cent of all freight transport by 2030 and to double passenger numbers, as part of efforts to fight climate change.Manufacturers rely on freight trains particularly to transport commodities like coal, iron ore, and sheet metal steel.Deutsche Bahn’s heavily loss making freight unit accounted for a tenth of overall group revenue of €21.8bn in the first half of the year and was responsible for a fifth of operating losses of €975m.The current congestion and delays have been most acute in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia and along the Rhine Valley, in particular around the Duisburg area, which is home to the continent’s largest steelworks, run by Thyssenkrupp, the Network of European Railways said.The lobby group, which represents dozens of European logistics companies, cited a recent example where freight trains were delayed by close to eight hours between the Dutch city of Venlo and the south-German city of Kehl.NEE said that management at DB Netz, the subsidiary that manages rail infrastructure, were responsible for a “de facto systematic restriction” of the network.In a letter sent last month to DB Netz and Germany’s transport minister, seen by the Financial Times, NEE said management was in danger of causing “lasting damage to confidence” in rail freight.“As the central infrastructure service provider in the value chain, DB Netz is currently causing freight railways an extraordinary number of problems. which require rapid and sustained action on the part of the company’s top management,” the letter said.“Nothing less than the functioning of large parts of national and especially cross-border freight transport by rail is at stake,” it added.It claimed that for five days in recent weeks, train path bookings at DB Netz had to be sent by fax because of understaffing and technology problems.Leading German business lobby, the BDI, held an unscheduled meeting this week to discuss the rail freight bottlenecks.The new government has also said it will quiz Deutsche Bahn’s executive board over fraud allegations related to the €8.2bn construction of a new station in Stuttgart.The project has been overseen since 2017 by Angela Merkel’s former chief of staff, Ronald Pofalla, who is now a Deutsche Bahn executive and the head of DB Netz’s supervisory board.
117  European countries are tightening restrictions to reduce the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant with the Netherlands leading the way after reimposing a strict nationwide lockdown on Saturday.Germany set new entry requirements for people from the UK and several other European countries, with Berlin on Sunday designating the UK a “virus variant region”, triggering the country’s toughest travel regulations.As of Monday, only German citizens, residents and transit passengers will be allowed to enter Germany from the UK. Those entering the country will be required to quarantine for 14 days, regardless of their vaccination status.New travel restrictions were also introduced for arrivals from Denmark, France and Norway. New arrivals must quarantine for at least five days if they are not vaccinated or recovered from the virus.Omicron is far more infectious than previous strains and can be caught by those who are double vaccinated.Covid-19 infections have also spiked in the US over the past week: both New York State and the District of Columbia have reported successive days of record cases. President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser warned on Sunday of mounting “stress” on the US hospital system as new cases start “raging” through America and the world.“Our hospitals, if things look like they’re looking now, in the next week or two, are going to be very stressed with people,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told ABC on Sunday.Austria, which is just emerging from a national lockdown, said it would allow entry only to vaccinated travellers from Monday. Those who had not received a booster shot would be required to take a test in order to enter the country.The Dutch government has closed all bars, non-essential shops, hospitality venues, cinemas and gyms until at least January 14. Professional sports events will take place without crowds, and households can invite a maximum of four guests during the Christmas period, to be reduced to two after the holidays.While no country has yet gone as far as the Netherlands, all are under pressure from scientists to act. Ireland is introducing an 8pm curfew for pubs and restaurants from Monday after the government rowed back from recommendations from health experts to order hospitality venues to shut at 5pm.Public health officials in Ireland warned of as many as 20,000 infections per day and, in the worst-case scenario, up to 2,000 people in hospital and 400 requiring critical care.“The level of social contact over the next three weeks is key,” Philip Nolan, who heads epidemiological modelling for the scientific group advising the Irish government, wrote on Twitter on Saturday. “The difference between a 10 per cent reduction in effective social contact and what we had in Christmas 2020 could double the number of infections.”Italy’s health ministry this weekend told regions to strengthen planning measures to manage the current phase of the epidemic and a potential surge in hospitalisations.Campania, the region that contains Naples and the Amalfi coast, banned indoor gatherings including children’s parties.UK health minister Sajid Javid said he could give no guarantees that he would not order a pre-Christmas lockdown.Spain and Portugal, where vaccination levels are among the highest in Europe, warned that they might have to tighten restrictions as the Omicron variant spreads.Pedro Sánchez, the Spanish prime minister, has called an online meeting of regional government heads on Wednesday to assess the potential introduction of more restrictive measures.In a televised address on Sunday, he said the rapid spread of Covid infections posed “a real risk”, but noted that, despite higher daily infection rates, the number of patients being hospitalised was lower than a year ago, before vaccination began.Belgium will consider possible new measures on Wednesday.France has banned tourist and business travel from the UK from Saturday with exceptions for French nationals and residents and those with essential reasons to travel.There were protests in several countries. More than 25,000 people demonstrated across France on Saturday in more than 100 protests against vaccine requirements and other restrictions related to the pandemic, the police said. It was the 23rd weekend running of such protests.In Germany, there were demonstrations in cities including Hamburg, Nuremberg and Cottbus, with some turning violent. The demonstrators raised placards saying: “Thinking mandate instead of vaccine mandate”, a reference to a push by the new German government to pass a law requiring vaccination next year.Additional reporting by Jude Webber in Dublin, Victor Mallet in Paris, Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli in Milan, James Politi in Washington and Peter Wise in Lisbon
118  There are quotes so good they become trite through overuse. So it might be thought of Jean Monnet’s line that Europe will be forged in crises and become the sum of the solutions it addresses them with. Cliché or not, the foresight of Monnet — one of the architects of the EU — has held up in this crisis as it has in past ones. The pandemic helped the EU cross the Rubicon of common borrowing for fiscal transfers.But another change also pushed the EU forward in this crisis, which didn’t involve finding new solutions but rediscovering something old. For two decades from the 1990s on, Europe’s governing parties — the centre-right but also the centre-left, notably under Gerhard Schröder in Germany — were seduced by a form of market fundamentalism-cum-redistribution: restrain the state, let markets work their magic, then compensate where necessary. That governing philosophy was already wearing thin after years of fiscal austerity, under-investment, and the growing threat of climate change. The pandemic put the nail in the coffin: the obvious imperative of smart state intervention, to manage the health crisis and to support livelihoods through lockdowns, allows Europe to embrace the social market economy again.The relish with which the European commission is running with this revaluation of the economy’s social aspects makes it near-unrecognisable from its own incarnation of just a decade ago. Then, it was the champion of fiscal consolidation, deregulation, and “competitiveness” in the form of lower unit labour costs, aka compressing the wage share of national income. And now?This month the commission launched an action plan for the “social economy” — the various types of entities that carry out economic but not-for-profit activities, from social enterprises to mutual societies and charities. In the same week, it published proposals to firm up and clarify gig workers’ rights — putting into legislation some of the developments that have been taking place in courts around the world or by individual EU governments to ensure that platform workers do not get short-changed by cracks in labour law.Meanwhile, its year-old push for an EU directive on adequate minimum wages is gathering pace. The Nordic countries, which don’t have legal minimum wages, have opposed it for fear it will undermine their model of collective bargaining. Now Sweden’s new social democratic prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, has accepted a compromise in the council of national governments. It is very possible the French council presidency will bring the process to a conclusion next year.Wind in the sails of Europe’s social market economy, then. But these winds are international. In the US, Joe Biden’s administration is explicitly making policy using a doctrine I describe as progressive supply-side economics, which sees social spending as investments into higher work participation and greater private sector productivity. The UK, barely a year after leaving the EU in a quest for divergence, adopted a European-style wage replacement scheme for those losing their livelihoods in the pandemic. Its conservative government is raising taxes to historically high levels to fund the public health service. And in Japan, a new prime minister rails against “neoliberalism” and promises a more redistributive economic policy.So the EU and its member states (in many of which the centre-left is ascendant) are riding the changing global currents of economic thinking. That was true in the previous phase, too: the uncritical infatuation with little-regulated markets was a worldwide phenomenon. The difference is that now, Europe is aligning with a global phenomenon that plays to its strengths.In a new paper, economists Thomas Blanchet, Lucas Chancel and Amory Gethin use the most comprehensive methodology of inequality to compare Europe and the US. Europe has more egalitarian incomes; no surprise there. But two other findings are far from obvious. Europe’s greater equality is not due to a more progressive tax and transfer system. In fact the US redistributes more to the poorest. Instead, the markets’ own rewards — before redistributive taxes and transfers — are much more equally shared in Europe. More, in fact, than in America after redistribution.That is the return from persistent social investments — even during the lean years. The global social turn caused by the pandemic allows Europe to reclaim its DNA. Former German chancellor Angela Merkel used to say Europe has 7 per cent of the world’s population, 25 per cent of its economy, but 50 per cent of its social spending. She meant to point out a problem. It looks increasingly like an example to emulate.
119  The EU’s Brexit negotiator has called for a strategic partnership with the UK to tackle key issues including climate change and European security, saying that a resolution of the dispute over Northern Ireland would “re-establish political trust”. Maros Sefcovic, a European Commission vice-president, said London and Brussels should seek to resolve the “politically sensitive issues” over the Northern Ireland protocol early in the new year and before campaigning begins for the regional assembly’s May elections.Speaking to the Financial Times on Friday, the day before UK Brexit minister Lord David Frost’s resignation became public, Sefcovic welcomed the UK’s “more constructive” approach in the past two weeks. London dropped a demand for the European Court of Justice to lose its role in enforcing the protocol and signalled further compromises, which some political observers believe prompted Frost’s decision to quit.Sefcovic on Sunday declined to comment on Frost’s resignation.He said a Northern Ireland deal would allow the two sides “to move to where I think we both should belong: to the global stage, where we are tackling together global challenges from climate change, some security threats from the fringes of Europe and really develop that strategic element of our co-operation”.He said he expected to keep legal action against the UK frozen provided the more constructive dialogue continued, adding that his goal was to “depoliticise and de-dramatise” the relationship between London and Brussels. “We don’t want more conflict, we want less.”But the Slovak former diplomat added that the UK threat of triggering Article 16, which would suspend much of the protocol, was making it harder to advance other aspects of the relationship, including UK membership of the Horizon scientific research programme, which remains suspended. He called for London to “restore the value of the signature below the agreements which have been signed”.“On our side there is much more care into studying the documents we are signing.” Frost’s hardline stance did persuade Brussels to offer changes to the protocol in October, accepting it was creating trade disruption and political concern in Northern Ireland.The protocol avoided a trade border on the island of Ireland by keeping the region in the EU’s single market for goods, with checks taking place between Northern Ireland and the British mainland instead.Brussels on Friday legislated to ensure British medicines could continue to be marketed there. It has also offered an “express lane” for goods heading to Northern Ireland that were unlikely to leak across the border into Ireland and the wider single market.It claims that the changes would cut customs checks in half and health checks by 80 per cent, although the UK has questioned those figures, with the result that talks have hardly progressed.Sefcovic said he could guarantee those reductions but “everything depends on the quality of the safeguards” from the UK, such as giving the EU real-time access to customs data.“Can the trusted trade scheme really be trusted? What will happen in the case where we have some kind of public health alert, some spoilt shrimp or some kind of damaged goods that need to be pulled off the shelves?“Why are you telling us that putting a sticker on a food product ‘only for the UK’ is a huge problem when you have a sticker on everything on the shelves that you can take two for the price of three or there is a discount? What is so cosmically difficult about that?”He called for an end to “political dramas”. “Ninety per cent of the problems coming to us.could be solved at a technical level.“It would be good if we could solve this as quickly as possible.”
120  The Netherlands has become the first EU country to re-enter a strict nationwide lockdown in a response to the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant that will shut swaths of the economy until at least mid-January.Tough new restrictions to close all bars, restaurants, non-essential shops, cinemas and gyms kicked in on Sunday morning and will last until at least January 14. Professional sports events will take place without crowds and homes can invite a maximum of four guests during the Christmas period, to be reduced to two after the holidays.Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte told journalists on Saturday that the measures were “unavoidable” in the face of a variant that was spreading “even faster” than authorities had expected. “We have to intervene now to prevent it from getting worse,” he said.Also on Saturday, Germany announced that it would ban all travellers entering the country from the UK, apart from German nationals, residents and transit passengers, from midnight on Sunday to stop the spread of Omicron.Everyone entering Germany from the UK, whether vaccinated or not, will require a negative PCR test and will have to quarantine for 14 days.The Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s main public health agency, announced the restrictions on Saturday evening as it classified the UK as a virus variant area.The Dutch lockdown, which is the toughest imposed since 2020, was announced after an emergency cabinet meeting on Saturday and followed advice from the country’s health authority that a “hard” lockdown was urgently required.The Netherlands has a mixed record handling the pandemic. The government initially opted for a lighter, “intelligent lockdown” during the first phase in 2020. But this year it has been forced to take some of the toughest measures seen anywhere in the EU in the face of surging case rates and hospitalisations. Rutte’s government had come under fire for lifting almost all curbs in September, leading to a surge in infections in the autumn.In the past 24 hours, the Netherlands recorded 14,742 positive Covid-19 cases, continuing a steadily declining trend for the past month. The numbers are down from a peak of more than 24,000 recorded in November, but health authorities have advised stricter measures are needed to contain Omicron.The Dutch health authority (RIVM) estimates that Omicron will become the dominant cause of infections before the end of the year. Jaap van Dissel, director of disease control at RIVM said that as of today, the new strain accounted for only a “small share of infections.but we know that share will increase”. The government is also ramping up access to booster shots after falling behind its EU peers on administering additional doses that health experts say are vital in maintaining some immunity to the virus. The Netherlands was also slower than most EU countries in vaccinating people, starting its immunisation programme in January this year.Restrictive measures have been met with street protests and violence in recent months, notably during two nights of rioting in Rotterdam last month.Rutte urged the country to show unity. “We have previously proven that we can handle a lot together. Together we will also overcome this period. I am absolutely convinced of that,” he said.Additional reporting by Guy Chazan in Berlin
121  Roberto Cingolani has a blunt message for Italians opposed to new wind turbines or solar farms in their local area.“The alternative is you get rid of your car, no air con, no mobile phone, no internet at all,” Italy’s minister for energy transition told the FT in an interview. “Citizens have to understand this.”Cingolani, a physicist and academic, was appointed by Mario Draghi, the prime minister, this year to spearhead a renewed drive to reduce Italy’s carbon emissions. He is responsible for spending about a third of Italy’s €200bn share of the EU’s €800bn pandemic recovery fund.Italy is the biggest beneficiary of the fund. The money gives Rome, under Draghi’s leadership, a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reboot its economy after two decades of stagnation, with the green transition central to its recovery fund plans.Cingolani has set a target of producing at least 70 per cent of electricity from renewables by 2030, a big step up from the 55 per cent commitment Rome has formally made with the EU. The current level is 34 per cent.In recent years, Italy’s shift to renewables has stalled. Between 2015 and 2020, only 2 gigawatts of wind capacity and 3GW of solar were brought online, out of a total installed capacity of 116GW, according to analysts at Ember, a campaign group.Renewables account for only 17 per cent of Italy’s total energy mix, leaving it dependent on expensive natural gas, 95 per cent of which is imported. “Our energy mix is very poor,” Cingolani said.The country has been hard hit by recent gas price rises. The government has already earmarked €3bn to help poorer households and small businesses pay their bills and is preparing a further package of assistance next year.Italy needed to triple its generating capacity from wind and solar by 2030, Cingolani said. “There is no plan B.”The objective is likely to be a stretch given Italy’s notorious bureaucracy and frequent political resistance to new infrastructure projects. The minister said 3GW of renewable energy projects were currently blocked because of objections over the impact on landscape and heritage.Streamlining lengthy administrative procedures to unlock growth is one of the main aims of Italy’s pandemic recovery plan.Cingolani said that since Draghi took office at the head of a national unity government in February, following the collapse of the former administration, Italy had implemented a “very powerful simplification” of rules and procedures for authorising new projects. Officials estimated that the time taken to obtain a permit for an infrastructure project could be cut from 1,200 to 270 days, “which is best in class”, he said.The central government has also adopted new “powers of substitution”, allowing it to override regional and local authorities and other bodies in the event of protracted delays in authorising infrastructure projects.Cingolani said the EU recovery fund — with €27bn allocated to decarbonising power generation and industry — would only take the country part of the way to the EU goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. “I see the recovery plan as the booster in the rocket that has to go from Earth to Mars. The challenge is in five years, the money will finish,” he said.Although Italy phased out nuclear power generation following a referendum in 1987, it should consider bringing it back, Cingolani said. It was “too late” to use nuclear to help reach the 2030 targets for renewable energy because the sector now lacked investment and expertise, he said. But he argued that by 2050, demand for clean electricity would be five times what Italy hoped to generate in 2030 and so all technologies, including small modular reactors, had to be considered.“I’m not a fan of nuclear, I’m a fan of innovation,” said Cingolani, who joined the government from defence company Leonardo, where he was chief technology officer.Previously scientific director of the Italian Institute of Technology, he described himself as a “technical minister. I’m not very political”.Asked whether it would be possible to take the public with him on the massive expansion of renewables, he was candid: “As elsewhere, the answer is No.”However, it was important “not to make ideology out of energy”, he said. Governments had to be “very reasonable”, especially when it came to raising the price of carbon.Rome has previously expressed misgivings about the EU’s plans to extend the emissions trading scheme to housing and transport, which would raise energy bills for consumers. It has said it wants to understand the economic impact on households before giving its blessing.“We do want to do good things, but in the meantime there are social problems,” Cingolani said. “Sustainability is a compromise.”
122  His country faces an imminent threat of full-blown invasion, according to US intelligence, with more than 100,000 Russian troops amassed at the border. But Ukraine’s embattled president Volodymyr Zelensky has chosen the moment of danger to deepen a domestic stand-off with the country’s richest oligarch, Rinat Akhmetov.In a press conference late last month, Zelensky claimed, without providing evidence, that his intelligence services had uncovered plans for a Russian-backed coup that aimed to lure in support from Akhmetov.“I think [Akhmetov] may not know about it,” the president said before adding: “I invite Rinat Akhmetov to [my office] to listen to the information that can be shared.”Zelensky’s extraordinary decision to draw a powerful businessman into an alleged plot has dismayed analysts and western diplomats, given the heightened Russian threat and multiple problems including the country’s low Covid-19 vaccination rate and high death toll.Oleksandr Danylyuk, briefly national security chief under Zelensky, said his weakness “is an unwillingness and maybe inability to consolidate society and elites amid the Russian aggression threat”.“At a time when Russia is threatening to attack, it is really critical that the pro-Western forces in Ukraine be working together,” said a western diplomat who has worked closely with Ukraine. “The current domestic fighting in Ukraine is damaging.”Zelensky won the presidency in 2019, promising to end the war in eastern Ukraine and to root out corruption. He has made little progress on the first and has a mixed reform record. A hoped-for robust economic recovery from the pandemic has faltered.Akhmetov, a steel and energy tycoon, has rejected alleged involvement in a coup plot as “lies”. Experts say his television channels have been increasingly critical of Zelensky, upping the ante in a disagreement between two of Ukraine’s most powerful people.Meanwhile, the looming fear from Washington to Kyiv is that Russia’s military build-up spells plans by president Vladimir Putin to destabilise Ukraine and possibly initiate a full-blown military incursion. Ukrainian troops are battling Russian-backed separatists in far eastern regions, in a proxy war fomented in 2014 soon after Putin occupied Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula.“I don’t recall any other president who was ready to challenge Akhmetov” but “the Russians will exploit this moment when Ukraine is weaker internally”, said Daria Kaleniuk, director of anti-corruption watchdog Antac.“Maybe Zelensky thinks going after the oligarchs will rally the population and ultimately help the national cause in resistance against Russia,” said Timothy Ash, analyst at BlueBay Asset Management.Since winning the presidency in 2019 after many voters cast ballots in a protest at his predecessor, Zelensky’s poll ratings have plunged. A recent poll has shown that he could lose a re-election bid, with erstwhile ally Dmytro Razumkov, who was ousted this autumn as speaker of parliament, positioned to beat him in a run-off.Experts say Razumkov has received favourable coverage on Akhmetov’s television channels. In turn, Zelensky’s MPs have boycotted what they view as hostile media.“Because Akhmetov started eating into Zelensky’s popularity by using his media,” the president responded with his “fairytale” claim that the oligarch could be part of a coup plot, said Maria Zolkina, an expert at Kyiv’s Democratic Initiatives Foundation.Their dispute is also grounded in legislation adopted this autumn taking aim at the influence of rich business figures.The so-called de-oligarchisation law would formally register oligarchs — defining them by reference to their wealth and media and political influence. It would ban them from funding politics, prohibit participation in privatisation and require all contact with public servants to be reported.“Akhemtov is really unhappy about this anti-oligarch law, and to some extent it is really a tipping point,” said Yuriy Vitrenko, chief executive of the state gas company Naftogaz and a trusted presidential confidant.“It is very difficult for the president to implement [the rest of] his reform agenda unless he changes the situation with the oligarchs.”In written comments to the Financial Times, Akhmetov questioned the fairness of the law, saying: “I am not an oligarch, I am an investor. And I am ready to defend it in Ukrainian and international courts.”“We all need a fair competition and a level playing field,” he added.Political analysts see scope for compromise between Zelensky and Akhmetov. “Zelensky wants an end to the massive criticism.which has been airing on Akhmetov’s channels,” said political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko. “Akhmetov wants the president to withdraw or soften the oligarch law.”The oligarch law was “not the best solution,” a western diplomat in Kyiv said. “The way to defang the oligarchs is by improving antitrust law, speeding up judicial reform and building anti-corruption institutions.These things will have a bigger impact in the medium and long term.”Some experts and diplomats fear the oligarch law could be used by Zelensky for a selective crackdown on non-loyal business figures.“The question is whether the same approach is taken to all oligarchs,” said Kaleniuk. She pointed to positive coverage for Zelensky on channels owned by Igor Kolomoisky, an oligarch who backed the president’s election campaign.Since before Zelensky’s election Kolomoisky has been part of legal battles over PrivatBank, a commercial lender nationalised in 2016 after authorities uncovered a $5.5bn hole in its balance sheet. Ukrainian authorities and PrivatBank allege in court cases spanning multiple jurisdictions that Kolomoisky and partners siphoned money out of the bank under their ownership.Ukrainian prosecutors have not brought any charges against Kolomoisky, who denies claims of corruption.Addressing parliament this month, Zelensky took another swipe at Akhmetov and other oligarchs without mentioning them by name. He unveiled plans to use taxes from natural resources for a fund for the country’s next generation to finance higher education and home purchases.“Then our oligarchs will become real investors in our children,” Zelensky said.“For the first time in 30 years, we have started a systematic struggle against the oligarchs. And I am sure that Ukraine will win this fight.”
123  Of all the ecclesiastical sartorialists in the Eternal City – many of which line the streets surrounding Santa Chiara, rendering the area a kind of Mayfair of high-church vestments – Gammarelli is probably the best-known; certainly it’s been the most popular with the Office of the Holy Father. (The lone outlier, Pius XII, “only had his first three vestments made by us”, notes co-owner Massimiliano Gammarelli. “He already had a personal tailor he liked very much – so, you know.”) Along with only a handful of others, it has also achieved a degree of popularity with the secular tastemakers of the world. Ever since Giovanni Antonio Gammarelli founded the shop at the end of the 18th century, six generations have continued the tradition. Today, Massimiliano, along with cousins Stefano Paolo and Lorenzo, oversees the production of cassocks and cloaks, albs and scapulars, mozzettas and surplices and mitres (most of the garments are hand-tailored). “We have a clientele that comes from all over,” notes Massimiliano.Inside, along two walls, floor-to-ceiling shelves house bolts of fabrics – cottons and silks in rich red and purple, and ornate brocades shot through with metallic threads, almost all still produced in Italy. Rolls of fringe and braiding are neatly arranged alongside. Throughout the two small rooms of the shop, portraits of past Pontiffs hang or are propped on tables and cabinets. Full-length black priest’s cassocks, their collars and buttons (33 of them, one for each year of Christ’s life) covered in plush velvet, hang on hooks; glass cases hold crucifixes and bishop’s rings studded with amethysts and topaz, along with an array of ornately inlaid gemelli, or cufflinks (from €18.33), many of them associated with Ecumenical and Equestrian Orders: Saint Gregory, Saint Lazarus, the Knights of Malta. There are one or two pairs of accidentally fabulous buckled calfskin loafers (from €150).And socks. Socks are key because they are the Gammarelli crossover superstar, having long ago burst out of the sacristy and into the wardrobes of dandies and style enthusiasts. Their more famous fans range from former French prime minister Edouard Balladur to Balenciaga’s creative director Demna Gvasalia, who sent them down his couture runway last summer. Knee-length socks are produced in cotton lisle, merino wool or pure silk (from €11), and the traditional colourway – red for cardinals, black for priests, purple for bishops, and white for His Holiness – was some years ago augmented with various fashion shades: navy, yellow, turquoise and a burgundy. “After Balladur started wearing them, they became quite popular among the French,” says Massimiliano. “Then it just slowly grew, until they were a little famous around the world.”For such a sought-after bit of haberdashery, they get fairly subtle play in the shop, with just a single shelf allocated to their display. But the real surprise is a vignette of tiny Gammarelli anklets, in red and purple, for babies aged three months, six months and one year. A concession to the exigencies of commercialism or a nod to the transcendent power of the absurdly adorable? Does it matter? They are – no other word for it – divine.
124  Brussels has complained that a senior US official is campaigning on behalf of Big Tech, days after the EU approved a common position on draft rules aimed at curbing the power of large American tech companies, fuelling a transatlantic tit-for-tat among senior officials.Thierry Breton, the EU internal markets commissioner, accused US commerce secretary Gina Raimondo of lobbying on behalf of the sector after she said this month that new European rules were “disproportionately” targeting US companies.Breton said he had already discussed these concerns with Raimondo and that he was “a little bit astonished” to learn that she was airing the same issues publicly.He said: “This is not something that we do against anybody. We do it for our European fellow citizens and our companies. This is our duty.”The commissioner said the chief executives of the world’s largest tech platforms, including Google and Facebook, had his “cell number” and could call him to air their concerns. He also said these companies took part in extensive discussions ahead of the EU’s draft rules and that they had plenty of time to “express their concerns”.He said: “We could discuss. So we don’t need any extra lobbying.” The US was also having a debate on regulating Big Tech, he said: “But I don’t want to interfere in what’s happening in the US and I think it’s fair not to interfere in what’s happening in Europe. It’s a balanced way of fair play for fair partners.”The EU commissioner’s comments come at a particularly awkward time for large online platforms in Brussels. Just this week the European Parliament agreed on a common position on the Digital Markets Act, a draft piece of legislation aimed at curbing the power of Big Tech.The new rules are expected to ban anti-competitive behaviour by the large platforms, including any highlighting of their own products or services at the expense of rivals, and to force big platforms like Google and Facebook to share data with smaller rivals.While the DMA was created to force so-called gatekeepers, such as Amazon, to ensure more equal terms on their online platforms, the Digital Services Act will seek to clarify the way large online companies should keep illegal content off their platforms.This is not the first time US officials have complained about EU draft legislation unfairly targeting American companies. Last June, the US accused Brussels of pushing “protectionist” technology policies that were specifically targeting American companies.The National Security Council, an arm of the White House, wrote to complain about the tone of recent comments about the EU’s flagship tech regulation. “We are particularly concerned about recent comments by the European Parliament rapporteur for the Digital Markets Act, Andreas Schwab, who suggested the DMA should unquestionably target only the five biggest US firms,” their complaint, dated June 9, said.The commerce department said on Friday that while Raimondo supported the goals of the Digital Markets Act, it was longstanding practice for the US government to consult to ensure other jurisdiction’s laws did not discriminatorily target US firms.“While we appreciate the assurances of our European colleagues about their non-discriminatory intentions, it is still unclear whether the current and proposed scoping requirements under the DMA will cover well-known tech platforms, for example, from China and Europe,” a spokesperson said.
125  Russia has published a set of stringent demands it is making of the US and Nato, which would end all prospect of Ukraine or any more former Soviet states joining the transatlantic alliance and rewrite many of the principles upholding European security since the end of the cold war.Moscow’s demands go even further than the “red lines” mentioned by President Vladimir Putin, who has said they are needed to insulate Russia from the threat of attack, and many have previously been ruled out by Nato and its members.The US and EU are worried that the proposals could be a prelude to war after Russia deployed about 100,000 troops near its border with Ukraine in recent weeks.Putin, who denies Moscow plans to invade its neighbour, has blamed the tensions on Nato, for supplying Kyiv with advanced weaponry and holding “provocative” exercises near Russia’s borders.Sergei Ryabkov, a deputy Russian foreign minister, said Moscow wanted to begin negotiations over its proposals in Geneva as soon as possible.“US and Nato have aggressively escalated the security situation in recent years, which is absolutely unacceptable and extremely dangerous,” Ryabkov said. “Washington and its Nato allies must immediately end their regular hostile acts against our country.”Joe Biden, the US president, agreed to discuss Putin’s grievances further in a video call last week but has given no indication that Washington could accept the demands. Ryabkov called on the White House to take Moscow’s demands seriously.A senior US administration official said Washington was concerned by Russia’s “increasingly harsh rhetoric” and “false narrative that Ukraine is somehow seeking to provoke a conflict with Russia”.Under the draft proposals, Nato would have to seek consent from Moscow to deploy troops in former Communist countries in Europe that joined Nato in May 1997.Nato would have to refrain from “any military activity” in Ukraine, eastern Europe, the southern Caucasus, and central Asia; pledge not to deploy any missiles close enough to hit Russia; and limit exercises to previously agreed numbers in border zones.A separate treaty with the US would require each side to keep their bombers, naval vessels and missiles out of striking distance of the other party, as well as limiting all their nuclear weapons to their own territory.The US would also pledge not to set up bases in any former Soviet countries or partner with their militaries.The US official said Washington was prepared to discuss some elements of Moscow’s proposals. “That said, there are some things in those documents that the Russians know will be unacceptable,” the official added.Jen Psaki, White House press secretary, speaking on Air Force One, said: “We will not compromise the key principles on which European security is built, including that all countries have the right to decide their own future and foreign policy free from outside interference.”Jens Stoltenberg, Nato secretary-general, did not rule out discussions on Russia’s demands but said the alliance was “clear that any dialogue with Russia would also need to address Nato’s concerns about Russia’s actions, be based on the core principles and documents of European security and take place in consultation with Nato’s European partners such as Ukraine”.Nato members want to avoid dismissing Russia’s proposals out of hand and giving Putin a propaganda victory, while at the same time making clear that many of the demands — including ruling out Ukraine’s potential membership of the alliance — are unacceptable.Alliance officials are also aware that, without negotiations to defuse tension and reverse Russian troop deployments, Moscow may seek to establish its militarisation of the border as an accepted baseline.Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry, said: ‘We emphasise that only Ukraine and Nato member states have the right to decide the direction of further development of our relations, including the matter of Ukraine gaining membership in the alliance.“The same applies to the exclusive sovereign right of Ukraine to independently determine the course of its relations with foreign states at the bilateral level, which includes military co-operation.”
126  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
127  The festive season plans of millions of Europeans have been thrown into doubt by the Omicron variant that has dealt a heavy blow to the winter sports industry across the continentAfter months of generally free movement for vaccinated adults, EU governments have unilaterally started placing new entry requirements on travellers, even within the union’s borderless travel area.France has taken the most radical step by banning tourist travel to and from the UK, which is battling an Omicron-fuelled surge in Covid-19 infections, causing the cancellation of thousands of ski holidays and trips to second homes in the country.Several Eurostar trains from London to Paris sold out on Thursday and Friday as people rushed to travel before the Saturday deadline. But hoteliers at the Morzine resort in the French Alps were inundated with cancellations after the announcement. Sara Burdon, communications manager at the Morzine tourism office, described it as “the worst kind of timing”.“Every British booking we’ve got as of this Saturday is going to be cancelling or is already cancelling, which represents well over 50 per cent of all Christmas and New Year bookings and over 60 per cent of January bookings,” she said.With half of the customers gone and no government support, Burdon said she expected the impact would be even more severe than last winter when ski lifts were closed.John Dredge, who owns More Mountain, a 350-guest chalet business in Morzine, said “this week’s rule change could be the nail in the coffin”. All of his post-Christmas bookings have been cancelled, equivalent to one twelfth of £2.5m annual turnover. “Knee-jerk reactions are being made week after week that massively affect us,” he said.Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne, France’s tourism minister, called on French citizens to step in and fill the gap. “About 15 per cent of ski tourism business in France is from UK travellers, so we did not take this decision lightly,” he told France Info radio on Friday. “I’d encourage French people who had not reserved a ski trip since the availability was quite low before to try to book now out of solidarity.”The restrictions on British tourists were “yet another blow” after two tough years, said Niall Walsh, chief operation officer at Direct Ferries, a booking service. Christmas was among the busiest times on the Dover- Calais route.Scientists believe that Omicron, identified in South Africa in November, to be more transmissible than earlier variants and more likely to evade the immune protection provided by vaccines or previous infection. At a summit on Thursday in Brussels, some EU leaders attacked unilateral actions they said were undermining efforts to maintain a common system of Covid-era travel inside the union.But they appear to be fighting a losing battle as politicians sought to protect their populations from infection and health systems from becoming overloaded. Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, has suggested PCR tests for all travellers from outside the EU to try to preserve free movement in the borderless Schengen zone. Several countries including Italy, Portugal and Greece now demand people take tests before arriving.Filippo Taddei, senior European economist at Goldman Sachs, said the restrictions would present “challenges” for winter tourism. He estimated that an international travel ban on the industry would knock about 0.5 percentage points off growth in Italy and France and about 0.2 percentage points off Swiss growth.International visitors accounted for as much as three-quarters of tourism in the Alpine region of Austria, roughly half of it in France, Italy and Switzerland, and about a quarter in Germany, according to Taddei.But there were already signs that tighter domestic restrictions were damping demand at restaurants, hotels and bars in many parts of Europe.IHS Markit said its monthly survey of eurozone purchasing managers found “a steep fall in tourism and recreation activity of a similar magnitude to the declines seen at the start of the year amid rising Covid-19 infection rates and associated restrictions across the region”. It said this contributed to a fall in new inflows of business for euro area services companies to the lowest level since May, when they were rebounding from the last round of lockdowns.Italy, Greece and Portugal this week announced that even vaccinated visitors from the EU would be required to present a negative test result, joining Ireland. Greece’s similar measure takes effect from December 19 and will only apply during the Christmas period.Kyriakos Mitsotakis Greek prime minister, said he needed “to gain additional time to boost as many people as possible”. Businesses are concerned. “The changes and travel restrictions are the biggest problems we face in this phase of the pandemic’‘, said Yannis Retsos, head of the Greek Tourist Confederation. “It has an impact on hotel reservations, even the limited number we have due to winter are under doubt.”Switzerland, another popular ski destination, requires all travellers — whether vaccinated or not — to present a negative PCR result before entry, and to complete further testing on day four and seven of their stay.Neighbouring Austria, which has just emerged from a three week national lockdown, and other EU members such as Belgium and the Netherlands require tests only for the unvaccinated.Sweden imposed its first restrictions on travellers from its Nordic neighbours on Thursday, demanding proof of vaccination, prior infection, or a negative test. Meanwhile, Finland has introduced a requirement for travellers from the UK, Norway and Denmark to test themselves at the border. In addition from Tuesday, all travellers from outside the Schengen zone will have to show a pre-departure negative test.Additional reporting by Leila Abboud and Anna Gross in Paris, Martin Arnold in Frankfurt, Sam Jones in Zurich and Richard Milne in Oslo
128  This article was published before the writer resigned as the UK’s Brexit ministerWhen I reached agreement with the EU on our free trade deal, this time last year, I hoped that 2021 could be about making the UK’s new relationship with the EU work. Away from the noise, much is indeed working well. But one issue remains difficult and I have spent most of the year managing it — the Northern Ireland protocol.Indeed, no one could have predicted a year ago how 2021 would develop. We saw the EU’s attempt in January to put in place a vaccines export ban across the land border in Ireland; their insistence upon interpreting the protocol as if it provided for a normal external EU border through the middle of the UK; the invocation of infraction proceedings against us that could by now have been before the European Court of Justice; and political turbulence including the departure of the longstanding first minister of Northern Ireland, Arlene Foster.Economically, supply chains started to change and trade started to be diverted. Despite the £500m we committed to make the protocol work, we saw reductions in the supply of goods, discontinuation of medicines, and increased prices for consumers.By the summer, the practical and political difficulties generated by the protocol were obvious to all. Fortunately, we managed to stabilise the situation by presenting, in our July command paper, a full and comprehensive solution to the problems.We also decided then that the best way through, if we could achieve it, was to get a negotiated outcome rather than use the safeguards contained in Article 16 of the protocol. Since then we have been engaged in detailed talks with the EU about the way forward, including on the EU’s own limited proposals put forward in October.Unfortunately we have not managed to make as much progress as I would have wished. With the exception of medicines, where we will look carefully and positively at the EU’s proposals now we have them, what Brussels has put on the table does not do enough to ease the burdens or cover the full range of problems faced by people in Northern Ireland.The burdensome customs arrangements for goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland need to be changed drastically, given the overwhelming importance to the Northern Ireland economy of links with the rest of the UK, far outweighing its links with Ireland.The simplest solution is to put in place substantively different arrangements for goods that all sides agree will stay in the UK and those that will not, and to manage any risks arising in a collaborative way. The EU’s proposals do not do this and our expert analysis does not support the ambitious public claims made for them when they were published.Similarly, Northern Ireland’s state aid rules need to reflect the reality that, since the protocol was signed, we have agreed entirely new subsidy control rules in our free trade agreement, and put in place a new and rigorous domestic regime. The rules in Northern Ireland should evolve to reflect this.And a solution must be found on governance — the undemocratic ways in which EU laws are applied in Northern Ireland, and the role of the ECJ. I know sometimes people dismiss this as an ideological demand. But no solution can work if the European Commission can get the ECJ to sit in judgment upon any of our actions, as happened in March. That kind of hair-trigger response is not the right way to achieve sustainable solutions in Northern Ireland and it is anyway obviously unfair and unreasonable for disputes between us to be settled by the court of one of the parties.We would prefer to find a comprehensive solution to these and the full range of other difficulties. But, given the urgency, we have been ready to consider an interim agreement covering the most acute problems — trade frictions, subsidy control, and the ECJ. We have proposed various possible ways forward, but so far we have not found consensus — even on the content of an interim agreement.The situation remains highly problematic. A protocol that was meant to support the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement is now undermining it. The Northern Ireland institutions are clearly at serious risk.The most recent polling last week showed that 78 per cent of people in Northern Ireland want at least some change to the current arrangements.As long as there is no agreed solution, Article 16 safeguards remain on the table. They may turn out to be the only way of dealing with the problems. But it is still better to find a negotiated way through if we can. Time is short. So the talks need to resume with renewed urgency in the new year if we are to reach an outcome that delivers for everyone in Northern Ireland. The UK will work for that.Letter in response to this article:Frost exit has echo of when Tories played the Irish card / From Matthew Ward, Dublin, Ireland
129  Poland’s parliament has unexpectedly voted through a controversial bill on media ownership that could force the US media conglomerate Discovery to sell a majority stake in Poland’s main independent broadcaster, TVN. The bill, put forward by MPs from the conservative nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS), would prevent companies from outside the European Economic Area from owning a majority stake in Polish media groups. PiS officials claim the law is needed to prevent companies in undemocratic states from taking control of Polish media outlets. But the changes are widely seen as an attack on TVN, which has long found itself in the government’s crosshairs for its often critical coverage.The legislation was vetoed by Poland’s opposition-controlled upper house this year. But PiS MPs abruptly revived the bill on Friday, adding it to the parliamentary agenda at short notice, overriding the upper house’s veto and sending it to President Andrzej Duda for final approval.The move drew strong criticism from the US. The state department said that the law would “undermine freedom of expression, weaken media freedom, and erode foreign investors’ confidence in their property rights and the sanctity of contracts in Poland”.It also called on Duda, who is an ally of PiS but who has previously expressed reservations about the legislation, to veto the bill, warning that if it became law it would damage Poland’s investment climate.Jean-Briac Perrette, chief executive of Discovery International, said he was shocked by the abrupt revival of the bill. But he insisted that Discovery would “continue to fight every which way we can” to protect TVN, which employs about 2,000 people and, with a value of about $3bn, is one of the largest US investments in Poland.“It is an ambush,” he told the Financial Times. “We’re a bit in disbelief that an EU member would, on the eve of Christmas, at the last possible moment, circumventing all due process of how a law should be debated.try and jam this through.”Opposition lawmakers accused the government of returning to the law without warning in an effort to distract from a run of recent bad news, including the announcement earlier on Friday that household gas bills would jump as much as 54 per cent next year.“Today in the Sejm [lower house of parliament] the latest step to the liquidation of the free media [took place],” wrote Miroslaw Suchon, from the opposition grouping Polska 2050, on Twitter. “This is a scandalous decision against our political and economic interests.”The revival of the media ownership bill comes amid broader pressure on independent media groups that has led to Poland falling from 18th to 64th in the World Press Freedom index — below Malawi and Armenia — since PiS took office in 2015.During its time in power, PiS has reduced the public media to the role of a mouthpiece, used a state-owned oil group to buy up a swath of local media outlets and funnelled advertising from state-owned companies to supportive media groups.This year, it also put forward plans for a new tax on advertising revenues, which sparked an unprecedented blackout from private media groups in protest at the move, which they saw as a targeted threat to independent journalism.Poland’s media watchdog also delayed the renewal of the broadcasting licence of TVN’s main news channel, TVN24, until just four days before it was due to expire in September, even though the application had been submitted 19 months earlier.
130  Germany’s powerful business lobby has lashed out at China after the communist country blocked imports from German manufacturers in Lithuania.The BDI accused Beijing of a “devastating own goal” after companies from other EU member states were caught by China’s decision to ban imports from the Baltic country.“The latest measures China has adopted against Lithuania amount to a trade boycott that will impact the whole of the EU,” it said. “Imports from China, which are needed in German manufacturing facilities in Lithuania, are also being affected, as are exports from Germany to China which contain Lithuanian components.”“In the long term, the escalation by China is a devastating own goal. It shows that China is prepared to decouple economically from “politically undesirable” partners. It’s clear to the BDI that any damage to the value chains that are at the heart of the EU single market, is not to be tolerated.”However, in a swipe at Lithuania for bolstering ties with Taiwan, a move that precipitated the crisis, it criticised individual states that were “out of step” with EU policy. China is Germany’s biggest trading partner, with €213bn in goods exchanged in 2020.“It remains important to maintain economic relations with China on a high level,” the BDI said. Its statement will add to pressure on Berlin to intervene diplomatically.Continental, the German blue-chip auto parts supplier, is among the companies to have had exports blocked by customs authorities in China, according to people familiar with the matter. The company makes telematic control units at a factory in the Lithuanian city of Kaunas.China blocked all imports from Lithuania earlier this month, after the Baltic state allowed Taiwan to open a de facto consulate in its capital Vilnius. Beijing, which considers Taiwan to be part of China, also suspended its consular services in Lithuania. Vilnius pulled its diplomats out of China over concerns for their safety.But China’s import ban targeted at Lithuania is now beginning to hurt foreign companies who established manufacturing facilities in the low-cost country.Lithuanian officials met the European Commission on Friday, an industry representative in the country told the Financial Times.The EU is preparing a legal case at the World Trade Organization, which could take months.Continental, which has operations in 58 countries, is considering shipping products from Lithuania via other countries, one person said, in order to avoid further the Chinese blockade. The company declined to comment.Hella, another German supplier with a large plant in Lithuania, has also encountered difficulties with exports to China, according to one industry representative, as have smaller companies with operations in the country. Hella did not immediately respond to requests for comment.A spokeswoman for the German economy ministry said it was aware of the difficulties encountered by Continental and was “concerned” by developments, but did not elaborate on the coalition government’s plans.Florian Schröder, the managing director of the German-Baltic Chamber of Commerce, said several German companies had been seeking advice from the body after having trouble importing or exporting products.“We have been working hard for the past 5 years to establish a small automotive supplier cluster,” he told the FT.“Now things have escalated and many German and Lithuanian companies are affected.”Chinese officials have denied ordering any action, but told the EU that private logistics companies and importers might be avoiding Lithuanian goods in anger over its links with Taiwan.Brussels is collecting evidence but many companies fear that if they complain they will be shut out of China completely.Additional reporting by Richard Milne in Oslo
131  The EU is changing its rules to allow Britain to continue supplying medicines to Northern Ireland as a first step in solving a dispute over post-Brexit trade in the region.Brussels will legislate to permit UK-approved medicines to enter Northern Ireland to avoid a possible shortage due to post-Brexit regulations.The EU move was given a cautious welcome by Lord David Frost following meetings with the EU on Friday, but the UK Brexit negotiator warned that the two sides still had a long way to go to resolve their differences.The solution on medicines, which government officials privately acknowledged will ensure that Northern Ireland has the same access to medicines as the rest of the UK, marked a positive end to several months of at-times fractious negotiations that have poisoned the wider EU-UK relationships.It was welcomed by the pharmaceutical industry in both the EU and the UK. In a joint statement the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) said the EU proposal created a “strong footing for a long-term resolution”But despite the progress as the two sides broke for Christmas, Frost cautioned that they were still far apart on several key issues raised by the so-called Northern Ireland protocol, which governs trade in the region.He added that solutions would need to be found “urgently” for Northern Ireland in the new year ahead of politically sensitive local elections in May, and urged the EU towards more creative solutions.The two sides continue to disagree on how to reduce bureaucratic friction on the Irish Sea border. This was created when Northern Ireland was left behind in the EU single market for goods after Brexit in order to avoid the return of a hard trade border on the island of Ireland.Despite agreeing to the arrangement, Frost has since warned that the level of customs checks on the Irish Sea border is “not sustainable”, arguing it has destabilised the region’s politics and made trade too complex and expensive for some smaller companies in Great Britain wanting to send goods to Northern Ireland.“I do not believe that the negotiations are yet close to delivering outcomes which can genuinely solve the problems presented by the protocol,” he said in a statement, adding it was “disappointing” a comprehensive deal had not been possible this year.Frost wants drastic changes to the operation of the Northern Ireland protocol. But this week he dropped his demand to remove the oversight of the European Court of Justice from the protocol and has offered to agree to an interim deal on the most pressing issues, deferring others until later. The concessions have convinced many EU diplomats that the UK is seeking a deal.Maros Sefcovic, the EU Brexit commissioner, told reporters in Brussels that the agreement on medicines showed “the protocol has the flexibility to work on the ground. We must carry this momentum into the other areas of discussion.”Frost has suggested an independent arbitration system to manage disputes over the implementation of the protocol that would keep EU judges at one remove but still allow them oversight of matters of EU law. But Sefcovic on Friday dismissed the idea, saying the UK should stick to what it had signed upon leaving the bloc.“Without the ECJ you cannot have access to the single market,” he said. He also claimed the protocol was working “to the benefit of Northern Ireland”, citing increased investment and a growing amount of local produce on supermarket shelves.Talks will resume in early January, with Frost and Sefcovic due to meet again on January 14.
132  This was the week that central banks around the world changed gears and got serious about inflation.Gone was talk from the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank or Bank of England that rapidly rising prices were temporary, transitory or transient. Instead, they began to worry about high inflation being “persistent”.The ECB and Fed sharply scaled back their programmes of asset purchases. Central banks in two rich economies, the UK and Norway, raised interest rates. Nine emerging economy central banks, ranging from Chile to Russia, also pushed rates higher. Even the Bank of Japan, more often concerned with deflation, dialled back its coronavirus crisis monetary support.Rarely has there been such a clear shift across the global economy towards a more hawkish outlook on inflation. Ajay Rajadhyaksha, head of macro research at Barclays, said: “Central banks are clearly pivoting to a tightening regime far more quickly than appeared likely just a few months ago”.Francesco Pesole, foreign exchange strategist at ING, said the most important new message this week was “the centrality of inflation in the policy discussion”.As well as putting inflation at the centre of their thinking, officials in charge of monetary policy downgraded the importance they attached to coronavirus and its effects on economic activity. Statements from the Fed, ECB and BoE all highlighted the uncertainty surrounding the Omicron variant. But none thought it would be pivotal to policy in coming months.In the US, Fed chair Jay Powell said Omicron “doesn’t really have much to do with” its plan to accelerate the removal of pandemic-era monetary stimulus.Christine Lagarde, ECB president, stressed that “our economies have become more resilient, stronger and are more capable of adjusting wave after wave after wave, and variant after variant”. As for the UK, BoE governor Andrew Bailey said it was unclear if Omicron would add to or lessen inflation pressure “and that’s a very important factor for us”.There was no sign these responses were co-ordinated. Yet the consistency of their message has raised concerns among some economists that leading central banks may have forgotten how corrosive coronavirus waves can be.“The central bankers who have taken this hawkish, or less dovish in the ECB’s case, tilt were never imagining.in October and November that there would be this bolt from the blue with Omicron,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “I’m surprised that there is not a little bit more willingness to accept that things actually could be quite bad for a while.”The underlying reason driving the rise in inflation is global demand exceeding the world’s capacity to supply goods and services. Yet while leading central banks acknowledged the problem, how they chose to address it varied.The Fed’s rapid withdrawal of quantitative easing, and the signal it will raise interest rates three times next year to leave them at between 0.75 and 1 per cent, was well telegraphed. Yet the view among some economists was this was too little too late — given that US inflation, at almost 7 per cent, is already at an almost four-decade high.Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America, said: “There is slow-motion capitulation with the Fed.We will see [interest rate forecasts] inching up.”By contrast, the BoE surprised everyone with its rate increase. It felt it could not afford to wait because, with UK inflation already more than 5 per cent, the bank was receiving reports that companies were planning further wage and price rises.As Huw Pill, its chief economist, told CNBC on Friday, the BoE had to raise interest rates “in order to ensure the credibility of our [2 per cent inflation] objective”.The ECB was calmer because it felt there were fewer signs of rapid wage growth in Europe than in the US or UK, and it continued to expect eurozone inflation to fall below its target in the next two to three years.“It was striking to us how much more confident in the economics of the outlook and more balanced on Omicron, ECB president Lagarde appeared,” said Krishna Guha of Evercore ISI. “This largely reflects the fact that underlying inflation dynamics in the eurozone remain subdued.”The one global outlier to these central bank moves came from Turkey, which cut its interest rate to 14 per cent, despite inflation running at more than 21 per cent; boosted consumer demand, with a 50 per cent rise in the minimum wage — and then watched investors flee. As a cautionary tale for others, by midday Friday the Turkish lira had fallen 17 per cent against the dollar during the week.None of the hawkish moves by other central banks should yet be seen as a demonstration of their independence from government. Inflation has become a political problem in many countries, especially the US, and such central bank action is supported by politicians.Moreover, policy is still providing stimulus, interest rates remain very low, and there is scope to ease again if the economic effects of Omicron prove worse than expected.But now that the tightening cycle has begun, a bigger challenge facing central banks has drawn nearer. It will arrive if they have to go far further than they did this week, and take unpopular decisions to squeeze persistent inflation out of the economy. Their biggest test is yet to come.Additional reporting by Martin Arnold in Frankfurt
133  Economists are warning that Germany risks sliding into recession this winter after the country’s main indicator of business confidence slumped to its lowest point since February and the central bank slashed its growth forecasts.Germany’s vast manufacturing sector has been hamstrung for months by delays and shortages of materials caused by supply chain bottlenecks. But now its larger services sector is also being weighed down by new restrictions to contain a surge in coronavirus infections.The worsening outlook for Europe’s largest economy was underlined by the Bundesbank cutting its growth forecasts for this year and next year, while warning output was likely to fall at the end of this year.The monthly indicator of German business sentiment produced by Munich’s Ifo Institute fell more than most economists expected to 94.7 in December, down from 96.6 the previous month.“Companies assessed their current business situation as less positive,” said Clemens Fuest, president of Ifo. “Pessimism regarding the first half of 2022 also increased. The German economy isn’t getting any presents this year.” Fuest said sentiment declined in the services, retail and construction sectors — including a steep drop in confidence among tourism and hospitality companies. Confidence rose among German manufacturers, but more of them also warned of worsening supply logjams.Carsten Brzeski, head of macro research at ING, said: “The fourth wave of the pandemic could now actually push the economy to the brink of stagnation, or even into a technical recession.”However, some economists said a recent rebound in German industrial production, driven by a jump in car production in October, could save the economy from a fall in overall output during the final quarter.“It is unlikely that fourth-quarter growth will be negative given the momentum you have going into it,” said Sven Jari Stehn, chief European economist at Goldman Sachs.He added, however, that there were “downside risks” to Goldman’s forecast for German growth of 0.4 per cent in the first quarter of next year — particularly if a stricter national lockdown is introduced to counter the Omicron coronavirus variant, and it lasts longer than expected.The Bundesbank on Friday cut its German growth forecasts for this year from 3.7 to 2.5 per cent, and for next year from 5.2 to 4.2 per cent. It warned gross domestic product “could fall somewhat” in the final quarter of this year, but would rebound from next spring thanks to a “boom in private consumption”, as well as higher exports and business investment.Jens Weidmann, the Bundesbank’s outgoing president, said inflation risks were “skewed to the upside” and urged policymakers to be “vigilant”. The central bank raised its forecasts for German inflation, predicting it would increase from 3.2 per cent this year to 3.6 per cent next year, before moderating to 2.2 per cent in 2023.There was more evidence of supply snags pushing up inflationary pressures, after German producer prices rose 19.2 per cent from a year ago in November — their fastest rate since 1951 — driven mainly by soaring prices for energy, metal and wood products.The Bundesbank predicted that supply chain bottlenecks would not be resolved until the end of next year.Both Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank — Germany’s two largest private sector lenders — also warned of a likely recession this winter.Deutsche Bank forecast the German economy would contract 0.5 per cent in the current quarter and the following one “largely due to the brake on private consumption caused by tightened Covid regulation and voluntary social distancing”.Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank, also forecast German consumer spending would fall in the short term. But he said households had built up extra savings worth 10 per cent of their disposable income during the pandemic, and predicted that “this will strongly boost consumption” once restrictions are lifted, even if only part of it is spent.
134  Turkey’s main stock exchange halted trading on Friday after the country’s currency crisis, already stinging bonds, spread to equities.Borsa Istanbul announced a temporary so-called circuit breaker after its main Bist 100 index fell 5 per cent. After trading resumed, the benchmark was more than 8 per cent lower.The selling came as the Turkish lira fell a further 7 per cent to a fresh all-time low of more than 17 to the US dollar, and a day after the central bank once again lowered interest rates despite an annual inflation rate of more than 20 per cent.The lira has halved in value so far this year following a series of rate cuts, as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan — who rejects the economic orthodoxy that high interest rates rein in inflation — exerts increasingly close control over the central bank.“The central bank has totally lost control,” said Timothy Ash of BlueBay Asset Management.The stock exchange also said it had halted repo transactions in Turkish bonds as prices extended their recent decline. The yield on Turkey’s 10-year bond rose 0.3 percentage points on Friday to 21.5 per cent.Turkey’s stock market has so far been largely insulated from the chaos engulfing the currency, with investors betting that a weaker lira is good for the country’s exporters. Even after Friday’s losses the Bist 100 benchmark is still up by more than 40 per cent this year in local currency terms. In dollar terms, it has fallen by 35 per cent.However, the lira’s swift decline is likely to spark fears about the financial health of companies that have borrowed in foreign currency, or the possibility that Turkish depositors might begin to pull their cash out of the banking system, according to Ash.“The moves in the lira are just so extreme. People are getting worried that we are reaching levels where debtors will have problems,” he said.The central bank continued to intervene in markets in a bid to prop up the lira by selling foreign currency on Friday, with further signs that its monetary policy is unnerving Turkish businesses.“We are astonished to watch the central bank, which cut interest rates yesterday, giving its precious foreign exchange resources to the market today,” said Erdal Bahcivan, head of the Istanbul Chamber of Industry, in a post on Twitter.On Thursday, Erdogan announced a 50 per cent increase in the minimum wage in a bid to protect workers from rapidly rising prices, a move that economists warned would further fuel inflation.
135  The conservative MP Friedrich Merz is to become leader of Germany’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union after soundly winning a popularity poll of its members.The 66-year-old’s task will be to rebuild the morale of a party still reeling from defeat in September’s Bundestag election, when it chalked up the worst result in its 76-year history.Merz won 62.1 per cent of the vote, beating his rivals Norbert Röttgen, the former chair of the Bundestag’s foreign affairs committee, and Helge Braun, who served as ex-chancellor Angela Merkel’s chief of staff. He will be formally elected leader by 1,001 delegates at a digital party conference on January 21-22.It is third time lucky for Merz. His last two bids for the CDU leadership ended in narrow defeat — first to Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer in 2018 and then to Armin Laschet, the former prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, in January this year.Both were considered moderates committed to Merkel’s centrist, pragmatic course while Merz is a conservative who often complained that the CDU had drifted too far to the left under Merkel, his old rival.But Merz stressed on Friday that he would seek to represent the “full spectrum” of the CDU. He said he wanted it to be a party “where different political ideas, opinions and tendencies find their place”, adding: “I, at least, will do everything I can to achieve this.”Merz will succeed Laschet, who ran as the CDU’s candidate for chancellor in September’s election and lost to Olaf Scholz of the Social Democrats, leading the Christian Democrats into opposition for the first time in 16 years and only the third time in the party’s history.Friday’s poll result marks the first time CDU grassroots members have been involved in selecting a leader. As such, its outcome was almost a foregone conclusion: Merz has long enjoyed cult status among rank-and-file Christian Democrats.However, some in the party worry it is harming its chances of returning to power by electing a leader who is seen by large sections of the electorate as an anachronism, a man from a bygone age whose traditionalist views are out of step with those of modern Germany.In the leadership contest he faced two rivals, Röttgen and Braun, who are seen as moderates eager to bring more women into senior roles in the CDU and make it more appealing to younger voters, in part by focusing more on halting climate change.Merz described the view of him as a throwback to a bygone age as a “caricature”, one he would “gradually correct”.Merz rose to prominence in the 1990s, when his rhetorical brilliance and economic liberal credentials marked him out as a rising star in the CDU. He became leader of the Christian Democrats’ parliamentary group in 2000 but lost the job in a power struggle with Merkel and in 2009 quit the Bundestag to pursue a career in business.From 2016 until last year he was chair of BlackRock Germany, a job that made him a multi-millionaire.German media have speculated that Merz will claim the job of leader of the CDU’s parliamentary group, replacing the incumbent Ralph Brinkhaus. Asked on Friday about his intentions, he said the issue was “not on the agenda right now”.
136  EU markets regulators have ruled that banks and asset managers can continue to use UK derivatives clearing houses to handle their trades, saying the risks of shifting the business to the bloc outweighed its benefits.The European Securities and Markets Authority said on Friday that the UK’s two biggest clearing houses, LCH and ICE Clear Europe, were “of substantial systemic importance” to the EU’s financial stability and created risks that may not be fully covered by its existing rules.However, it concluded that the cost of prohibiting EU users from accessing them “would outweigh the benefits to the EU at this time”.It urged regulators to consider what it called “incentives” like tougher capital requirements or forcing banks and fund managers to send a portion of their business to the EU, to push more business out of London.The verdict from the Paris-based agency has been eagerly awaited by the global derivatives market after the EU tightened its rules for overseas clearing houses as Britain departed from the EU.Clearing houses are central to staving off market instability, sitting between parties on deals and preventing defaults from cascading through the financial system.The EU tasked Esma with assessing whether London clearing houses posed too great a risk and should shift activities within the EU to serve European customers. Brussels is concerned about the financial stability risks of seeing up to €80tn of open contracts being handled in a market that is no longer subject to its direct oversight.LCH is the dominant hub for clearing euro- and Polish zloty-denominated interest rate swaps while ICE Clear Europe handles credit default swaps and the bulk of the EU’s short-term interest rate.The market has been unwilling to move from London because users can concentrate their portfolios in one place, net their positions and save millions of dollars a day on the insurance required to back their deals. Its reticence to move has forced the European Commission to extend a temporary permit allowing European banks to access UK clearing houses beyond June 2022. A decision on the length of extension is expected in coming weeks.London Stock Exchange Group, which owns LCH, said it welcomed the assessment. “LCH Ltd remains committed to working with relevant regulatory authorities to offer clearing services to our customers, ensure the orderly functioning of markets and support financial stability.” ICE Clear Europe declined to comment.However, Esma said it had insufficient supervisory tools to manage a crisis in the bloc originating from UK clearing houses. It urged the politicians and the commission, the EU’s executive arm, to consider formal regulatory measures like tougher prudential capital standards.“We expect that liquidity would shift in a way that makes the EU clearers attractive, the cost lower,” said Froukelien Wendt, a member of Esma’s clearing house supervisory committee.It also urged closer co-operation with UK authorities on plans that cover a potential failure of a clearing house and said it wanted a broader memorandum of understanding with the Bank of England.Last month the BoE said its long-term plans to monitor overseas clearing houses that affect the UK’s financial stability would be based in part on the depth of relationship it enjoyed with another supervisor.
137  The last EU summit of the year ended at the stroke of midnight, with leaders sparring and ultimately failing to agree a common position on the bloc’s energy crisis. The meeting started on a sour note in the morning, when several leaders ganged up on Italy’s Mario Draghi for having put in place travel restrictions and Covid-19 testing requirements without any prior notice. It ended in relative failure after a statement on how to tackle soaring energy prices was scrapped from the text. Meanwhile in Frankfurt, the European Central Bank said it would start winding down its pandemic bond-buying in response to soaring inflation, but committed to continue asset purchases for at least 10 months and ruled out raising interest rates next year — a more cautious approach than what the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have announced.And in Luxembourg, an opinion by the EU top court’s advocate general has dealt another blow to Margrethe Vestager’s strategy of using competition law to clamp down on multinational corporations paying as little tax as possible — in this case, Fiat Chrysler’s sweetheart tax deal with Luxembourg.The case will only bolster the European Commission’s arguments for the need to translate into EU law the international agreement inked earlier this year on corporate taxation. Proposals on that and other so-called own resources are scheduled for next week. Below we’ll have more on that and other issues coming up in the next few days.This will be our last Europe Express edition of 2021. We will be back on January 5. Happy (and Omicron-free) holidays!This article is an on-site version of our Europe Express newsletter.  to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every weekday morningEuropean leaders opened their summit in a grim mood — the prospect of Omicron becoming dominant in the new year — and ended in disagreement on how to respond to the continent’s mounting energy crisis, write Mehreen Khan and Sam Fleming in Brussels. The summit ended in bizarre fashion with European Council president Charles Michel announcing that there would be no common language on rising energy prices and promising to return to the matter in the future. Rising CO2 prices, the functioning of the EU’s Emissions Trading Scheme and an upcoming commission proposal on green finance rules divided leaders all night — emerging as an unexpected flashpoint during a summit where the resurgent pandemic and the bloc’s efforts to prevent Russian aggression were on the agenda. Here’s the Financial Times’ take on the fight over the ETS. Poland and the Czech Republic stood firm in their demands that the summit communiqué should commit the EU to exploring the functioning of the ETS market — amid fears that carbon prices are being “manipulated” by traders (Brussels says there is no evidence this is the case). Warsaw and Prague also demanded a mention of forthcoming taxonomy rules, due next week, which will decide how investment in nuclear power and natural gas should be categorised. Anti-nuclear countries — Germany, Luxembourg and Austria — resisted on the taxonomy, forcing Michel to abandon attempts at common language just after midnight, diplomats told the FT. The scrap casts an ominous shadow on the EU’s continuing attempts to agree ambitious emissions reductions policies in the midst of record high energy prices this winter. Commission president Ursula von der Leyen tried to calm tensions over the ETS and the forthcoming taxonomy, but without success. On Covid, the clear message among leaders was that booster shots are the top priority, given early evidence that they provide around 75 per cent protection against symptomatic infection, better than two shots alone. (Belgium has just lowered to four months the period between the second and third shot, in a bid to accelerate its booster campaign.)But the risk, as with the previous outbreaks, is that the spectre of a surging caseload eats away at EU unity — especially when it comes to rules governing travel around the union. Concern that this is already happening because of the Omicron outbreak was on display at the summit. As Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, observed as he arrived, member states were now engaged in a battle against time, as they seek to win extra breathing space to enlarge their booster programmes before Omicron hits with full force. Greece has joined Italy in requiring negative tests from passengers arriving even from within the EU. The idea of requiring tests is not in itself seen as beyond the pale as an emergency brake — and is indeed envisaged in commission guidance on the topic released earlier this month. But the Italian measures irked other EU member states because of a lack of advance notice, diplomats said. Their concern, expressed by states including Belgium, Estonia and Spain, is that EU co-ordination breaks down. Do you agree with the latest European travel restrictions? Click here to take the poll. Even as leaders jet back to their capitals, Brussels will keep working into next week as officials seek to settle unfinished business. Here are the main items on their radar for the coming days: Brexit detente: The UK government today is expected to drop its demand to remove the European Court of Justice as the ultimate arbiter of trade rules in Northern Ireland as it seeks to de-escalate tensions with Brussels ahead of the winter holidays. Meanwhile, the commission is set to propose a law to ensure Northern Ireland continues to receive medicines from the UK (we wrote about it here). Taxonomy: The commission is finally due to present a second draft legal act next week and is almost certain to include both nuclear power and natural gas in the “sustainable” category. The move is likely to win majority backing from member states, but has come under fire from NGOs and some MEPs for opening the door to greenwashing. Own resources: The commission is due to unveil its proposals next week on how to raise the billions of euros that will be needed to repay the borrowings backing the EU recovery fund. This will entail three new “own resources” (revenue streams allocated to the commission). First, the EU’s Emissions Trading Scheme and secondly, its proposed carbon border levy. The third would involve the commission taking a slice of the proceeds from newly proposed rules agreed under the auspices of the OECD. These force multinationals to declare profits and pay more tax in the countries where they do business. Brussels is also due to put forward a directive implementing the other wing of the OECD tax deal setting a 15 per cent global minimum effective corporate tax rate. Gibraltar deal for Easter: After Spanish-UK talks this week, the deadline to conclude talks on Gibraltar has been extended to Easter. As a reminder, this would create a treaty out of the last minute outline deal on free movement of people and goods between Gibraltar and Spain. That provisional accord was struck on New Year’s Eve 2020, less than a day before the frontier was set to become the only hard land border created by Brexit. Business activity in the eurozone slowed after more Covid-related restrictions hit the services sector, while there were signs of an easing in the supply bottlenecks holding back manufacturers, according to the latest IHS purchasing managers’ index. (More here)An adviser to the EU’s top court has said Fiat Chrysler did not break any EU rules, in yet another setback for the bloc’s competition supremo Margrethe Vestager in the area of taxation, writes Javier Espinoza in Brussels.The bloc’s competition chief has for years tried to use state aid rules to try to bring member states in line and force companies to pay their fair share of taxes. But the limits of competition law when it comes to tax policy became evident when Vestager lost a massive case against Apple, in which the court quashed an order for the US tech giant to pay back €14.3bn in tax advantages to Ireland.Following a similar reasoning, the court’s advocate general Priit Pikamäe said yesterday that the commission was wrong to say Fiat Chrysler had broken state aid rules. This means the Italian carmaker does not need to pay €30m in back taxes to Luxembourg.The European Court of Justice is set to rule on the case in the coming months but the opinion is an indication of where the ruling might land as the ECJ follows the advice of most opinions.Even though the ruling may turn into yet another loss for the commission in this area, when it comes to antitrust law, Vestager’s reputation has been bolstered by a recent ECJ judgment confirming her €2.4bn fine and competition decision against Google.

138  In theory, Turkish businessman Vahit Yilmaz should be benefiting from the weak lira: orders from abroad are flooding into Turkey’s $30bn textile and clothing industry after the lira’s crash slashed the cost of production in dollar terms.But there was only a 50-50 chance that his wholesale clothing business would survive the next 12 months, he said. The cost of fabric, thread and other inputs, all priced in dollars, has shot up, and domestic producers such as Yilmaz in Merter, Istanbul’s ready-to-wear wholesale district, are bracing themselves for a turbulent spring season.“Turkish textiles are all but free at this exchange rate,” said the 35-year-old. “Business was super when the dollar rose steadily. Now it’s dangerous.”Recep Tayyip Erdogan has presided over a 50 per cent slide in the currency since the start of the year after he ordered the central bank to slash interest rates repeatedly despite rising inflation. On Thursday, the central bank cut rates for the fourth month in a row. The lira fell a further 7 per cent on Friday to TL16.8. It has tumbled by a fifth this month alone after a 29 per cent fall in November. The Turkish president has argued that a cheaper currency will help the country of 83m people to enjoy booming exports, investments and job creation.But the president’s critics say he is submitting the country to a giant economic experiment. Durmus Yilmaz, a former central bank governor, said this month that he was turning Turkey into “a laboratory for crackpot ideas”.In recent months, as Erdogan launched another easing cycle, he has reportedly cited China’s economic transformation in the wake of 1978 reforms as evidence that his model would bear fruit.But Ali Akkemik, an expert on the economies of both China and Turkey at Japan’s Yamaguchi University, said that while it was true that Beijing had devalued its currency in the 1980s and 1990s, it had implemented a clear “industrial vision” that was crucial in its transformation into the world’s second-largest economy over the course of several decades.“Turkey doesn’t have any clearly defined industrial policy,” he warned. “We don’t know what industry they’re trying to promote.”A London-based banker with expertise on both economies who asked not to be named put it more bluntly. “It is economically crazy to think that a country can build an export-oriented economy simply on the back of a trashed currency,” he said. “If that were the case, Zimbabwe would be a tech superpower.”Erdogan’s determination to push ahead with rate cuts despite growing dismay from voters and the business community has fuelled speculation in Turkey that certain constituencies must be benefiting from the slide in the lira.But, said Atilla Yesilada, an analyst at the consultancy GlobalSource Partners, “this is not a policy that benefits any identifiable constituency, including his family.or his cronies”.Turkey’s benchmark stock index tumbled 8.5 per cent on Friday, triggering temporary halt to trading and other curbs. Some businesses are gaining from the slide in the currency. “Most of the companies listed on the Borsa Istanbul are benefiting from the weak lira,” said Selim Kunter, an equities analyst at the Istanbul-based Ak Yatirim. He pointed to publicly listed airlines, defence groups, carmakers and chemicals producers as companies that enjoy foreign currency-denominated revenues and Turkish lira-denominated staffing costs.The success of those sectors has helped fuel a boom in exports, powering economic growth that is expected to exceed more than 9 per cent this year. But it is likely to come at the cost of inflation of 30 per cent or more in the months ahead, hurting not only businesses that rely on imported energy and raw materials but also ordinary Turks already struggling with the soaring cost of living.“Erdogan is prioritising exporters over households,” said Jason Tuvey of the consultancy Capital Economics. “If you think about his support base, it doesn’t really make sense at all.”Many big exporters have also been critical of the currency volatility, which they say makes it difficult to price their products and plan ahead. Tusiad, a group representing large industrial companies that account for 85 per cent of Turkey’s foreign trade, excluding energy, has warned that what the business world needs most is stability.Musiad, a business association with close links to the ruling party, recently added its voice to the disquiet in a rare critique of the president’s approach.“A businessman needs to know what the exchange rate will be in two to three months’ time and how much it will rise,” Mahmut Asmali, the group’s president, told the Turkish business newspaper Dunya last week. “The exchange rate chart should not look like the chart of someone with high blood pressure.”Despite booming house sales, the construction sector, which has close links to Erdogan and other ruling party officials, is also complaining. Figures from the industry, which represents about 5 per cent of the Turkish economy, have warned that the sector is being crushed by the high cost of raw materials and energy, both of which rose more than 90 per cent year on year in November.Erdogan simply “doesn’t have a game plan”, Yesilada said, pointing to the fact that Turkish authorities have spent several billion dollars defending the lira in recent weeks while simultaneously praising the virtues of a cheap currency. “We can discuss it for hours. None of it makes sense,” said Yesilada. “There isn’t any logic.”Yilmaz, the clothing producer, said the domestic sales that usually made up half of his business were already “dead”. He hoped that foreign sales will counterbalance the losses.But he predicted that half of his neighbours in Merter would be gone within six months, pushed out by rents that are set in dollars despite a ban on the practice.“Right now, I am optimistic we will weather this storm,” he said. “But I too could soon be gone.”
139  In mid-November, prosecutors filed bribery charges against three prominent businessmen. That followed the collapse of the government in October, when chancellor Sebastian Kurz was accused of being part of a scheme to abuse taxpayer funds to boost his popularity using bogus polls and newspaper adverts.And there are indications more is to come: prosecutors are still probing the labyrinthine connections between one of Europe’s biggest gambling firms, Austria’s Novomatic, and the country’s ruling political class.There is also a parallel investigation into the activities of Wirecard, the German fintech run by two Austrians that was found last year to have been a giant fraud.All of this is familiar territory. In 1985, Germany’s Der Spiegel dubbed Austria — which was then in the grip of a similar cluster of fraud and graft investigations — the “Skandalrepublik”. Great protests in Austria followed. But, today, it is hard not to jump to similar conclusions. In 1985, at least, the scandals did not claim the scalp of the chancellor.For most foreign investors in Austria, this will be little more than noise. But the recent scandals do reveal a truth about Austria that continues to strike many foreigners doing business there: it is still a country in which who you know, not what you know, carries great weight.In myriad ways, doing business and raising capital in Austria is not like it is in Germany, let alone in London or New York.Ferdinand Tönnies, one of the founding fathers of German sociology — alongside the much better known Max Weber — would have recognised the distinction. His great work of 1887, Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft — community and society — categorises two types of human society in the modern period: those bonded by personal relationships and group psychology, and those held together by institutions and laws. Or more neatly: those in which rules are implicit, and those in which rules are explicit.Tönnies did not necessarily privilege one above the other. In a Gesellschaft-oriented society — as exemplified by unbridled US-style capitalism — impersonal laws can lead to exploitation and suffering as compassion is eroded. In a Gemeinschaft-oriented society, corruption can spread as social groups and networks look after their own.These are broad — to some extent historically dubious — distinctions, but it is fair to say that, in Austria, the pull of Gemeinschaft is still strong. It is a notion that helps to explain not just the kind of clubbable corruption in the country that has dominated recent headlines, but also, on a broader scale, the development of Austrian capital markets in general.Capital in Austria is still dominated by banks and lending institutions. Few businesses raise money from open markets. It is personal relationships that matter. Over coffee, recently, with a very senior Austrian banker, I was told how deep this runs: many entrepreneurs or business owners in Austria are distrustful of what it means to take investment from abroad, or to raise money by selling equity or debt securities.There is a perception that such measures put businesses at the mercy of rapacious speculators whose interest is a quick buck. Austrian consumers, the banker said, are also reluctant to put their savings into equities.Instead, businesses are heavily reliant on specific relationships with Austrian lenders — and often with longstanding and very important personal relationships with specific individuals within them.“The thing is, we really need to develop capital markets here,” the banker said, “because so many businesses need investment. There is a shortage of capital in Austria. But how do I convince people that investing in equities or raising capital like that is not a turbo-capitalistic frenzy?”A younger Austrian generation of entrepreneurs may change things. The horizons of young tech, medical or engineering businesses in Austria’s thriving start-up scene are not limited by national borders.Young founders look to Berlin, London and Silicon Valley as much as they do to Vienna for business leads and development.If such businesses — sparked by Austria’s superb education sector and culture of innovation — can make their needs heard by the government, then there is the possibility of reform. The government has said it wants to make doing business in Austria easier.Founders look to Berlin, London and Silicon Valley as much as Vienna for leads and developmentBut changing the law and changing a culture are different things, as the corruption cases in the headlines currently indicate.Regardless of the fallout, doing business in Austria is not going to become like doing business in London any time soon, one liberal politician told me on a recent trip to Vienna.However, there are plenty of places to start. Transparency, the politician said, was key. More transparency would mean less corruption, and would also encourage more outside investment.“It would be the first best step to being a more open business community in Austria.”Sam Jones is the FT’s Austria correspondent
140  A group of EU leaders have demanded that Brussels intervene to help curb the record price of CO2, arguing that potential market manipulation is raising energy costs and exacerbating Europe’s winter gas crisis.European member states led by France and including Spain, Poland, Hungary, Latvia, and the Czech Republic objected to the European Commission’s assertion that there were no irregularities in the EU carbon market as they come under pressure to cushion consumers from the rising cost of energy.The complaints were raised at an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday, where leaders ultimately failed to bridge divisions and abandoned attempts to agree common language on the energy crisis.Charles Michel, president of the European Council who chaired the meeting, described the issue as “difficult” after Poland and the Czech Republic demanded references to the emissions trading scheme (ETS) and forthcoming EU rules on its green “taxonomy” in the summit conclusions. The requests were resisted by Germany’s new chancellor Olaf Scholz, along with Austria and Luxembourg.European gas prices hit their highest level since October earlier this week on the back of concerns about Russia’s new Nord Stream 2 pipeline to deliver natural gas to Europe.The gas supply crunch has provided an incentive to energy producers to switch to cheaper but more polluting coal — raising demand for carbon allowances under the EU’s cap-and-trade system. The carbon price as reflected in the ETS surged to more than €90 per tonne of CO2 last week.Heavy polluters are obliged to buy ETS allowances to cover their carbon emissions, in an effort to place a cost on the dirty fuel and curb greenhouse gas emissions.EU diplomats told the FT that a number of leaders demanded the commission carry out more rigorous scrutiny of the price dynamics in the ETS. Some suggested direct political intervention in the market for allowances which is effectively controlled by the commission.Leaders also clashed over Brussels’ much-anticipated rules on green finance, known as the taxonomy. The commission is due to publish a legal bill next week that will decide whether nuclear power and natural gas can be awarded a “green” label in the classification system, designed to help investors stamp out so-called “greenwashing”.A large majority of EU member states, including France, the Netherlands, Poland and Hungary, support the inclusion of nuclear power in the rules — arguing that it is a low-emission technology that is crucial to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This has been resisted by environmental groups who says nuclear power produces toxic waste.“It is no secret that there are different positions [on the taxonomy].and it was not possible to have an agreement” said Michel.The spats over energy and green policy will cast a shadow over the EU’s attempts to agree more than a dozen pieces of legislation designed to drastically cut CO2 emissions over the next three decades.At the heart of the EU’s net zero plan is a an extension of the ETS to cover sectors such as cars and housing. The proposal is opposed by France, Spain, Portugal and eastern European countries who say it will impose a direct tax on consumers who cannot afford to switch vehicles or domestic goods to those with lower emissions.The dramatic increase in the price of the carbon allowances from €50 in late July to a high of €90.75 last week has led to forecasts that it could rise to at least €200 in coming years as supply dwindles.Poland, which relies on coal power for about 70 per cent of its energy, has hit out at attempts to penalise coal use with rising CO2 prices. Prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki told leaders the ETS was taking “money from the poor to give to the rich”, said a diplomat familiar with the discussions.French president Emmanuel Macron and Czech prime minister Andrej Babis also challenged the commission’s assessment that there was little evidence of market speculation.An initial review of the carbon market from the European Securities and Markets Authority and the EU’s energy body ACER found no evidence of trading irregularities.The commission has also insisted the system, which is the centrepiece of the EU’s emissions reduction strategy, benefits all member states by providing them with lucrative revenues from the sale of allowances.Brussels estimates that the CO2 price has generated at least €11bn in windfall profits for EU governments this year compared with 2020. It also estimates that only 10-13 per cent of the current rises in energy costs can be attributed to the higher carbon price.During the summit, one leader suggested the commission should place a ceiling on the carbon price to prevent excess volatility, said diplomats familiar with the discussions. Other countries mentioned increasing the supply of allowances to help dampen prices.Germany’s Scholz defended the ETS but also expressed concern at the cost of allowances, said diplomats. Germany is among the biggest supporters of carbon markets, and has implemented a comprehensive system of CO2 trading.
141  EU leaders have agreed to co-ordinate with allies over potential sanctions against Moscow in the event of an invasion of Ukraine and charged the bloc’s officials with preparing punitive measures that could include cutting Russian banks off from the international Swift network.Under pressure from the US to back threats of crippling financial restrictions against Russia aimed at deterring Vladimir Putin from any military action, they agreed in a closed-door meeting in Brussels to draw up options for potential sanctions, officials said.The EU has sought to avoid public discussion of specific measures, arguing against putting precise options on the table before it knows what action — if any — Putin might take.But a growing number of member states have called for a stronger stand towards Moscow, which has deployed more than 100,000 troops in recent weeks on its south-western border with Ukraine.“We discussed the measures we should take, and which we can take in the event that we don’t succeed in ensuring that things stay peaceful,” German chancellor Olaf Scholz told reporters following the talks. “We are evaluating the different measures, checking what effect they would have, how efficient they would be. But that is just the preparation for an eventuality that should not happen.”EU leaders agreed that “any further military aggression against Ukraine will have massive consequences and severe cost in response, including restrictive measures co-ordinated with partner[s]”.They also agreed to continue encouraging “diplomatic efforts, especially in the Normandy format to achieve the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements”, referring to the group of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany that agreed as-yet unfulfilled peace terms over the war in eastern Ukraine.Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, said following the leaders’ discussions that co-ordination with allies including the US on potential sanctions had already begun and that the commission had a variety of options available.“We are able to read the signs and we are prepared,” she said. “It is a very clear message.”The list of possible sanctions to be prepared by Brussels officials will include cutting Russian banks off from the Swift network that facilitates global money transfers, an escalation of financial restrictions that would make it difficult for Russian corporates to do business with the rest of the world, people briefed on the discussions told the Financial Times.Other potential measures included targeted sanctions against private Russian banks, restrictions on certain technology exports to Russia — including those related to the telecommunications and chemicals industries — and individual injunctions against Russian oligarchs.But German officials said no concrete sanctions were discussed in Thursday’s meeting. They added that it was important to consider what damage any particular sanction might inflict on the EU itself.US intelligence shared with EU and Nato allies last month outlined a large-scale deployment of troops, tanks and electronic warfare equipment on the Ukraine-Russia border and warned an invasion could be undertaken within weeks. Nato has said that deployment has continued since.Nato’s North Atlantic Council on Thursday said it was “seriously assessing the implications for Alliance security of the current situation” and it would co-ordinate with the EU and other partners regarding its response.“We will always respond in a determined way to any deterioration of our security environment, including through strengthening our collective defence posture as necessary,” the NAC, the military alliance’s political decision-making body, said in a statement. “Nato will take all necessary measures to ensure the security and defence of all Nato allies.”A number of EU leaders used the discussion on the crisis — conducted without phones or aides in the interests of discretion — to stress that Europe needed to play a role in defusing the crisis and not allow Russia and the US to dictate decisions that had an impact on the continent’s defence and security, officials told the FT.US president Joe Biden, who held a telephone summit with Putin last week, has said he is open to further talks over Russian opposition to Ukraine’s ambitions for Nato membership and allegations that the alliance’s expansion into eastern Europe threatens Moscow.
142  The UK government is on Friday expected to drop its demand to remove the European Court of Justice as the ultimate arbiter of trade rules in Northern Ireland as it seeks to de-escalate tensions with Brussels.Brexit minister Lord David Frost will tell his EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic that governance issues can wait until they have agreed on practical ways to improve the flow of goods between the region and the rest of the UK, according to officials.The expected climbdown by London confirms a UK briefing given to European journalists last week that was later vehemently denied by Downing Street.The EU has refused to discuss the ECJ’s role as the referee of single market rules despite weeks of UK pressure, including a threat to trigger the Article 16 process, which temporarily suspends parts of post-Brexit trade arrangements in Northern Ireland.The Northern Ireland protocol kept the region in the single market to avoid a trade border on the island of Ireland when Britain left the EU. Instead, there are checks on east-west trade across the Irish Sea.EU members have made clear that using Article 16 would be met with a tough response, including the possible suspension of the entire post-Brexit trade agreement.The US has also put pressure on the UK to drop its threat, which it fears could undermine the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement in Northern Ireland. Washington has refused to lift tariffs on UK steel and aluminium until London shifts its position.With London’s retreat, UK-EU talks will now focus on reducing customs procedures and food safety checks that have created big problems for companies and consumers in Northern Ireland and then return to governance issues.“Since the EU won’t address all the issues we put on the table now, we are willing to look at interim solutions which deal with the most acute problems,” said a UK official. “But any such interim agreement must put a stop to the ECJ settling disputes between us and the EU, now and in the future.”The UK has now indicated that it could accept an arbitration mechanism of the kind that governs other elements of the EU-UK withdrawal agreement, which leave the ECJ as the arbiter of EU law but puts the court at one remove from resolving disputes over the protocol.Meanwhile the European Commission will on Friday propose a law to ensure Northern Ireland continues to receive medicines from the UK.Pharmaceutical companies have said it would be unviable to comply with a bespoke regulatory regime for the region. To prevent them stopping supply, Brussels will recognise drugs authorised by the UK regulator supplied from Great Britain, as long as they are labelled for UK use only.The changes will also allow new cancer and other drugs to be used as soon as they are licensed by the UK.However, the two sides remain far apart on core trade issues, although the UK has watered down its demand for completely frictionless trade between mainland Britain and Northern Ireland. At least 200 UK companies have stopped sending goods to Northern Ireland since the UK left the EU, according to British officials.Brussels has offered to reduce checks on goods that are heading for Northern Ireland and unlikely to move onward into Ireland and the wider single market, such as supermarket deliveries. It says one form for each lorry would cut customs checks in half. Food and animal health checks would come down by 80 per cent.“Their proposals do not remove a single product from having to go through customs processes as they would if it were an international border — all they do is reduce the number of boxes on the form, leaving the most onerous ones untouched. Only having to complete 20 boxes on a form instead of 40 doesn’t really feel like a big reduction in checks,” said one UK official.London wants to conclude talks early next year before campaigning begins for elections in Northern Ireland in May. The Democratic Unionist party, the largest in the devolved assembly, continues to oppose the protocol, while Sinn Féin, the nationalist party tipped to overtake it in May, supports it.
143  France will block entry to UK tourists, tightening its border restrictions in an effort to slow the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant.The decision came as EU leaders expressed heightened alarm over the renewed surge in Covid-19 cases and tried to maintain a common approach to travel within the bloc.Travel from the UK to France will be largely limited to French nationals, residents and their families, although exceptions have been made for students and some professions, such as doctors, which have a work-related reason to enter the country.The prime minister’s office said the curbs would apply from midnight on Friday.The emergence of Omicron, which was identified by South African scientists in November, has led many countries to impose travel restrictions. Omicron has dozens of mutations that scientists expect make it more transmissible than earlier variants and more likely to evade the immune protection provided by vaccines or previous infection.In a summit on Thursday in Brussels EU leaders differed over how to handle rules within the union after Italy and Greece said travellers would have to show proof of a negative PCR test — even if they are travelling from within the EU.The move has sparked frustration in some other parts of the EU, where capitals worry that it could damage efforts to maintain a common system to Covid-era travel inside the union. Leaders from countries including Belgium and Estonia warned against unilateral measures in response to the Omicron upsurge, diplomats said.Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, said she believed passengers flying into the EU should present a negative PCR test before they board, and that a test may be merited on arrival as well. The commission will soon present proposals for the validity of the union’s vaccine certificate to be set at nine months following the initial shots.France has clamped down ahead of the Christmas travel season. “The challenge is to slow the spread of Omicron to allow as much time as possible to do booster shots,” said government spokesman Gabriel Attal on BFM TV.Covid-19 tests must be taken less than 24 hours before departure, rather than 48 as at present, and those who arrive from the UK must self-isolate for seven days, reduced to two days if they test negative in France. An online registration system will be used to track those arriving and to submit test results.In the UK, Omicron has been spreading rapidly and could be infecting 200,000 people a day, according to an estimate from the UK Health Security Agency, dwarfing the number of confirmed cases identified by sequencing. The HSA said a record 88,376 new Covid-19 cases were reported on Thursday.France, which does much less genetic sequencing of variants than Britain, has only identified roughly 240 cases of Omicron, although health experts expect the number is probably higher. More than 95 per cent of infections in the country are still with the Delta variant, according to public health officials, but that is expected to change in coming weeks.Even without the impact of Omicron, France has been experiencing a surge of infections in the past six weeks to reach about 45,000 per day, on a seven-day rolling average. Hospitals and health workers are stretched, with more than 1,000 Covid patients being admitted daily and predictions for use of intensive care beds to be close to capacity by the end of the month unless more are added.The government has responded by accelerating the booster programme, closing nightclubs and tightening protocols in schools. But it has stopped short of imposing curfews or lockdowns. In a television interview on Wednesday night, President Emmanuel Macron forecast that there would be “very strong pressure on our hospitals” between Christmas and the new year.
144  It’s a glaucous December dawn in Zurich. A light sleet makes the icy Limmat River look like dull, beaten lead.Inside, three advent candles are flickering on the altar and weak light is beginning to filter through the Chagall stained glass windows at the end of the choir. Every Wednesday for the past month, the Fraumünster church, former seat of the abbess-rulers of the city, has held a short lauds service of Bach organ music.It is 7.30am. I’ve had barely a nod of sleep. But I have contrived to make this December morning as festive as I can. And so here I am.The crowd is large and mixed. The Swiss rise painfully early. Some young friends meeting before work. Coiffed retirees from Lake Zurich’s Goldküste. The slicked hair and zippered gilets of Paradeplatz — private bankers with consciences to assuage.Also currently in the scales of the gods: the results of my PCR test, for which I’ll need good news to fly back to London and see my family for the first normal(ish) Christmas in two years.Switzerland is currently in the grip of a coronavirus wave more severe, and less cared about, than almost any other in the pandemic. It isn’t even because of Omicron. One-third of Swiss have yet to take even a single dose of vaccine. Just over one-tenth have had a booster. No country in western Europe is more poorly positioned.Outside the old abbey church, in the Münsterhof, vans are delivering the day’s supplies of glühwein, wheels of raclette and items of expensive wooden tat to the stalls of the Christmas market.Authorities deem it necessary for outdoor market-attendees to have their Covid certificates checked, even though the crowds in the breezy outdoors are far less dense than those in the crush of the perfume and cosmetics hall in the ritzy department store Jelmoli, just down the road, where the only preconditions to entry are a lack of financial sense and taste.Switzerland’s Covid policy is at sixes and sevens. I’ve swerved between support for its approach — quality of life, not just the longevity of it, is something the government genuinely factors into its thinking — to despair at its lack of mettle where it matters, specifically on vaccinations.Bern says it is doing everything it can to avoid another lockdown. But, as elsewhere in Europe, no one really has much faith the government knows any better than they do.Up in Zermatt earlier this month, skiing with a friend, I paid a visit to the Walliserkanne: a pub in the village that has become a national symbol of resistance to government impositions. The owners repeatedly refused to check customers’ vaccine or test status. Eventually authorities were forced to stack huge concrete blocks in front of the doors to the venue. It’s open again now. A slightly tatty A4 sheet in the window, reads: “Thank you for all your support!” The season in Zermatt, Europe’s highest ski resort, is off to a sluggish start. A snap decision by the Swiss government to put the UK on a quarantine list for a week has hit visitor numbers already.For this reason alone, I suspect, we manage to nab a spot at the bar of Elsie’s, a local wine bar, usually packed, which a newspaper clipping on the wall declares as the haunt of silk-stockinged bankers and aristocrats. And now me.In Zermatt, unlike Zurich, the concerns over what another bout of tough restrictions might do are more palpable. Christina, the manager of Elsie’s, recounts how last year she was distraught as she threw crates of fresh food — lobsters, oysters — into the bin, after a snap lockdown ended the season.The outlook for Switzerland in the first weeks of 2022 is not a good one, based on how things are already developing with the Omicron variant in the UK, where Covid antibody seroprevalence is significantly higher than here in the Alps.But a part of me hopes that the Swiss will tough it out. It’s been very easy these past two years, after all, to deride things like music performances, drinking, socialising or skiing as frivolous extras to life. But take out all those extras and what ends up being left?Walking home with Bach’s Christmas prelude ringing in my ears, I take a glass of glühwein for the stroll.
145  President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced a 50 per cent rise in the country’s minimum wage in an effort to protect the Turkish people from soaring inflation just hours after the country’s central bank cut interest rates for the fourth consecutive month.Erdogan, whose ruling party has suffered an erosion of support in the polls amid a sharp slide in the lira and rising living costs, hailed the increase as a “historic” pay boost for the country’s workers, about 40 per cent of whom earn the minimum wage.“I believe that this increase demonstrates our determination not to let our workers be crushed by price rises,” Turkey’s president said in a televised statement as he announced that the take-home monthly pay would rise from TL2,826 in 2021 to TL4,250 ($274) next year.The increase, which marks an almost 50 per cent rise in lira terms, represents a 27 per cent decrease in dollar terms compared with the start of this year due to the plunge in the Turkish currency.The announcement came shortly after the central bank lowered the cost of borrowing to 14 per cent despite inflation that is running at 21 per cent year, according to official statistics.The country’s deeply negative real interest rates have put huge pressure on the Turkish lira, which is down more than 50 per cent against the dollar since the start of the year.The lira hit a record low following Thursday’s decision, plunging as much as 5.2 per cent to 15.595 against the US dollar, according to Refinitiv data.The slide in the currency has caused spiralling inflation in a country that is heavily reliant on imported energy and raw materials.Analysts warned that the big rise in pay for millions of workers, though necessary to help shelter them from the rising cost of food and other basic goods, would also itself be inflationary.“There is feedback between inflation and the minimum wage,” said Selva Demiralp, a professor of economics at Istanbul’s Koc University. “As the inflation rate increases, you have to increase the minimum wage. And as the minimum wage increases, that creates more inflation.”Erdogan, who rejects the established economic orthodoxy that high interest rates curb inflation, has argued that slashing the cost of borrowing will lead to a surge in exports, investment and employment that will ultimately stabilise the currency and bring down inflation.But economists have described Erdogan’s determination to fly in the face of warnings about high inflation as a risky and unprecedented economic “experiment”.They say the president’s plans are likely to result in runaway price rises, further eroding the living standards of a population that is already suffering from rising poverty.“If it were not for the pain and suffering inflicted on 84m people, this would be a fascinating economics experiment,” said Refet Gurkaynak, a professor of economics at Ankara’s Bilkent University.“It shows that economists actually have a very good understanding of the fundamentals of monetary policy. We knew this would be the result — and it is.”Charlie Robertson, chief economist at the investment bank Renaissance Capital, said Erdogan’s approach had no precedent. “I can’t think of another leader who has pushed this weird policy mix before,” he said.The central bank suggested that Thursday’s cut was the last, saying in a statement accompanying the decision that it had decided to “complete the use of the limited room” that it had to lower borrowing costs.Piotr Matys, an analyst at InTouch Capital, said the market was unlikely to give much weight to that assertion. “The CBRT doesn’t have sufficient credibility for the market to trust that the easing cycle will be paused,” he said.Thursday’s rate cut and minimum wage announcement, combined with a report by Bloomberg of a fresh capital injection for the country’s state banks, fuelled growing speculation that Erdogan could seek to bring forward presidential and parliamentary elections that are scheduled for mid-2023.Tim Ash, an analyst at BlueBay Asset Management, said the president appeared to be preparing to go to the polls in what he called a “boom or bust” strategy.
146  The European Central Bank said it would scale back its crisis bond-buying in response to soaring inflation, but committed to continue asset purchases for at least 10 months and ruled out raising interest rates next year.The decision, which contrasts with a more aggressive withdrawal of crisis support by the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England this week, led to a fall in eurozone bond markets on Thursday as investors absorbed the ECB’s plan to sharply reduce its bond purchases in 2022.Christine Lagarde, ECB president, said the eurozone economy had recovered enough to allow a “step-by-step reduction in the pace of asset purchases”. But she added: “Monetary accommodation is still needed for inflation to stabilise at our 2 per cent inflation target over the medium term.”The central bank said its €1.85tn Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), launched in 2021, would reduce net purchases next year and halt them altogether in March. But it cushioned the impact by announcing it would expand its older asset purchase programme (APP) from its monthly pace of €20bn, rising to €40bn in the second quarter and to €30bn in the third.The APP purchases would then continue at €20bn per month after October “for as long as necessary”, it said. The moves mean it will continue bond purchases at a rate well below the near-€90bn a month it operated for much of 2021. Amid so much uncertainty generated by the Omicron coronavirus variant, Lagarde said the ECB wanted to avoid a “brutal transition” to lower levels of purchases.There was opposition to the plan expressed by a few ECB governing council members, including Germany’s Jens Weidmann, who is stepping down as head of the Bundesbank at the end of the year. One of their criticisms was that the ECB was committing to maintain its stimulus for too long given the upside risks to inflation.Although the ECB sharply raised its forecast for inflation over the next few years, Lagarde said it was “really making progress” towards hitting its 2 per cent target over the medium term, even if it was “not quite” there yet.The ECB predicted inflation would increase from 2.6 per cent this year to 3.2 per cent next year. But it said price growth would then fall below its target to hit 1.8 per cent in 2023 and stay at that level in 2024.Carsten Brzeski, head of macro research at ING, called the ECB decision “a very cautious taper” that was in line with it stopping asset purchases next year and raising interest rates early in 2023.The price of eurozone government bonds, already on the back foot following the BoE’s decision to raise its policy rate earlier on Thursday, fell further following the ECB announcement.Germany’s 10-year yield climbed 0.03 percentage points to minus 0.34 per cent. Italian 10-year borrowing costs rose 0.06 percentage points higher at 0.97 per cent. Bond yields rise when their price falls.The move to halt the expansion of the ECB’s emergency bond purchase scheme was widely expected by analysts, despite a surge in coronavirus infections, as it reflects the recent rise in eurozone inflation to its highest-ever level of 4.9 per cent in November.Even so, markets had expected slightly more bond buying in 2022 than the total implied by the ECB’s revised plans, according to Richard McGuire, Rabobank strategist.The sell-off in Italian bonds showed “how sensitised the market is to even modest adjustments in terms of expected ECB support”, he said.Frederik Ducrozet, strategist at Pictet Wealth Management, calculated the ECB was on track to buy about €480bn of bonds next year, covering about 80 per cent of net debt issuance by eurozone governments, vs more than 120 per cent in the past two years.“They are really buying more time to see if there will be second-round effects from higher inflation on wage negotiations. It is really all about that,” Ducrozet said.The euro rose 0.6 per cent against the dollar to $1.136, its highest point in more than two weeks.In a busy day for the central banks of developed economies, the Bank of England unexpectedly lifted borrowing costs by 15 basis points to 0.25 per cent, while Norway’s central bank raised interest rates in a widely expected move by 25bp to 0.5 per cent. The Swiss central bank, meanwhile, kept its main interest rate unchanged at minus 0.75 per cent.The ECB, which kept its deposit rate unchanged at minus 0.5 per cent, also extended plans to reinvest the proceeds of maturing bonds in the PEPP until at least the end of 2024.It said these reinvestments would be “adjusted flexibly across time, asset classes and jurisdictions at any time” to allow it to skew them towards Greek bonds, which it is otherwise prevented from buying because of their low credit rating.
147  Business activity in the eurozone slowed after restrictions to tackle surging coronavirus infections hit the services sector, while there were signs of an easing in the supply bottlenecks holding back manufacturers, according to a closely watched survey.The IHS Markit flash eurozone composite purchasing managers’ index, a monthly poll that takes the pulse of business activity, fell slightly more in December than most economists expected to a nine-month low of 53.4, down from 55.4 the previous month.A number of countries have announced new coronavirus containment measures recently, including Germany, Italy, Austria and the Netherlands. The restrictions are already reducing the flow of customers in the services sector, particularly at restaurants and shops.While the PMI score for the region’s services sector remained above 50, indicating a majority of businesses still reporting higher activity levels than a month ago, the slowdown was sharper than for manufacturing.Euro area manufacturers reported an improvement in the global supply chain problems that have caused order backlogs in factories, congestion at ports and shortages of materials, helping them to report the biggest rise in production since September.“This chimes with our assessment that supply bottlenecks may have peaked, with the important caveat that the Omicron variant brings some downside risks in this area,” said Ricardo Amaro, senior economist at Oxford Economics.Input costs and selling prices rose less steeply than in the previous month, but IHS Markit said they still increased at the second-fastest rates in the history of its survey. Higher shipping costs, energy prices and staff costs again added to inflationary pressures, it said.“The eurozone economy is being dealt yet another blow from Covid-19, with rising infection levels dampening growth in the service sector in particular,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.But he added there was “encouragement” from the easing of supply strains in the manufacturing sector, for which the survey’s measure of output rose to a three-month high.German businesses reported a stalling of activity and their first drop in new orders for goods and services since June 2020, as the country’s PMI score dropped to an 18-month low of 50.The slowdown was mainly caused by the German services sector, for which the PMI score fell below 50 for the first time in eight months, indicating a fall in activity from a month ago, which outweighed a recent rebound in production at the country’s manufacturers.Deutsche Bank economists forecast this week that Germany would enter a technical recession this winter as coronavirus restrictions, high inflation and supply bottlenecks hit Europe’s largest economy over the next two quarters.The picture is brighter in France, where businesses reported only a slight slowdown in growth. IHS Markit said “a relatively resilient service sector helped to offset a decline in manufacturing output for the second time in the past three months”.Most economists still expect the overall eurozone economy to continue growing in the fourth quarter, albeit at a markedly slower pace, while the rapid spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant has raised doubts about the outlook for the first quarter of next year.“Strong recoveries are being dampened by the latest wave of the virus, but the medium-term economic outlook remains relatively benign,” said Carsten Brzeski, head of macro research at ING. He added that indications of easing price pressures were “a first cautious sign that much of the current high inflation is likely to be temporary”.
148  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.It’s EU summit day and one of the important issues on the leaders’ agenda is fear that Russia could invade Ukraine. Leaders are not expected to discuss specific measures they might take in case of renewed aggression, but we look at some of the options under consideration.While this will be the first EU summit for the new German chancellor, his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte has been a member of the European Council since 2010. Now, he is starting his fourth term in office, and we will profile Rutte’s latest political incarnation — as leader of the most progressive coalition government yet.Meanwhile, in Frankfurt, the European Central Bank holds its governing council meeting. Top of many minds is the topic of accelerating inflation, and we will look at where the ECB thinks it will go next.EU leaders are back in Brussels today for a last get together before winter break, write Sam Fleming, Henry Foy and Valentina Pop. The organisers have insisted on keeping the European Council to one day, starting at 10am, given that several leaders were already in town for the Eastern Partnership summit yesterday.Given the breadth and depth of topics to be discussed, officials expect the meeting to run late into the night. One of the most highly charged will be the discussion on Russia and the troops it has massed on the border with Ukraine. Diplomats expect leaders to put aside their mobile phones to have a candid conversation over lunch about how to respond to Vladimir Putin’s provocations.The European Commission has been in discussion with member states and allies including the US as it considers how to deter Russia from escalating the situation. Brussels has prepared an options paper containing a broad range of potential sanctions that could be deployed.However, diplomats do not expect detailed discussions today on specific measures given the prevailing uncertainty over exactly what Putin will do next. Capitals are also divided over how much economic pain they are willing to bear in order to punish Putin’s behaviour.Potential sanctions that have been explored by Brussels range from the most extreme, such as disconnecting Russian banks from the Swift global network, to targeted sanctions against private-sector Russian banks, according to people familiar with the subject.Other options include restrictions on exports of certain technologies to Russia as well as more familiar steps such as the imposition of individual sanctions against more oligarchs. (The options are along the lines of what Washington has also been considering.) The commission declined to comment.Kyiv worries that the Europeans are missing the point of a deterrent. President Volodymyr Zelensky, who met EU leaders yesterday, said the bloc needed to make abundantly clear to Putin what the consequences of an attack would be, rather than just punish him for it afterwards.“For us, it is important for them to be applied before, rather than after a conflict.which would basically make them meaningless,” he told reporters yesterday evening. “We have had a war for eight years. We understand that only if the sanctions are applied prior to an armed conflict they can be a prevention mechanism.”Ukraine is just one of a host of topics that leaders will chew over in Brussels. Here are some of the other ones:Mark Rutte arrives at this morning’s EU leaders’ summit boasting a new domestic coalition that will equip the Dutch leader with something he has rarely enjoyed: an avowedly pro-EU, progressive majority, writes Mehreen Khan in Brussels.Known as “Rutte IV”, the government is made up of the same four parties that comprised the last coalition. But the latest incarnation marks a decisive break with years of penny-pinching, an obsession with a small state, and even opens the door towards greater EU federalism.Here’s the FT’s take on the 50-page coalition agreement that commits the Netherlands to tens of billions in spending on climate, housing and defence policy, expanding the country’s borrowing and budget deficit.It is a radical departure from previous iterations of frugal Rutte-led governments and cements the 54-year-old’s reputation as a political shape-shifter extraordinaire.The former Unilever executive entered office in 2010 as a hyper-individualist, pro-market climate change sceptic. Rutte IV is likely to be defined by mass social spending on childcare and housing, a higher minimum wage and radical emissions-cutting ambitions. The motto for the new coalition is “take care of each other and look to the future”. The agreement bears clear hallmarks of the pro-EU liberal democrat D66, which made big gains in the March elections and is the second-biggest party behind Rutte’s VVD. The spending plans will mean the Netherlands is on course to overshoot the EU’s 60 per cent debt to gross domestic product ceiling for the first time since the aftermath of the eurozone crisis.After spending the post-Brexit years as the EU’s frugal chieftains, the government has made some surprising interventions on EU matters. They support giving the European parliament stronger powers to sack individual commissioners. It was only a few years ago that Rutte dismissed the parliament as a talking shop.The shift will please Brussels and southern EU capitals that have gone head to head with the Netherlands over eurozone reform, the EU budget and recovery fund spending.But a big test of the government’s pro-EU credentials will be in its personnel changes.There are 20 ministerial positions up for grabs, with the finance ministry being fought over by the conservative Christian Democrats and D66. Should it change hands from hawkish incumbent Wopke Hoekstra to progressive former diplomat Sigrid Kaag, the sea change in Dutch politics may well live up to its billing.When Christine Lagarde presents the outcome of the European Central Bank’s meeting today, one number will be of particular interest to investors and economists: its first inflation forecast for 2024, writes Martin Arnold in Frankfurt.Economists expect the ECB to forecast 2024 inflation of 1.8 per cent.Cynics may say that number is too convenient. If it was much higher, the “hawks” would argue it was on track to achieve its 2 per cent target and the central bank should stop buying bonds and raise interest rates soon. If it was much lower, the “doves” would argue it needs to buy even more bonds to push inflation up to its target, which would be difficult to explain after eurozone inflation rose to 4.9 per cent in November — a record since the euro’s launch 23 years ago.But most economists agree with Lagarde’s prediction that inflation will follow a “hump” shaped trajectory — falling back below the ECB target in the next few years — justifying it maintaining bond purchases and negative interest rates for at least another year or two.“Policymakers should continue to be relaxed about inflation and not take the eye off the recovery ball,” said Christian Odendahl, chief economist at the Centre for European Reform. “The real risks from high energy prices are weakness in consumption and a potentially weaker economy in 2022 and 2023, not inflation.” Nevertheless, rising prices are causing political concern — notably from Germany’s new chancellor Olaf Scholz, who said recently his government would “have to do something” if inflation in the country does not drop from its recent 30-year high of 6 per cent.Consumers are expecting higher prices, according to a recent Bundesbank survey of German households, which found the proportion expecting inflation to “increase significantly” over the next 12 months had more than doubled in the past year to 40 per cent.Other central banks — including the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England — are preparing to withdraw their stimulus policies. But Lagarde says Europe is different because its economic recovery is still fragile and wages have shown few signs of shooting upwards.Lagarde can expect EU leaders, who know voters are feeling the pinch from rising prices, to ask more questions about inflation over dinner when she joins them at the summit tonight.
149  Workers from two of Italy’s largest trade unions will strike on Thursday to protest against government economic and fiscal policy just days ahead of parliament’s approval of a crucial budget law.The general strike marks the first big face-off with Prime Minister Mario Draghi since the former European Central Bank chief took the helm in February. It highlights the political challenges his government faces in passing crucial structural reforms, including on tax and pensions, to ensure that Italy gets tens of billions of euros from the EU to aid its post-pandemic recovery.The CGIL and UIL labour unions, which have a combined membership of more than 7.5m people, said the announced budget was “unsatisfactory”. Their main objection is to an envisaged €8bn of tax cuts, which unions say favour higher earners. Retirement rules and labour contracts are other causes of disagreement.Pierpaolo Bombardieri, the UIL secretary-general, said the government had prioritised political compromise over social demands. “When there’s a [complicated] political mediation, there’s no room for one with the [unions],” he told the Financial Times.Under the measures announced by the government, workers earning between €15,000 and €55,000 a year will get a reduction in their tax rate. Tax breaks are proposed for lower earners.Unions say the biggest benefits will still go to those in higher tax brackets and that the government has not devoted enough attention to those who were affected the most by the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic.CISL, Italy’s other main trade union, has said it will not take part in the strike, saying it risks “radicalising positions at a delicate time for the country”.The strike shows the balancing act for Draghi, who as the leader of a national unity government is trying to pass reforms while rebooting the country’s economy and working to avoid a fourth wave of Covid infections.Bombardieri said tax cuts should have focused on reducing labour costs that were among the highest in Europe, rather than reducing tax rates on personal income. “In the face of rising inflation, tackling the cost of labour would have increased real wages,” he said.A meeting between union chiefs and the government to discuss the pension reform, another sticking point of the discussion, has been scheduled for Monday.The prime minister’s office said the unions’ choice to stage the strike was “unjustified” while Matteo Salvini, leader of the League, called union leaders “irresponsible”. A spokesperson for the Democratic party said the party hoped to continue a constructive dialogue with CIGL and UIL after the strike.Bombardieri said it was “fair to raise questions on situations of social distress”.“The narrative that everything is going perfectly well and the exclusive focus on the country’s GDP growth figure is misleading,” he said.* This story has been amended since original publication to correct the range of earnings covered by tax cuts
150  Until a shortage of semiconductors throttled the supply of everything from cars to games consoles this year, few in Europe gave much thought to the GlobalFoundries factory in Dresden, the EU’s largest chip plant.“I did not have any [media] interviews in the first 18 years of my career — nothing,” said Guido Uberreiter, an engineer who oversees operations at the site in the heart of former communist east Germany. “Nobody was interested.”Now the GlobalFoundries plant — which makes chips for devices from the Apple Watch to Samsung smartphones and the Amazon Echo — and others in the state of Saxony are firmly in the spotlight, as Brussels looks to strengthen Europe’s semiconductor supply chains and reduce its reliance on dominant Asian producers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.Governments across the world — particularly in the US, South Korea and Japan — have pledged tens of billions of dollars in support for the building or expansion of semiconductor factories in an effort to reshore production of the crucial components. Companies and regions in need of investment have been clamouring to become the beneficiaries.Germany hopes “Silicon Saxony” — which accounts for one in every three chips made in Europe — will be at the heart of EU efforts.“Saxony will become one of Europe’s main and most advanced industrial and technological semiconductor centres,” said Thierry Breton, the EU’s commissioner for the internal market, on a visit last month.Breton is behind the EU’s proposed Chips Act, which aims to double Europe’s global market share for semiconductors to 20 per cent by the end of the decade. Germany’s new Social Democrat-led government has also pledged to offer the sector “sufficient financial support along the entire value chain in order to secure, strengthen and expand this key technology”.But industry figures in Saxony see plenty of remaining questions about the EU’s commitment to the region, whose semiconductor cluster rose up in the 1990s, when the area was awash with unemployed microelectronics experts trained by the former German Democratic Republic.The region has been burnt by politicians’ fading interest before. While Taiwan was shoring up the semiconductor sector with nine-figure subsidies at the turn of the century, European support for the capital intensive industry remained modest.As recently as 2009, Dresden-based memory chipmaker Qimonda — one of the world’s largest — filed for bankruptcy after struggling to compete with Asian rivals despite appeals to the European Commission for support.“Qimonda wasn’t saved, [carmaker] Opel was saved,” said Frank Bösenberg, managing director of Silicon Saxony’s representative body, which lobbies on behalf of 370 institutions. “Whose belts are standing still right now due to the lack of semiconductors?” he said, referring to Opel’s production lines.Furthermore, the EU’s stated ambition is to invest particularly in the most cutting-edge chips which, according to the Chips Act proposal, are “10 times more energy efficient than today”. Member states such as Italy, and individual German states have been wooing America’s Intel, which plans to spend tens of billions of euros on “fabs” — chip plants — in Europe, to manufacture advanced, two nanometre semiconductors.Neither US-listed GlobalFoundries, nor Bosch and Infineon, German companies with plants near Dresden, make such devices.Yet these producers’ commonplace power, connectivity and sensor chips are vital for Europe’s automotive and consumer goods manufacturers, which have lost billions of euros in revenues as a result of the semiconductor shortage.Uberreiter and his competitors hope lawmakers in Germany and the wider EU will see the value in their companies’ technology and invest in its expansion to prevent further bottlenecks despite the higher costs of doing business in Europe.“If you look at these things,” he said, waving his smartphone, “there’s exactly one chip that is the most leading-edge, shiny thing, and then there are 46 others.”Promoters of Saxony said the companies here had also created a chips “ecosystem” that benefited established companies and could attract smaller, cutting-edge entrants to the area.One such business is Arioso Systems, a start-up based in the former premises of an East German computing company. A spin-off from the nearby Fraunhofer Institute for Photonic Microsystems, a research body, Arioso is trying to use silicon to produce sound in wireless earbuds such as Apple’s AirPods, rather than a traditional coil speaker.“We don’t have a membrane that is moving, we have cantilevers, which move and squeeze the air out of the chip,” said engineer Lutz Ehrig, balancing a tiny chip on the tip of his finger.Making the technology relies on collaboration with semiconductor factories in the area, but it is personnel, rather than plants, that Arioso is struggling to find. Local demographics are unhelpful — 9 of the 10 oldest regions in Europe are in eastern Germany.“Most of the applications we get are from India and Pakistan,” said managing director Hermann Schenk. “We can’t get enough people [locally].”Global recruitment is key to Silicon Saxony’s aim to increase the number of workers in the semiconductor sector from 70,500 to 100,000, and for the industry to overtake carmakers as the biggest employer in the state. Employees at GlobalFoundries, for example, hail from more than 40 countries.“We will need more immigration,” said Bösenberg. The rise of the far-right, anti-immigration AfD party in Saxony, he said, may be hindering efforts to attract the most qualified candidates.In September’s general election, ten of Saxony’s 16 constituencies voted to directly elect AfD candidates.Given current polling, local elections in 2024 could result in the AfD’s overtaking the Christian Democrats to become the largest party in Saxony’s parliament, potentially handing them control of the state budget.With less than 60 per cent of its citizens double vaccinated, Saxony also consistently posts record high numbers of new Covid-19 cases.“We have to fight this perception,” said Bösenberg, dismayed at the reputation the state has gained in recent years. “We are in competition with each and every German region.we need a more positive image”.
151  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
152  Emmanuel Macron has vowed to pursue the economic reforms begun since he became French president in 2017 but stopped short of confirming that he will stand for re-election next April, despite his lead in opinion polls and widespread expectations that he will seek a second term.In a two-hour primetime television interview on TF1 on Wednesday night, Macron defended his record over the past four-and-a-half years in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic, launching reforms to liberalise the economy and tackling the anti-government gilets jaunes demonstrations, as well as responding to attacks by Islamist extremists.He said that he had learnt to love the French more than ever but also admitted that he had often erred. “I make mistakes, yes, many,” said Macron, who has been accused by rivals of being an arrogant president of the rich. “I try not to repeat them.” Opposition politicians criticised Macron and TF1 for what they painted as a soft interview that allowed the president to make a case for re-election without officially declaring his campaign.“It’s a propaganda broadcast by a candidate,” said Eric Ciotti of the rightwing Les Républicains, whose nominee has a chance of challenging Macron, according to opinion polls. “The Elysée is seized by panic over the candidature of Valérie Pécresse,” Ciotti said in a debate on TF1 immediately after the interview.Jordan Bardella of Marine Le Pen’s far-right Rassemblement National called Macron a “self-satisfied” president who was clearly a candidate. Boris Vallaud of the Socialist party said the interview, billed as being about where France was headed, instead offered “a lot about where Macron is with himself”. Macron reiterated the need to modernise France’s costly pension systems — a landmark reform suspended during the pandemic — by simplifying the 42 different regimes in place. But he accepted that his plan to replace them with a single system had provoked too much concern and would have to be modified.He also said it was inevitable that the retirement age would rise from 62 to ensure that pensions were sustainable. “We must all be prepared for the idea that we work longer,” he said.Macron’s opponents on the right and the far-right, including the anti-immigration polemicist Eric Zemmour, have made immigration and law and order the most prominent themes of early campaigning, prompting Macron to reassert his determination to “control” immigration without stopping it completely, as some of his rivals have pledged.“There has never been zero immigration,” Macron said. “Yes, we have a problem of managing it. [But] we need this immigration of workers, in a limited, selective and controlled way to power our economy.” An opinion poll published on Wednesday by Harris Interactive for Challenges magazine gave Macron the lead in voting intentions for the first round of the presidential election, with 24 per cent, followed by Pécresse with 17 per cent, Le Pen with 16 and Zemmour with 15.
153  The writer is a senior fellow at Harvard Kennedy SchoolEconomic sanctions have become the hammer in the US diplomatic toolbox, used repeatedly on foreign policy nails. The idea is to punish egregious behaviour without going to war. But they have never been great at coercing behavioural changes and President Joe Biden’s threat to impose “economic consequences like none he’s ever seen” on Russia’s Vladimir Putin is not likely to be particularly effective.An invasion of Ukraine would be met “with a range of high impact economic measures that we have refrained from using in the past,” according to secretary of state Antony Blinken. Those could include impeding Russia’s ability to convert roubles into western currencies, kicking Russia out of the Swift payments system, restricting its sovereign debt purchases and encouraging Germany to halt the Nord Stream 2 oil pipeline that will bring gas from Russia directly to Europe.But Russia is already heavily sanctioned. After its annexation of Crimea in 2014 the US imposed travel bans, asset freezes, finance and trade restrictions and a ban on assistance to Russian oil and gas companies. Russian banks were blacklisted by the US, with Visa and Mastercard also blocking some from using their payment systems. We do not know what would have happened without these sanctions, but they do not seem to have resolved the Ukraine crisis, reduced human rights violations in Russia or deterred new cyber attacks. They have no doubt knocked a few points off Russian GDP growth, but the economy has nevertheless adapted.According to the Treasury Department’s 2021 Sanctions Review, US sanctions use has increased 933 per cent between 2000 and 2021. During Barack Obama’s first term, the US designated an average of 500 entities for sanctions per year, a figure that nearly doubled under Donald Trump. Biden has imposed new sanctions against Myanmar, Nicaragua and Russia and this week will put eight Chinese companies on an investment blacklist for their involvement in repressing the Uyghur Muslim minority in Xinjiang.You might hope this explosion of US sanctions means they’re really effective. One generous study published in 2014 determines they lead to concessions about half the time. Since then, that percentage has probably fallen. After the 9/11 attacks, the US weaponised its financial system, making it harder for financial institutions to engage in dollar transactions with sanctioned governments, companies or people. But the proliferation of digital currencies and alternative payment platforms has created new loopholes around economic sanctions, giving targets the opportunity to hold and transfer funds outside of the traditional, dollar-based system.Economic sanctions have lost efficacy in a globalised world, too. China has emerged as a “black knight”, stepping in to offer trade diversion and other relief to sanctioned entities. The Venezuelan state-owned oil company, under US sanctions in a bid to topple the government, nevertheless sold oil to China via the Russian state-owned oil company, Rosneft. Iran is heavily sanctioned, yet China continues to buy its oil.The ratchet effect also makes US economic sanctions less effective. It is much easier for leaders to impose sanctions than remove them, for fear of appearing weak. Only Congress can permanently revoke sanctions mandated by law rather than by executive order, such as those against Cuba and Russia. Rising political polarisation makes this a very heavy lift. If there is no credible path towards removing sanctions, the target doesn’t have much incentive to change or negotiate.If economic sanctions are not a silver bullet, why does the US keep using them? Dan Drezner, a professor in international politics at Tufts University, offers one explanation. He argues they are both a reflection of American decline (adversaries are less afraid of the US and American leaders have fewer tools at their disposal) and a catalyst for it. Sanctions antagonise enemies, irritate allies, impose costs on innocent people and drive targets to find alternatives to the US financial system, undermining dollar supremacy.The Ukraine issue is a difficult one. Biden and Putin failed to resolve their differences in a two-hour phone call last week. It’s not clear what inducements the US and its allies can offer Putin to back off. Yet the threat of more sanctions may not accomplish much. They would impose a cost, but, to paraphrase Richard Nephew, former principal deputy co-ordinator for sanctions policy at the state department, “One can’t blame the [hammer] if it fails to perform the work of a screwdriver.”Letter in response to this article:EU must reduce reliance on Russian gas supplies / From Paul Bledsoe, Washington, DC, US
154  As a French-born and -educated citizen, I am to appreciate and never question the top-down, centralised nature of the Fifth Republic, the presidential regime shaped by the late Charles de Gaulle in 1958. Every five years, I am required to elect a president with super executive powers, and give little thought to government and parliament. This is the price for stability and efficiency, or so we are taught. But I must confess that in the past two weeks I have experienced a sacrilegious feeling of envy at Germany’s grown-up coalition politics.The French have been mesmerised by the understated exit of Angela Merkel, Germany’s centre-right chancellor for 16 years, and the arrival in power of the centre-left veteran politician Olaf Scholz. Commentary has underlined an austere yet benevolent democratic transition. As the French presidential campaign heats up and turns toxic, Berlin has offered a more consensual alternative to our confrontational political culture. “It’s what democracy should be, appeased. a mixture of change and continuity,” political scientist Dominique Moïsi marvelled on BFMTV. “Are we going to be capable of such a transition in April?” he wondered, referring to the presidential polls.Merkel’s generous farewell speech to her successor, the bouquet of flowers Scholz gave her and the standing ovation she received in the Bundestag were worlds apart from the republican pomp the French are used to. For us, accustomed to the uncompromising nature of partisan politics, the marriage in Berlin of three parties with vastly different platforms — the liberal FDP, the leftwing Greens and the centre-left SPD — has been a source of wonder.France’s electoral system is designed to create a parliamentary majority behind the president (this was reinforced by the reform in 2000 that aligned the presidential and legislative terms). Consensus is not the result of patient discussions between political parties, but is created by default, through a run-off between two presidential finalists. In 2017, Macron was elected against the far-right Marine Le Pen, even though he had won only 24 per cent of votes in the first round. So far this has kept the extremists at bay.The cost is a “deep democratic malaise” in France that Macron, who had pledged to “renew” politics, has not cured, political scientist Luc Rouban notes. The Macron presidency is one of the most technocratic and centralised in postwar France. By contrast, “the German transition projects the image of a well-functioning democracy,” Rouban says. In a comparative survey released in October, he and his colleague Bruno Cautrès found more profound mistrust of political parties than in Germany (and in the UK) — a trend that burst into the open with the gilets jaunes protests in 2018 and did not materially shift during the pandemic. “Political criticism is more virulent than in Germany or the UK, and it is concentrated on the president,” Rouban says.This French mal-être (malaise) results in contradictory demands. A growing minority, 42 per cent, agree that “in democracy, nothing progresses, we need less democracy but more efficiency”. But separately, there is a desire for shifting more power to local entities and for more direct citizen consultations, according to Rouban.France seems to be at an impasse. But would a return to a German-style parliamentary regime help? Only leftwing firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon believes so. He wants to curtail presidential powers and bolster those of parliament. But this is a minority view. Rouban thinks it would simply not work: surveys show that in France, political faultlines between left and right run deeper than in Germany, he says. History cannot be erased: memories of the messy postwar parliamentary republic that preceded the current constitution loom large.“Compromise is tantamount to treason for French voters,” Rouban says. Friendly deals among parties are perceived as political shenanigans. Take a look at the French left, he says, fragmented and with little prospects of making it to the second round, yet still unable to unite. The French can dream about the German democratic model all they want — it will remain pure fantasy.
155  The Netherlands has agreed to form a new four-party coalition government that has promised an unprecedented burst of public spending, breaking with the country’s traditional focus on balanced budgets and a small state.Caretaker prime minister Mark Rutte will retain his job to become the country’s longest-running leader as part of the new governing coalition that includes his centre-right People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), pro-EU liberals, conservative Christian Democrats and the Christian Union. The government will be Rutte’s fourth coalition since 2010.The coalition agreement was announced on Wednesday, more than nine months after national elections in which Rutte’s party emerged as the largest in parliament, while the pro-European D66 party came second. The political interregnum, the longest in Dutch history, coincided with a wave of Covid-19 infections and a nationwide lockdown announced last month.Unlike Rutte’s previously thrifty governments, the coalition has vowed to launch significant spending programmes on housing, education, defence and climate that will increase the country’s ratio of debt to gross domestic product above the EU’s 60 per cent limit in coming years.The coalition also promised to open two new nuclear power stations in a bid to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 per cent by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. The last government effectively dissolved itself in January after all ministers resigned following a scandal that involved the country’s tax department incorrectly labelling thousands of parents claiming child benefits as fraudsters.Wopke Hoekstra, the Christian Democrats’ leader and finance minister in the previous coalition, said the new government’s measures would help “restore the balance in the Netherlands and make sure that every person really counts”.Over the past decade, the Netherlands has become known as the EU’s leading “frugal” member state, opposing more expansive EU budgets and fiscal risk-sharing in the eurozone.The new coalition marks a clear reversal of such austerity policies, first introduced in the wake of the financial crisis. It also follows Germany’s new “traffic light” coalition government, which has similarly embraced more expansive spending and progressive social policy.Landmark measures include the creation of a €35bn Netherlands climate fund to be built up over 10 years, €25bn to help reduce the country’s nitrogen emissions, the provision of almost free childcare and a 7.5 per cent increase in the statutory minimum wage.The Netherlands will also boost its foreign aid budget, spend an additional €3bn a year on defence, and partially loosen its hardline stance on inward migration.On EU matters, the coalition agreement states the governing parties will support abolishing the unanimity votes required to make EU foreign policy, seek a stronger role for the European parliament and support EU-wide taxes such as a carbon tax and digital levy.Ministerial posts are likely to be announced in the new year, with the D66 vying for the finance ministry role. The finance minister is traditionally in the hands of the second-largest party and was held by conservative Hoekstra for the past four years — often straining ties with southern eurozone countries and France.
156  Germany is to expel two Russian diplomats after a judge accused Russia of “state terrorism” for ordering the killing of a former Chechen rebel in a Berlin park in 2019.A German court on Wednesday sentenced Russian national Vadim Krasikov to life in prison, after convicting him of killing Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, a Georgian citizen of Chechen ethnicity who lived as a refugee in Germany.Judge Olaf Arnoldi said Krasikov “acted on the orders of the Russian central government”, describing the killing as an “execution”.Annalena Baerbock, Germany’s new foreign minister, called the murder a “serious breach of German law and Germany’s sovereignty”.She said she had summoned the Russian ambassador, Sergei Nechaev, and told him two members of the embassy’s diplomatic staff would be declared personae non gratae.The culmination of Krasikov’s year-long trial and Germany’s move to expel Russian diplomats in response is likely to plunge ties between Berlin and Moscow into a new crisis.Nechaev described Wednesday’s court verdict as “a biased, politically motivated decision” which would “seriously strain the already difficult German-Russian relationship”.Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on messaging app Telegram that Moscow would respond “appropriately” to Berlin’s “unfriendly actions”.The verdict could pile pressure on Germany’s new chancellor Olaf Scholz, who was sworn into office just a week ago, to harden his policy on Russia. His predecessor Angela Merkel had threatened consequences if the court established that Khangoshvili’s death had been ordered by the Kremlin.It also comes at a time when east-west tensions are already threatening to boil over. The US has warned that Russia, which has deployed about 100,000 troops along its border with Ukraine, could be about to invade its western neighbour. The G7 group of nations has warned Moscow of “massive consequences” and a “severe cost” if it does invade.Krasikov, 56, killed Khangoshvili in the Kleiner Tiergarten, a park in central Berlin, on August 23 2019. He approached him from behind on a bicycle and fired twice at him from a Glock pistol fitted with a silencer, shooting him again in the back of the head as he lay on the ground.Khangoshvili, who had fought against Russia in the Chechen war and had lived as an asylum seeker in Germany since 2016, died at the scene. The judge said that accomplices stationed in Berlin — whose identity have yet to be established — had “meticulously prepared” the murder.Russian authorities considered Khangoshvili a terrorist, with the Russian domestic intelligence agency, the FSB, claiming in 2012 that he was a member of a militant organisation known as the “Caucasian Emirate”.The execution-style killing sent relations between Moscow and Berlin into a tailspin, with the two countries carrying out tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions in late 2019.Russia denied any involvement in the Khangoshvili’s killing. But asked about it at a press conference in December 2019, President Vladimir Putin called the dead man a “bandit”, adding: “In Berlin, a fighter was killed who was wanted in Russia, a bloodthirsty and brutal man.”Krasikov’s lawyers claimed at the beginning of the trial that it was a case of mistaken identity — that their client was not Vadim Krasikov but Vadim Sokolov, a 50-year-old construction engineer who had no ties to the Russian state and the FSB. They said he had nothing to do with Khangoshvili’s murder and had been in Berlin as a tourist.Robert Unger, Krasikov’s defence lawyer, said after the trial the judge had not presented a “single viable piece of evidence” that his client was acting on orders of the Russian government. “The circumstantial evidence that exists is not in our view sufficient for such a verdict,” he said.In his summing up on Wednesday, the judge stressed the “particular severity” of Krasikov’s guilt, a formulation which means he is unlikely to be released from prison after serving the minimum life term of 15 years.In her statement, Baerbock said the new German government was interested in pursuing an “open and honest exchange” with Russia, but that it must be “on the basis of international law and mutual respect”.“It’s quite clear that actions such as the Tiergarten murder place this exchange under severe strain,” she said.Additional reporting by Max Seddon in Moscow
157  Brussels has proposed a ban on long-term contracts to import natural gas into the EU beyond 2049 in an attempt to end the bloc’s reliance on foreign producers led by Russia.The European Commission on Wednesday unveiled an update of its gas market rules, which includes a prohibition on member states entering gas contracts with non-EU countries that run beyond 2049 — the last year before the EU aims to hit its net zero greenhouse gas emissions target.“No long-term contracts for supply of unabated fossil gas shall be concluded with a duration beyond the end of year 2049,” states the commission proposal, which will require agreement from a majority of EU governments and MEPs to come into force.The proposed ban on long-term contracts comes as Europe has suffered from record prices for wholesale gas since the autumn. The price surge has been driven by factors including rising global demand as countries recover from the pandemic, reduced supply of renewable energy and lower additional supplies from Russia.Russia, the EU’s largest single supplier of natural gas, has preferred long-term contracts and said the energy crisis was caused in part by EU countries’ moves to phase out such purchasing agreements. “This practice is a mistake,” Russia’s president Vladimir Putin said in October.“Long-term contracts are normally used to open new sites of gas production and ensure their profitability,” said Kadri Simson, the EU’s energy commissioner. “This ban sends a strong signal that such activities should not be pursued unless emissions are abated. This repeats our clear message that our gas market will be decarbonised by 2050.”Brussels’ ban will apply only to “unabated” fossil gas, which does not use ways to reduce CO2 emissions, including carbon capture and storage.Russia, which supplies a third of European gas needs through state-backed monopoly producer Gazprom, reacted cautiously to the commission’s proposals.“Let’s wait for the decision they actually take. Normally, a discussion ends with a more weighed approach,” said Pavel Sorokin, Russia’s deputy energy minister. “So let’s wait until they are done talking and see the final proposals. Then, let’s wait another 10-15 years and see whether they remain in place.”With Russia also pledging to be carbon-neutral by 2060, Sorokin said the move to a greener future was a common goal.“We absolutely must move toward ecological neutrality, it’s a non-disputed fact that everyone has accepted and everyone is moving to. But we must do it without slogans but with real calculations and a real understanding of prices.”Sorokin warned that a move away from long-term gas contracts could lead to even higher prices and potential social unrest. “Remember what happened with the gilets jaunes in France? It happened because of a higher ecological tax on gasoline. Now imagine what happens when [the commission] reveals the actual cost of all these actions,” he warned.Konstantin Simonov, head of Russia’s energy security fund, called the timing of the proposals “foolish”.“When the spot gas price is skyrocketing, [it] seems the agenda should be the opposite. It’s like Europe is trying to worsen the crisis,” he said. “When experts even in Europe say long-term contracts are a way out, the officials want to cancel them. It’s very strange. Well, let them go for it, let’s move everything to the spot market and see what happens.”Gazprom declined to comment. But the company has repeatedly pointed out that it is fulfilling all its contractual obligations, and that Europe should consider longer-term deals if it wants more gas.The commission has also proposed a voluntary system of joint gas procurement and shared storage for EU countries, many of which have demanded drastic changes to the internal energy market to damp rising electricity prices. Brussels will encourage member states to carry out joint purchases in times of emergency.Simson said countries should carry out national risk assessments based on their purchasing and storage needs. “These reserves could be released in times of emergency and be in line with EU energy market and competition rules,” added the commissioner.As part of its plans to decarbonise gas, Brussels will introduce rules to increase production of biogas and green hydrogen. Biogas has a 70 per cent smaller carbon footprint than natural gas but makes up less than 5 per cent of the EU’s total gas consumption, according to the commission. Brussels will also propose cutting entry tariffs for low-carbon gas and integrating these sources into the EU’s gas grid.EU leaders will discuss the proposals at a summit in Brussels on Thursday.
158  Addressing the Bundestag on March 13 2014, Angela Merkel could not have been clearer in her condemnation of Vladimir Putin’s annexation of Crimea a few days earlier. The redrawing of Ukraine’s borders by force ran counter to the rules-based international order that Germany held dear. Europe was reliving a 19th-century conflict about spheres of influence, “a conflict we believed we had overcome”, Merkel told parliamentarians.Her clear denunciation of Russian aggression and support for economic sanctions against Moscow marked the beginning of Germany’s emergence from what John Lough calls its state of “conscious denial” about Russia’s authoritarian and revisionist direction.For much of the preceding two decades, including the bulk of Merkel’s 16-year chancellorship, wishful thinking about the direction of Russia and the ability to influence it through empty dialogue and pieties about partnership had clouded German foreign policy thinking. To a degree it still does. Merkel refused to acknowledge that the new Nord Stream 2 pipeline bringing Russian gas to Germany, allowing it to scale down transit through Ukraine and thus intimidate Kyiv — was anything other than a “commercial project”.Germany’s Russia Problem seeks to explain why the core tenets of German policy towards Moscow under chancellors Helmut Kohl, Gerhard Schröder and Merkel (until 2014) did not change even though Russia plainly did.Through misguided thinking and a “stubborn quest for ‘strategic partnership’, Germany inadvertently ended up supporting the emergence of a Russian regime hostile to its interests and values”, writes Lough, an analyst and former Nato official. “It legitimised and reinforced a deeply corrupt and increasingly authoritarian and repressive Russian system, emboldening it to deploy force against its neighbours and to attack western institutions.”Given Merkel’s departure from office, the arrival of a new coalition government and a renewed threat of Russian military aggression towards Ukraine, this book is well timed. It is also nuanced and deeply researched. Lough’s starting point is that Germany’s relationship with Russia is the most important link between the western world and the largest country on the European continent. They have interacted intensely for centuries, leaving Germans with a “complex psychological inheritance” that shapes their way of thinking.Both succumbed to radical ideologies and both committed crimes against humanity. Their war of annihilation created an unparalleled “bond of spilt blood”. War guilt is still a powerful influence on German thinking about Russia, less so about Ukraine, which suffered more. Russian postwar forgiveness has created a sense of German “debt and obligation”, which Moscow still seeks to exploit.Lough also points to the “mythology” still cultivated in Social Democratic party circles that Ostpolitik — the policy of rapprochement and engagement launched by Willy Brandt — was the most important factor in ending the cold war. Meanwhile, there is enduring gratitude for Moscow’s green light for German reunification, even though it was probably the result of circumstance as much as the Kremlin’s benevolence.Finally there is the longstanding economic appeal of a vast country rich in resources — and the belief that trade encourages partnership and political change.The depth of interaction means that Russia “is inescapably present in the German consciousness”, writes Lough. Germans feel better equipped to understand Russians than others in the west. It has given rise to Russlandversteher, or “Russia understanders”, across the German establishment with a strong influence on policymaking. “‘Understanding’ in this context is a synonym for ‘readiness to make allowances’.”Lough is surprisingly sympathetic towards Merkel, paying tribute to her leadership on EU sanctions and courage in shifting German policy on Russia to a more realistic position. But it is “reasonable to ask” why it took her 15 years to “conclude that the criminalised state posed serious dangers to its citizens, its neighbours and Europe as a whole”.Germany’s Russia Problem was completed before September’s federal election. A postscript would observe the much more critical tone on Russia in the new coalition agreement between social democrats, greens and liberals. It will take more than a few paragraphs to change what he calls Germany’s “historical reflexes”.Germany’s Russia Problem: The Struggle for Balance in Europe by John Lough Manchester University Press, £20/$29.95, 256 pagesBen Hall is the FT’s Europe editorJoin our online book group on Facebook at FT Books Café
159  Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to present a united front with Xi Jinping as the Kremlin said the Chinese leader supported Moscow’s demand for security guarantees that would limit western influence in its backyard.In remarks shown by Russian state television at the start of their 90-minute video call on Wednesday, Putin told his “dear friend” Xi that “a new model of co-operation between our countries has formed on principles such as non-interference in internal affairs and respecting each other’s interests”.Xi, who called Putin an “old friend”, told him that he “highly appreciated” Russia’s “strong support of China’s efforts to protect its key international interests”, according to the official Xinhua news agency.“Certain international forces are interfering in the internal affairs of China and Russia, and trampling on international law and recognised norms of international relations,” Xi added. “China and Russia should carry out more joint actions to safeguard the security interests of both parties.”After Putin briefed Xi on his recent demands to redraw Europe’s security order in a call with US President Joe Biden last week, the Chinese leader “underscored that he supports Russia’s demands for such guarantees [and] understands what concerns Russia has with regard to its western borders”, Putin’s foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters, according to Interfax.Russia sought to portray Putin and Xi’s call, the 37th meeting between them since 2013, as a show of support at a time when both countries’ relationships with the west are deteriorating to lows not seen since the cold war more than three decades ago.Moscow and Beijing are not formally allied but have moved closer together since 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine and fuelled a slow-burning separatist war in the eastern Donbas border region.Putin secured a major gas supply deal with China that underscored Beijing’s support for Russia in the face of US and EU sanctions over Ukraine.After Russia deployed about 100,000 troops on the border with Ukraine this autumn, the US and EU fear Moscow could be planning to restart the conflict and have threatened crippling sanctions in response.Putin has said the US warnings of an invasion are “alarmist” and accused Nato of inflaming tensions by supplying Ukraine’s army with advanced weaponry while conducting military drills near the Russian border.Following his talks with Biden, Putin reiterated Russia’s demands in calls this week with western leaders including UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron.Beijing and Washington, meanwhile, have clashed repeatedly in recent weeks over the Xi administration’s alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, moves by the US to block Chinese companies’ access to investment capital and technology, and Joe Biden’s “Summit for Democracy” that excluded China and Russia.The Biden administration has also announced a “diplomatic boycott” of February’s winter Olympics in Beijing — which Putin pointedly said that he would attend, marking the first in-person contact with Xi since the start of the pandemic.“Amid growing confrontation with the west it’s important for Vladimir Putin to show that partnership with China is deepening,” said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center. “This visit will be another milestone in forging the axis.”Putin and Xi both condemned the democracy summit hosted by Biden earlier this month and said they were “worried” by new alliances aimed at countering China’s influence such as the US, UK and Australia’s Aukus security pact, Ushakov said.Lu Xiang, an international relations expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, said Xi and Putin needed to “co-ordinate policies in a complex international environment”.“The US is trying to unite other nations by creating fear about China,” Lu said. “That’s going back to a cold-war mentality in the 21st century.”
160  German chancellor Olaf Scholz has warned of the threat posed by extreme anti-vaccine campaigners, hours after police launched raids over a suspected violent “anti-vax” plot against the leader of the state of Saxony.Germany has some of the lowest vaccination rates in western Europe and there has been vocal opposition both to tighter anti-coronavirus measures and the government’s vaccination policy.“There is a lot of talk about the alleged division of society. I would like to point out that our society is not divided,” Scholz told the Bundestag on Wednesday, as he presented the new German coalition’s government plan.“We will not put up with a tiny minority of uninhibited extremists trying to impose their will on our entire society.”His comments came hours after police in Saxony said special forces units had raided six properties and were investigating five suspects in connection with an alleged murder plot against the state premier of Saxony, Michael Kretschmer, and shared on Telegram, the messaging app.On Tuesday the ZDF news channel reported on apparent death threats against Kretschmer, posted by opponents of coronavirus regulations and the vaccine rollout.ZDF said a group of some 130 members on a group on the mobile platform Telegram, called “Dresden Offline Networking”, were sharing messages encouraging people to oppose government measures “with armed force if needed”.Anti-vaxxer protests and demonstrations against coronavirus regulations have erupted across Germany but the eastern state of Saxony, which has one of the lowest vaccination rates and the highest coronavirus infections, has become a hotspot.Earlier this month, far-right supporters carrying torches marched in front of the home of Saxony’s health minister in protest against coronavirus regulations, chanting against “dictatorship”.Scholz said his government had no problem debating with those who opposed tighter restrictions or who were sceptical of vaccination, adding: “We are listening. We are looking for debate.”But, he told the Bundestag: “There is in Germany today.denial of reality, absurd conspiracy stories, wilful disinformation and violent extremism.“We will counter this with the means of our democratic constitutional state. Our democracy is a democracy capable of defending itself.”Scholz, 63, said he was sensitive to the weariness in society over the pandemic. “Sometimes it is difficult not to lose heart,” he said. “Nobody is doing really well in these times — not me, not you, not the citizens.”But he noted there were “no red lines” for the federal government in terms of fighting the pandemic. Opponents have argued that he has not ruled out the possibility of future lockdowns.“We will pull every possible lever until we have all regained our former lives and all of our freedoms,” Scholz said.
161  Lithuania has pulled its remaining diplomats out of China over concerns for their safety, in a sharp escalation of bilateral tensions as Beijing retaliates against the Baltic nation’s efforts to strengthen ties with Taiwan.Audra Ciapiene, Lithuania’s interim chargé d’affaires in China, the country’s most senior diplomat in Beijing after the ambassador’s recall in September, returned to Vilnius on Wednesday for consultations. The embassy will temporarily operate remotely, the foreign ministry in Vilnius told the Financial Times.According to three people familiar with the situation, the Chinese government had demanded Lithuania’s remaining diplomats in Beijing hand in their diplomatic IDs to the foreign ministry to have their diplomatic status lowered. The move raised concern in Vilnius that the officials could lose diplomatic immunity, putting their safety at risk if they remained in China.Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania’s foreign minister, said later on Wednesday that China had also “unilaterally” decided to rename the Baltic country’s embassy in Beijing. The Chinese wanted to call it “the office of the chargé d’affaires”, according to officials. The fallout threatens a dilemma for the EU over how to support one of its member states without risking consequences for others in Beijing’s response. It will probably also spark international discussions over how democracies can respond to Chinese coercion.“China is sending the message to other European countries that the punishment will be draconian if you follow Lithuania’s example, so people would like to deal with this cautiously,” said a western diplomat in Beijing. “But at the same time, we must make clear that steps against one member country are steps against the EU.”The diplomats’ evacuation followed a string of Chinese threats and retaliation measures in response to Lithuania’s decision in July to allow Taiwan to open a representative office in Vilnius under its own name.In August, Beijing recalled its ambassador to Lithuania. It also demanded that Vilnius “immediately rectify its wrong decision, take concrete measures to undo the damage, and not move further down the wrong path”.After the Taiwanese representative office in Vilnius opened last month, Beijing imposed economic sanctions on Lithuania. This month, it blocked all Lithuanian exports to China by removing the country from the customs administration’s country list, in effect making it impossible for companies to file customs declarations.Lithuania was restored to the list after a few days, but national and EU officials said Lithuanian exports to China remained blocked as any attempt at processing shipments returned an error and customs officials refused to assist.Chinese companies have cancelled orders of Lithuanian products and from Lithuanian suppliers, the EU delegation in Beijing said.The European Commission said it was seeking an explanation from Beijing, and that the actions could break World Trade Organization rules.The falling out with Lithuania comes as the EU reconsiders its relationship with China, partly as the bloc attempts to respond to Washington’s policy towards Beijing.A planned investment agreement between the bloc and Beijing was derailed this year after China blacklisted EU lawmakers and officials in response to sanctions the bloc imposed over human rights violations.Last week, Brussels proposed an “anti-coercion instrument” that would allow it to retaliate against economic punitive measures. Other central and eastern European nations, once wooed by Beijing through a special 17+1 grouping, have cooled on China, while public opinion in many EU member states has turned against the country.The commission on Wednesday confirmed that “all Lithuanian diplomatic staff and their families” left Beijing on Wednesday morning, accompanied by staff members from the EU delegation to the country. “The repatriation of Lithuanian diplomatic staff and their relatives is a sovereign decision by the Lithuanian authorities on what is best for its mission and its staff,” Nabila Massrali, EU foreign affairs spokesperson, said in response to a question regarding whether the issue warranted a response from the 27-member bloc.The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Asked about the issue, a senior US official said Washington would continue to “respect and support Lithuania’s sovereign decision to define the contours of its One China policy, free from outside coercion”.“Lithuania is a valued Nato ally and partner for the US and we reaffirm our support for Lithuania,” the official added. “We will continue to expand and deepen our already robust bilateral relationship with Lithuania.”
162  In the wake of the financial crisis a decade ago Spain agonised over how to cut spending to meet Brussels’ demands. Today Madrid has the opposite dilemma: can it ramp up spending enough to use up vast quantities of EU coronavirus aid?With the vast majority of €70bn in EU recovery fund grants scheduled for 2021-2023, the resources are without precedent for Spain, the programme’s second-biggest beneficiary after Italy.“This is the absolute priority; this is an opportunity for the whole country,” Gonzalo García Andrés, minister of state for the economy, said in an interview. “When the money starts coming into the economy, it is not going to stop.”The money is at the heart of the economic and political strategy of the government of Pedro Sánchez, under whose watch the economy contracted by a savage 10.8 per cent in 2020, and which faces elections by the end of 2023.Spain’s share is part of the bloc’s €800bn coronavirus recovery fund, intended both to deliver a medium-term boost to the continent’s economy and to transform it longer term, by funding a green energy transition, digitalisation and training as well as structural reforms.The vast sums testify to a volte face by Europe. A decade ago, austerity was the response to crisis. Spain labels that a mistake, and, with the aid of France, Italy and crucially, Germany, has won the EU around to a much more expansive approach.But the sums reaching the Spanish economy this year have fallen far short of expectations. The experience shows that, while the EU might be more convinced of the need to spend, many countries will struggle to absorb funds at such a scale and speed.Problems with managing the funds range from the complexity and number of projects to vexed negotiations with Brussels about the rules, and fear of taking legal risks by hurrying.Spain had initially budgeted €27bn from EU funds for this year, forecasting the money would contribute 2.6 percentage points to 2021 growth. But such hopes have been dashed by bottlenecks and delays.The EU gave Spain a €9bn advance in August and this month the European Commission backed a further payment of €10bn based on the country’s fulfilment of 52 reforms and other criteria.Yet María Jesús Fernández, at Spain’s savings bank association, estimated that, at most, €7bn of recovery funds will be allocated this year — contributing a maximum of 0.6 percentage points of growth.“The impact on GDP doesn’t occur when the funds are assigned but when the [corresponding] investment takes place and the money is spent effectively,” she said. “That’s why I think the figure is going to be very disappointing given the expectations we had.”It is a significant shortfall at a time when Spanish GDP has trailed behind pre-crisis levels.“A certain time has to pass before the money arrives in the economy: you have to carry out the tenders, the companies have to be selected,” said García Andrés. “Throughout the process, we have been among the first: the first, together with Portugal, to come up with our plan, the first to require the funds from the commission and the first to receive its positive assessment based on meeting the objectives.“We are going very fast but we have to do things well.”Other countries are lagging behind. Hungary, Poland, Sweden and Bulgaria have still not received commission approval for their plans. The Netherlands has yet to submit a plan.Brussels requires money from the programme to be allocated by the end of 2026, to draw a line under the pandemic. Madrid intends to front-load the disbursements, planning to spend 77 per cent of its total €70bn in grants over 2021 to 2023.Analysts say this implies spending the money quicker than Spain ever managed with billions of past EU aid. Almost half of the €60bn of European structural funds for Spain during the 2014-2020 period have yet to be spent, according to commission figures.“The rate of absorption of these funds that the European institutions expect does not seem very realistic,” said Chus Escobar, partner responsible for the public sector at EY Spain.She said the government had recognised in budget legislation that roughly half of the planned funds will not be spent this year. Instead, she said, it will have to allocate a mammoth €36bn in 2022.The government says the pace of disbursement is speeding up and will be maintained over two years. On Tuesday it said that more than €15bn — almost two-thirds of the recovery funds planned for this year — had already been transferred to beneficiaries or was being awarded through tenders. However, this figure includes €11bn transferred to regional authorities, much of which is unlikely to have been spent.A further big roadblock was removed last week when, after months of negotiations with Madrid, Brussels approved the use of €3bn in recovery funds to subsidise companies helping produce electric vehicles, which manufacturers have said is vital for Spain.García Andrés said it was not surprising that Spain should encounter delays, given that it was pioneering the use of the funds with Brussels.“We are trailblazers because we are starting a discussion [on permissible state aid],” he said. “When the commission gives us an answer, it also has to apply to all the others who come after us. This is a cost we are assuming.”Then there is the question of making reforms on which further aid depends. The bulk of the reforms that unlocked Spain’s €10bn payment had already been carried out by mid-2021, well before Madrid’s funding request. But the biggest reform promised this year — an updating of labour rules — still needs to be agreed. And new reforms will be needed when Spain seeks the next tranche.“I know that the government is fully and strongly committed,” Paolo Gentiloni, the EU commissioner overseeing the programme, recently told the FT. “This challenge can be successfully addressed, but.the second part will be more challenging than the first.”
163  For almost 75 years the Bluebell Girls have kicked up a storm at the Lido Cabaret on the Champs-Elysées. But the future of Paris’s celebrated showgirl troupe may hang in the balance after news that hotel group Accor is to buy the iconic venue from catering services company, Sodexo.The first question that springs to mind after the news, first revealed by France’s Les Echos, is what on earth was Sodexo doing with the Lido in the first place? The two brands couldn’t be more different — one is a feast of feathers, diamanté costumes and, let’s be honest, partial nudity. The other is a provider of the office canteen cuisine we all love to hate.The second question might be, what on earth is Accor doing buying the Lido? No matter how glorious the show and talented the artists, isn’t there something distinctly passé about the concept? How do bare-breasted dancers fit in with a modern, global brand such as Accor?But scantily clad dancers have been integral to Paris’s great cabarets for more than a century and the Lido’s statuesque Bluebell Girls, with their feathered headdresses and glittering costumes, are its trademark.In recent years the Lido has struggled, however. Terrorism, national strikes, and now Covid have all taken their toll on the international tourism that delivers at least 50 per cent of the Lido’s clientele.There has also been an image problem. Some six years ago, Sodexo invested roughly €25m to modernise the programme and the premises. The aim was to boost annual turnover from €38m to €50m and double the audience to 1m within 3 years, according to reports in Les Echos. Paris Merveilles, the new show created by former Cirque du Soleil director Franco Dragone, was indeed more modern, using cutting edge staging technology, but it drew fire from cabaret aficionados for its paucity of feathers, the introduction of hip-hop sounds into the musical numbers and a lead singer covered in tattoos. “Sodexo did not understand the DNA of the Lido,” says one longtime cabaret owner.Insiders insist many shows continued to sell out — at least when there were no strikes or pandemics. If so, maybe there is a problem with its pricing power.The question now is why should a hotel group fare any better? “When you consider Accor’s knowledge of dynamic pricing and inventory management from their hotels business, moving into theatre seat sales is potentially a logical extension of their brand,” says Robin Cantrill-Fenwick, chief executive of cultural consultancy Baker Richards. “But the biggest question mark for me is how they plan to deliver high quality theatrical productions befitting the space.” And cabaret does not come cheap. In 1999, the Moulin Rouge spent €8m developing its show Féerie and its reputation has been boosted by the 2001 film starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor.Accor argues that the Lido will “expand its augmented hospitality strategy offering unique new experiences to its customers as well as members of its loyalty program”. But does Accor need to buy the lossmaking Lido to offer its spectacle to their clients? Surely this could be achieved more cheaply through an exclusive partnership or joint venture.That said, there may be opportunities to expand the Lido brand, which still has some cachet. Evelina Girling, founder of the London Cabaret Club, says hotels have expressed interest in putting on cabaret shows. Her company is also about to open a show in Dubai. Finally, Accor has a record of taking iconic brands and extending the theme to hotels, such as the Orient Express. Why not a Lido chain?But Accor may be planning something even more radical. According to one person with knowledge of the subject, Parisian theatre director Jean-Luc Choplin has been identified as the Lido’s new boss. Choplin has a passion for Broadway musicals. Paris is awash with rumours that he will transform the Lido into a Broadway-style musical theatre.“Musical theatre is a huge driver of commercial theatre revenue,” says Cantrill-Fenwick. But that too takes heavy investment.What this means for the Bluebell Girls is unclear. If Accor’s ownership signals the end of the Lido as a full-time cabaret, that would be bad news for the whole sector, says Philippe Lhomme, head of the national cabaret association, Camulc, and owner of another, more select Parisian venue, Crazy Horse. “It is important there are a number of cabarets to maintain this tradition,” he says. “Paris is cabaret.”
164  In a packed community hall in northern France, Valérie Pécresse, the newly anointed presidential candidate for the conservative Les Républicains, is making her pitch to party members — and elderly supporter Annie likes what she sees.“It’s the start of a new adventure,” said the 82-year-old, who comes from a family of textile workers and had hoped local champion Xavier Bertrand, the leader of the Hauts-de-France region, would win the party’s primary. Now she is happy to swing behind her party’s first female presidential nominee. “Having a united team is what’s key,” she said.Pécresse evidently agrees. In the days since she won Les Républicains’ primary she has criss-crossed France to show her desire to bring together her party after a hard-fought victory. But unity among its members is a work in progress.“I’m trying to be pragmatic,” mumbled one retiree in the elderly crowd on the outskirts of Lille, who had favoured either the EU’s former Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier or Eric Ciotti, the most rightwing of the LR candidates. He is unimpressed by some of Pécresse’s past positions and thinks she has made gaffes on issues such as multiculturalism.Another member of the audience questions Pécresse’s loyalty after she left the party in 2019 before returning for the primary.The former minister’s bid for the Elysée depends on a balancing act: trying to win back voters who edged to the centre and helped Emmanuel Macron to his presidential victory in 2017, as well as those veering to the far-right. That includes trying to accommodate the more radical anti-immigration policies espoused by Ciotti, the runner-up in the primary vote.Pécresse has sought to portray herself as unwavering in her political line, emphasising her fiscal conservatism and intractability on security matters and decrying “uncontrolled migration”.Her political rivals sense tension that they can exploit. “Valérie Pécresse now has to choose between two irreconcilable versions of the right,” Christophe Castaner, who heads Macron’s La République en Marche (LREM) party in France’s lower house of parliament, told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper on Sunday.Described by fellow politicians and friends as hard-working and often underestimated, Pécresse’s action since winning the nomination contrasts with the approach of François Fillon, the LR’s last presidential candidate. He was derided for disappearing on a skiing holiday right after winning a 2016 LR primary.Pécresse has already visited her opponents’ strongholds, earning grudging support from Ciotti in his village near Nice and posing for pictures with Bertrand in Lille, before wrapping up the week in Paris with a buoyant rally that included her defeated LR rivals.Pécresse saluted the “four musketeers” of the primary and said they were now “one for all and all for one”.Her win has boosted LR’s chances of making it to the second round of the election next year. One poll last week even gave her the edge over Macron were she to make the run-off, which no other contender had managed.“It does help morale,” said Constance Le Grip, an LR member of parliament, on the sidelines of the Paris rally on Saturday. Initially a backer of Barnier in the primary, Le Grip said support for Pécresse within LR ranks was “real and sincere”, though many are still cautious about polls.“That now needs to translate into reality,” she said, adding that Pécresse’s effort to build up local support, and the LR’s regional network, were major strengths.That Pécresse is the party’s first female presidential candidate could also be a source of enthusiasm, said Gilles Norroy, who has worked with her before as an elected local official. At her Lille gathering, Pécresse drew prolonged cheers when she thanked the party for having the “audacity to elect a woman”.Her party is still traumatised by the fall from grace of Fillon, who bled support following an embezzlement scandal that erupted mid-campaign. He failed to qualify for the 2017 run-off against Macron.Pécresse, who said she would cut public spending and civil service jobs, has reserved her harshest words for Macron, attacking the government’s spending largesse during the pandemic. “[Macron] has reformed so little and spent so much,” she said at the Lille gathering.But she will still need to see off the far-right threat posed by the Rassemblement National’s Marine Le Pen and anti-immigration polemicist Eric Zemmour to even make it to the second round.Surveys put her on between 16 and 20 per cent of voting intentions for the first round of the presidential election on April 10, levels similar to Le Pen or Zemmour. Macron is still polling at more than 20 per cent, while leftwing contenders are far behind.Analysts say Pécresse may have a tough time luring blue-collar workers who have turned to Le Pen and will need to convince voters she is concerned about purchasing power and the struggles of low-income families, three years after the “yellow vests” protests over high living costs swept France.“She needs to talk to the working class,” said Aicha Talha, a life-long LR supporter and retired administrative worker from the northern, former industrial city of Roubaix.Though enthusiastic about the “Iron Lady” she sees in Pécresse, she worries the campaign will be long and dirty.“I’m from the right, but I think Macron is going to get his second term,” she said as the Lille gathering disbanded.
165  European and UK gas prices hit another record high on Tuesday over concerns that a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine could disrupt already stretched energy supplies over the winter.Derivatives linked to TTF, Europe’s wholesale gas price, soared as high as €131 per megawatt hour, up from a record high closing price of €116/MWh on Monday, raising energy bills for millions of households and industries across the continent. The UK equivalent rose to as much as £3.24 a therm, extending its gains over a previous high of £2.94 on October 5 and fuelling concerns about inflation.European prices have now surged nearly 40 per cent since the start of the month, surpassing the record highs set in October when the rebounding global economy drove up demand and European calls for additional gas deliveries from Russia went unanswered.Russian president Vladimir Putin’s initial promises to boost supply eased prices last month, but European storage facilities are yet to be replenished and spells of cold weather have led to further drawdowns.“Cold temperatures and soft wind conditions raised the call on fossil-fuelled power plants more recently and thus temporarily boosted natural gas demand,” said Norbert Rücker, a strategist at Julius Baer. “More importantly, the escalation of tensions between Russia and Ukraine seems to nourish supply fears and add a risk premium on prices.”An estimated 100,000 Russian troops have been positioned on Ukraine’s border despite calls from world leaders for Moscow to de-escalate and pursue a diplomatic solution. US officials have warned that Russia could be planning to invade Ukraine as soon as early next year, in a move that would further delay the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline as well as risk disrupting other supplies.On Sunday, German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said the Nord Stream 2 pipeline could not be permitted in its current form because it did not comply with EU law.Continental Europe gets more than a third of its total gas supplies from Russian state-backed Gazprom at present via several pipelines: one through Belarus and Poland, another through Ukraine and the existing Nord Stream 1 pipeline.Tom Marzec-Manser at consultancy ICIS said north-west Europe would probably end the winter with lower gas storage levels than in 2018 in the wake of the cold snap known as the “Beast from the East”.“It is still a market operating as it should. At these prices. the market is trying to reduce demand and draw in additional demand supply,” he said.European gas prices have started to trade to above the price of liquefied natural gas in East Asia, making it the premium market for spot market cargoes, Marzec-Manser added.Still, it is possible that rising cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant could force governments to impose more restrictions, hitting economic growth and reducing energy demand.The International Energy Agency said on Tuesday it expected a surge in new Covid-19 cases to slow the recovery in oil consumption, with air travel and jet fuel the hardest hit. It now estimates global demand will rise by 3.3m barrels per day in 2022, down 100,000 bpd from an earlier estimate.“The surge in new Covid-19 cases is expected to temporarily slow, but not upend, the recovery in oil demand that is under way,” the IEA said in its latest monthly report, which was released on Tuesday.But analysts have said there was no obvious reprieve for Europe’s gas market outside of a mild winter. Across Europe, gas storage facilities are now just 62.8 per cent full, more than 10 per cent below seasonal norms. If the drawdowns continue at current rates, storage levels will reach critically low levels by March or April next year.
166  If one word captures the main economic takeaway from the pandemic, it is surely “shortages”. From March 2020 on, our global economic system seems to have failed us over and over again: first unable to supply the requisite amount of personal protective equipment, then vaccine manufacturing inputs, the vaccines themselves, commodities and raw materials, semiconductors, and the host of durable goods that depend on them, and most recently energy.The economic consequence — inflation — has come harder and faster than most people expected, but not as hard and fast as the political conclusions many observers and leaders saw fit to deduce: that neither globalisation nor capitalism is fit for purpose. Globalisation, because it eroded national control over the supply of vital goods. Capitalism, because private companies designed their production for “just in time” rather than “just in case” considerations, prioritising efficiency in normal times over resilience in extraordinary ones.These judgments were touted loudly early in the pandemic, and have inspired policy ever since. All the big economic powers, and many smaller ones, have acted to bend globalised capitalist production patterns towards forms more within the reach of national authorities.There may be a case for such a policy turn, but the main factual premise of the new resilience-cum-autonomy doctrine is false. The pandemic put capitalist globalisation to the test, with sudden and enormous surges in demand, and it passed with flying colours.Take durable goods. Headlines about shortages are the only thing that seem in ample supply, and everyone is experiencing delays in obtaining items, such as cars, that could previously be had with instant gratification. But the actual supply of durable goods is at record highs. Since the summer of last year, American consumers have been obtaining them in volumes much larger than the pre-pandemic trend. Many EU economies, including Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, have also matched or exceeded 2019 levels of durable goods consumption.What about semiconductors? In a short paper published a month ago, Daniel Rees and Phurichai Rungcharoenkitkul of the Bank for International Settlements showed that semiconductor exports from Taiwan and Korea in 2020 exceeded the volumes recorded in 2019, and 2021 exceeded 2020. Exports currently appear to be running at a good 30 per cent above two years ago. The BIS’s Hyun Song Shin has added that semiconductor sales in the US are much higher than in the years before the pandemic.The same point holds for the goods most relevant to the pandemic itself. Recall that the panic around personal protective equipment supplies, real as it was, dissipated within a month or so. The EU’s imports of test kits and protective garments grew by 20 and 40 per cent, respectively.And vaccines? There is much to criticise about rich countries’ hoarding of Covid-19 vaccines when they were in scarce supply. But that is yesterday’s problem. Analysts estimate that vaccine makers are already producing more than 1bn doses a month.In sum: shortages? What shortages? Of course, even these remarkable increases have not always been enough to satisfy soaring demand. But far from failing us, the globalised capitalist production system has delivered, ramping up supplies in record time in response to one unexpected demand surge after another.So when we complain about shortages, we are really complaining that the ramp-up wasn’t faster and smoother still. We are oblivious to how much we take for granted that sudden, unpredicted, demand is satisfied instantaneously with no noticeable disruption. That goes to show how thoroughly we have internalised the global market’s ability to do just that. Capitalist globalisation is suffering the reputational consequences of its own success.There are obvious qualifications to make. Producing enough for all to share does not ensure that everyone does get a share: fair distribution is not one of capitalism’s strengths. Governments have helped co-ordinate, not to mention pay for, production capacity — well-regulated markets work best. And there is no doubt a role for policy to ensure that even short-term disruptions — such as to PPE supplies in a pandemic — do not happen.But with due regard to those caveats, what other social organisation of economic production does anyone think could respond as well to the seesawing global demand patterns of the last 21 months?There is no reason to think renationalised supply chains — rolling back globalisation — could scale up production any faster than our current system. And why should we expect a significantly more state-directed production system — rolling back capitalism — to be either fairer or more resilient, given states’ failure to ensure adequate stockpiles “just in case” or distribute vaccines fairly across the world?At best we can hope to tweak globalised capitalism at the margins to make it do even better. By all means, invest in stockpiles or require firms to diversify, explaining to taxpayers the insurance rationale for the added cost — but minimise it by sourcing from global markets in good times. Boost public and private investment and consider repatriating where national security requires domestic control. But on the whole, the pandemic’s lesson for global supply chain policy is to leave well alone.
167  Bulgaria’s new prime minister has signalled that Sofia will end its obstruction of North Macedonia’s bid to join the EU once his new government takes office in the coming weeks.Kiril Petkov, who was confirmed as premier by the country’s parliament on Monday after his party took the largest share of the vote in November’s elections, made the pledge as he reaffirmed Bulgaria’s commitment to Nato and the west. “We are on the right side of Nato and EU policies, 100 per cent,” he told the Financial Times in an interview before he was confirmed as prime minister.“We will propose a new process [on North Macedonia], very fast, with a limited timeframe, just six months long,” he said.Sofia wanted certain issues to remain on the table, he noted, including both sides pledging to fight hate crime against the other and North Macedonia referring to its historical connection to Bulgaria in its constitution. But he indicated compromise was possible. “Let the two populations start talking about the benefits of working together.,” he said. “Once we put the upsides on the table.discussions about compromises are much easier to have.”The prime minister added: “Once this is all achieved.I believe we can happily sign Macedonia into the EU.”The U-turn comes after Bulgaria last year vetoed its neighbour’s EU accession talks amid disputes over history and identity. Critics at the time accused Bulgaria’s former centre-right leader Boyko Borisov of resorting to nationalism to distract attention from months of protests against organised crime and corruption on his watch.Borisov was ousted in April elections, but failure to agree a coalition led to fresh polls in July and again in November, when Petkov’s centrist We Continue the Change (PP) party won about a quarter of the vote.Petkov and his coalition partners — the Socialist party, “turbo-folk” pop star Slavi Trifonov’s anti-establishment ITN, and the liberal Democratic Bulgaria — completed the first draft of a coalition agreement last Monday.The new government’s immediate challenge will be tackling the country’s coronavirus crisis. Bulgaria has among the world’s highest death rates and lowest vaccination rates.“We have to increase vaccinations for sure,” said Petkov, whose party campaigned on a pledge to eradicate corruption and streamline the state. “We will put up a sufficient budget for promotion. I will invite experts, go to hospitals and show the situation. It is as much a health program as an economic program. We cannot close Bulgaria again.”The incoming prime minister will also face a complex foreign policy balancing act at a time when Russia is playing an increasingly assertive role in the region.Petkov told the FT the new government would put discussions with North Macedonia on a fresh footing. “We will use working groups.to hash out solutions on issues like joint economic activity, infrastructure, culture and history,” he said.North Macedonia, which first called itself the Republic of Macedonia, emerged out of the former Yugoslavia and was granted EU candidate status in 2005. Its application was held up for years by Greek opposition to its original name, which Athens complained implied a territorial claim on the Greek region of the same name. The issue was resolved in 2019 when the qualifier “North” was added.Meanwhile relations between Sofia and Skopje deteriorated, with many Bulgarians rejecting the concept of a separate Macedonian identity and language, and disputes over events dating back to the second world war.However, Petkov faces a challenge in framing his government’s North Macedonia policy. The enigmatic ITN leader Trifonov has cultivated an image rooted in romantic nationalism — which in Bulgaria encompasses the claim that North Macedonia is ethnically and culturally Bulgarian. His party has nominated the coalition’s foreign minister and energy minister.A recent Gallup International poll found fewer than 10 per cent of Bulgarians support North Macedonia’s EU aspirations outright, and more than 70 per cent back upholding Bulgaria’s veto on Skopje’s accession talks until the bilateral disagreements are settled.Petkov said ITN was a constructive partner in coalition talks and that areas of concern discussed in recent months would remain on the table. “For example, in the Macedonian textbooks Bulgaria should not be called fascist,” he said, alluding to Macedonian descriptions of Bulgarian troops occupying — or in Bulgaria’s view, liberating and managing — what is today North Macedonia during the 1940s.The prime minister aimed to win both sides round with sweeteners, including financial investment, infrastructure and cultural projects and a publicity push. “We are willing not just to talk the talk but also put some money on the table,” he said.Sofia will also need to tread carefully at a time of intensifying tensions in the Black Sea region, where Russia is increasingly flexing its muscles following its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.Bulgaria wanted to end its dependence on Russian energy, Petkov said. The country obtains nearly all its natural gas from Russia. A pipeline running via Greece to Bulgaria that could carry alternative supplies has been under construction for over a decade.Petkov noted Sofia had already signed contracts for supplies of Azeri gas via the Greek route and pledged to complete the Bulgarian part of the work as soon as possible.Petkov said his foreign policy would focus on averting armed conflict “anywhere in the neighbourhood” but that the country remained anchored in the west.A comment by his political mentor, President Rumen Radev, during an election debate in November — when Radev sparked concern among international allies by saying “Crimea is.currently Russian” — had not signalled a change in Bulgaria’s stance, Petkov argued. The president merely meant to call attention to the reality on the ground, he said.“We are treating Crimea as part of Ukraine, there is no doubt about that,” Petkov insisted. “But we want to make sure to use all diplomatic means to avoid military conflict.“We seek an active and committed role for Bulgaria both in the EU and in Nato,” he added. “We no longer want to be the bad kid in the back of the classroom.”Updated to include additional quotes from Kiril Petkov.
168  Occasionally, antitrust action is good news for investors in target companies. Two of the world’s three biggest shipbuilders, which make two-thirds of the world’s natural gas tankers, face an EU antitrust veto on a proposed tie-up. But that could free the smaller partner to pursue its own ambitions.South Korean shipbuilder Hyundai Heavy plans to take over local rival Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering for $2bn. This could have a big impact on the world’s stretched energy supply chains. EU regulators rightly fear the deal would create a single dominant giant, raising costs for customers.The defensive deal made sense in 2019, when Hyundai first announced it. The shipbuilding sector was struggling with overcapacity, even selling some ships at a loss. A tie-up would have meant big savings.But much has changed. Freight rates for transporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) are at a record high of more than $300,000 per day. Orders for carriers are at record highs. Ship prices have risen steeply.The dash for gas reflects stricter environmental regulations in China, India and Europe. LNG generates lower carbon emissions than coal and oil. Though unpopular with environmentalists and some investors, LNG is seen as a stepping stone in a long-term shift in energy usage.Shipping companies have accelerated orders for vessels to ensure delivery. Korean shipbuilders have full order books through 2024.The unusually long 20-year contracts China has been signing for LNG supply means demand will stay strong. Hyundai and Daewoo face little risk of competition from newcomers. Barriers to entry are high in LNG carriers. The liquid needs to be stored at minus 160C under rough conditions. The risk of explosions is ever present. The technology preventing them is complex and expensive.Shares of the pair are down 30 per cent over six months, reflecting fears the takeover will unravel. But this is short-sighted. A veto would spare Hyundai steep restructuring costs. And Daewoo, which received a state bailout in 2017, would have a shot at regaining its glory days as a strong, independent shipbuilder.
169  Little about the green-grey building on Varsonofyevsky lane in central Moscow suggests that it was home for 30 years to the main execution squad of the Soviet secret police.About 15,000 people were shot and killed in its basement and backyard, tour guide Vasily Starostin told a small group gathered outside its gates one sub-zero day last week, on a walk organised by Russia’s oldest civil rights group, Memorial, and based on its mammoth archival research into Soviet-era crimes.The group has worked since 1989 to preserve the memory of some of the darkest moments in Russia’s history, but its work could soon be halted after government prosecutors accused it of failing properly to identify itself as a “foreign agent” and alleged that its human rights centre supports extremist groups.Moscow courts are convening this week to consider liquidating Memorial after initial hearings late last month.“If it happens, it will truly be a tragedy,” said Starostin, as participants in the “topography of terror” walk peered through the gates of the run-of-the-mill Moscow house that, according to Memorial’s research, was also once a laboratory for testing lethal poisons on political prisoners.The move has triggered a public outcry, with some accusing the government of wanting to suppress the memory of Stalin-era crimes, from the Gulag labour camps to the purges and executions of the 1930s.“Memorial is being taken from me right now,” author Ludmilla Petrushevskaya wrote in an open letter. “And so is the memory of the condemned and the executed, of those who.died of hunger and those who froze to death en route from one Gulag to another.”Open letters have been signed by many others, including the widow of author Alexander Solzhenitsyn, whose novels exposed the horror of the Gulag system to the world. More than 120,000 people have supported a petition to save the group.Government prosecutors argue that Memorial on several occasions broke a law requiring it to label all of its publications and online posts as having been produced by a “foreign agent”, a designation given the group in 2016.On Tuesday — which also marks the anniversary of the death of one of Memorial’s founding members, Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei Sakharov— Russia’s Supreme Court reconvened to consider the case, which was first heard last month. After comments on the merits of the suit, the court decided to reconvene for debates on December 28.Describing the court cases against Memorial as a “criminalisation of memory”, Andrei Kolesnikov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center, said the group had become an obstacle to the mythologised retelling of Russia’s past.“History is very important to the people currently in power,” Kolesnikov said. “They don’t have many modern-day achievements to brag about, and visions of the future are pretty absent too. So the most important glue for holding everything together is history.”“And this history has to be glossy, victorious, successful. Naturally, the history of Stalinism and the purges gets in the way,” Kolesnikov said.Memorial, dubbed “Russia’s conscience” by some, has helped open monuments and museums, and has hung up hundreds of plaques in cities marking the last known addresses of Soviet political prisoners.A plaque for Kolesnikov’s grandfather, who died in a prison labour camp in 1946, was installed on a Moscow building three years ago.Memorial has also combed through archives to create searchable databases of the prison and death records of the Soviet era’s many millions of victims — but also of the names of more than 41,000 perpetrators from the NKVD secret police.Last week, the Supreme Court ruled against a historian seeking to declassify certain archived documents that would have revealed more NKVD names. Arguing in court, representatives of the FSB, the NKVD’s current iteration, said such a disclosure would jeopardise national security. The ruling was telling, said Kolesnikov, who discovered the names of his grandfather’s accusers and jailers in Memorial’s lists.At a meeting of Russia’s human rights council last week, Russian president Vladimir Putin said he respected Memorial’s activities, but added that he also understood the group to have defended terrorist groups.“Regarding the international organisations that Memorial is trying to defend, we have them on our list of terrorist and extremist organisations. This is an issue that requires additional research,” the Interfax news agency quoted Putin as saying.Memorial’s human rights centre, well-known for its work in Chechnya and other southern Russian republics, has questioned some of the cases against groups ruled as terrorist or extremist in Russia, including Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir and the Jehovah’s Witnesses. On Thursday, a Moscow city court will convene to consider whether in doing so it has broken the law.This branch of Memorial also maintains a modern-day list of political prisoners, and its numbers are now comparable to those seen in the late Soviet period, said Sergei Davidis, head of the group’s political prisoner support programme.“It is the absolute highest number in the history of modern Russia,” Davidis said.Ending the Memorial walk around central Moscow, after stops at former show trial courtrooms, execution sites, and prisons, tour guide Starostin said he believed that even if the group was shut down, the idea behind it would survive.“You can ban us and liquidate us as an organisation, but you can’t ban the idea itself — that’s the most important thing,” he said.Letter in response to this article:Solzhenitsyn provided a warning from history / From Frank Boll, Rotselaar, Belgium
170  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.Gas price rises are back and the timing couldn’t be worse for the European Commission, which is due tomorrow to make new proposals to tweak the energy market. We’ll unpack why countries are unhappy about Brussels not going far enough.Gas transit (and origin) countries including Ukraine and Azerbaijan will be represented in Brussels tomorrow by their leaders at a summit with five Eastern Partnership nations — we’ll look at the stakes and why some want to break off.And after French president Emmanuel Macron poured cold water on Polish and Hungarian hopes to see their EU recovery fund allocations any time soon, we’ll explore how the other countries are faring and what difficulties remain.A fresh surge in European gas prices comes at an awkward time for Brussels, which this week will attempt to calm panic in its member states about record energy prices, writes Mehreen Khan in Brussels.European gas futures rose 10 per cent yesterday on the back of comments from Germany’s new foreign minister about Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline not being compliant with EU law. The surge builds on steadily rising wholesale gas prices in December, accelerating a trend that has increased anxiety levels among EU governments since the autumn.The European Commission will make a legislative intervention tomorrow, unveiling draft plans to provide options for common EU gas storage capacity and shared procurement. The proposals are in direct response to concerns from southern and eastern governments that many households will struggle to foot higher energy bills this winter.Brussels’ plan will offer countries the chance to pool resources and carry out common gas purchasing and store it in shared “strategic reserves” to be tapped during emergencies, according to an EU official. Countries can voluntarily club together based on whether they share similar energy security risks, for example Denmark, Poland and Sweden, which tap gas supplies from Norway.The regional designations are an attempt to ease the fiendishly difficult task of setting up common gas storage in a bloc where energy needs and resources for expensive storage are highly divergent. Less than a dozen EU countries have strategic gas reserves, and the EU’s voluntary system will require governments to fund setting up shared capacity between themselves. Current European gas storage is running at less than two-thirds full, about 10 per cent lower than seasonal norms.The commission’s proposals will not offer sweeping changes to EU energy pricing rules, as demanded by Spain and France. Brussels has dismissed the need for a root-and-branch revamp of its energy market in response to a price surge which it said is likely to dissipate next spring.But the return of record gas prices this week will refocus attention on squeezed poorer households and embolden countries who don’t want this energy crisis to go to waste. For some member states, the crunch should force a fundamental break with Europe’s reliance on Russian gas, piling further pressure on Germany’s Nord Stream 2 involvement.For others, there’s a reason to hit the brake on the EU’s ambitious green transition. Threatening a veto over EU policy, Poland’s justice minister told the FT this week that Warsaw “should. revise its commitment to EU climate and energy policy, which results in drastic hikes of energy prices”.Omicron will become the dominant coronavirus variant in Denmark this week, epidemiologists say, driving a rise in cases to record levels and offering a warning to the rest of Europe about the more transmissible mutation.Tomorrow sees the first meeting in four years between the EU and its eastern neighbours, some of whom still aspire to join the bloc one day, writes Andy Bounds in Brussels.Charles Michel, European Council president, and commission president Ursula von der Leyen will meet the leaders of Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.Belarus, the sixth member of the Eastern Partnership, has suspended its participation in the group as relations between the dictatorship and the EU deteriorated over the migrant crisis, human rights and other issues.Armenia and Azerbaijan fought a war last year over the Armenian-controlled enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. Michel will meet the leaders of the two countries separately and then together.Ilham Aliyev, Azerbaijani president, and Nikol Pashinyan, Armenian prime minister, first met last month in Russia after an invitation by Vladimir Putin. Russia brokered the ceasefire a year ago but sporadic fighting has flared up since. EU officials said that the two countries’ army chiefs had set up a hotline on Michel’s suggestion, which had calmed tensions.The Eastern Partnership summit will see the launch of a €2.3bn regional economic investment plan funded by the EU, which aims to support post-Covid-19 recovery and accelerate green and digital infrastructure. The hope is that the plan will leverage up to €17bn in public and private investment. There is also €75m for vaccines from EU countries via the Polish Development Agency.Brussels is desperately trying to prevent the Eastern Partnership itself from fracturing, though. Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, tired of waiting for the other three to reform, have formed a trio and signed free trade agreements with the EU. Their people also benefit from visa-free travel.They want to join the bloc, which is reluctant to admit new members after disputes over migration from poorer countries and fears of adding to an “awkward squad” that includes Poland and Hungary, who chafe against many of the EU’s rules.A senior EU official said that there was still “so much runway” for countries to cover before membership talks could start that “it makes sense to keep the Eastern Partnership together.”As 2022 looms, the complex process of paying out tens of billions of euros under the EU’s recovery plan is about to shift into a high gear, writes Sam Fleming in Brussels.Yesterday evening, commissioners Valdis Dombrovskis and Paolo Gentiloni updated the European parliament on where things stand. Hungary, Poland, Sweden and Bulgaria have still not received commission approval for their plans while the Netherlands hasn’t got around to submitting a plan at all.The other 22 member states, however, have now received EU sign-off for their proposals to tuck into the €800bn NextGenerationEU programme. The commission has already forked out €52.4bn in pre-financing.The next step is for member states to sign up to monitoring arrangements and start submitting their regular payment requests — mostly at half-yearly intervals — which will be dependent on hitting pre-agreed reform milestones and targets.France and Spain have already submitted their first payment demands to Brussels. Spain’s request received a rapid approval from the commission this month because Madrid made sure it had already put in place the various reforms linked to the payment months ago. It should, accordingly, soon reap a €10bn dollop of recovery fund cash.For the rest of the member states the hoops should in theory be harder to jump through. To get their hands on the recovery fund bounty, they will have to prove to the commission that they are enacting hundreds of reform targets and milestones, all of which have been laid out in plans agreed with Brussels.If a country misses key targets, the commission can refuse to pay out some of the recovery cash. Any government that gets itself into that situation will quickly find itself in very hot political water.
171  As Christine Lagarde unveiled plans last week to redesign euro banknotes for the first time since their launch two decades ago, the European Central Bank president said they were “a tangible and visible symbol that we stand together in Europe, particularly in times of crisis”.Lagarde’s comment underlines her pride in the united approach taken by European nations and policymakers to tackle the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and — so far at least — prevent it from spiralling into a repeat of the region’s 2012 debt crisis, which threatened to tear the currency union apart.However, the hardest challenge for the ECB still lies ahead. Having overseen the biggest injection of monetary stimulus in the history of Europe’s single currency, including the €2.2tn purchase of mostly government bonds and a similar amount of heavily subsidised loans to banks, the central bank is now preparing to start scaling back its support for the economy.Most central banks have already started to withdraw the generous stimulus policies they introduced to lower borrowing costs and shield economies from the fallout of the pandemic. But the ECB — still scarred by criticism of having raised interest rates too soon in the last crisis — is more reluctant than most to wind back its support, having struggled until recently with years of uncomfortably low inflation and sluggish growth.The eurozone has the added complication that unlike the US Federal Reserve or the Bank of England, the ECB has to make policies for 19 different countries, each with its own economy and — crucially — bond market. So any shift by the ECB to a less accommodative policy risks reawakening the region’s old financial tensions by pushing up financing costs for weaker governments — in particular Italy — and stifling its nascent economic rebound.Managing the recovery phase requires a delicate balancing act by Lagarde and her fellow policymakers as they try to avoid the mistakes the ECB made when it prematurely raised interest rates in 2011 just as the region’s debt crisis was erupting.However, if the ECB waits too long to reverse its stimulus it risks losing credibility and being forced into an even more painful policy correction later on. This could happen if inflation does not fall back below the bank’s main objective of 2 per cent as fast as it expects, having already hit a new eurozone record high of 4.9 per cent in November.Most analysts expect the ECB to continue buying bonds and keep interest rates deep in negative territory at least until 2023, especially after it accepted in a strategy review that inflation could exceed its target for a period.“This is crunch time for the ECB, because if they lose patience when inflation is about to peak, they risk undermining the conclusions of their strategy review and with that, the stability of the bond market,” says Frederik Ducrozet, strategist at Pictet Wealth Management.Vítor Constâncio, a former vice-president of the ECB who is now finance professor at the University of Navarra in Madrid, says “the situation is becoming more difficult for the ECB”.He adds: “The big question is how smoothly the ECB will prepare the aftermath of the pandemic and the gradual winding down of asset purchases.”When the ECB meets on Thursday, Lagarde is expected to announce the first step in the process of slowly withdrawing its stimulus by outlining plans to end net bond purchases in March under the €1.85tn pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), which it launched when the virus hit last year.Complicating its decision is the arrival of the more infectious Omicron coronavirus variant at a time when the Covid infection rate had already risen to new highs in many parts of Europe.The return to varying levels of lockdown is expected to hit eurozone growth, which had been on track to recover from last year’s record postwar recession by the end of this year. At the same time, the latest wave of the virus is also likely to accentuate the supply chain bottlenecks that have already caused vast backlogs of containers at ports and steep increases in the prices of many goods — all of which could keep inflation higher for longer.After eurozone economic output shrank by a record 6.5 per cent last year, the EU has forecast it will increase 5 per cent this year and 4.3 per cent next year — by far the highest levels of growth since the single currency was launched over 20 years ago. Brussels also predicts inflation in the bloc will stay above the ECB’s 2 per cent target for a second consecutive year in 2022 — the first time that will have happened for a decade.The ECB is set to raise its own inflation forecasts this week, but it seems determined to avoid any sudden policy reversal. When the central bank slowed its bond purchases in September, Lagarde denied it was starting to “taper” them down to zero, echoing the late UK prime minister Margaret Thatcher by saying “the lady isn’t tapering”. This month she pledged to “ensure conditions remain favourable” for financing governments, households and firms and described the recent surge in inflation as a “hump” that would decline next year.All this means the ECB looks increasingly like a “dovish” outlier compared to many central banks. In response to a stronger surge in inflation than they expected, the Fed and BoE are this week expected to signal they will stop asset purchases and prepare to raise interest rates in the next few months. In contrast, the ECB has indicated it expects to keep buying bonds for all of next year and Lagarde said it was “highly unlikely” to start raising interest rates before 2023 at the earliest.Analysts expect the ECB to reduce the “cliff edge” in its bond-buying after the PEPP ends in March by ramping up an older quantitative easing scheme, which is still hoovering up €20bn of assets a month. It could do this by increasing monthly purchases under the older scheme to about €40bn or by adding an extra “envelope” of several hundred billion euros to spend over the rest of the year.Some ECB executives have even suggested keeping an option open to restart the PEPP or creating a new “backstop fund” to deal with any market disruption. Others stress the need for “optionality” and hope to delay some decisions on future bond purchases until February.“Given the ECB has made the mistake in the past of tightening too fast it is going to err on the side of caution this time,” says Maria Demertzis, deputy director of the think-tank Bruegel. “If they increase interest rates too fast that will create a direct threat of financial fragmentation while we are still in quite a vulnerable stage of recovery — the US and UK don’t have that concern.”Many share Demertzis’s concern about financial fragmentation, whereby the borrowing costs of weaker eurozone countries could rise much higher than those of safer ones, which stems from the fundamental weakness at the heart of the single currency: it is a monetary union without a fiscal union or a fully unified banking system.The same faultline was exposed in the region’s sovereign debt crisis when investor fears about high government debt levels and toxic bank loans pushed up borrowing costs for countries in Europe’s periphery and forced several of them to turn to the EU for bailouts, including Greece, Spain, Ireland and Portugal.“What is different for the ECB compared to the Fed and the Bank of England is that there is a risk of financial fragmentation in the eurozone,” says Spyros Andreopoulos, senior European economist at BNP Paribas who used to work on monetary policy at the ECB. “It is not democratically legitimised to share large-scale financial risks by using its balance sheet.”However, even though debt levels have again shot up to new highs across the eurozone, economists believe a similar crisis is less likely to happen this time. This is mainly because the EU now has a much more supportive fiscal position after launching a €800bn recovery fund. This innovative scheme enables Brussels to issue debt centrally and send the money to member states to boost their post-pandemic economic prospects by investing in new green energy and digital projects.“Europe has more instruments now to address a situation like the one we faced a decade ago, so it will take a much bigger asymmetric shock to cause a similar crisis,” says Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, chair of French bank Société Générale who was on the ECB executive board until 2011.When the pandemic first hit last year, Lagarde got off to a stuttering start. Asked what the central bank could do to support governments as their economies shut down in March 2020, she said it was not the ECB’s job to “close spreads” — referring to the extra interest that weaker eurozone members have to pay relative to Germany when they sell new debt.Her comment sent euro area bond markets into a tailspin. Investors suddenly doubted the ECB’s commitment to holding the eurozone together at a moment of crisis. Italy, by far the most indebted of the bloc’s big economies, bore the brunt of the bond sell-off.The episode prompted a swift rethink. Lagarde quickly rowed back from the remarks and later that month the ECB unveiled the much larger PEPP. The rearguard action calmed the markets after a few weeks of volatility, and Italy’s bond yields sank for the rest of the year.“Governments had to do massive fiscal stimulus,” says Salman Ahmed, head of strategic asset allocation at Fidelity International. “The role of the ECB was to make sure they could borrow at a rate that makes it affordable.”But this role for asset purchases, even if it was never made explicit by the ECB, raises awkward questions as the central bank plots an exit from its pandemic-era stimulus, which has led the ECB to buy more than the total net debt issued by eurozone governments for the past two years.Bond markets are already showing nerves over the prospect of life after PEPP. In recent days, the spread on Italy’s 10-year debt over that of Germany has reached its widest point in more than a year at 1.3 percentage points.Despite investors’ positive perception of the Italian government — led by former ECB president Mario Draghi — Italy’s €2.3tn bond market remains the favoured playground for investors looking to speculate on renewed fragilities in the eurozone.The biggest worry for some ECB-watchers is that Italy could be plunged back into political instability if Draghi steps up early next year to become president of Italy, which could trigger new elections that Eurosceptic rightwing parties, including Matteo Salvini’s League and the far-right Brothers of Italy, are favourites to win.“There is the possibility of a Salvini government in coalition with the Brothers of Italy next year and that could be a big problem,” warned Constâncio, who was Draghi’s deputy at the ECB for seven years until 2018. “A mild increase in government bond yields is in general acceptable,” he said. “But if peripheral spreads move a lot higher the threat of financial fragmentation will require national and European policymakers to respond.”The sheer size of Rome’s borrowing — amounting to more than 155 per cent of GDP — means a move above 2 percentage points on Italian spreads would reawaken concerns about debt sustainability, according to Ahmed. “It’s a huge credit risk without the backing of the ECB,” he says.The other problem for Lagarde is that extra bond-buying is increasingly difficult to justify with inflation running well above target. Any sign that the more conservative “hawks” are gaining the upper hand could see investors once again question the ECB president’s commitment to controlling sovereign spreads.“The market’s got into its head that it’s going to see additional purchases to replace PEPP,” says Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at BlueBay Asset Management. “If they don’t deliver that there’s a chance the spread in Italy will blow out again.”Some investors worry Lagarde lacks the determination of Draghi, who in 2011 memorably promised to do “whatever it takes” to protect the euro. “You still have that comment [by Lagarde] from March last year ringing in the back of your mind,” says Dowding. “Market participants have a long memory and still don’t trust Lagarde in the way they trusted Draghi.”The recent surge in inflation to levels not seen for more than 20 years has also fuelled rising criticism of the ECB, particularly in richer countries like Germany where its ultra-loose monetary policy has been subject to several legal challenges and suspicions it is supporting profligate southern governments at the expense of prudent northern savers.Christian Lindner, the new German finance minister, said last week the government was “sensitive to avoid a situation of fiscal dominance in the future”, referring to the fear that the ECB could be unwilling to withdraw its stimulus due to a fear of pushing up borrowing costs for heavily indebted governments. “The central bank must also be able to respond to monetary developments with its instruments,” he added.“Germans are getting increasingly nervous about rising prices,” says Klaus Adam, an economics professor at the University of Mannheim. “If inflation rates won’t ease in the next few months, as expected, the critics of ECB policy will get more vocal.”Bild Zeitung, the top-selling German tabloid newspaper, warned recently that “prices are skyrocketing, our purchasing power is melting away”, and put the blame squarely on “Madame Inflation” — a reference to Lagarde.Sentiment at the ECB also seems to be shifting against further large-scale bond buying, with Isabel Schnabel, the German board member responsible for market operations, last week arguing that it has pumped up the price of many assets, including residential housing, to dangerous levels and encouraged “excessive risk taking”. But some investors think the central bank can still keep bond yields in check without having to commit upfront to buy hundreds of billions more in assets. Christian Kopf, head of fixed income at German asset manager Union Investment, says the ECB should announce a new programme that will intervene in markets only if there is a “dislocation”. If investors think the central bank is lurking in the background they will be inclined to keep buying Italian and other lower-rated eurozone debt, doing the ECB’s heavy lifting for it. “The blanket QE approach is dying, and I think that’s a good thing,” says Kopf. “The ECB doesn’t need a permanent presence in markets, but the threat of a presence.”“We hold a couple of billion of Italian bonds, and we are long-term holders,” he said. “If I have to factor in the risk of a self-reinforcing spiral I will be less comfortable holding that debt. But if I know there’s a circuit breaker I will be a lot more comfortable.”Europe’s response to the pandemic has so far been more unified and potent than in previous crises, but the true test will be how it manages the recovery. On Thursday, the ECB will take the first tentative steps towards that objective and Lagarde will be hoping to bring investors along for the ride.
172  Hello from a train in the Lake District, avid readers. I’m on my way to Scotland to talk about schemes ensuring communities have access to cash, even as bank branches and ATM numbers dwindle (more on this in a later newsletter).As the days grow shorter and Christmas is less than a fortnight away, talk of Omicron continues to fill the air. Though we’re yet to see how heavily lockdown measures will re-emerge, I for one will be watching the fintech space to see whether we’ll have the same winners from previous rounds.In this week’s edition, asset management reporter Akila Quinio talks to the chief executive of French banking app Lydia, which reached a unicorn valuation after it closed a funding round last week.Meanwhile, I spoke to Pleo, which provides smart company cards and has secured a $4.7bn valuation after a $200m extension to their series C round.When French president Emmanuel Macron said his country should have 25 unicorns by 2025, the nation counted nine and wasn’t exactly known as a tech hub. Two years later, nine of France’s 22 private companies valued over $1bn are fintechs. Banking app Lydia joined the ranks last week after closing a $100m round.“France is a great place to build European start-ups,” said David Sainteff, partner at Global Founders Capital. Because of its “challenging” regulatory environment and competitive scene, start-ups that “reach a market-product fit despite those constraints” are often mature enough to compete on a European scale, added the backer of French digital accountancy firm Penny Lane.Ten years ago, France suffered from chronic bureaucratic syndrome. Administrative hurdles stifled innovation and entrepreneurship. Homegrown talents, despite strong maths and finance credentials, would start companies elsewhere. Eventbrite and Datadog are among the billion-dollar companies that French entrepreneurs founded in the US.The sheer perspective of “building champions” able to scale up beyond national borders “didn’t use to exist in France” said Lydia’s chief executive officer Cyril Chiche. “In fact, it existed very little in Europe outside of the UK,” he added. Chiche saw a shift take place in the last three years, as France started to attract foreign capital “in very large proportion”. China’s Tencent and US-based venture capital firm Accel are among Lydia’s investors.Capital concentration in the UK’s fintech scene meant European start-ups were slightly undervalued in comparison, making them attractive to investors. “Once they realise there are companies of this calibre, which already have users, revenues streams, and a maturity they hadn’t imagined.they realise valuations are attractive and it’s a good place to invest,” said Chiche.This year, France raised $2.4bn* in fintech fundraising rounds, overtaking Sweden as the third-hottest European destination for venture capital in the sector, after UK and the Germany.Lydia plans to add an investing arm to its banking and payments app, in a bid to become a European “super-app”. If scaling beyond borders is the next frontier for most French fintechs, the UK is not on their horizon, said Sainteff. As a “very competitive” environment, it has “well-established local players” and is seen by American companies as the “easiest gateway to Europe”. Like N26, Lydia closed its UK operation citing “local constraints”, and has instead focused on expanding in Portugal and Spain.Though Emmanuel Macron has tried to nurture the French tech spirit — his government unveiled a pandemic stimulus plan for the digital sector worth €7bn — most fintech players say the trend predates him and expect it to transcend his presidency. “You’d have to be crazy to hit the brakes now,” said Chiche. According to BPI France, French fintechs have created over 25,000 jobs and most are actively hiring.Chiche says the “tens and tens of concrete measures” implemented in the last decade helped the ecosystem flourish. He cites fiscal reforms, the creation of a public investment bank and the “bettering of relations between the tech scene and national administrations”.“Crazy puzzles” used to penalise start-ups, says Chiche, such as the now-reformed Banque de France’s solvency scoring system. Previously, it was based on profitability and size, meaning lossmaking start-ups struggled to borrow cash.“We believe that by 2025, two or three scale-ups will be on the CAC40, with probably one fintech among them,” said Paul-François Fournier, Innovation director at BPI France.But challenges remain, such as fierce global competition for talents, said Sainteff.When asked about the challenges of competing in a crowded pan-European market, Chiche said: “If we look at potential future big actors in digital banking.there are maybe 10 at most.Do you know how many banks there are in Europe? 5,073. So actually, well there is room, you know.” (Akila Quinio)Correction: France raised $2.4bn in fintech fundraising rounds this year. An earlier edition misstated the figure.Every week we ask the founders of fast-growing fintechs to introduce themselves and explain what makes them stand out in a crowded industry. Our conversation, lightly edited, appears below.I chatted with Jeppe Rindom, co-founder and chief executive of Pleo, which recently announced it had almost tripled its valuation to $4.7bn thanks to a $200m Series C extension. The Danish B2B fintech, founded in 2015, provides smart company cards and expense management, and operates across six markets including Denmark, Sweden and the UK. The latest round, led by Coatue Management with Alkeon Capital, brings the total Pleo has raised to $350m, with existing investors including Bain Capital Ventures and Thrive Capital.What does the fundraising and valuation reflect about the current state of the market, and what are your expansion plans? I think it starts with a very consistent recognition that we are tapping into a massive market and we have a solution which is the easiest to use, with very high satisfaction and a strong business model. We now have 20,000 customers, which is a good proof point but also a recognition that the market is extremely immature, there’s so more to do. In terms of expansion plans, we’re very ambitious about Europe and will be more or less present in all European countries by the end of the year, and [we are] planning a launch in a new continent.Who are your main competitors? You could say the real competition out there is Excel, emails, Google Docs, stuff like that. And then you have some more legacy payment cards and software, such as a card issued by Deutsche Bank or Barclays. In terms of Europe we see Spendesk, which has maybe 3,000 or 5,000 customers [Spendesk lists more than 3,500 users], so it’s a fraction of the market, but obviously we respect and follow them.What trends have you noticed during the pandemic? We’ve been bouncing back really solidly during the pandemic because customers and organisations are just getting used to working in a more distributed fashion, of course, and increasingly investing in tools that can set up workflows for success. This is very relevant because before you relied on going to a manager and borrowing or a card, or your relied on going to an IT department, and you can’t really do that any more.I think the second major trend is just about respecting your employees a bit more and caring a lot about their employee experience. It’s very competitive in talent management these days. Having a good experience for your employees is important, and you need to respect their time so you have to give them tools which are intuitive.Is the shift to decentralised working a permanent change? I think that way of working is going to be sustained, but no doubt it is not the only use case for our technology. It’s also for travelling or those who need to manage a budget from the office, looking after subscriptions and different software tools. The working from home use case is trending right now, but before the pandemic, the traveller being out and about was the biggest use case.UK spy chief talks risks of Chinese digital money Sir Jeremy Fleming, head of UK intelligence agency GCHQ, told Roula Khalaf and Helen Warrell that China’s digital renminbi poses risks to British sovereignty. Beijing is increasing efforts to rollout the digital currency, which provides it with vast amounts of data about transactions, ahead of the Winter Olympics.Nubank shares leap in New York debut Brazilian fintech Nubank became the most valuable financial group in Latin America when it started trading last Thursday, with an eye-watering valuation of close to $50bn, write Michael Pooler and Nicholas Megaw. Investors in the company, which offers a range of services including savings accounts and business loans, include Warren Buffett, Tencent and SoftBank.Monzo triples its valuation Stephen Morris and I got the exclusive on the coral-pink neobank’s $500m-plus fundraise, pushing its valuation to $4.5bn despite a bruising start to the pandemic. Monzo is continuing to look at new avenues, with its buy now, pay later product in beta and with the idea of cryptocurrency trading potentially being considered.
173  The writer is author of ‘People Power: Why We Need More Migrants’A striking feature of the raucous debate over migrants and refugees in the English Channel or at Poland’s border with Belarus is the unchallenged premise that migration is to be resisted, or at best kept to a trickle.The upshot is policies that are harmful to the future of Britain and Europe. The next 25 years will see 33m people retiring with no replacements, thus shrinking the combined UK and EU workforces from 240m to 207m. It would be naive to think migrants can step straight into their shoes, but clearly a massive rethink is needed about the value to Europe of more newcomers.Advocates of a more open approach to legal migration have so far made little dent in public opinion. And very few politicians challenge the idea that people fleeing from conflict or poverty should be limited, if not actively discouraged. By the same token, few commentators question the idea that “political” refugees deserve more favourable treatment than “economic” migrants.The blanket prejudice is that all newcomers from Africa, the Middle East and now Afghanistan are a burden on host countries. But researchers have for some years been looking hard at the economic balance sheets of immigration to a number of countries, and overall have found it positive.The moral case for offering a safe haven to the persecuted and poverty-stricken is undeniable. But apart from occasional flurries of sympathy and regret, humanitarian arguments win little enduring support. The economic facts of life should therefore be hammered home by policymakers and politicians.Migrants usually create far more wealth abroad than if they’d stayed home. When the mass exodus from Syria and its neighbours sparked Europe’s “migrant crisis” in 2015, a study reported that migrants’ worldwide economic contribution was $6.7tn, about 40 per cent more than their likely domestic value. Although only 3.4 per cent of the global population, they accounted for 9.4 per cent of its gross domestic product.The UK’s Brexit referendum in 2016 may have been determined by hostility to immigration but, prior to it, Britain was enjoying the fruits of a relatively relaxed attitude to migrant workers. One academic study looked into migrants’ economic value and found that the taxes paid by workers who had come from elsewhere easily outweighed their social and health costs, amounting to a £25bn bonus for 2001-11.It’s much the same story throughout Europe; migrant labour is filling job vacancies and making substantial economic contributions. Yet mainstream politicians so dread populists’ ability to exploit anti-migrant sentiment that they hesitate to call for more balanced discussions of immigration.Europe badly needs a more progressive approach to immigration. The doubling of the Arab and African populations by mid-century will greatly intensify “push” pressures, so the recent €500m boost to the EU’s Frontex border force’s yearly “fortress Europe” budget is doomed to inadequacy.EU governments have generally resisted proposals for a fresh approach to legal migration. The European Commission is fine-tuning a “new pact on migration and asylum” to be unveiled next year, but the indications are that it won’t do much more than put an EU label on a framework that allows member states to operate competing national systems.Paris and London would do themselves and the rest of Europe a great service if they abandoned their unseemly blame game over people trafficking and illegal channel crossings and instead focused on the need for more migrants, not fewer. The ageing and shrinking of Europe is a structural problem that won’t go away.Letter in response to this article:Innovative ideas are needed on immigration / From Roderick Wallace, Beckenham, England BR3
174  A former Danish minister who was responsible for some of the Scandinavian country’s toughest policies on immigration has been sentenced to 60 days in jail by an impeachment court.Inger Stojberg, immigration minister from 2015 until 2019 in the country’s previous centre-right government, was on Monday found guilty of breaching her duties by illegally separating refugee couples in asylum centres, just one of a series of hardline measures she enacted.Stojberg, who is being courted by the nationalist Danish People’s party as a possible future leader, became infamous internationally when she marked the introduction of her 50th restrictive immigration measure with a celebratory cake.She was behind a law that allowed police to strip refugees of jewellery and cash as well as tightening reunification rules and falsely claiming that a Danish kindergarten had banned children from having pork products in their lunch boxes.Her impeachment trial — the first in Denmark for 30 years — centred on the forced separation of teenage refugee couples in asylum centres, which was later ruled to be unlawful despite Stojberg arguing that she was trying to protect girls from forced marriages. In total, 18 couples were forcibly separated with at least three cases ruled to be illegal by the impeachment court.“Danish values lost today, not just me,” said a visibly shocked Stojberg on Monday after the judgment. “I take my punishment, and I do it holding my head high,” she added.One of the most controversial politicians in Denmark, Stojberg resigned from the Liberal party in February after falling out with the party’s leadership, and now sits in parliament as an independent.The DPP is trying to woo Stojberg to become its next leader and arrest its decline after the ruling centre-left Social Democrats became significantly more anti-immigration through anti-ghetto laws and becoming the first European government to deem Syria safe enough to return refugees.The immigration debate has become increasingly bitter on both sides of the political spectrum in Denmark in the two decades since the DPP first backed a centre-right government in Copenhagen.Morten Messerschmidt, deputy chair of the DPP who was in August given a six-month prison sentence for misusing EU funds — which he is appealing against — said he was shaken by the verdict. But he added that he did not think parliament should strip Stojberg of her right to sit as an MP, something that could complicate any attempt to make her leader of the DPP.The verdict is final and cannot be appealed, but parliament will now decide whether Stojberg is “unworthy” to sit as an MP, a fate only accorded four times previously in Denmark.
175  Turkey’s lira fell to a record low, breaching 14 to the dollar, as investors braced themselves for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pushing on with another interest rate cut later this week despite intense inflation.The currency, which has fallen about 40 per cent since the central bank embarked on a rate-cutting cycle under Erdogan’s orders in September, on Monday crossed a threshold that authorities had previously appeared reluctant to tolerate.The lira tumbled as much as 5 per cent to 14.62 against the dollar in London dealings on Monday, before recovering to about TL14. The currency started 2021 at roughly TL7.The renewed selling came after Erdogan’s increasingly unorthodox approach to running Turkey’s $795bn economy led the rating agency S&P to downgrade its outlook on the country to negative at the end of last week, meaning that its rating of Turkish sovereign debt could be cut deeper into junk territory.“The negative outlook reflects what we view to be rising risks to Turkey’s externally leveraged economy over the next 12 months from extreme currency volatility and rising inflation, amid mixed policy signals,” S&P said.Erdogan, a staunch opponent of high interest rates, has declared in recent weeks that he is seeking to implement a new economic model for his nation of 83m people.By cutting rates, he argues, the country will benefit from a competitive currency that will boost exports, attract foreign direct investment and create employment.Economists warn that it will come at the cost of exacerbating inflation that was already growing at an annual rate of 21 per cent last month, according to official data, and hitting living standards.It also risks financial instability in a country that is heavily reliant on foreign financing to keep its economy afloat.The US investment bank Goldman Sachs said the need to raise — rather than cut — interest rates was “even more acute” this month as it argued that the current approach was “not sustainable”.“Nevertheless, the authorities appear committed to maintaining a low rate policy,” it added.The consensus expectation among analysts is that the central bank will cut its benchmark lending rate by 1 percentage point to 14 per cent on Thursday.Still, the central bank’s decision this month to resume a policy of seeking to defend the lira has led some analysts to question whether Erdogan may be reaching the limits of his tolerance to currency weakness — and whether he may instead allow a pause in the rate-cutting cycle.On Monday, Turkey’s central bank announced it had intervened in the currency market for the fourth time so far in December. The bank had sold an estimated $2bn to $3bn on the three earlier occasions, according to Barclays. The UK-based bank said there were “large uncertainties” around this week’s rates decision and those in the months ahead.Yet one senior Turkish official offered a signal that Ankara was committed to ploughing ahead with its contentious approach.The new finance minister, Nureddin Nebati, told business representatives in a closed-door meeting last week that there would be “no turning back” from the policy of rate cuts, according to an article published on Sunday by the columnist Abdulkadir Selvi, who is seen as close to the government.Nebati, who was appointed by Erdogan two weeks ago after his predecessor resigned, reportedly said that the authorities were not willing to allow Turkey to enter an “interest rate spiral”.
176  For decades, American military planning was based on the idea that the US should be able to fight two wars, in different parts of the world, simultaneously. But even the gloomiest strategists did not plan for three wars at the same time.The administration of Joe Biden, however, is currently facing militarised crises in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Collectively, they amount to the biggest challenge to America’s global power since the end of the cold war.American officials have briefed that Russia is planning an invasion of Ukraine “as soon as early 2022.” Meanwhile, Lloyd Austin, America’s defence secretary, has warned that China’s military manoeuvres near Taiwan look like rehearsals for a full-scale invasion. Iran may also be weeks away from creating enough fissile material to manufacture a nuclear weapon — an outcome the US has spent decades trying to stop.Some analysts worry America may now be facing a co-ordinated global assault by revisionist powers. Carl Bildt, former prime minister of Sweden and international diplomat, warns that policymakers should contemplate the possibility of simultaneous invasions of Taiwan and Ukraine. “Taken together, these two acts of conquest would fundamentally shift the global balance of power”, he says, sounding the death knell for a world order that has “underpinned global peace for decades”.It seems unlikely that Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin are talking directly about co-ordinated military action. The idea of a three-way conference call, involving Ebrahim Raisi, the president of Iran, spirals off into the realms of pulp fiction.But while there is no single plan linking the ambitions of Beijing, Moscow and Tehran, there is a degree of shared analysis and watchfulness. The governments of China, Russia and Iran all complain that they have been targeted for “regime change” by Washington. They all have ambitions to dominate their regions. And they all justify their ambitions by claiming kinship with peoples beyond their national boundaries.The Xi government insists it is China’s national destiny to “reunify” the motherland by absorbing Taiwan. Putin argues that a “genocide” is being committed against Russian speakers in Ukraine and that it is Moscow’s duty to protect them. The Iranian government claims to be the protector of Islam across the world and has used Shia Muslims, beyond its borders, as proxy warriors.After the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan over the summer, America is looking weak. That increases the temptation for Russia, China and Iran to try to redress old grievances, or push forward with long-held ambitions.The revisionist powers in Asia, Europe and the Middle East will each be watching developments on other continents. Unopposed attacks on Ukraine or Taiwan would signal the fundamental shift in global power that Bildt and others worry about. But US power and credibility could also decline through a series of less spectacular accommodations that collectively signal that America is backing down.There is already alarm in parts of Europe at the Biden administration’s talk of reaching a new security “accommodation” with Russia in Europe. If the US gives ground in the face of Russian threats to Ukraine, China may be encouraged to ramp up its intimidation of Taiwan and Iran may step on the nuclear accelerator. America’s allies, crucial to Washington’s global reach, may also lose heart and start to peel off.The White House is alert to these dangers. It knows it must pick its battles — or risk becoming dangerously overcommitted. A strong US stand in Europe, Asia or the Middle East could help to restore American deterrence across the world. But where, if anywhere, should America flex its muscles?The scale of the threat points to China. The scale of the provocation points to Russia. The smaller scale of risk points to Iran — which is (so far) a non-nuclear power. In strategic terms, the Biden administration’s instinct is to concentrate on China as the only plausible challenger to America’s role as the world’s sole superpower. Biden has suggested that the US would defend Taiwan, if it is attacked — but has not made similar comments about Ukraine.However, most US analysts still think an attack on Taiwan is unlikely in 2022 — since Xi needs stability, as he prepares to cement his power at a vital Communist party congress next autumn. Russia’s threats to Ukraine are on a shorter fuse. But direct conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia remains close to unthinkable. Instead, Biden has threatened massive economic sanctions and military aid to Ukraine, in the event of a Russian attack. Air-raids on Iranian nuclear facilities looks less dangerous than tangling with Russian or Chinese forces. But Biden, like Barack Obama and Donald Trump before him, is reluctant to get involved in another war in the Middle East.The Biden administration will not explicitly take the military option off the table in any of these three conflicts. But the US is most likely to rely on economic and diplomatic weapons. The kind of stringent US economic sanctions already deployed against Iran could be used against Russia or China — in the event of attacks on Ukraine or Taiwan.That would not mean the beginning of world war three. But it might mean the end of globalisation.
177  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
178  European gas futures surged 11 per cent on Monday after German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said the Nord Stream 2 pipeline could not be permitted in its current form because it did not comply with EU law.Speaking on ZDF TV late on Sunday evening, Baerbock said the three parties that make up the new German government — Social Democrats, Greens and Free Democrats — had agreed that all energy projects, including Nord Stream 2, must be in accordance with EU energy legislation.“And that means that, as things stand at the moment, this pipeline can’t be approved because it does not fulfil the requirements of European energy law,” she said.The situation on the Ukrainian border, where Russia has amassed an estimated 100,000 troops, was “also a factor”, Baerbock said. “The last government discussed with the Americans that if there are further escalations this pipeline can’t come on line,” she added.The pipeline was top of the list when US officials considered potential sanctions that western countries could threaten against Russia.Baerbock’s comments suggest that Germany’s position on Nord Stream 2 could harden now that the Greens, who have long opposed the project, are in charge of the foreign ministry. However, the Social Democrats, the party of Chancellor Olaf Scholz, have traditionally supported the pipeline.Nord Stream 2, which is complete but has not yet been permitted to begin operations, will double the capacity of undersea routes from Russia to Europe. US and European critics of the project say it will increase the EU’s dependence on Russian energy exports and allow the Kremlin to put pressure on Ukraine, which will be denied lucrative gas transit fees if the pipeline goes ahead.European natural gas futures rose to their highest levels since early October. The European gas benchmark for delivery in January jumped as much as 11 per cent on Monday to a high of €117.25 per megawatt-hour, up from €105.35 on Friday and just under the record high of €117.50/MWh in October.Spells of cold weather and stable but weak flows from Russia to western Europe have resulted in an accelerated drawdown of gas stocks. Across Europe, gas storage facilities are now just 62.8 per cent full, more than 10 per cent below seasonal norms. If the drawdowns continue at current rates, storage levels will reach critically low levels by March/April next year. Analysts say there is no obvious reprieve for Europe’s gas market outside of a mild winter.Nord Stream 2 can only go into operation once it has been approved by Germany’s regulator, the Bundesnetzagentur, or Federal Network Agency, and the European Commission.But in mid-November the Bundesnetzagentur suspended the certification process, citing non-compliance with the EU’s gas directive. This has strict rules about “unbundling”, which dictate that companies producing, transporting and distributing gas within the EU must be separate entities.The Bundesnetzagentur said it could only approve the pipeline if the operator was “organised according to German law”. Nord Stream 2 will seek to comply with the requirement by setting up a subsidiary based in Germany that will own and operate the part of the pipeline running across German territory.Asked on Monday morning why Nord Stream 2 in its current form was non-compliant with EU law, Baerbock pointed to the decision of the Bundesnetzagentur to suspend the certification process, “because there are clear requirements under EU energy law regarding unbundling”.Nord Stream 2 AG, the operator of the pipeline, and Gazprom, which supplies the gas that will flow through it, both declined to comment.When asked for his response to Baerbock’s comments, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said the pipeline company “is working with the regulator and fulfilling all its demands. We just need to be a bit more patient.”“This is technical, bureaucratic and legal work. So it’s still going on, let’s not get ahead of ourselves,” he said, according to Interfax.Additional reporting by Nastassia Astrasheuskaya in Moscow and Neil Hume in LondonThis article has been updated since original publication to reflect that the European gas benchmark price was for delivery in January, not December
179  France has named agriculture traders Bunge and Cargill as the leading importers of soyabeans from areas at risk of deforestation, one of the main contributors to global warming.The companies have been identified as the French government tries to clean up the country’s agriculture supply chains with the launch of an online database that tracks soyabean exports from Brazil to France.The database shows about a quarter of Brazilian exports of soyabeans to France in 2018 came from areas hit by deforestation.Brazil is the world’s biggest producer of the legume, which is mainly used as livestock feed and oil. Its production has been one of the causes of deforestation of tropical rainforest over several decades.The Amazon and Brazilian savannahs are critical buffers against climate change, acting as giant stores of carbon. In the year to July, the rate of deforestation of the Amazon was the highest in 15 years, according to official Brazilian data.The online database, which was launched by the French ecological transition ministry with the help of supply chain transparency group Trase and environmental NGO Canopee, highlights the role of the world’s largest agricultural traders in handling commodities potentially linked to deforestation.It showed Bunge accounted for 70 per cent of cargoes, where soyabeans came from areas threatened by the high risk of deforestation, while Cargill accounted for almost 10 per cent.Bunge said it was committed to reaching deforestation-free supply chains by 2025 and had already removed some farmers linked to deforested land from its supply chain.Cargill said the platform’s data did not reflect French imports, adding that it was committed to eliminating deforestation in the shortest time possible, but that there was no single solution to the issue.The French government said traders and other businesses were invited to share their data to improve the quality of the analysis.Nico Muzi, at environmental campaign group Mighty Earth, said traders dictated the conditions of the global soya market, and could make material changes if they felt under pressure.Some 411,000 tonnes out of 1.57m of soyabeans, or products made from it, exported from Brazil to France in 2018, were associated with high deforestation risk, according to the French website.France imports about 3m tonnes of soya meal, or about 17 per cent of the EU total a year, according to the government’s ministry of ecological transition. “Monitoring the flow of these imports that present a risk to the forests.will help with supply chain risk,” it said.The release of the online database comes soon after a global commitment to halt the destruction of the world’s forests at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.The EU also published draft regulation that would force companies to prove that products they sold into the bloc did not contribute to legal or illegal deforestation or forest degradation.However, the figures on the French website did not prove that the soyabeans were grown in deforested areas, said the ecology ministry, adding it would contact traders about deforestation risk in their supply chains.French supermarket group Carrefour, a member of the government working group that helped develop the platform, said it would use the data to eliminate soya livestock feed linked to deforestation from its supply chains by 2025.The group, along with other leading French retailers, last year signed a soya manifesto to tackle deforestation and destruction of savannahs. Retailers and food companies in the UK have followed, signing a similar manifesto in November.
180  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.The last week at full intensity before the winter holidays is kicking off today with a gathering of foreign ministers under pressure from the US to agree sanctions aimed at deterring Russia from invading Ukraine.EU leaders meeting in Brussels on Thursday for their last summit of the year are then expected to discuss the options. More on this later.On the rule of law front, German chancellor Olaf Scholz yesterday told reporters in Warsaw he hoped Poland and the EU would find a solution to their current stand-off.More conciliatory tones are expected also from French president Emmanuel Macron, who is visiting Budapest today and will join the Visegrad leaders’ group, with Poland’s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki included).Our main item today will look at a budding discussion about the possibility of a sequel to the bloc’s unprecedented €800bn post-pandemic recovery plan — to fund the EU’s green transition.While the landmark NextGenerationEU recovery fund was formally designed to be a one-off, advocates have always quietly hoped it will provide a Rubicon-crossing precedent for more common borrowing in the future, writes Sam Fleming in Brussels.Now those voices are growing louder.At an FT conference last week, Paolo Gentiloni, the economics commissioner, argued that if the recovery fund succeeds it can serve as a template for new investment vehicles supporting EU priorities.One such idea was a green investment fund, he said — a concept that was also floated by the IMF in its recent Article IV statement on the euro area economy. “It’s one of the possible ways to address a problem which we all recognise — how do we keep a decent and possibly strong ratio of public investment to GDP?” said Gentiloni.The commission has estimated that green investments will require an extra €520bn a year for the next decade — although admittedly the bulk of that will need to come from the private sector.NextGenerationEU remains a one-off programme, Gentiloni said. However if it is a success, “you will have the basis to use these methodologies for other purposes and other goals”. If it’s not a success, he added drily, “we will have a problem”. Macron hinted at similar ideas last week as he met Scholz in Paris, suggesting the EU should be willing to come up with innovative financing ideas — just as the union did when it hatched up the recovery fund in 2020.There are other ways of achieving the goal of supporting investment, Gentiloni added, pointing to the current consultation over reforms of the EU’s Stability and Growth Pact. One change would be to reform these budget rules to incentivise “strategic investments” — something southern European countries have long advocated.This concept of a so-called green golden rule, backed by the Bruegel think-tank among others, is viewed sceptically in fiscally conservative states such as the Netherlands.In a letter sent to the Dutch parliament on Friday, finance minister Wopke Hoekstra pointed to commission staff working papers that have found that golden rules don’t necessarily incentivise public investment but instead add to overall complexity.The Dutch letter favours simplification of the SGP and more rigorous enforcement — focused especially on countries with very high debts. One way of achieving that would be to prioritise public spending growth. The speed limit for this would depend on the country’s potential economic growth and level of debt.Debt control, rather than deficit control, would become the primary objective of the budget rules, Hoekstra argues.The letter points the way to tough battles ahead between frugal northern states and southern capitals, which will be seeking more accommodating fiscal rules as well as reruns of the NextGenerationEU experiment in joint debt issuance. Common ground will not be easy to find.Supply chain disruptions wrought by the pandemic have led to several nations, including France, to seek “national economic resilience” and “reshoring” of critical manufactured goods — ranging from medicines to semiconductors and textiles. (More here)“So I would love to say that [they are] going to meet and sort out all the world’s problems,” said one EU diplomat of today’s meeting of bloc foreign ministers. Their tongue was firmly in their cheek, but the best jokes are a little bit true, writes Henry Foy in Brussels.Six weeks on from the first US intelligence reports shared with EU states, four weeks after Macron vowed to defend the country from attack and a week after the US called on Brussels to support robust sanctions against Moscow, the EU is still yet to decide on how to respond — beyond promising to do so.There are multiple reasons for this. Some officials think that the bloc should be “cautious” about threatening Moscow with tough sanctions for fear of how the Kremlin could react. Some bemoan the EU’s need to find unanimity among 27 states. Others point to the reality that the EU’s big three member states are also the ones who stand to lose the most economically from tougher sanctions on Russia.Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraine’s defence minister, yesterday criticised Berlin for vetoing Nato weapons shipments to Kyiv, telling the FT: “They are still building the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and at the same time blocking our defensive weapons. It is very unfair.”At a meeting in Liverpool this weekend, G7 foreign ministers warned of “massive consequences and severe cost” if Russia increased its military aggression against Ukraine. The EU’s high representative for foreign affairs and security, Josep Borrell, in bilateral meetings with his British and US counterparts, discussed co-ordinated actions.With US sanctions proposals already circulating, Brussels has some catching up to do. Three EU officials told Europe Express that the most likely course of action would be a broad discussion on sanctions at this week’s summit of EU leaders, with the expectation of them agreeing to instruct commission experts to draw up a list of specific measures.But, as one senior EU official put it: “A deterrent is only as useful as you can credibly make it true.”Scholz, Germany’s new chancellor and Morawiecki, his Polish counterpart, made an effort to find common ground when they faced the press yesterday after their first meeting, writes James Shotter in Warsaw.The new German leader expressed hope for a “pragmatic solution” to Poland’s long-running feud with Brussels over the rule of law — which has held up the approval of Warsaw’s request for billions of euros in pandemic recovery funding.While agreeing on topics such as Belarus’s orchestration of a migrant crisis on Poland’s eastern border, the two leaders also clearly disagreed in a number of other areas.The most prominent remains the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will ferry gas directly from Russia to Germany, and is fiercely opposed by Poland.Morawiecki reiterated Poland’s concerns, warning that it would undermine Ukrainian and EU energy security. Scholz expressed his commitment to protecting Ukraine’s role as a transit route for Russian gas to Europe.There was also disagreement over the future of the EU, and the two countries’ history. Asked about the German coalition agreement, which includes a reference to working towards a European federal state, Morawiecki said ideas of centralisation were “utopian”, and therefore “dangerous”, and stressed the importance of nation states.Morawiecki said that they had also discussed the topic of compensation for the suffering Germany inflicted on Poland during the second world war. Germany regards the matter as legally settled — a position Scholz maintained yesterdayand later this week
181  Qatar has not gone far enough in improving the working conditions for migrant workers in the country ahead of next year’s Fifa World Cup, a senior EU official has warned, complaining of persistent concerns about workplace accidents.Nicolas Schmit, EU commissioner for jobs and social rights, said he met Ali bin Samikh Al Marri, Qatar’s labour minister, earlier this month to discuss the measures the Gulf state has been taking to reform its labour markets, and that he had warned that working conditions remained a concern for the EU.“He said to me that they had made some progress, that they had adopted ILO [International Labour Organization] conventions,” said Schmit. “I acknowledged that, and I said that I was still worried by the accidents which continue to occur — that health and safety and fair treatment for workers are for the European Union essential.”Qatar has been criticised by Amnesty International and other campaign organisations over the working conditions of the mainly south Asian construction workers in the gas-rich state. Their criticisms focus on conditions at construction sites including the Khalifa stadium in Doha, and on Qatar’s response, including how the authorities investigate deaths.Qatar has a migrant workforce of about 2.1m, over 90 per cent of the country’s working population. An ILO report on Qatar last month found that there had been 50 fatal occupational injuries in 2020 and 506 severe injuries.The ILO called for improvements in the country’s statistics on occupational health and also a review of the way deaths of seemingly healthy young workers from “natural causes” were investigated.In a separate interview in Brussels, Al Marri defended his government’s record, describing some media reports on death rates in the emirate as amounting to the “demonisation” of Qatar.He cited a number of recent reforms introduced by Qatar, including the abolition of its system of “kafala”, in which employers acted as “sponsor” and had the power to deport workers and give permission for an expatriate to leave the country.They had also removed the requirement for most workers to obtain exit permits, tightened rules on working hours to reduce the risk of heat stress and introduced a minimum wage, he said, insisting there had been a significant decrease in work-related accidents in the country.“This development in the field of workers’ rights will not stop with the World Cup — it will go beyond the World Cup,” he added.Amnesty International in a report last month acknowledged the kafala reforms as “an important step forward”, but said in reality “problematic elements remain”, including employers controlling workers’ legal status and other retaliatory measures used by abusive employers.And while embassies and advocates agreed that it is easier for workers to leave the country since exit permits were removed two years ago, they said some migrant workers, especially domestic staff, continued to face hurdles, such as employers filing spurious legal claims and the confiscation of passports, the report said.“Some of the reforms have undoubtedly been positive, but the significant structural changes just started too late — 10 years after winning the World Cup — so it is unsurprising that implementation has, at best, been not good. It is still a nightmare for workers to leave their jobs, so the extent to which these changes have yet changed their lives for the better is extremely contested,” said James Lynch, a founding director of FairSquare, a human rights group.“There is also a lack of political will, with the business community in Qatar pushing back against labour mobility — so the big question is what will this issue look like once the spotlight of the World Cup fades away.”Schmit acknowledged some progress, including the abolition of the previous system of “total control of immigrant workers”. But he warned: “There is a problem of accidents and health and safety for these workers and working conditions.”The commissioner also said the level of the minimum wage introduced by the country, at QR1,000 ($275) a month, plus additional support for accommodation and food, seemed to him to be “very low”.Letter in response to this article:Qatar’s labour reforms will outlast the World Cup / From Ali bin Samikh Al Marri, Qatari Minister of Labour, Doha, Qatar
182  This article is part of a guide to Paris from FT GlobetrotterParis’s Right Bank is having a moment. Not that it is ever really not having one, but there is definitely a boom in the air. This year has seen the opening of three much-heralded luxury hotels in the golden Haussmannian real estate of the 1st and 8th arrondissements. Bernard Arnault’s €750m transformation of the Samaritaine department store into the Cheval Blanc hotel was unveiled in September, while a month later Madame Rêve, a new hotel in Paris’s legendary former 24-hour post office, opened its doors. So far, so français. But the beginning of this month saw the unveiling of something rather different — an injection of Roman high life on the Avenue Georges V in the form of the new Bulgari Hotel Paris.Roughly equidistant between the Champs Elysées and the Pont de l’Alma, the hotel occupies a prized corner of Georges V with the Rue Pierre Charron. Before the building’s six-year Italian facelift, it was an unattractive 1970s office block — but one that the hotel’s architect designers Antonio Citterio and Patricia Viel nevertheless found to have a certain aesthetic potential. It has been spruced up to become an imposing 11-floor neo-Palladian vision of clean vertical lines and honeyed ashlar masonry — similar in style to the nearby Trocadéro, but also to Bulgari’s existing hotels in Milan, London, Dubai, Bali, Beijing and Shanghai.The word “craftsmanship” is one that is bandied around liberally when it comes to luxury, but in Bulgari’s case, with justification. The brand, which began as a small jewellery emporium on Rome’s Via Sistina in 1884 and is now part of LVMH, has over the decades become synonymous with ultra-high-end opulence thanks to its, well, craftsmanship. This spills over into its hotels. “We treat each opening as if we are launching a jewellery collection,” Silvio Ursini, the group executive vice-president, told me over strong Italian coffee on my visit to the hotel pre-opening.The second you enter the Paris hotel, you step on a marble and granite eight-pointed star design — inspired, I learnt, by the one in Rome’s Piazza del Campidoglio. Bulgari takes heritage seriously. This is not just any old Carrara marble, but Breccia Medicea marble — the ultra-veiny marble of choice for the Medicis. The theme continues: the Murano glass chandeliers are from Barovier & Toso, who have been blowing glass since 1295. The pretty scalloped mosaic pattern in the glorious vitality pool — itself a homage to Rome’s bathing tradition — is copied from the Caracalla baths, which Bulgari helped restore (and which is also mirrored in its Divas’ Dream jewellery collection). But this is more than just a slab of Italian marble plonked incongruously on the Avenue Georges V — it is a carefully curated Franco-Italian crossbreed. So while the floors of the hotel are black granite, the rugs in the rooms have a herringbone design, a nod to the parquetry of Haussmannian Paris. The menu in the excellent in-house Il Ristorante, overseen by three-Michelin-starred chef Niko Romito, may be largely Italian, with an emphasis on light, fresh cooking, but you can still order a blanquette de veau, albeit only on room service.Paris is the latest stop for the Roman fine-jewellery and luxury-goods house’s hotel expansion, which will see new properties open in Moscow, Rome, Tokyo, Miami and Los Angeles over the next few years. It took eight years to find the perfect spot for the Paris hotel; it needed to be in proximity to the city’s two standalone Bulgari stores — the accessories outlet on the Champs Elysées, and the marble-hewn flagship at No 23 Place Vendôme. As Jean-Christophe Babin, Bulgari’s group CEO, told me: “Place Vendôme is the high-jewellery centre of Paris, and therefore of the world!” There are currently 12 luxury hotels in Paris that have been awarded the much-coveted “Palace” status. Any new five-star hotel has to prove its exceptionality before even being considered. But this is apparently not the principal drive for Bulgari. “Our intention was never to compete with the grand hotels,” Ursini explained. “We hope our more intimate size [76 rooms and suites] will underline the difference. There’s more of a clubby feel.”Ursini hopes the hotel will become popular with locals. I suspect the bar, with its glossy lacquered walls and fortifying Negronis, will soon be a sweet spot for a smart rive droite crowd. With no meeting or conference rooms, this is not a hotel for business travellers, Ursini asserts. It is designed for the hybrid traveller “who blurs the lines” and might take a meeting in the Mad Men-esque lounge before going to a museum or buying some wine. Or some jewellery, perhaps, even from the on-site boutique.Many guests, I suspect, will find it hard to leave the hotel. My room, a spacious 42 sq m, overlooked the Avenue, the Eiffel tower just visible from one corner, glinting behind the spire of the American Cathedral of the Holy Trinity. The decor is pared back for maximum restfulness, but there are playful treats aplenty: a minibar hidden inside an oversized tweed travelling trunk, a dressing table worthy of Sophia Loren (who coincidentally took up residence on the Avenue Georges V in the 1960s) and, best of all, an all-singing, all-dancing padded iPad that allows you to control your entire in-room experience without leaving your bed. Lose it under the high-thread-count covers and you will have to actually get up to turn the TV on, order (an eye-wateringly expensive yet extraordinary) breakfast or communicate with the concierge. Hotel tech has come a long way; it works so well I didn’t bother reaching for my phone — I was having too much fun with my new friend.Dragging myself away from the cashmere blanket, leather-clad coffee machine and exciting Bulgari bath products on a chilly late November day was hard, but with all of the eighth arrondissement at my feet I had another espresso and hit the Champs Elysées. This feted area of Paris has so much more to it than shopping and, determined to cram as much in into one day as I could, I swerved the boutiques and their desultory queues of bone-cold tourists and headed to the queue-free Arc de Triomphe instead. Despite multiple trips up the Eiffel Tower and the Tour Montparnasse, I had never mounted this great monument to those who have fought and died in the name of la patrie.With its never-ending flame burning below for the Unknown Soldier, and a video exhibition about the late artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s 60-year project to wrap up the arch, there was plenty to keep me occupied for a contemplative hour without venturing on to the parapet. But once up there, the panoramic wind-whipped views of the grisaille cityscape — with those 12 avenues radiating outwards in another great multi-pointed star — reminded me that Paris is at its moody best when the buildings are the same hue as the sky.After this, I was in need of sustenance and so headed into the bowels of the Musée d’Art Moderne to Forest, a trendy new eatery that puts “plants in the middle of the plate”. This is about as far from Brasserie Lipp as you can imagine: the vegetable-celebrating menu is printed on textured handmade paper; concrete walls are alive with real branches lit up with colourful lights; and the clientele is a largely female arty crowd. I had a menu fixe of parsnip soup (very hard to find in France, my friend who joined me exclaimed in delight), a vegetarian bruschetta and coffee. We deliberately left room for a visit to a nearby branch of Cyril Lignac, pâtisserie king of Paris. There was a ligne, bien sûr, but the sight of an unctuous royal au chocolat in the window spurred us on.Diagonally opposite is the Palais Galliera, Paris’s museum of fashion history, currently showing Vogue Paris, 1920-2020. Snaffling our patisseries beforehand in very un-Vogue-like fashion, we spent a glorious hour studying a room plastered with magazine covers, from the very first issues with their elegant art deco illustrations to the gender-fluid present day, via the 1960s when Catherine Deneuve seemed to grace every cover. This was the perfect exhibition — satisfying yet small.On the way back to the hotel, we marvelled at the marriage of old and new in this storied area of Paris as we stumbled on the 19th-century-style gold signage of a small neighbourhood chocolate shop, Confiserie St Pierre on the Rue de Chaillot, which we learnt has been going for 40 years. The two women inside, who could have walked out of a Jacques Demy film, were proud to talk and taste us through their curated selection of artisanal products, carefully displayed in typical glass jars and counters — pain d’épices, jars of Normandy honey and bags of orangettes coated in flaked almonds.Back at Bulgari, only five minutes’ walk away, there was just time to visit the penthouse. The vast 400sq m apartment consists of two bedrooms, two ensuites with bathtubs and sinks carved from single blocks of marble, a gym, a sauna, a dining room and a 360-degree terrace to rival that of the Arc de Triomphe, but without the selfie-sticks.From the balcony, you can wave across the avenue at the inhabitants of the Four Seasons’ penthouse or simply marvel at le tout Paris. The terrace’s crowning glory is a 250 sq m garden, complete with magnolias, lemon and pear trees and redcurrant bushes, planted a year ago in order to bear fruit in time for the opening. Gardens in Paris, of course, are almost non-existent — even a tiny balcony is highly prized. Here, however, you can lounge on 11th-floor springy grass with a cocktail in hand and a curious sense that the Eiffel Tower is glittering just for you. And for a cool €35,000 per night, it should do too.What is your favourite way to spend a day on Paris’s Right Bank? Tell us in the comments below.
183  When leader Mary Lou McDonald stood before Sinn Féin’s annual conference in October, she said that things had “gone to the dogs” under Ireland’s traditional parties. “We are the party of change,” she asserted.Voters appear to be listening. Sinn Féin has successfully fashioned itself as champion, not just of the working-class and supporters of a united Ireland, but of the key issue hurting many of the country’s 5m population, especially young people: unaffordable or unavailable housing.That policy is now paying dividends: Sinn Féin has seen its support rise to a historic high of 35 per cent, according to a new Irish Times poll by Ipsos/MRBI released on Friday.Not only is it far ahead of Ireland’s two traditional rivals, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, both of which muster 20 per cent, but leftwing Sinn Féin is also far outstripping them among middle-aged and middle-class voters. As well as the squeezed, who hope the untested party will deliver a better future, the poll found support among nearly a third of voters aged over 35 and over a quarter of the middle class.“They’re very professionalised, they’re very on-message, they’re very effective opposition and they’re offering a message of hope, a Nirvana-like future,” said Gail McElroy, a political-science professor at Trinity College Dublin. “We’re 21 months into a pandemic.people are tired and [Sinn Féin] have this great message of change and hope.”Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Cumann na nGaedheal (Fine Gael’s forerunner) have supplied every Irish government since the state’s inception in 1922 and are currently in coalition with the Green party.The unlikely threesome was hammered out despite Sinn Féin winning the popular vote in elections last year. It was shut out of government because for many, its links to republican paramilitaries during three decades of sectarian strife in Northern Ireland’s Troubles made it too toxic.The party’s populist spending and tax-the-rich plans spook Ireland’s wealthy. Its past has also put it off-limits to people, even among its core constituencies, who remember the Troubles. As one former senior trade unionist put it: “I would rather die than vote Sinn Féin.”Ireland’s elections are not due until February 2025, but Sinn Féin is widely expected to cement its position as the most popular party both north and south on the island by winning elections in Northern Ireland, a devolved UK region, next May.Still, analysts caution against seeing a victory in Ireland as inevitable.“I wouldn’t say they’re unstoppable,” said David Higgins at financial consultancy Carraighill, who said the ruling parties’ fatigue mirrored trends seen in grand coalitions in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands.But he noted: “They’re not just gaining at the expense of government parties, they’re gaining at the expense of other opposition parties. It points to Sinn Féin’s success in communicating a very clear policy on housing.”The average age of a first-time homebuyer in Ireland has now risen to 34, from 29 15 years ago, because of high prices and scant supply. “I know people who are beginning to look favourably on Sinn Féin — it does come back to housing”, Higgins said of 30-something peers in well-paid financial jobs.Although the economy is booming — Ireland was the only EU country to grow in 2020 and is headed for 15 per cent GDP growth this year — voters’ concerns show “not everyone’s boat has been raised by economic buoyancy,” said McElroy.But Kevin Cunningham, a lecturer in politics at Technological University Dublin, said even diehard Sinn Féin fans may not see eye-to-eye. Young people, for example, may like the party’s promises to solve the housing crisis but disagree with its opposition to carbon taxes.Meanwhile, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil together are still polling 40 per cent, with time to cash in on job growth and a cap on rent rises.But McDonald will be hoping, as she told her party faithful, that “the writing is on the wall”.Letter in response to this article:Blame property owners for lack of affordable housing / From Jonathan Malone, Singapore
184  Andrea Orcel wants to talk about his plans for the bank he joined this year, UniCredit.But minutes after finishing an interview with the Financial Times on Friday, he learnt that he had won a famous victory over the bank he almost joined in 2019: Santander.Two years ago, Orcel sued the Spanish lender for withdrawing an offer to appoint him as chief executive. Waging a public court battle over his own remuneration was a bold move at a time of heightened scrutiny of executive pay.Adding to the drama was a soured personal relationship. Orcel had been a favoured confidant to Santander’s late leader Emilio Botín and close to his daughter, the current chair Ana Botín. Now she faced him in a Madrid court.On Friday, his gamble paid off. A judge awarded Orcel €68m, the bulk of it in remuneration for deferred pay he lost when he resigned from UBS to take the Santander job. It also included “moral and reputational damages”.Orcel’s success was striking not just for the size of the award, but because he had triumphed against a pillar of the Spanish establishment.Later on Friday, Orcel told the FT: “I am very pleased my rights have been recognised.”Just before the ruling, speaking in his office on the 28th floor of the UniCredit tower in the centre of Milan, Orcel insisted his legal battle — “unfortunate or not” — was “the right thing to do because there was no other way”.“I think it’s unfortunate that we are where we are, but if people look only at the facts and what has emerged in court the conclusions are clear,” Orcel said. “I hope it ends and we can all turn the page; [Santander] is in the past and I am 150 per cent focused on UniCredit.”His new job did not begin without drama and has already contained an abortive deal of its own: UniCredit’s attempted takeover of ailing local rival Monte dei Paschi di Siena, which Orcel walked away from.Orcel said he would not have done a “good service” to the bank’s shareholders or to Italy by going through with the deal.“The market would have seen it as a political deal [on the government’s terms],” said Orcel, in his first interview since taking the helm of Italy’s second-largest lender in April.Talks between UniCredit and the Italian government, which owns a 64 per cent stake in MPS, collapsed in October after Rome said it was unwilling to pour in many more billions of euros than had been expected to recapitalise the Tuscan bank.Orcel said the government and UniCredit had agreed on how the balance sheet should be cleaned up “and those terms, if you take the accounts of Monte dei Paschi and the due diligence that was carried out, almost mechanically equate to a number”. He said “the number was significantly higher than the €2bn-€3bn” originally anticipated by the government.There are no hard feelings between him and the government, according to Orcel — who is from Rome but had never worked in Italy before taking the UniCredit job. Both sides “negotiated in good faith” and he had been keen to look at the potential deal despite shareholder scepticism.“Saying no from day one would have been the easiest choice for me,” Orcel said.The collapse of the talks has left Orcel in a stronger position to pursue an alternative growth strategy. Unlike his predecessor Jean Pierre Mustier, he has not ruled out acquisitions and “continues to look at opportunities”, but his priority is to deliver on a challenging three-year plan.The targets include annual profit growth of 10 per cent, a €16bn capital distribution programme, an initial €2bn investment in technology and the recruitment of 1,500 new people, 900 of them in Italy.“I’ve spent my whole career abroad, but I’m proud to be Italian.It’s the same thing for UniCredit,” said Orcel. “We can be an Italian bank and we want to be strong here, but we also realise we have outgrown our roots.”Betting on further integration across the group’s 13 European markets, Orcel believes “recomposing” and streamlining UniCredit’s network will boost revenue growth and provide better customer service. “We are not going to treat the other 12 countries as colonies,” he said.In order to do so, the chief executive is reducing costs while also investing in data, technology and people. “We were nervous if people would agree with that, but investors said yes.That brings a sustainable approach over time,” Orcel said.Investors responded positively to the strategy announcement, with the bank’s shares rising 12 per cent in the following two days.Orcel argues that UniCredit requires a cultural repair. “We had lost our DNA,” he said. “If you go back 15 years, UniCredit was the blueprint for banking, it was the most truly European bank, best returns, best people, we pioneered a lot of things,” he said. “Then mistakes were made.”According to Orcel, whose office contains a rumoured live wolf that turns out to be a granite statue, the bank’s long but necessary restructuring phase led the former management to centralise processes and decisions that generated a “culture of fear”.“Feeling that if you make a mistake you are out, if you challenge something you are out, makes people lose track of what we stand for,” he said.“It’s OK to make mistakes, within the rules, recognise them and move on,” he said. “We want to trust and empower our people or we can’t go anywhere, because you can’t control everything.”Additional reporting by Owen Walker in London and Daniel Dombey in Madrid
185  Ukraine’s new defence minister has blamed Germany for blocking the supply of weaponry to Kyiv through Nato, despite US warnings of a possible imminent invasion by Russian forces.Oleksii Reznikov told the Financial Times that Berlin had in the past month vetoed Ukraine’s purchase of anti-drone rifles and anti-sniper systems via the Nato Support and Procurement Agency. However, Germany had since relented on the first item, after deeming it non-lethal.“They are still building the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and at the same time blocking our defensive weapons. It is very unfair,” Reznikov said, referring to the Russian gas pipeline that runs through the Baltic Sea to Germany and bypasses existing supply routes through Ukraine.Kyiv has struggled to plug gaps in its military capabilities, but allies are wary that supplying arms may be deemed a provocation, or even a pretext for escalation, by Russian president Vladimir Putin. Ukraine is urgently seeking to acquire anti-missile and anti-aircraft systems, electronic warfare kit and cyber defence equipment.Given the German blockage of procurement of lethal equipment — a position taken by Angela Merkel’s former government — Reznikov said Ukraine would seek to acquire arms through bilateral deals with allies, including the US, UK, Lithuania and France.The position of the new German government, led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz, is not yet clear. The German economy ministry, which is responsible for approving or vetoing weapons exports, declined to comment on Sunday, as did the German chancellery.In May, Robert Habeck, co-leader of the Greens and now economy minister in the ruling coalition, said Ukraine’s requests for defensive weapons would be “hard to deny”.Reznikov said he was in a “very optimistic mood” about obtaining missiles and other defensive weaponry from the US and other western backers after holding talks with his counterparts.But he could not confirm whether supplies would arrive swiftly enough to deter a full-blown Russian invasion. Western leaders, led by US president Joe Biden, have threatened crippling economic sanctions to dissuade Moscow from further aggression.After a summit in Liverpool on Sunday, G7 foreign ministers released a statement calling on Moscow to “de-escalate, pursue diplomatic channels and abide by its international commitments”.“Russia should be in no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have massive consequences and severe cost in response,” the statement said.Reznikov said western allies’ fears of confronting Putin from a position of strength were misguided.“Not provoking Russia — that strategy does not work and will not work,” he said, noting that Moscow had invaded Georgia after Berlin and Paris had blocked the country’s path to joining Nato in 2008.Despite the increasingly loud US warnings of a possible Russian invasion, Reznikov, like other Ukrainian officials, downplayed the imminent threat.Kyiv estimated there were about 100,000 Russian troops deployed along its borders — similar to the Russian build-up during the spring and summer. While Moscow was building encampments for up to 175,000 personnel, according to US assessments, many of the tents appeared to be unoccupied, Reznikov said.A conflict would be a calamity for Europe, with millions of Ukrainians likely to flee to the EU and Ukraine’s vast exports of grain in jeopardy, he said.“There will be a lot of coffins coming back to Russia,” he said, adding an invasion would mark “the end of the current world” and open “a new era” without international rules.Reznikov, a lawyer who served as minister for the reintegration of occupied territories until his promotion to defence minister last month, said Kyiv had no indication from Washington that its aspirations to join Nato would be delayed or excluded. Biden last week agreed to further talks with Putin to discuss Russia’s opposition to Ukraine’s Nato membership.Moscow’s “red line” against Ukraine entering Nato was just part of Russia’s “salami-slicing tactics” against the alliance, Reznikov said. “My perception is the US has understood these threats. They have to keep the alliance unified.”Reznikov also denied Kyiv had come under any pressure from the US to grant special status or deeper autonomy to the occupied Donbas regions as a way of kick-starting stalled peace talks.Letter in response to this article:Kennan did not mince his words on Nato expansion / From Armen Martirosyan, Ambassador of Armenia
186  The writer is spokesperson for the German Greens in the European Parliament and vice-minister in the federal German department of economy and climate protectionIn Germany, the Green party has entered into a coalition at the federal level with the Social Democrats and liberals for the first time. Realising the aims of the Paris climate agreement and driving an ecological transformation of the German economy are the new government’s top priorities.Its plans have the potential to set a global standard in tackling the climate crisis. Germany, the fourth-largest economy in the world, wants 80 per cent of its power supply to be provided by renewables by 2030. That will involve, among other things, building wind farms on 2 per cent of the country’s land and installing photovoltaic systems on the roof of nearly every suitable building.The timely implementation of energy infrastructure projects on this scale will require cutting unnecessary bureaucracy and speeding up the notoriously cumbersome German planning and authorisation systems. In the medium term, Germany will switch completely to renewable energies, becoming a global climate leader in the process.The Green party now has responsibility for the “super ministry” for economy and climate, which will oversee the final stage of Germany’s transition to 100 per cent renewables — while other countries are discussing nuclear power, which is neither ecologically competitive nor economically sustainable.Decarbonisation goes far beyond the energy system, though. Since the second world war, German economic policy has been guided by the principles of the “social market economy”. These include fostering open markets and competition, on the one hand, and controlling their negative consequences, such as environmental damage or inequality, on the other.This regulatory framework must now be extended from the economic and social realms to the ecological. Climate neutrality and protecting biodiversity should be central goals of economic governance alongside prosperity and social security. In short, Germany needs to become a social-ecological market economy.A transformed German economy will only be an inspiration at home and abroad if it renews its competitiveness based on ecological and social innovation. And this is exactly the point where the Greens’ economic policies differ from those of most centre-right parties. For them, climate-friendly innovations are best achieved by deregulation and carbon pricing. But in our view, modern economic policy has to be based on an intelligent and pragmatic mix of instruments in order to create a framework for enterprises to change their business models in a way consistent with the limits of planet and people.This democratically defined framework for a highly competitive market economy does include pricing of carbon emissions, but also technical standards, financial incentives and the empowering of consumers to “green” their demand. It should allow for a plurality of technological solutions in order to reconcile economy and planet.Key here is the idea of a humble state mindful of its own limitations and inefficiencies. Getting serious with a social and ecological market economy will boost private investment in the economy — not in order to curb headlong growth, but in order to expand sustainable forms of production and consumption and shrink unsustainable ones. This huge programme for investment, jobs and innovation will best be achieved if macroeconomic policies and the regulation of financial markets create a relatively stable investment climate.However, the role of the state should go beyond the creation of a regulatory framework. The state needs to help private enterprises to innovate by boosting infrastructure and supporting innovation as part of an active industrial policy. However, industrial policy is not to be confused with picking potential global champions, which would threaten the many economic and social advantages that flow from an economy based on a mixture of large corporations, successful SMEs, and social businesses as well as innovative start-ups. Green economic policy takes the ideas of German “ordoliberalism” and develops them by the pragmatic use of heterodox ideas.Completing this transformation will be a tremendous challenge — not only for lawmakers and industry, but for society as a whole. The process of modernisation always creates winners and losers. Social compensation and the democratic inclusion of citizens in the transformation will be key, in order to avoid stoking protest movements such as the gilets jaunes in France. But if Germany succeeds, it can be an example for Europe and beyond of how to reconcile ecology and economy.Letter in response to this article:Buzzwords won’t deliver results for Green party / From Alan Mitcham, Cologne, Germany
187  The Greek central bank is planning an appeal for the country’s bonds to remain eligible for new European Central Bank purchases after March when the vast bond-buying scheme launched in response to the pandemic is expected to end.Several members of the ECB’s governing council said they were amenable to finding a way to keep buying Greek bonds for the rest of next year when they meet on Thursday. But Greek officials fear legal hurdles may mean that ECB purchases of the country’s debt will still be reduced much more significantly than those of other countries.Officials in Athens are keen to avoid the stigma of the country being singled out once again without the safety net of the ECB’s bond-buying after its €1.85tn Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) is due to stop net purchases in just over three months’ time.The ECB is usually barred from buying bonds issued by Greece because it is the only eurozone country rated below investment grade by the main credit rating agencies.However, the central bank made an exception to its ban on buying so-called junk-rated bonds that allowed it to restart purchases of Greek debt when it launched the PEPP in March 2020.The ECB has bought €35bn of Greek bonds over the past two years. When it stops net purchases under the PEPP, the central bank is expected to continue buying bonds under the longer-standing Asset Purchase Programme. But this scheme is barred from buying junk bonds.Greece’s borrowing costs have fallen sharply since the ECB started purchasing its bonds. The country’s 10-year bond yield dropped from about 2.4 per cent when the PEPP started to a record low of just over 0.5 per cent in August. Bond yields fall as their prices rise.The country’s bond yields have risen recently and investors expect their spread — the extra interest Athens has to pay relative to Germany when it sells new debt — to rise further if the ECB sharply reduces the amount of Greek debt it buys.Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at BlueBay Asset Management, said this scenario “would definitely be a reason for Greece to underperform a bit. You could see spreads widening further.” But he said hopes of future Greek rating upgrades may limit the downside for its bonds.Some ECB purchases of Greek bonds will still be possible using the proceeds of maturing bonds already bought under PEPP. The central bank has committed to continue those reinvestments “until at least the end of 2023” and they could be skewed in favour of Greece.Frederik Ducrozet, strategist at Pictet Wealth Management, predicted PEPP reinvestments would total about €12.5bn a month.Another option is for the ECB to launch a new bond-buying programme that has similar flexibility to the PEPP, although several council members said this was unlikely. The ECB and the Bank of Greece declined to comment.Analysts and Greek officials do not expect the country’s bonds to earn an investment grade rating until after the next national elections scheduled in 2023, despite the strong rebound of its economy this year.Greece has the largest national debt in the eurozone, amounting to more than 200 per cent of gross domestic product. Athens is still under a system of “enhanced surveillance” by the European Commission designed to ensure it meets deficit targets until next year.A Greek official said the country hoped to avoid another “Deauville moment” — a reference to the French coastal town where the leaders of Germany and France shocked investors in 2010 by agreeing that any rescheduling of a eurozone country’s debt would include private sector creditors, triggering a sell-off in Greek bonds.Greece was bailed out by the “troika” of the IMF, the ECB and the commission, which imposed strict austerity measures on Athens. ECB president Christine Lagarde, who was French finance minister during the Deauville meeting and later became head of the IMF, has since said “the demands vis-à-vis Greece were excessive” — indicating sympathy with the idea that the country was harshly singled out.Officials are confident Greece’s finances will not be hampered even if its bond yields rise. The country’s Public Debt Management Agency usually front-loads bond issuance and next year it aims to raise about half of its €10bn debt programme in the first quarter, before the PEPP expires.Greece has also built a cash buffer that now amounts to about €40bn, enough to cover financing needs for at least three years.Additional reporting by Tommy Stubbington in London
188  France’s Pacific island territory of New Caledonia voted overwhelmingly against independence on Sunday in the last of three scheduled referendums since 2018, but difficult negotiations over its future are expected to continue following a boycott of the latest vote by pro-independence militants.With most of the votes counted, 96.5 per cent of those who cast their ballots opposed independence, the government said. Turnout was low at 43.9 per cent because of the boycott.New Caledonia, which lies 1,500km east of Australia and has a population of 270,000, is one of the world’s biggest nickel producers and gives France influence over a large maritime zone in the South Pacific. Tesla, the electric carmaker that needs nickel for its batteries, this year agreed to buy New Caledonian nickel from a Trafigura-backed consortium.Those who support the idea of the islands remaining part of France argue that the territory is coveted by an expansionist China and allows the French to maintain their status as an Indo-Pacific power. That argument was recently undermined by Australia’s decision to cancel a large submarine contract with France and buy nuclear-powered vessels from the US and the UK instead.The pro-independence camp in New Caledonia, a territory seized by France in 1853 under Napoleon III, had appeared to be gaining ground in the previous two referendums, with the No vote winning 56.7 per cent in 2018 but only 53.3 per cent last year.This time the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS), which has been riven by internal dissension, called for a boycott on the grounds that the Covid-19 pandemic made a fair contest impossible.The three referendums were held under the terms of the Nouméa Accord of 1998, which set out a path towards autonomy and was designed to put an end to years of dispute and sometimes violent clashes.Now that the population has voted no to independence three times, there are plans for 18 months of negotiations to discuss the territory’s future status, to be followed by yet another referendum to validate whatever decision is reached.“New Caledonia will therefore remain French,” President Emmanuel Macron said in an address to the nation on Sunday, but he added: “We can’t ignore that the electorate has remained deeply divided despite the years that have passed.A period of transition begins.” Macron, who models himself on General Charles de Gaulle and has promoted the country as a global power with big interests in the Pacific, has previously said France would be “less beautiful without New Caledonia”. On Sunday, he said: “Tonight France is more beautiful, because New Caledonia has decided to stay.”The French president has nevertheless been criticised as weak by rightwing nationalist political rivals seeking to thwart his bid for re-election in the presidential election in April.Sébastien Lecornu, Macron’s overseas minister, was denounced by the right for saying the government was “ready” to discuss autonomy for the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe to defuse angry street protests there over Covid vaccines and lockdowns.
189  Last year, as Covid-19 first swept across Europe, a French textiles company tweeted it would start making surgical masks. Within hours, the ministry of health asked how many it could produce; two days later, Les Tissages de Charlieu had made 100,000 masks for French hospitals and public workers.“Our aim was to onshore a very simple, basic commodity — to prove that it can be done,” said Antoine Saint-Pierre, co-director of the company that is based in Charlieu, a textiles town for more than 500 years. The firm has now also begun making millions of tote shopping bags, generating one-fifth of the emissions of those imported from China, according to the company.Supply chain disruptions wrought by the pandemic have made “national economic resilience” and “reshoring” of critical manufactured goods — be they vaccines, semiconductors or protective equipment and textiles — industrial policy buzzwords across the western world. But that is especially so in France, where the return of manufacturing production and jobs from overseas has become a hot-button issue ahead of next year’s presidential election.Candidates across the political spectrum have vied to convince voters of their vision of how to reverse the country’s industrial decline, which has seen industry’s contribution to the French economy halve between 1970 and 2020 to 11 per cent.Meanwhile, the government of President Emmanuel Macron, who has long believed Europe should reclaim its economic sovereignty, points proudly to the €830m it has handed out to companies since 2020 to support reshoring projects.“We provided a boost during the crisis to ensure that manufacturers did not stop investing. It was our obsession, and it worked really well,” industry minister Agnès Pannier-Runacher told the Financial Times. She added that over 10,000 industrial companies got financial support from France’s EU recovery package, with more than 620 specifically being helped to reshore their activities.Yet economists question whether such a wide range of cash injections is the right way to reboot domestic manufacturing. They may bolster small companies such as Les Tissages de Charlieu, but can they change France’s industrial fabric?The textiles industry provides a vivid example of the issues at stake, as well as some of the reasons why economists are sceptical.Central to France’s industrial revolution, the sector was savaged in the late 20th century by the offshoring of production to Asia and eastern Europe, where costs are lower and regulations less stringent. Nowadays, 90 per cent of textiles and clothes bought in France are made abroad, according to 2015 data from Insee. Ethically minded consumers also have limited visibility into factory working conditions or the origins of raw materials.That changed somewhat during the pandemic, as textile imports fell. With the over €1m of state aid that Les Tissages de Charlieu received to help it make tote bags, the company is now also more than doubling its workforce to 180 people — equivalent to 10 per cent of Charlieu’s population. Its tote bags are greener too.The state has shown a “very good commitment” to onshoring, Saint-Pierre said. “There has been a real shift in the government’s speech and actions.”However, whether reshoring textiles production can reverse French industrial decline is a moot point, economists argue.‘Reshoring’ is often a “polite word for protectionism”, Isabelle Mejean, an economist at Sciences Po, said. “It is not clear precisely what it means,” she added, even if it is often presented as being able to “solve everything”, be that more economic sovereignty, jobs or resilience to climate change.Mejean and Xavier Jaravel, a fellow member of France’s Council of Economic Analysis which provides the government with independent advice, recommended in April the government would do a better job of boosting French industry and protecting supply chains if it prioritised “vulnerable inputs with high technological content”.They warned that “imperfectly targeted industrial policies would be costly for consumers, without fundamentally enhancing [economic] resilience” and cited priority sectors such as aeronautics, electronics and chemicals. Textiles came a distant second last, before “others”.Even so, Pannier-Runacher defended Macron’s industrial record. Leaving aside the effectiveness of France’s recovery plan, which will take time to come through, she pointed to a net increase in industrial jobs between 2017 and 2019, when the pandemic reversed the trend.“We have created the conditions to improve France’s competitiveness,” she said.Yet while surveys show that France’s business climate has become more attractive thanks to corporate tax cuts and labour market reforms introduced by Macron, manufacturing remains depressed and the trade deficit in industrial products has continued to grow.Patrick Artus, chief economist at Natixis, argues that France needs to benchmark itself against Germany, which has kept the more lucrative parts of its industrial power base onshore, including its Mittelstand businesses, car manufacturing and research and development initiatives.Rather than just offering cash handouts, France specifically needs to further reduce business taxes that are €50bn higher than Germany per year, improve technical skills, and put more public money at risk when financing innovation and high technology start-ups.“You can engage in pretty aggressive offshoring and still protect domestic industry,” agreed Gilles Moec, chief economist at insurer Axa. “As a free-trader, I don’t think we should give up the good fight that in general international trade is good, and is defined by specialisation. You will not do everything better at home.”Back in Charlieu, Saint-Pierre half agrees. He believes it would be “crazy to say all production should come back to France”. But he also argues that many manufacturing processes can be reshored, creating thousands of jobs while also cutting the environmental impact of production.“We don’t have to de-globalise, we just need to find an equilibrium,” he said.Additional reporting by Eir Nolsoe
190  Poland’s justice minister has said the country should suspend its payments to the EU budget and veto European policies if Brussels cuts funds to Warsaw and escalates its fight over the rule of law.Zbigniew Ziobro said the European Commission would be acting “illegitimately” if it used new powers to withhold funding from Poland over the rule of law dispute. The commission, the EU’s executive arm, has already delayed the approval of €36bn in pandemic recovery funding for Poland over the feud but is under pressure from the European parliament to use a so-called “conditionality mechanism” to take more action.Warsaw and Brussels are battling over changes to Poland’s judicial system that the commission believes threaten judicial independence. Poland’s government insists its changes are needed to fix an inefficient judicial system.Ziobro, who as well as serving as justice minister heads a small party whose votes help the government to maintain a wafer-thin majority, told the FT he expected the EU to back down. But he said if the conditionality mechanism — which Poland and Hungary have challenged in court — were used against Warsaw, he would demand retaliation.“Poland should respond to EU’s blackmail with a veto on all matters that require unanimity in the EU. Poland should also revise its commitment to EU climate and energy policy, which results in drastic hikes of energy prices,” he said.“If this dispute escalates, I will demand that Poland suspends its EU contributions. It would be justifiable since the EU illegitimately denies us funds from a joint budget that we also contribute to.”While member states have the ability to veto some types of EU legislation which require unanimity, including taxation matters, they are legally obliged to meet their national contributions under the EU’s budgetary framework.As part of its judicial reforms Poland created a disciplinary chamber for judges, which has been ruled illegal by the EU’s top court. European officials have said Poland should scrap the chamber, change the disciplinary rules and reinstate dismissed judges as conditions for approving Warsaw’s request for pandemic recovery funding.Ziobro said he could “allow for the possibility” of the disciplinary chamber being dissolved as part of a reform of the Supreme Court “and entire judicial system that we have prepared”.But annulling the disciplinary chamber’s past decisions to bar some 600 judges, or allowing judges to question the status of judges appointed since the government embarked on its judicial overhaul, would be “unacceptable”.Some barred judges had committed criminal offences, he said, and allowing judges to question each other’s status would lead to “anarchy”.“The European Commission is posing impossible conditions because its real goal is not to achieve a supposed rule of law but to change the government in Poland,” he added.“It is sending a message to Poles: if you support this government, you will not get money from the EU. It is not their concern for the rule of law but a contradiction — a political diktat enforced by blackmail and an attempt to undermine a democratic decision of several million Poles.”Officials in Brussels see the stand-off with Poland — the bloc’s fifth most populous member state — as a fundamental threat to the rules that unite its members and the biggest challenge to its legal order since Brexit.However Ziobro said the fight was political and that Poland was the object of a “brutal attack”.“The EU is conducting an aggressive policy and does not care about the rule of law. It is just a pretext,” he said. “Brutal economic blackmail is supposed to force Poland to agree to the EU being restructured into a federal state officially managed from Brussels, but in practical terms — from Berlin. Before that it is supposed to assure the fall of the democratically formed Polish government, which opposes this direction of change in Europe.”The tense clashes between Warsaw and Brussels, which came to a head in October when Poland’s constitutional tribunal declared key parts of EU law incompatible with Poland’s constitution, have sparked questions about Poland’s long-term position in the bloc.Ziobro, whose United Poland party has charted a more openly Eurosceptic line than the ruling Law and Justice party, himself said in August that Poland should not stay in the bloc “at any price”. Asked about the future relationship, he said that the place of Poland was in “the Union that it joined: based on partnership of sovereign nations and states, not on the rule of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy that is lacking democratic controls.”However, he insisted that his party would not accept any concessions to Brussels that would result in Polish sovereignty being limited. “We will never agree for Poland to have the status of a colony,” he said.
191  From a vantage point above Dublin port, Eamonn O’Reilly can see how Brexit is changing the terms of Ireland’s trade.Rising rapidly in importance at Dublin is what O’Reilly, the port’s chief executive, says is “Lo-Lo traffic” — unaccompanied containers that are lifted on to ships and then lifted off at their port of destination.Lo-Lo’s counterpart, “Ro-Ro” — where containers are sent on the back of lorries and roll on to and off ships — is on the decline. Ro-Ro freight was mainly bound for Great Britain, Ireland’s traditional trading partner, and the shift is a sign of how Ireland’s biggest port — and the country’s economy — is pivoting to focus on continental Europe.“When you’re going longer distances to continental Europe, [Lo-Lo] is more viable because it’s cheaper,” O’Reilly said in an interview overlooking a yard that will soon be expanded to take account of changing trade patterns. A new phase of the port’s overall €1.6bn 30-year expansion master plan, announced in November, includes a plan for Ireland’s largest Lo-Lo container terminal.Prior to Brexit Dublin’s main importance for trade with continental Europe was its position as the gateway to a “land bridge” via the UK. Trucks carrying freight would cross the Irish Sea and traverse Britain before moving on to France or other parts of the EU.Now post-Brexit checks are pushing many hauliers to divert exports from Dublin directly to the EU, bypassing the UK entirely. Since the UK left the EU at the start of this year, Lo-Lo volumes from Dublin have risen 14 per cent compared with the same period last year, according to port data.Dublin Port’s trade is now split 50-50 between the UK and EU, whereas prior to Brexit, trade with British ports accounted for roughly two-thirds of volumes, O’Reilly said.Ireland is betting on such trade growing. Last month, it opened a new goods terminal in Dunkirk as a gateway to the continent, to be served from the southern port of Rosslare, the main rival to Dublin.The Irish Maritime Development Office notes that Irish importers and exporters now have access to 13 different direct EU Ro-Ro services, up from just six in 2019, before Covid-19 disruptions.In a new report, it found Ireland-EU traffic was 52 per higher in the first nine months of this year than in the whole of 2019.The other main shift at Dublin concerns Northern Ireland. Since 2006, Dublin has handled most goods going into Britain because routes from Dublin are the shortest. By last year, Dublin handled a quarter more Ro-Ro volumes than all of Northern Ireland’s three main ports — Belfast, Larne and Warrenpoint — combined.But now — because of the customs red tape introduced when Brexit put a customs border down the Irish Sea — trade is increasingly going to Britain via Northern Irish ports. The volume of Ro-Ro cargoes in Dublin has fallen by a quarter in the first nine months of this year, O’Reilly said.“I think it’s permanent.It’s turning back the clock,” he said. “History suggests to me that [this trade] won’t come back.”Joe O’Neill, chief executive of Belfast Harbour, told the FT he had seen at least a “partial reversal” of previous trends with Ro-Ro volumes up 5 to 7 per cent in the first nine months of this year, compared with the same period last year.“We do suspect that the growth we are enjoying at the minute in Ro-Ro is in part from the contribution of some traffic that is not going out of Dublin port,” he said.O’Reilly said Brexit has sparked another, unexpected shift.While Dublin Port saw a 3.3 per cent drop in overall tonnage handled in the first nine months compared with the same period last year, the number of containers and trailers fell just 0.5 per cent, O’Reilly said.“We think what’s happening now is that, on average, there are less goods in each container,” he said. Consolidating loads into one container could require multiple customs checks under post-Brexit rules.“It’s an inefficiency introduced into the supply chains but it’s bad for the carbon impact,” O’Reilly said. More containers also puts pressure on the port’s already squeezed capacity, he added.
192  US president Joe Biden warned Vladimir Putin that he would dispatch additional troops to allies in eastern Europe if Russia invaded Ukraine, in one of his sternest warnings yet about the fallout from military action by Moscow.Speaking to reporters after remarks on the deadly tornadoes that battered the US, Biden said if Putin “moves on Ukraine” he would face “devastating” economic consequences. Washington and western allies are discussing a hefty package of economic and financial sanctions to punish Moscow in a more damaging way than they did when Russia invaded Crimea in 2014.But Biden added that the US and Nato would also bolster the defence of B9 countries, a group of alliance members in central and eastern Europe who are most vulnerable to the security threat posed by Russia.“We will find it required that we’ll have to send more American and Nato troops into the eastern flank, the B9, all those Nato countries where we have a sacred obligation to defend them against any attack by Russia,” Biden said.The US has not indicated any appetite for deploying troops directly to Ukraine. But Biden said that Washington would “continue to provide for, and we have and continued to provide for the defence capacities for the Ukrainian people”.The US president also suggested that Russia would pay “a terrible price” in terms of its image if it were to attack Ukraine.Biden’s comments came after a week of tense negotiations over the fate of Ukraine, following warnings from the US that Putin was preparing to attack its neighbour with up to 175,000 troops. Biden held a two-hour call with Putin in which he warned the Russian leader against taking any action. But he opened the door to a negotiation and a possible “accommodation” with regards to Ukraine, unnerving some Nato allies in eastern Europe.Since then, Russia has made a series of demands of the US, including that it curb any ambition to further expand Nato, which were dismissed by US administration officials.“[Biden] stands by the proposition that countries should be able to freely choose who they associate with,” Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser told reporters.
193  Thousands of Serbs took to the streets for the third Saturday in a row to demonstrate against the pollution caused by heavy industry and mining companies.Protesters blocked roads in Belgrade and other cities and towns across the Balkan nation as environmental groups sought to force green issues up the political agenda ahead of elections next year.Campaigners had feared that the government would pass legislation favouring Rio Tinto, the miner that holds the rights to develop one of Europe’s largest known Lithium deposits in the western Serbian region of Jadar.But President Aleksandar Vucic appeared to have defused protests earlier this week when he backed down on two key pieces of legislation, sending back a land expropriation bill and tighter rules on issuing referendums to parliament for reconsideration.However the organiser of the biggest rallies in Belgrade, protest group Kreni-Promeni (Go-Change), said on its Facebook page it would refocus on collecting the 30,000 signatures necessary to force a vote on lithium mining, which it wants banned.Lithium is a key mineral in making batteries and its price is expected to rise steeply as demand for electric vehicles rises, placing Serbia in a strong strategic position in Europe. However, many Serbs have doubts about the environmental record of big industrial companies.“This is the first victory of the citizens since 2012! We’ll keep moving on! This is a win for all of us,” Kreni-Promeni said.Vucic, who has led the ruling Serbian Progressive party (SNS) since 2012 and came to power on a pro-western, pro-EU platform in 2017, faces elections in April next year. The protests have channelled a widespread sense of anger at what is seen as an oppressive, populist rule of an increasingly autocratic ruling elite.“Protests are not over, but blockades may be over,” Nikola Krstic of the environmental group Fortress Movement (Pokret Tvrdava), which organised some protests in the Belgrade suburb of Smederevo, told the Financial Times.“We will find a new method to fight, a new approach. Maybe not in the street now, the protest will pause. I really hope that we can replace Vucic at the elections, but we have a problem because it is not a free elections. It is hardly a democracy.”Analysts do not believe the popular pressure will dent Vucic’s power as the opposition parties are seen ill-equipped to take over from the ruling SNS party, which has participated in government under Vucic for most of the past decade.“The opposition is disliked,” said Milos Damjanovic of the Belgrade-based BIRN consultancy. “If they appear, there is much less political traction. The environmental issue is a much healthier topic to gather around.”Without a party structure, it will be difficult to make political inroads, said Vessela Tcherneva of the European Council on Foreign Relations.“We need to see how that evolves, and how persistent the protest is,” she said. “The Rio Tinto investment is not the main focus. It is a trigger but the underlying reason is people are getting fed up with the regime.”Senior government officials also said they sensed political, not ecological, pressure.“The main reason for the protest is the attempt to change the government without elections, not the environment,” deputy prime minister and minister of mining and energy, Zorana Mihajlovic, was quoted on the government website as saying.
194  Boris Johnson’s government has this week offered a significant climbdown in talks with the EU over post-Brexit trading relations in Northern Ireland, as the prime minister tries to end the toxic dispute.A senior British official on Friday briefed London-based EU journalists that Johnson was no longer seeking the immediate axing of the European Court of Justice from its role in enforcing the so-called Northern Ireland protocol.In a move described as “an important shift”, the UK official said “no one is demonstrating on the streets of Belfast” in protest against the role of the ECJ.The protocol is the part of the UK’s Brexit deal that aims to maintain an open border in Ireland. In exchange, some checks on east-west trade across the Irish Sea are needed.Although Johnson wants to settle the “governance” issue of the protocol in the longer term, EU journalists were briefed that the prime minister wants to focus for now on securing the smooth flow of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland across the Irish Sea.“If the negotiations fail it won’t be because the UK is insisting on taking the ECJ out of the protocol,” the official said, adding that London accepted that the European Commission did not have a mandate from member states to discuss the excision of the court from the deal.According to journalists at the briefing, they had been summoned specifically to report the “shift” in UK government thinking — an olive branch that could help broker a deal with Brussels.But when accounts of the briefing started to emerge, Downing Street desperately attempted to play down what had been said, fearing it had undermined the negotiating position of Brexit minister Lord David Frost.A government spokesperson said: “This is an inaccurate characterisation of our position. Any durable solution must address the full range of difficulties created by the protocol, including on the ECJ.”In spite of that statement, the formal briefing of a group of EU journalists suggests Johnson wants to “park” the ECJ issue to secure a breakthrough in other areas.Both sides have been talking for weeks about a dramatic reduction of checks on goods at Irish Sea ports, including medicines, animals and foodstuffs, and on reducing customs inspections.The European Commission on Saturday said the UK had issued 23 licences for French fishing boats, in a further sign of de-escalating tensions.“Today the UK has issued 18 licences for EU replacement vessels in the UK territorial waters and five licences for EU vessels to access Jersey waters,” the commission said in a statement. “Further technical consultations will continue with the aim to have seven additional replacement vessels licensed by the end of Monday.”While the commission described the move as an “important step” towards seeking full implementation of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, they noted that a “number” of boats seeking access to UK waters had not been granted a licence.A UK government spokesperson said: “Throughout this process, the UK’s approach has been evidence-based and in line with our commitments under the Trade and Cooperation Agreement. We have licensed vessels where sufficient evidence has been provided that demonstrates that a vessel qualifies for access under the TCA.”Additional reporting by Jasmine Cameron-Chileshe
195  Russia has demanded Nato withdraw a 2008 pledge to admit Ukraine and Georgia as part of future security talks that Washington hopes will deter Moscow from invading its southern neighbour.The Russian foreign ministry on Friday published a list of proposed agreements that offer the most detailed insight so far into the “red lines” Vladimir Putin wants to form the basis of a new European security order.US president Joe Biden agreed to discuss Putin’s grievances with the transatlantic military alliance in the company of a group of Nato members following a video call between the two leaders on Tuesday.The US has warned allies that Putin has massed as many as 175,000 troops on Ukraine’s northern, eastern, and southern border in preparation for a possible invasion that officials say could be the bloodiest conflict in Europe since the second world war.Russia’s foreign ministry said Moscow’s relations with the west were at a “critical juncture”, blaming the US and EU for holding “provocative” military drills near the Russian border and supplying Ukraine’s army with equipment.It also accused the west of “dragging Ukraine into Nato”, which it said could result in the deployment of missile systems and troops that could be used to attack Russia from Ukraine.Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, has made securing an action plan for Nato membership a cornerstone of his foreign policy.Nato’s then-secretary general said in 2008 that Ukraine and Georgia would one day become members but the alliance has never specified a timeline and has not entered either country into its formal process for membership.Russia’s foreign ministry said it wanted legal guarantees that the pledge was no longer in force, as well as other agreements that Nato would not deploy weaponry to countries bordering Russia, hold military drills beyond a certain distance from Russia, and setting maximum approach distances for ships in the Baltic and Black seas.It also called on the US to readopt the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty, a Cold War agreement banning land-based missiles with a range of 500km-5,500km from which the Trump administration withdrew in 2019.Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, on Friday dismissed Putin’s demands as unsurprising. “It’s the same list of demands that the Russians have been advocating for and voicing for several months, if not years, and that is their prerogative,” she said.Jake Sullivan, national security adviser, said Biden “clearly and directly.made no such commitments or concessions” regarding excluding Ukraine from Nato in his discussion earlier this week with Putin.“He stands by the proposition that countries should be able to freely choose who they associate with,” Sullivan said.Senior US officials have also said Biden has made “very clear” that one nation cannot force another nation to change its border. “[One] nation cannot tell another to change its politics, and nations can’t tell others who they can work with,” a senior administration official told reporters on Thursday, after Biden spoke to Zelensky and, separately, nine Nato allies along its eastern flank.The US administration has said it is “always” prepared to talk about the full set of security issues with Russia, however, and cited a large number of formats that exist to be able to do that.A Nato spokesperson referred to earlier comments by its secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg: “We stand by our decisions and nothing has changed when it comes to Nato’s approach to Ukraine’s membership,” the alliance’s head said in Paris on Friday. “It is for Ukraine to decide its own path, to decide whether it wants to aspire for membership or not.And then this for the 30 Allies to decide when Ukraine is ready to join the Alliance. No one else.”Sergei Ryabkov, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, told a news conference on Friday that Moscow did not expect the US to agree to its demands immediately, but warned of consequences if they were ignored.“If our opponents on the other side — first and foremost the US, but also other countries, allies, the so-called allies of the US — refuse, try to torpedo the whole thing, they will inevitably encounter a further worsening of their own security situation,” Ryabkov said.Russia and the US will discuss some of the proposals as part of an ongoing strategic security dialogue about nuclear weapons, Ryabkov said.“We need to avoid a new missile crisis in Europe before it’s too late,” he added.Additional reporting by Katrina Manson in Washington and Henry Foy in Brussels
196  At the Findlerhof restaurant, high above the Swiss village of Zermatt, the terrace is packed.On the first day of the season in one of Europe’s top ski resorts, staff are flitting between tables to pour chilled champagne and wine, switching between English, French, Italian and German as they welcome back guests from across the continent after almost two years of severe coronavirus-related disruption.But the continuing uncertainty has made for a difficult few weeks as the restaurant prepared to open. The Findlerhof brings up most of its food and wine in October before the first snows set in, but this year it has brought in just half of what it would normally.“We’re all a little more careful, especially here in the mountains,” said manager Francis Schwery. “We just don’t know if the government will close things down for one or even two months. Everyone is just a little more scared — the situation can change from day to day.”Across the Alps, the winter season is off to a faltering start as memories of spring 2020 loom large. Then, Alpine resorts such as Ischgl in Austria became notorious as coronavirus superspreaders after remaining open even as the pandemic ravaged neighbouring Italy. Visitors from across the continent partied in packed bars and carried the virus home with them, prompting a wave of international condemnation.This year authorities are acting with caution. Austria has been in lockdown since late November, and the country’s low vaccination rate, coupled with the emergence of the Omicron variant, has dashed hopes of an easy return to normal for its multibillion-euro mountain sports industry. Restaurants and bars across most of the country can open again from Sunday but in ski resorts must remain closed.In France and Italy, nervousness about potential restrictions is palpable. Last season both countries moved early to shut ski resorts amid fears about repeating the first wave of the pandemic.French prime minister Jean Castex said on a November trip to Manigod in Haute-Savoie that he wanted to guarantee a “dignified season”. Masks would be necessary on lifts, he said, but stressed the situation would need to be reviewed. Covid-19 certificates showing proof of full vaccination, a negative test or recovery from the disease will be required to access the slopes.In Italy, only fully vaccinated visitors, those with a negative test or those who show proof of recovery will be able to access indoor public and entertainment spaces, including in ski resorts.All visitors to Switzerland must take a PCR test before flying and a second PCR or antigen test between four and seven days after arrival. Bern announced on Friday that entry into hospitality venues would now require proof of vaccination or recovery from Covid-19. A negative test alone will not be enough.On November 27, the federal government imposed a 10-day quarantine on arrivals from countries that had reported Omicron cases. Bern rescinded the requirement barely a week later, but in the Alpine cantons the damage was done — thousands of December bookings were cancelled.According to the NZZ newspaper, one hotel in Zermatt lost €160,000 worth of custom the day after the quarantine was imposed.Scott, a skier from London queueing in acid-yellow ski pants for a cable car, said the quarantine rule almost ruined his plans. “Normally I would be skiing as much of the season as I could,” he said. “It must be so damaging for local people.so much business lost. There needs to be consistency.”The region pays a high economic price if the winter sports season is curbed. In the Alps themselves, winter tourism dominates local economies, accounting for up to half of jobs in some villages in the peak season. Skiing is responsible for about half of Switzerland’s tourism revenues, contributing about 2.5 per cent of gross domestic product, according to government statistics. In Austria the industry accounts for up to 4 per cent of GDP, official figures show. By comparison, carmaking in Germany accounts for 5 per cent of GDP.Nobody wants a repeat of last season, when billions in revenues were lost. Confidence is crucial, says Martin Nydegger, chief executive of Switzerland’s tourism association. “Quarantines are tourism killer number one, there’s no sugar coating it.”This year he estimates visitor numbers to the country’s slopes might amount to about 80 per cent of their 2019 peak if governments do not panic. He hopes Switzerland’s reputation for orderliness and cleanliness will give tourists the confidence that the country is safe and open.“We have working vaccines, we have a test regime and we have 12 months more experience,” he said. “The pragmatic, liberal way is definitely in our interest.”Despite the uncertainty, in Zermatt preparations are under way for the big parties of the festive season. Christina Villano, manager of Elsie’s wine bar, recalled last New Year’s Eve, when she had to throw away lobsters, caviar and oysters bought for a booked-out gala evening that was cancelled when the resort was locked down on December 28. They did not return to work all winter.“It was really bad.It was a lot of money for us to lose and we cried. We’re a little place, and we only buy in fresh food,” she said.Villano remained hopeful for the coming weeks. On a recent Friday evening, Elsie’s was packed with visitors, ordering Bordeaux and Burgundy and enjoying platters of snails and melted Belper Knolle, a local cheese.“We’re just not sure what the next few weeks will be like. We have to wait every day and see what’s happening with this new variant,” she said. “The government, of course, has to do what is best. But this has been going on so long, and we’ve done everything they’ve asked, with the vaccine, with masks, with distancing.we also have to think about our livelihoods.”
197  When Russia first began massing troops, tanks and artillery on its border with Ukraine in March, Vladimir Putin insisted the deployments were just a snap exercise.But as the build-up has continued to swell to as many as 175,000 personnel, the US has warned allies the Russian leader may be planning a renewed invasion for real this time — and found Moscow in an increasingly belligerent mood.In the past few days alone, Putin has likened Ukraine’s policy in the Donbas, the border region where Russia has led a slow-burning separatist war since 2014, to “genocide” — words Kyiv fears may be a pretext to invade.Russian officials have vowed to intervene if Ukraine attempts to retake the region — which Kyiv sees as a thinly veiled threat of a Russian offensive. Sergei Ryabkov, a deputy foreign minister, even said the stand-off with the US over the country was the worst since the 1962 Cuban Missile crisis.US president Joe Biden has rushed to de-escalate the tensions by offering Putin talks with Nato allies about Russia’s longstanding grievances with the transatlantic security alliance in a video call on Tuesday — although he also issued a threat of severe economic consequences in the event of an invasion.“I don’t think this is over by any means,” says Samuel Charap, a Russia expert at Rand Corporation, a US-based think-tank. “It seems unlikely that a promise to talk is going to be enough for Putin to declare victory and send the boys home to Siberia for New Years.”Officials and analysts in Washington and Europe — and even people close to the Kremlin in Moscow — admit Putin’s true intentions with Ukraine remain a mystery. Some speculate the troop build-up is a form of “reflexive control” that Russia has used to pressure the US into halting Nato’s expansion. Others see the aspersions Putin casts on Ukraine’s statehood as a sign the president is now willing to solve what he sees as the key foreign policy dilemma of his two decades in power with force if necessary.“This is his life’s work. Everything he’s done as president has been about fighting Nato expansion,” says Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of political consultancy R.Politik. “So now he thinks it’s either now or never.”In July, Putin published a 5,000-word article about Ukraine that alternated between professions of love for Russia’s “brotherly nation” and thinly veiled threats against Kyiv should it continue to drift away from Moscow.It cast doubt on Ukraine’s continued existence within its current borders, argued that “the true sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership with Russia”, and vowed that Moscow would never allow it to become an “anti-Russia”.The essay, apparently based on Putin’s own historical research, indicated how crucial Ukraine is to Russia’s conception of its own statehood — and how much Putin’s thinking on it has hardened since Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014.“When Putin writes an article like that, it shows you that the state has really made a step forward,” says Konstantin Malofeyev, an Orthodox Christian tycoon who has close ties to the Donbas rebels and funds a Fox News-style online news channel seen as a bellwether for the hawkish fringe of Moscow’s elite.“In the ’90s, pro-western liberal rhetoric was dominant in Russia and we were on the sidelines shouting that Russia has a special path,” adds Malofeyev. “Now, under Putin, we’re at the heart of things, because Putin thinks like us.”Malofeyev dreams of an “imperial scenario” under which Ukraine will return to the Russian fold and eventually be subsumed into it — if necessary, by force.“We are a divided people, just like Germany under the BRD and DDR” during the cold war, he says. “The war won’t last a week. It’ll be over in a matter of days. The whole regime will wind up in London and go around telling everyone that they would have ridden their tanks into Moscow if the [west] hadn’t given up on them,” he says.The US has shared intelligence to convince even the most sceptical European allies that Putin may be prepared to make good on Russia’s quasi-imperial ambitions early next year but has yet to conclude precisely when or if he may give the order to invade.Russia’s continuing military deployment, while larger than that seen earlier this year, is still missing some critical equipment and capabilities typically required for a sustained offensive, says a senior western intelligence official, adding that these elements could be brought to the border rapidly if needed.“[Putin] has to take into account his pain-versus-gain calculation, and think about when diplomacy will be more fruitful and when threat of force is more fruitful, and be very dynamic,” says the official.If Russia were to attack using the troops that the US says are being readied, “it would be the largest conflict on the European continent since World War Two”, the official adds. “To think that conflict would be contained to one nation is foolish.”Some officials and analysts believe the bloody prospect of open warfare on Ukraine’s eastern border — where 14,000 have already died since 2014 in a conflict that Russia insists, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, it is not party to — means Putin is unlikely to resort to force.Instead, they point to his demands for talks with the US on “legally binding security guarantees” over what Putin has called Russia’s “red lines”: namely, that Nato will commit to ceasing its eastward expansion and refraining from deploying troops or weapons in Ukraine that could be used to attack Russia.Putin’s hostility to the alliance dates back to the mid-2000s, when Nato expanded into former Soviet territory for the first time by admitting Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and the US deployed missile defence systems in Poland and Romania that Moscow feared could be used against it.“The world made a big mistake by driving us into a corner. Yes, we are paranoid and have our Soviet hangover, but it takes several generations to get over it,” says a former senior Russian official.“We were traumatised,” the former official adds. “America is the most powerful country and should have listened to us, but you were drunk on your own power — giving orders, saying that you are for everything good and everyone else is against freedom and democracy. You should have been more sympathetic.”Following his call with Putin on Tuesday, Biden said that he would announce talks between Russia, the US, and a group of Nato allies to discuss Moscow’s demands for a new security order. However, Jake Sullivan, national security adviser, also said the president had made no “commitments or concessions” regarding excluding Ukraine from Nato.Any future summit on Nato expansion “would be a significant achievement for Moscow, because they’ve recognised there’s a problem”, says Fyodor Lukyanov, editor of the Russia in Global Affairs Journal and an adviser to the Kremlin on foreign policy. “Neither the Americans nor the Europeans did that before — they said there were no problems with security in Europe, just problems with Russia. But if they need to meet, that means there’s something to talk about.”The possible summit has alarmed some US allies on Nato’s eastern flank, who have questioned Biden’s overreliance on so-called Quint countries — France, the UK, Germany, Italy and the US — in its diplomatic overtures at the expense of consulting closely with Ukraine and Baltic states most affected by Russian aggression.“It’s good that the US is leaning forward on this but we as Europeans feel discomfort for the fact that Ukraine is not a bigger part of the conversation and a number of countries such as Lithuania, Estonia and Poland who have been incredibly supportive of Ukraine are not part of that conversion,” says a European diplomat.Kyiv believes that any compromise deal between the US and Russia would probably involve the delaying of any plans to offer Ukraine a Nato Membership Action Plan (MAP), a process by which potential alliance states seek membership, a senior Ukrainian official told the FT.Nato declared its hope in 2008 that Ukraine would eventually become a member of the alliance alongside Georgia, but has taken no practical steps to admit it since Russia fought a devastating four-day war in the Caucasus country and occupied two breakaway Georgian territories.The Russian foreign ministry demanded the alliance rescind that pledge on Friday as part of a proposed list of guarantees.“The US obviously wants to freeze this issue and get it off the table. It is a major irritant [in relations with Russia],” says the Ukrainian official. “And they are of course more preoccupied with China.”The terms put forward by Putin also make reaching an agreement difficult, Lukyanov says, because they would require the west to abandon its core security principles since the end of the cold war: that countries are free to choose their own foreign policy trajectory and no powers have the right to a sphere of influence.“It’ll be funny if the six of them get together, Putin lays out everything he’s been saying, and they tell him, ‘Listen, dear Vladimir, what are you on about? We told you from the start that Nato’s not a threat to Russia, so why are you so nervous? We won’t do anything, just keep on peacefully expanding, because it’s freedom, democracy, and stability.’ It’s absurd,” Lukyanov says.Brussels views the situation on the border as part of a broader campaign by Russia against the EU and its partners, commission officials have said, aligning it with the use of migrants by Moscow ally Belarus to pressure eastern EU states and the use of gas supplies to strong-arm Moldova into reducing its levels of engagement with the EU.European commission officials are in daily contact with the Biden administration to discuss potential deterrence measures, a senior EU official said, but no detailed measures are expected to be announced by the 27-member bloc at a summit of leaders next week.“We will be reacting very robustly in terms of the sanctions we will propose,” the senior EU official said, referring to “the economic and financial side”.The US is pushing the EU and its member states to propose strong measures that would give Putin pause for thought, but is aware that the most far-reaching sanctions — targeting Russian energy exports or cutting off the country from the Swift international payments system — would undoubtedly hurt European economies more than the US.“It all comes down to the west’s risk appetite and willingness to bear those costs,” says Maria Shagina, a visiting fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. “There are not many options where the west has nothing to lose.”Some Russia experts in the US worry the Biden administration’s effort to telegraph the extent of possible US concessions may not be sufficient to deter Putin from taking a dramatic military step next spring.They warn against reading too much into US-led efforts to hear Putin’s grievances over Nato. The administration has already indicated it would not concede to Putin’s demands for a blanket ban on enlarging Nato eastward.“There’s very little reason to think that an issue of such cardinal importance for Putin is just going to disappear from the agenda,” says Andrew Weiss, a former Russia director of the US National Security Council. “Putin cares too much about Ukraine to listen to what the administration has been saying and respond with ‘Oh well, I guess I don’t care that much any more.’”Letter in response to this article:Neutrality would answer the Ukraine question / From Jack Helfenstein, Horgenberg, Switzerland
198  Hungary has avoided an immediate legal battle with Brussels after the country’s constitutional court stopped short of disputing the primacy of EU law.Friday’s ruling came in a case over immigration, which was brought by Hungary’s government in response to a verdict by the EU’s top court last year.Many legal experts had expected Hungary might follow Poland, where the constitutional tribunal called some EU legislation “incompatible” with Polish rules — a decision that stepped up Warsaw’s battle with Brussels over the rule of law. Hungary and Poland have previously helped each other to stave off disciplinary procedures by Brussels over breaches of EU rules.Hungary’s constitutional court said the country had the right to make its own laws where there was “incomplete” exercise of competences between the EU and member states.But the court declined to examine the specific 2020 ruling by the European Court of Justice. In that ruling, the ECJ held that Hungary’s asylum system illegally pushed migrants back without a due process, a practice that Hungary said was necessary to maintain order at the border amid continued pressure from migrants.“In the current case the procedure does not include an examination of the primacy of EU law,” the court said in its ruling.It added that Hungary retained the right to preserve its “constitutional identity”, which might change irreversibly if immigrants became part of the population — leaving open a window for the government to mount further legal challenges.Hungarian premier Viktor Orban has long fought what he views as increasing legal interference from the EU. The issue is again assuming more prominence ahead of an election next year when Orban is expected to face the most serious challenge since he took office in 2010.Senior government members said the court ruling backed Hungary’s record in dealing with migrants, and continued to dispute the ECJ ruling.Justice minister Judit Varga, who brought the case to the constitutional court, wrote on Facebook that the EU had no effective repatriation procedure for migrants already in the country, so legal procedures would only mean that migrants who arrive in Europe illegally end up staying.“The debate also pointed to the inevitable need of reforming EU rules on migration,” she added.She said Hungary “continues to be a dedicated member of the European Union”.A commission spokesperson said that the European Commission will analyse the ruling in detail, stressing how recently the decision had been announced. But the spokesperson added: “We understand that the ruling does not as such challenge the principle of the primacy of EU law.” Laurent Pech, an EU law expert at Middlesex University London, said the judges “sought to preserve what is left of their legal credibility by refusing to review the specific judgment of the ECJ targeted by the government.”The Constitutional Court, stacked by Orban loyalists, has been stripped of many of its former powers in recent years, and rarely stands up to the government.Orban’s chief of staff Gergely Gulyas called the ruling “the most important reinforcement of the Hungarian government’s policies” on migration, and added Hungary would continue to operate its asylum system without changes.Petra Bard, a legal expert at the Central European University Democracy Institute, said that the ruling “contained quite a few hidden mines,” leaving scope to examine the supremacy of EU law down the line.Bard said the most worrisome aspect of the ruling was its argument about preserving the social environment as an element of Hungarian identity.“This is a very bad message,” she said. “The Court must guard human rights, not serve up constitutionally dressed-up arguments for intolerance.”
199  US president Joe Biden came to office proclaiming that the defining issue of the current era was whether democracies would prove more successful than non-democracies. Nearly a year later, the challenges to democracy have only intensified. Washington has warned that China seems to have been rehearsing for military operations against Taiwan; Biden this week held a video call with Vladimir Putin after Russia positioned tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine’s borders. Yet the president’s handling of the epochal contest — notably with his ill-conceived online “Summit for Democracy” this week — has appeared less sure-footed than many allies hoped when he was elected.Biden dealt with elements of the Putin meeting well. Unusual intelligence-sharing with Nato and EU members helped to rally support for deterrent measures against a Russian invasion of Ukraine. The threat of sanctions such as blocking rouble conversion into dollars and restricting Russian sovereign debt trading on secondary markets should give the Kremlin serious pause. Western allies have signalled the newly-built Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea to Germany could be blocked if Russia invades — though this nakedly geopolitical project should have been stopped long before now.There were arguments, too, for Biden to challenge Putin to de-escalate by offering talks related to Moscow’s concerns about Nato’s potential expansion to Ukraine. Yet the US president went about this the wrong way. It is not clear he made a pullback of Russian forces a precondition. By signalling inclusion of Russia and four larger Nato allies, he played into Putin’s attempts to return to great power bargaining. Biden had to reassure Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky and nine eastern European Nato members that he had not made concessions to Russian pressure and that Ukraine will be “at the table” for any talks where it is on the agenda.Those calls made an awkward backdrop to day one of Biden’s misjudged summit of democracies. Formal organisations have long existed that require adherence to democratic values, notably Nato and the EU. Convening an informal “club” of democracies raises awkward questions over who gets invited. Why the illiberal Polish government, but not Hungary? Why India, a US ally whose democracy is moving in the wrong direction, not Turkey? Why some weak African democracies, but not some more established ones from Asia?White House officials have hinted that the diversity was intended to signal the summit was not a self-congratulatory exercise and all democracies have room for improvement, including the US — after protesters stormed the Capitol in January. There may be value in sharing notes on tackling corruption and institution-building. Yet there is a danger of giving credence to the autocrats’ propaganda that democracy is on the wane — especially in Biden’s message of a “global democratic recession”.Even then, such initiatives risk provoking counter-alliances. The Russian and Chinese envoys to the US wrote an unusual joint article accusing the Biden administration of cold war-style stoking of “ideological confrontation”.For America, resolve, self-belief and clarity on its own red lines and readiness to defend them are key to bolstering democracy. Freedom House, which has tracked the recent decline in global democracies to which Biden referred, also warns leading nations must “put their own houses in order”. This is a matter for Republicans, too; Biden lacks the votes to enact protections for US democracy even as states pass laws to limit access to the ballot. Solidarity with fellow democracies matters, but so does leading by example.Letter in response to this article:Democracy is prerequisite for Indian national survival / From Simren Kaur, Jalandhar City, Punjab, India
200  Spanish football clubs have voted overwhelmingly in favour of La Liga’s controversial €2bn financing deal with private equity group CVC, thwarting a last-ditch effort by Real Madrid and FC Barcelona to derail the plan.La Liga, which runs the top two divisions of professional football in Spain, said on Friday that 37 of 42 clubs backed the deal with CVC, which hands the firm a slice of La Liga’s revenues over the next 50 years in exchange for an immediate injection of funds.The first €400m instalment is expected to reach clubs within weeks, a boon for a football league whose finances have been hit by the pandemic. Four teams voted against the deal and another abstained.“I am confident it will be a watershed positive moment for these clubs,” said Javier Tebas, La Liga president. “It will mean they will be able to improve their infrastructures for fans to enjoy, develop their international brand and collectively take giant steps to continue improving this league’s stature around the world.”CVC will invest €2bn to partner with La Liga, through its company LOARRE, which will be entitled to 8.2 per cent of the Spanish league’s “commercial profits” — meaning its revenues, minus costs from setting up a new commercial entity — for the next 50 years.Those clubs that did not participate will not gain any CVC funding, but will also keep a full share of all future La Liga revenues without having to give up any cash to the private equity fund. After winning approval from the country’s clubs, the deal is expected to be signed this weekend.It is a significant victory for Tebas over Real boss Florentino Pérez, the construction tycoon, and Joan Laporta, Barcelona president, who had backed an alternative deal they had drawn up with Spanish advisory group Key Capital.Just days before the vote, Real Madrid and Barcelona, the country’s two most successful clubs, teamed up with Athletic Bilbao to offer an alternative financing package that they argued would potentially be €12bn cheaper for clubs than CVC’s offer over the long term. But the deal received little traction from other Spanish clubs.Real and Barca have maintained that La Liga’s deal is economically unattractive because it involves handing over a slice of the league’s broadcast and media rights to CVC in order to obtain money upfront.Intense rivals on the pitch, the two clubs have argued that the Luxembourg-based buyout group stands to profit handsomely from the agreement. It is a view shared by the Royal Spanish Football Federation, the domestic governing body.However, La Liga has insisted that CVC has the pedigree and knowhow to help the competition close the commercial gap with the English Premier League, the biggest domestic football division by revenue.CVC has a long history in sports, spanning Formula One and Moto GP motor racing series, as well as recent investments in rugby, cricket and volleyball.La Liga clubs’ revenues dropped 8 per cent to €3.1bn in the 2019-20 season, according to consultancy Deloitte, while its English rivals generated €5.1bn.Roughly 70 per cent of the CVC injection is earmarked for spending on infrastructure investment, brand and product development, communications, technology and digital content, with the remainder available to spend on players and debt refinancing.
201  The EU will announce sanctions against Russia’s Wagner Group next week in response to the mercenary organisation’s alleged human rights abuses in Ukraine, Syria and Libya.Western countries believe that the Kremlin uses the group, which the EU says has close financial links with a longtime friend of Russian president Vladimir Putin, to give it deniable leverage in overseas conflicts.The EU sanctions against Wagner, three related entities and eight individuals will include a ban on travel to the EU and a freeze of any assets held inside the bloc, said a senior EU official who did not want to be named before the decision is formally endorsed by EU foreign ministers on Monday.They come a little over a year after Brussels imposed sanctions on its alleged backer Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Russian caterer-turned-warlord nicknamed “Putin’s chef” for his close links to the Kremlin. Prigozhin on Friday said in a statement that he had no ties to Wagner.The punitive measures will complicate EU ties and financial arrangements with governments engaging with Wagner. Brussels and Paris have threatened to withdraw support for Mali after the country’s government said it was considering hiring the Russian mercenaries to help stem a jihadi insurgency.“We are now sanctioning the Wagner Group itself, along with. three entities and eight individuals connected with it,” the senior EU official said on Friday. The move will be legally based on four separate EU sanctions regimes.“Wagner is acting in Syria, acting in Libya, in Ukraine [undermining] territorial integrity and. these individuals are linked to gross violations of human rights,” said the official.Ministers will also adopt a sanctions regime relating to Mali, that will be set up to target “people who oppose the transition process or [are] being obstacles to the transition process,” the official added.Prigozhin denies US allegations that he bankrolls Wagner. The Kremlin says mercenaries are banned under Russian law. Representatives for Prigozhin did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Wagner participated in the Russian invasion and annexation of Crimea in 2014, and the subsequent conflict that erupted in eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian troops and Moscow-backed separatists.Since then, the paramilitary group has been involved in conflicts in Syria, Libya, Mozambique, Sudan and the Central African Republic, operating in line with official Russian foreign policy objectives. Human rights activists have raised the alarm over abuse allegedly perpetrated by Wagner soldiers in the Central African Republic.Its activities in that country and in Libya and its potential move into Mali have increased pressure on Brussels to attempt to curb its activities, particularly from France, which has deployed 5,000 troops to fight Islamist extremists in Mali and across the Sahel.Additional reporting by Max Seddon in Moscow
202  Seven years after Russia annexed Crimea and backed a separatist uprising in eastern Ukraine, the US and its European allies are putting President Vladimir Putin on alert. Yet more military aggression against Ukraine will result in measures more severe than the economic and political sanctions the western allies imposed in 2014.“If, in fact, he invades Ukraine, there will be severe consequences.and economic consequences like none he’s ever seen or ever have been seen,” President Joe Biden said on Wednesday.What might he have in mind? For one thing, Washington is pressing Germany’s new coalition government to be ready to stop the opening of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a project that would increase Russian gas exports to western Europe but, in US eyes, would make Ukraine more vulnerable to Kremlin pressure.Apart from that, there have been suggestions in Washington foreign policy circles that the Biden administration could unsheathe American dollar power. In particular, speculation is rife that Russia could be cut off from access to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or Swift, an important system for international money transfers. This is sometimes dubbed the “nuclear option” — though no weapons would be involved.So far, the Biden administration has carefully avoided saying that steps to shut out Russia from Swift are under consideration. Moreover, despite their public rhetoric, both Washington and Moscow know that the shock value of US economic sanctions has been somewhat dulled by overuse in recent decades.Most economic sanctions used by US presidents are implemented under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the successor law to the 1917 Trading with the Enemy Act. There have been more emergencies than most can remember. A congressional agency found in July 2020 that there had been 59 declared national emergencies since 1977, of which 33 were still going on.The IEEPA gives the president extraordinary powers to block dollar flows, freeze the use of the payments system, impose tariffs and restrict exports. These have been used against “rogue state” officials, terrorists, drug lords, cyber hackers, money-laundering banks and regimes considered hostile to US interests.A mini-industry in Washington services people and companies listed as “specially designated nationals”, a label that makes you unwelcome at a lot of banks and airports around the world. The list is maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the US Treasury. Ofac staff have access to financial, intelligence and law enforcement records.As the list of sanctioned people and countries has lengthened, Washington has appreciated that it has created a sort of anti-alliance stretching from powerful figures in Venezuela and Iran to North Korea’s ruling Kim family. Those targeted by the US shared contacts in the gold, cryptocurrency and money laundering world.Besides that, rival powers such as China or Russia might turn a blind eye to sanctions-busting. And there has been a growing risk to the dollar’s attractiveness as a reserve currency and medium of exchange. If the world relied less on the dollar system, the US would find it harder to finance its government and corporate deficits overseas.So when some US policymakers air the idea of cutting off Russia’s access to Swift, the Ofac people cough and look at the ceiling.Until last month, Michael Parker was a prosecutor in the US Department of Justice’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, where he worked closely with former colleagues at the Ofac. Now he heads the money laundering and sanctions division of Ferrari Associates, a Washington law firm. As he sees it, “cutting Russia off from Swift, absent any other action against Russia, serves only as a deep annoyance. Swift, remember, is just a communication system.”Swift, based in Belgium, serves as the primary secured messaging system that ties together the world’s correspondent bank relationships. But another former senior Ofac official says: “Swift is just one mechanism. There are other means to do direct payments between banks. They could go back to using telexes, as they did in the past.”This former official adds: “If you politicise a Europe-based institution such as Swift, then you encourage countries like Russia and China to set up their own system. So there are tremendous disadvantages to a Swift cut-off to implement a policy decision.”A Russian attack on Ukraine would trigger some US financial sanctions. But they might not include ending access to the Swift system.Letter in response to this article:Putin’s policies reflect country’s siege mentality / From Mergen Mongush, Moscow, Russia
203  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
204  When she describes the previous primary battle five years ago among France’s centre-right politicians, Valérie Pécresse recalls the proverb used by one of those in the losing camp: “If two dogs are fighting for a bone, it’s the third dog that shows up and wins the bone.” Pécresse herself has just pulled off the same trick in the latest primary among members of the country’s Les Républicains party, defeating favourites such as Michel Barnier, the EU’s former Brexit negotiator, to win the nomination as candidate for next year’s presidential election.The 54-year-old career politician, currently the elected leader of the Ile-de-France region that includes Paris, now stands a good chance of thwarting Emmanuel Macron’s re-election bid in April and becoming France’s first woman president.“For the first time in its history, the party of General de Gaulle, of Georges Pompidou, of Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy will have a female candidate to run for the presidential election,” Pécresse told cheering supporters in Paris last weekend. She describes herself as “two-thirds [Angela] Merkel and one-third [Margaret] Thatcher” and says she gets things done. “My opponents call me the Iron Lady,” she told the Financial Times this year.“I think she’ll be a really serious challenger,” says a friend who has known her since university days. “She’s a relentlessly hard worker and has been a formidable minister.” Sarkozy, whom she served as minister for higher education and the budget, also praised her diligence, saying he only wished she could have been “a bit more fun”. But the latest opinion polls indicate that Pécresse was a wise choice for the centre-right.According to a poll of voting intentions from Elabe for BFM TV, L’Express and SFR, she would defeat far-right contenders such as Marine Le Pen and Eric Zemmour and garner 20 per cent of first-round votes, qualifying her for the second round against Macron on 23 per cent. More significantly, the poll suggests she would go on to defeat the president in the runoff by 52 per cent to 48. “It’s the first time any published poll has Emmanuel Macron losing,” Elabe said.“She’s very often been underestimated,” says Vincent Martigny, a politics professor at the University of Nice. “She’s very determined, very motivated, a hard worker, she has got a lot of ministerial experience and she’s been leading the most important region of France.” She will not have an easy campaign, however. Married with three children, Pécresse is depicted by her political enemies as a comfortable, Roman Catholic bourgeoise based in the prosperous western suburbs of Paris in a country where voters supposedly appreciate provincial roots — although she has taken pains to emphasise her Corsican and southern origins and to point out that the region she runs has some of the toughest quartiers in France.Pécresse has learnt Russian and Japanese as well as English and is also a graduate of two of France’s top institutions, HEC Paris (the Ecole des hautes études commerciales), and — like Macron — of ENA (the Ecole Nationale d’Administration). “She is the quintessence of the French elite,” says Martigny.She also risks being dragged into uncomfortable political territory by her party — which moved so sharply to the right that she temporarily abandoned it in 2019 — and by the pugnacious mood among white voters whose antipathy to Muslim immigrants and demand for draconian law and order measures have been stoked by Le Pen and Zemmour.Her proposal, revived in this campaign, to double sentences for serious crimes committed in difficult suburbs where the police are often in danger was greeted with puzzlement by some critics. They noted that she had long taught constitutional law and been a member of the Council of State and should have known that it was unconstitutional to discriminate in this way.Pécresse is a moderate by the increasingly conservative standards of the LR, but her hardline stance on law and order and her commitment to economic reform and fiscal orthodoxy will play well on the French right.She has accused Macron of “raiding the till” to splash out taxpayers’ money during the pandemic, and has vowed that she will cut 200,000 administrative jobs from the country’s bloated civil service — something Macron promised but has failed to do during his five years in office.“Emmanuel Macron has only one obsession — to please (plaire). I have only one obsession — to act (faire),” she told her supporters in a rhyming critique of what she sees as the incumbent president’s lack of commitment to the hard reforms that France needs.Macron, who came to power declaring that he was “neither right nor left”, had no trouble demolishing Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right Rassemblement National, in a televised debate before the final round of the previous presidential election in 2017, and he would have been comfortable facing Le Pen again this time.Pécresse, politically the closest to Macron of all his main rivals for 2022, is another matter. She knows her history and economics as well as he does and has a solid record in government. Pécresse’s friend of three decades says: “Faced with a competent woman, I don’t see Macron being very comfortable.”
205  Will 2022 be a year of risk or reward? There will be good investment opportunities in the markets next year but they will be balanced against the danger of shocks, as policymakers grapple with the pandemic, inflation, and climate change — as well as the Ukraine crisis and profound upheaval in China.That’s the view of a panel of investment experts brought together by FT Money this week to debate the possible twists and turns of the financial markets over the next 12 months.With the global recovery from the 2020 recession now well in train, they expect further economic growth next year. But they worry a lot about inflation. If policymakers clamp down too hard, they could threaten the recovery. If they go too gently, price increases could escape out of control and require more drastic action later.“It’s a catch-22,” says Salman Ahmed, global head of strategic asset allocation at Fidelity International. He expects central banks will focus more on keeping borrowing costs low, so that servicing the world’s huge debts remains sustainable. He says: “The road to that can create a lot of downside risk if the market starts questioning the inflation credibility of the key central banks.” Meaning there could be a sharp sell-off in stocks and bonds.But, says Ahmed, there is an “upside risk” that investors will avoid this fate because a continuing flow of easy money from the central banks will keep liquidity pouring into the markets. “That will then push everybody to buy equities.because you have nothing else to buy.”Ahmed is cautiously optimistic that next year these forces will play out in a fairly benign way, with inflation perhaps settling at about 3 per cent.For Merryn Somerset Webb, the FT Money columnist, this is altogether too rosy. It’s “very complacent” to assume that policymakers can somehow manage to keep inflation at about 3 per cent and the economy growing, she says. “Wouldn’t it be wonderful? We’ll gradually erode the debt and everything will be absolutely fine. But it seems incredibly unlikely to me.”Somerset Webb says that with labour shortages and supply bottlenecks it’s “not that outrageous” to predict double-digit inflation “for a short period, maybe even for a lengthy period. And I’m pretty sure that central banks aren’t prepared for that.”She adds, somewhat provocatively, that perhaps the low inflation of recent years has “absolutely nothing to do with central banks” but was driven by economic changes — globalisation and the rise of China — which reduced labour costs. “We may now be entering a different period of higher inflation which, again, central banks will have absolutely no control over.”Somerset Webb and Ahmed joined a panel that included two other fund managers — Anna Macdonald of Amati Global Investors and Simon Edelsten of Artemis Fund Managers — plus Gavin Jackson, the FT’s economics editorial writer.We met over sandwiches and mince pies at the FT’s London headquarters in Bracken House, unlike last year when our panel convened over a video link. This year, we got in just before the pandemic cast a new cloud over the outlook, with the UK government’s latest appeal to work from home.Of course, all predictions are uncertain. But our panellists agreed that the pandemic makes forecasting even more difficult than usual, especially as it coincides with a sharp increase in political tensions. We talked about China and the threat it poses to Taiwan, Russia’s belligerent approach to its neighbours, and the Middle East.Macdonald says that from an investment point of view the biggest geopolitical issue is China-Taiwan, with so much of the global semiconductor industry based in Taiwan. “That would be a significant issue and I’m not clear about how we would all respond to it.”But, reflecting widely held views in markets, she adds: “I don’t actually think that is as likely as [conflict between] Russia and Ukraine. Given what lies ahead for China this year [including containing Covid], I don’t think invading Taiwan is top of their list. I do think that Russia is possibly more unpredictable.”Ahmed says: “I would agree with that assessment. China is the most important one for a long-term perspective. It’s a big market. It’s a huge economy, a complex economy, a different economic model.” But “given the recent history” including the occupation of Crimea in 2014, Russia “is a more volatile” country.Ahmed adds that Russia’s “economic importance has reduced because of ongoing sanctions”. But because Russia is a big energy exporter, “we’ll have to watch oil obviously very, very closely. That’s the transmission channel to the rest of the world” — not least for Europe, which is dependent on Russian gas.Jackson throws the Middle East into the mix, arguing that it was puzzling that Iran was no longer in the headlines when only two years ago it topped the geopolitical risk agenda. He says: “I guess I’m always surprised by how confident people are in the authorities’ ability to handle things.”As befits financial specialists our panel mostly focus on money and the markets. They agree that the pandemic has created unprecedented conditions. Or as Edelsten puts it: “This is undoubtedly the weirdest equity market I’ve ever seen.”Economics textbooks predict that when inflation rises so do bond yields. However, bond yields have barely moved, even though inflation has now increased in the US and Europe. As long as bond yields stay low, equities seem to be stable. But Edelsten says: “But equity markets can’t cope if that bond yield starts to move very quickly to the inflation level [which is currently around 3 percentage points higher]. Western equities will go down, though Asia has less inflation and may cope.The universal bullishness doesn’t necessarily fit very comfortably with some of these issues.”Jackson adds that economic growth will slow since most of the pandemic recovery has already taken place, especially in the US and UK. “In the UK it will feel like a slowdown because we will also have tax rises coming in, we might have an interest rate rise and we will have higher prices.”On top of that comes the fast-spreading Omicron variant of Covid-19. Jackson says: “I think it will be very hard for investors over the next year because with things like Omicron, we don’t really know what the impact will be yet on inflation. It could make it worse. So if you’ve got slower growth and potentially higher inflation, that puts everybody in a tough spot.”Macdonald warns that supply shortages in China may persist, contributing to global inflationary pressures. The authorities are determined to fight Covid, including with lockdowns, especially with the Winter Olympics due early next year and the Communist Party Congress later. She says: “So they want a steady year. That can mean they will still try to be very draconian in shutting down any kind of outbreaks that they see, which will jam up supply chains.”She adds: “In the past, I think if you had a single supply chain issue, you could perhaps model that it might take six months to resolve. But the problem now is that these [issues] are coming in lots and lots of different ways.”So how to take account of inflation in choosing stocks? Edelsten counsels savers to focus on Asia, where there is “very, very little inflation”. He also recommends sectors which manage inflation well. Railways, for instance, where companies have proved adept at passing on price increases to consumers. He says: “They’ve been doing it for 100 years. In fact, they’re so good at it that generally they have to be regulated and told not to do so.”Another winner could be robots, for their value in replacing workers during times of labour shortage. “Japanese robot manufacturers have got loads of orders,” he says.For Somerset Webb a good option in inflationary times is value stocks, which she argues have long been neglected in favour of growth stocks such as tech companies. “It does come to a point when a cycle has to turn around.”She particularly likes energy and mining stocks, arguing that these sectors have seen capital investment drop in recent years amid concerns about climate change. She says: “And that’s going to continue going forward as we have this kind of huge political drive towards net zero, et cetera. You know, politics is way ahead of practicalities, and that’s going to make a big difference to energy prices and to commodity prices.”Even the green revolution requires metals and energy to produce the necessary new infrastructure. “You need a lot of stuff that we haven’t been investing in enough to make to get us to where we want to go.”Macdonald agrees on the appeal of commodities, saying: “We do see a huge amount of opportunity in some of those [companies]”.Edelsten argues it’s time to be more focused on value and valuation. He says: “For me when the macro fundamentals are getting worse, I just think one should be much, much more cautious about valuation and much more thorough about it. I have moved my fund from being very growth oriented to being more of a balance.”Panellists still see opportunities in tech, but with a much greater focus on larger groups with reliable earnings. Ahmed says: “There is a big difference between profitable and unprofitable tech stocks.”Edelsten argues that established tech giants are seeing such large and increasing profits that they can reasonably be valued in the traditional way, in terms of a price/earnings ratio. He gives Alphabet, the owner of Google, as an example. “I think it’s on 26 times earnings next year.it’s got a normal valuation. It’s a very stable, incredibly profitable business. Be nice to have a yield at some point.”But at the other end of the spectrum are “the very young tech companies correlated” with electric carmaker Tesla, which has seen stratospheric stock market performance. “So there are bits of the American equity market which look very, very dangerously valued indeed. That bit of tech will have a difficult time, a very difficult year,” Edelsten says.Could a Tesla stock market plunge trigger a wider sell-off? The question divided panellists. Edelsten says not. He argues that the investors backing Tesla, and the investment banks behind some of them, are a “subset” of the market. “It’s one particular group of people who talk to each other. It’s not a mainstream game.There could be some very nasty losses. I’m sure that it would cause some headlines, but I don’t think it’s going to be a crisis.”Jackson is not convinced, pointing out that as Tesla has entered important indices including the S&P 500, many index tracker funds are obliged to hold the shares. And there is little way of knowing, until it is too late, how much investment in Tesla is on credit. He says: “There is hidden leverage, you only see it when markets are going down. If the fifth biggest company [by market capitalisation] in the world takes a tumble, there will be knock-on effects.”Ahmed warns more generally about the level of US debt, with debt held by the public soaring as a share of GDP from about 40 per cent in 2007 to 100 per cent this year. A sharp rise in interest rates of 200 or 300 basis points would be “a shock.the system would collapse”.He adds that some of the strength of the US economy is due to people spending money poured out in the huge fiscal stimulus launched to counter the pandemic’s effects. “Frankly speaking, equity markets have a lot to thank the government [for] because a lot of those earnings are actually fiscal stimulus being recycled. The stimulus will be shut down ultimately and growth will need a new engine.”Edelsten is more optimistic about the US, pointing to strong growth and the solid finances of large American companies. “I am really quite positive about large companies, even in the grim moments of discussing the collapse of the system, because all the big companies have got massive amounts of cash on the balance sheet.”And how about the UK market? Edelsten, who generally looks for growth-orientated companies around the world, says: “Trying to find growth stocks in the UK is really hard.”Somerset Webb takes a quite different view. She delights in saying that retail savers can profit from global fund managers’ neglect of the UK. “I still think that the UK market is something of a gift from the international institutional investor to the retail investor.”She says institutions tend to think the British market has “got the wrong sector mix, that Brexit still isn’t quite dealt with, that it’s got all these nasty, dirty companies [in oil and gas, for example] that people don’t really want to be involved in”.The net result is that “it’s still extremely cheap relative to most global markets”, says Somerset Webb.Macdonald, a UK specialist investor, is less sweeping, but argues that “there’s lots of small and mid-cap stocks that offer tremendous amounts of growth”.She likes businesses which can profit from the transition from traditional commerce to online. A favourite in her portfolio is Accesso Technologies, a company that offers virtual ticketing services to theme parks and theatres. Another is Auction Technology Group, publisher of the Antiques Trade Gazette newspaper, which has successfully developed online auctions such as saleroom.com.Macdonald says some companies she has bought in initial public offerings have grown to “pretty substantial companies” with market capitalisations of £1bn or more.But investors should be selective in sifting through shares and searching for their dream stocks. As Macdonald says: “You do have to kiss an awful lot of frogs.”
206  Bonjour and welcome to Europe Express.Emmanuel Macron is known for his elaborate news conferences. And yesterday’s presentation of the upcoming French EU presidency certainly did not disappoint, featuring lengthy discourses about European sovereignty and the need to update the bloc’s fiscal rules.I’ll unpack the most notable ideas and how feasible his ambitions are. (In case you were wondering, yes, France’s president is still upset about the US-UK-Australia defence pact that sunk his submarine deal. On Brexit, he wants a government in London that would co-operate “in good faith” with Paris.)Speaking of Brexit, another regular EU-UK meeting is taking place today, but progress is likely to come from outside the Sefcovic-Frost dialogue format. We’ll explore why and when the EU is likely to change is rules to allow for UK medicines to be sold in Northern Ireland.And in digital regulation news (also a priority pour la France), some last-minute tweaks to the Digital Markets Act are aimed at hardening the European parliament’s position ahead of negotiations with member states and the European Commission.President Emmanuel Macron sought to structure his presentation of the French priorities for the next six months into three broad “axes” — “Sovereign Europe”, a new “growth model” for Europe and a “human Europe” — although one could be forgiven for losing track of all the sub-points and tangents.Here’s the FT story on it and below a more detailed rundown of what he said:Should the Stability and Growth Pact allow investments to be excluded from a country’s deficit and debt calculations? Tell us what you think and click here to take the poll.Today brings another round of post-Brexit talks between the EU and the UK. But while very little progress has been made in the (virtual) room since October, there is movement outside it, writes Andy Bounds in Brussels.The European Commission will start legislating within days to change the rules on medicines to prevent an effective ban on many drugs in Northern Ireland, diplomats told Europe Express.The region is supplied from Great Britain but remains in the single market so all medicines would need to comply with EU regulations once a grace period expires on January 1.But British generic drugmakers have said the cost of doing so for a small market such as Northern Ireland is not worth it so more than 2,000 products would become unavailable.Maros Sefcovic, the Brexit commissioner, offered to solve the problem in his October package to deal with British complaints that there were too many impediments to trade across the Irish Sea.While he hoped to get London’s approval, he has decided to act unilaterally anyhow — the commission does not want people dying for lack of drugs.But there is another motive — Malta, a member state, suffers from the same problem, as does Cyprus to a lesser extent.“Malta imports medicines from the UK because of the small size of our national market,” said an EU diplomat. “Pharmaceutical companies do not want the expense of regulation. Also the labelling must be in one of the EU official languages so it needs to be in English.“It is facing the same supply issues as Northern Ireland.”On the other aspects of the Northern Ireland Protocol that the UK has issues with, there is no sign of agreement.The commission is discussing reductions to customs check and animal health controls, but not by enough to satisfy London.Lord David Frost, the UK Brexit minister, is expected to repeat his threat to suspend the protocol by invoking its Article 16. But few believe that will happen before the new year.The US and European capitals are in intense consultations over a sanctions package aimed at deterring Moscow from invading Ukraine, and which could include the Nord Stream 2 pipeline — if the German government agrees. The package will most likely be signed off by EU leaders at their summit in Brussels on Thursday. (More here)EU lawmakers are pushing for last-minute amendments on the draft Digital Markets Act, ahead of a crucial vote next week, writes Javier Espinoza in Brussels.Members of the European parliament have been for months engaged in lengthy debates over the scope of the regulation that would curb the alleged anti-competitive behaviour of online platforms (mostly American ones).Even though a compromise had been reached among political parties last month, two committees are now tabling more changes aimed at making the future rules even tougher.On Tuesday, Rasmus Andresen, a Green MEP in the committee for industry, research and energy, and his colleagues are pushing for a plenary vote on forcing WhatsApp, Twitter or Google to interact with each other. Currently this is not the case.“Messenger services and social media platforms would be directly instructed to make their offerings interoperable. This is the only way to achieve a true opening of the markets in these areas,” Andresen said.Earlier this week, Stéphanie Yon-Courtin, the MEP leading the debate in the economic and monetary affairs committee, tabled amendments to push for tougher scrutiny of so-called killer acquisitions led by Big Tech and on working more closely with national competition authorities to enforce the new laws.“The DMA will not be sufficient to address killer acquisitions so we must recognise that the DMA and competition law are working hand in hand,” she said.Expect more amendments from now until Wednesday, when the European parliament in Strasbourg votes on its common position, ahead of negotiations with the commission and member states on the final version of the law.
207  Despite weeks of ever more insistent US warnings that Russia could launch a full-blown invasion of Ukraine this winter, Volodymyr Nahorniy spent Wednesday evening at a ski shop in Kyiv splashing out $500 on kit for two planned snowboarding trips.Staff at the store say they were overwhelmed with customers two weeks ago during a Black Friday sale — mostly young entrepreneurs like Nahorniy, a 28-year old who works in Ukraine’s booming IT industry.“Time will show us what we face,” he said. “We are already at war with Russia,” he said, referring to the conflict with Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine that first erupted after Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.According to US intelligence assessments shared widely with western allies, President Vladimir Putin is amassing up to 175,000 Russian troops and heavy weaponry around Ukraine’s borders and may intend to launch an offensive.But in Ukraine, where officials have spent weeks playing down the threat pinpointed by Washington, there is little sign of alarm. Instead of panic-buying, cafés, bars and shopping malls are packed. The country’s oligarch-owned media is more interested in domestic political intrigues than a Russian onslaught. Ukrainians have grown accustomed to conflict, given that the war in the Donbas has rumbled on for seven years and taken 14,000 lives.“Ukrainians have seen this film before — that is, large build-ups of Russian troops on the borders,” said Brian Mefford, an American businessman based in Kyiv. He was referring to the deployment of 110,000 Russian troops along Ukraine’s borders earlier this spring. The Kremlin said it was a military exercise but used the deployment to extract a summit with US president Joe Biden in June.“There is no panic whatsoever — not for me, not with any of my friends, not with anyone,” said Valery, a 54-year old businessman shopping for Christmas with his wife and son. “It seems to me Ukrainians don’t fear anything after all of these years.”Oleksii Reznikov, defence minister, said Ukraine’s “comparatively calm response to this latest Russian threat reflects the long-term nature of the ongoing conflict between our two countries”.Like many of his compatriots, Valery expressed a weary resignation that Ukraine was the victim of a wider geopolitical game between Moscow and Washington.Putin, he said, was playing a game of brinkmanship to scare western-backers from providing further defensive weaponry to Kyiv and accepting the country’s bid to join the Nato military alliance.“We are just pawns on a chessboard,” he said.Biden’s decision this week to agree to talks with Putin over Russian concerns about further Nato expansion has reinforced Ukrainian suspicions that Moscow’s military build-up is simply a form of intimidation rather than an active military threat.“This is a Russian attempt to manipulate Biden to reduce American support for Ukraine,” said Oleksander Danylyuk, chair of the Kyiv-based Centre for Defense Reforms. “Biden is behaving in the way Russia wants him to behave.”Russian sabre-rattling also serves to destabilise the Ukrainian government and undermine the post-pandemic economic recovery.In an attempt to try to reassure investors President Volodymyr Zelensky played down the risks of a full-blown invasion in a recent meeting with business leaders.“President Zelensky is assuring us that foreign direct investment in Ukraine is safe,” said Andy Hunder, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine. “Companies are operating business as usual, showing positive financial results for the year.”At the same time Zelensky has tried to galvanise Ukraine’s armed forces, just in case. He has held televised rallies with troops around the country, parading armoured vehicles and patrol boats provided by the US.Ukraine’s army of 250,000 is better trained and battle hardened. It is also better equipped, with stockpiles of US-provided Javelin anti-tank busters, upgraded tanks and armoured vehicles. It also has Turkish-built Bayraktar drones that were deployed, to Moscow’s fury, against Russian-backed forces in Donbas. Kyiv plans to acquire naval vessels and missiles from the UK and Turkey.Although still vastly outnumbered and outgunned by Russian forces, Ukraine’s military is deemed more capable of inflicting losses on invading forces. However, Ukraine lacks air defences, leaving it exposed to Russian air power and missile strikes. Some analysts say Russian missile strikes to destroy Ukrainian assets, especially its Bayraktar drones, are more likely than a ground invasion.Ukrainians may not be alarmed, but they are beginning to prepare.“Many of the thousands of voluntary fighters who played a critical role in pushing back in 2014 will go back to the front lines; many have recently joined the government’s newly formed nationwide territorial defence forces,” said Lada Roslycky, an American security expert who heads the Ukraine focused consultancy Black Trident.One businessman living in a city close to Ukraine’s border with Russia told the Financial Times he was considering moving westward to Kyiv and eventually to elsewhere in Europe if the capital were to fall.Clutching his brand-new snowboard boots, Nahorniy contemplated what he would do this winter if Putin decided to strike.“I will be planning to defend my family, not snowboarding,” he said, before adding: “It depends how big of an invasion it will be.”Letter in response to this article:Nato and Russia need new security understanding / From Bohdan Skrobach, Toronto, ON, Canada
208  Joe Biden reaffirmed America’s “unwavering commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity” in a call with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday amid concerns the US president is open to negotiating with Russia over its demands to curb Nato’s expansion.The outreach to Ukraine, and a separate call with nine eastern European Nato allies, came after Biden sparked worries the previous day when he said he planned to hold talks with Russia and at least four unnamed Nato allies over Moscow’s position on the alliance.These discussions would cover “the future of Russia’s concerns relative to Nato writ large” and explore “whether or not we can work out any accommodations”, Biden said.The comments followed a virtual meeting with Vladimir Putin the previous day that was intended to avert a potential invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s president, who has overseen a large-scale military build-up on his country’s border with Ukraine that US intelligence has said could be used for an invasion, has demanded that Nato rule out making Kyiv a member.Putin has also called on the transatlantic alliance to cease military deployments in eastern European member states bordering Russia.A senior White House official on Thursday rejected accusations that Biden had made a “concession” by offering to discuss Putin’s concerns and that the US president had been slow to speak to Zelensky.“The one thing that I would say that the president made crystal clear to Zelensky in his call today is that if Ukraine is on the agenda, then Ukraine is at the table,” the official said.According to a White House readout of Biden’s call with the nine eastern flank Nato countries, the leaders discussed Russia’s military build-up along Ukraine’s border and “the need for a united, ready and resolute Nato stance for the collective defence of allies”.However, some in the region have already expressed concerns over Biden’s offer to undertake talks over Russia’s position on Nato.“I hope I’m wrong but I smell ‘Munich’ here,” Marko Mihkelson, head of the foreign affairs committee of Estonia’s parliament, told the Financial Times, in reference to the 1938 agreement in Europe to try to avoid conflict with Nazi Germany by ceding the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia.“Starting talks under the guns about the future of Nato, or even more so about involving Russia in the European security architecture with a veto right — this is completely the wrong way and will ignite appetite for further aggression,” Mihkelson added.Ukraine’s ambassador to the EU told the FT that Kyiv’s “red line” is that “Ukraine is a sovereign state and it is our business how we build our relations both with Nato, EU or individual states.”“The main principle for us is that there are no words about Ukraine without Ukraine, so we need to be involved in any discussion with regard to the Ukrainian security situation,” said Vsevolod Chentsov. “Russians will have to accept it. There is no other way.”Following his call with Biden, Zelensky tweeted that his US counterpart provided a briefing on his “negotiations with Putin”, adding that they “also discussed possible formats for resolving the conflict in Donbas”.A White House spokesperson earlier denied the US was seeking to appease Russia: “President Biden looked President Putin in the eye and told him that one nation cannot tell another to change its borders.”One senior western intelligence official said: “I wouldn’t rush to the conclusion that the worst-case scenario from their political perspective is the one Washington intends to pursue.”“While everyone is prepared to engage in dialogue, there can be no concessions.in protecting our allies,” a Nato official told the FT. “And on Ukraine we are not negotiating the right of countries to choose their own path.”Additional reporting by Lauren Fedor in Washington
209  The British government was accused on Thursday of hardening the land border on the island of Ireland — a key sensitivity in Brexit negotiations — under planned changes to UK immigration rules.The new regulations would require non-Irish EU nationals to obtain an electronic visa waiver to travel from the Republic into Northern Ireland, removing their right to free movement.The requirement is contained in the nationality and borders bill, the UK government’s wide-ranging rewrite of the immigration and asylum system, which is primarily aimed at tackling the thousands of clandestine arrivals who cross the English Channel from France.The legislation is in its final stages in the UK parliament; it has been passed by the House of Commons and looks set to be approved by the Lords.Under the new rules, all EU nationals — apart from citizens of the Republic of Ireland — who would previously have had free movement into Northern Ireland will need a visa waiver called an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA). The rules will also apply to non-EU citizens.While largely invisible, the land border is crossed by many people in nearby communities multiple times a day. Some people living in the Republic need to cross it simply to continue their journey south, and there are large multinational companies in Northern Ireland employing non-Irish EU staff.The removal of checks at the border, which was heavily militarised during three-decades of sectarian conflict, was a cornerstone of the peace deal enshrined in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.The planned changes to the immigration rules come amid tense relations between the UK and the EU over attempts by London to try to soften the application of the so-called Northern Ireland protocol. This is the part of the Brexit agreement designed to protect the 1998 peace deal by addressing trading relations in Northern Ireland.The protocol left Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market for goods in order to prevent the return of a north-south trade border on the island of Ireland. But it means there are some east-west customs checks on trade across the Irish Sea between the British mainland and the region.The UK has threatened to trigger the Article 16 process that overrides post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland but has stepped back as talks with Brussels continue.The US, which helped broker the 1998 peace deal, is also concerned about the UK’s threats to trigger Article 16 and has delayed a deal to remove Trump-era tariffs on UK steel and aluminium as a result.David Phinnemore, a professor of European politics at Queen’s University in Belfast, said while the UK government was complaining about the protocol putting a border in the Irish Sea for goods, the new immigration bill would do the same to people crossing the land border.“In the debate around the protocol, people see an increased hardening around the east-west border without realising the fact that Northern Ireland is not part of the single market for services, capital or movement of people,” Phinnemore said. “So you’ve got a hardening of the border north-south as well as east-west.”The UK government insisted the new immigration rules would have no impact “whatsoever on the land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland”. It said the new ETA requirement would minimise “the burden on those making frequent trips, including those across the land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.”“My view is this is not workable,” Stephen Farry, an MP from the centrist Alliance party in Northern Ireland, told Ireland’s RTÉ radio.“This is not about border controls on the land border — the UK government has been clear on that point at least. But this does create this grey areabecause there is a very clear forthcoming legal requirement that begs question of how it is going to be enforced,” he said.
210  France’s President Emmanuel Macron has called for the EU to stand up for itself as a strategic and economic power in a crisis-ridden world by securing its external borders and controlling clandestine migration, deepening defence co-operation and investing in high-tech industries.“We should move from a Europe of co-operation within our frontiers to a Europe powerful in the world, fully sovereign, free to make its own choices and master of its destiny,” he said at the Elysée Palace in Paris as he outlined his plans for France’s six-month presidency of the EU in the first half of next year.Macron called for a reform of the 26-nation Schengen zone — within which people can circulate freely without border checks — and an improved emergency system to send security forces to guard external frontiers, such as those of Poland and Lithuania recently threatened with mass incursions by migrants at the instigation of Belarus.He said Schengen procedures should be managed like the eurozone with regular ministerial meetings to ensure “a coherent policy for controlling our external frontiers”.In a low-key reprise of the ambitious European initiatives he announced at the Sorbonne University soon after being elected president in 2017, Macron called for deeper defence co-operation in the EU and a European economic “growth model” based on investment in high-tech industries and job creation.He also highlighted the need to help stabilise the EU’s neighbourhood, particularly Africa and the western Balkans, and announced a summit between the EU and the African Union in Brussels in February.Macron is expected to stand for re-election as president next April in the middle of France’s EU mandate. He is under pressure from political rivals on the right and the extreme right over what they call his lax approach to immigration into France.He has also been criticised by Valérie Pécresse of the rightwing Les Républicains party — who has emerged as the main threat to his re-election in the latest opinion polls — for not rescheduling the EU presidency in a way that would have averted a conflict with France’s domestic political calendar.“For these six months the French leaders will be rather on ice because no one can guarantee they will still be there in May,” said Michel Barnier, the EU’s former Brexit negotiator, who has thrown his weight behind Pécresse after losing to her in a party primary.On economic policy, Macron emphasised the need for the EU’s 27 member states to act together to promote the growth of strong European industries in technology sectors such as semiconductors, batteries for electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel and cloud computing.“One country does not have sufficient scale,” he said. “We have to act as Europeans” and build “real technological sovereignty in Europe”.He confirmed France would push for the adoption of the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), which is designed to ensure fair competition and prevent excessive dominance by big platforms such as Google, and the Digital Services Act (DSA), which aims to control hate speech and would make digital companies responsible for the content they publish and the products they sell.Macron, who meets Germany’s new chancellor Olaf Scholz in Paris on Friday, acknowledged the concerns of fiscally cautious northern Europeans about big deficits and debts among eurozone members, and agreed there was a need for budgetary rules that promoted economic convergence.Alluding to the debt and deficit constraints of the stability and growth pact, suspended because of the Covid-19 pandemic, Macron said the EU had to take into account the need for big investments given the challenge of economic recovery. “We can’t behave as if nothing has happened,” he said.
211  A US-born businessman who has operated in Russia since 1999 has been jailed by a St Petersburg court on suspicion of fraud, in a sign of the increasing judicial threat hanging over both national and foreign executives.Prosecutors allege August Meyer defrauded state-run Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank, of more than Rbs2.4bn ($32.5m) that it loaned to his now-defunct ecommerce site Ulmart. Meyer, who said in court that he holds passports from Russia, Malta and Saint Kitts, received a two-month prison sentence before his trial. He has denied the charge.In recent years, longtime investors in Russia such as Meyer have proven to be as vulnerable to prosecution as their Russian-born counterparts, under what regime critics have said was widespread abuse of the judicial system.Thousands of Russian businessmen are behind bars on fraud charges, according to Boris Titov, President Vladimir Putin’s business ombudsman. A survey by Putin’s own presidential security service found that more than 75 per cent of Russian businessmen felt unsafe from unfounded criminal prosecution by the state and that 18 per cent of prosecutors agreed with them.Putin has acknowledged the problem, saying on Thursday that “putting people behind bars in a cell is often completely unjustified”.Michael Calvey, a US private equity investor, was held in jail for two months on similar fraud charges in 2019, before being given a suspended sentence earlier this year.The charge against Meyer, who moved to Russia in 1999 to open a museum in honour of libertarian firebrand Ayn Rand before going into business, stem from a long-running shareholder dispute that destroyed Ulmart. Once Russia’s largest ecommerce business, the company filed for bankruptcy last year.Meyer’s business partner Dmitry Kostygin, a former Rand translator, spent a year under house arrest for allegedly defrauding Sberbank of Rbs1bn, before he was released on bail in 2018 and the charges against him were downgraded. A court ordered Ulmart to repay the loan in 2019 and fined it Rbs338m. Kostygin has denied the charges.Sberbank said: “Investigators establish the circle of suspects and defendants independently from the bank. We are sure that law enforcement takes balanced and objective decisions. For its part, the bank will continue to seek repayment of the debt in accordance with the law.”Meyer is no stranger to Russian corporate disputes. He made more than $1bn from the sale of his stake in St Petersburg-based hypermarket chain Lenta to TPG and VTB Capital, following a bruising shareholder battle in 2011.Titov told reporters on Thursday that Meyer’s charge was “dictated by investigators’ desires to artificially speed up the case [against Kostygin] and put more pressure on the defendants”, according to Interfax. “There was no basis for holding him in pre-trial detention,” he said.
212  We’re almost at the end of Year One of the Brexit experiment, which started on January 1 following the last-minute signing of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA). Remarkable to think that this time last year, it was still not yet fully agreed.Even if the “reasonable worst-case” scenarios of 7,000 trucks backing up at Dover never materialised (a rare example of deft expectation management and strategic comms from this government), it has still been a bumpy year for UK exporters compared with peer countries.In truth, there was plenty of disruption behind the scenes in January, but much of it was pushed back into the distribution centres, warehouses and parcel depots where hauliers were waiting to get the correct paperwork to set off on their journeys.Compliance levels at the border surprised UK officials, with only 2 per cent of trucks being turned away by mid-February, thanks to a combination of awareness campaigns (remember the Kent access permit?) and the fact that it was actually impossible to board a ferry to the EU without pre-declaring consignments via the French “SI Brexit” system.To get the green light to board a ferry, you needed to show that your forms — customs, health certificates etc — were in order. That meant that, after the first couple of months, only manageable numbers of vehicles needed to be pulled aside for checks on the EU side of the Channel. In short, it all worked surprisingly well.But what will have evaded the notice of much of the general public is that it worked in only one direction — for UK goods heading into Europe. For stuff coming the other way there was no requirement to pre-declare. Indeed, customs declarations could be deferred for up to 175 days.That all changes on January 1 2022. Barring a last-minute change of heart from the government, hauliers delivering goods from the EU into GB will need to pre-declare their consignments via the UK equivalent of “SI Brexit”, the “GVMS”, or goods vehicle movement service.Customs declarations can no longer be deferred, and products of plants and animal origin also need to be pre-notified in the “Import of products, animals, food and feed system” (IPAFFS) system — though they won’t need a full export health certificate (for which you need a vet to sign off) until July.This means that, to some extent, compared with the “big bang” of full checks from day one that we saw on the UK-to-EU routes last January, the new EU-to-UK system is being phased in more gently.But still, to get that green light to board the ferry in Calais, EU exporters sending food products will first need to complete IPAFFS forms, to generate a reference number in order to complete customs forms, which can then be used to obtain a GVMS code.As Shane Brennan of the Cold Chain Federation puts it: “The government gives the impression that the IPAFFS requirement is a ‘soft launch’ — but it’s not very soft if you can’t do customs or get a GVMS code without one.”So will it all go as (relatively) smoothly as last time? The truth is that nobody honestly knows, because the operation of the system will rely on drivers and exporters from 27 different countries getting their heads around the new system.In practice, a lot of this will be handled by agents, but Brennan reckons that there are still likely to be a fair number of EU food exporters and hauliers “playing catch-up” after January 1 next year.Looking at it optimistically, given that 85 per cent of lorry drivers on the Short Straits are EU drivers, and they have been using “SI Brexit” for a year going the opposite way, they ought — in theory — to be able to manage GVMS.They may also find, given the UK government’s self-professed desire to prioritise flow, that if things do get sticky in the initial months, the British authorities will be more flexible than their continental counterparts, based on the approach to Brexit borders thus far.When the top mandarins appeared in front of the public accounts committee last month they appeared quietly confident that preparations had been sufficient.Jim Harra, the permanent secretary at HM Revenue & Customs, said the fact that businesses were already filling in customs forms, albeit with 175-day deferrals available to them, meant that HMRC was “confident that traders are ready”.He was less certain about EU hauliers, acknowledging that the “greatest risk” came from EU drivers that didn’t realise what they needed to do, though HMRC said it was writing to 14,000 EU haulage groups monthly to gee them up.Harra was broadly confident. He said he reckoned there were “greater levels of readiness” in the EU than we saw in January 2021 for trucks moving the other way, but still, he says “we will undoubtedly see some lorries turned away, at least initially”.The other major unknown is how far the newly imposed hassles of trading with the UK will depress the appetite of EU business to trade with the UK, particularly smaller businesses which — on both sides of the Channel — have less capacity to cope with new paperwork.Another thing to watch for in 2022 is the ending of an easement on rules of origin that will require traders to have underlying information to prove that their goods are sufficiently “made in UK” or “made in EU” in order to qualify for zero-tariff access under the TCA.Businesses will continue to self-declare that their goods do qualify, but anecdotally there’s pretty strong evidence that some smaller businesses aren’t really up to speed on what is a highly complex area.Britain after Brexit has spoken this week with several UK traders who — despite getting letters and emails from HMRC — are still full of questions and uncertainties about this area, which leaves importers with the liability for paying tariffs on any goods wrongly imported duty free.That means that a shoe shop in Bristol, say, that imports shoes from the EU which came in tariff-free (but actually were imported from Asia and shipped onwards, so didn’t qualify) may find themselves paying a nasty retrospective bill.The owner of that shop is already pondering, if that happens, whether they have the lawyers, the cash and the watertight contracts that will enable them to reclaim those losses from their EU supplier. All this adds to the stress of doing business, even if it never happens.Again, we shall have to see how proactive HMRC is checking that declarations are substantive, but it will also cut the other way — UK companies that export to the EU will have angry EU customers on their hands if they’re unable to prove their goods qualified for zero-tariff access if challenged by EU customs authorities.All of which is to say that in some ways, Brexit was really only “half done” in 2021, and the second instalment, even if it has rather lesser billing in the media, will still give businesses that trade with Europe plenty to think about in 2022.Do you work in an industry that has been affected by the UK’s departure from the EU single market and customs union? If so, how is the change hurting — or even benefiting — you and your business?.Christmas is approaching and yet the discussion over Northern Ireland rumbles on without any obvious prospect of a resolution, at least on the issues surrounding customs and agrifood checks.The EU has signalled that it will press ahead unilaterally with a legal patch to guarantee equal access to medicines, even if the British won’t join hands with it on this.EU insiders say that, despite the de facto extension of grace periods by both sides to ease the burdens of the disputed Northern Ireland Protocol, the pharmaceutical industry wants legal certainty so the European Commission seems determined to push this particular file over the line before Christmas.What the new year brings is very much less certain, as political pressure builds in Northern Ireland ahead of local elections in May. Lord David Frost — having been sent to seek a mutually agreeable deal — will at some point need to make a determination on whether that has proved possible.The government routinely talks about triggering the Article 16 safeguards clause as a last resort, but polling this week (see chart) raised interesting questions about whether that was really more of a priority in Westminster than in the region itself.Analysing the new data, Katy Hayward of Queen’s University Belfast made several interesting points in a blog post co-authored with David Phinnemore for the UK in a Changing Europe think-tank.It was notable that the poll found that 52 per cent in Northern Ireland think the protocol is on balance a “good thing” for the region, up 9 per cent since June, which is perhaps linked to the region experiencing less shortages, particularly fuel shortages, than Britain this summer.And yet by contrast, as Hayward writes, a majority of MPs polled see the protocol as, on balance, a “bad thing” for Northern Ireland.This is a potentially instructive gulf in opinion, particularly when allied to the fact that 87 per cent of respondents in Northern Ireland “distrust or strongly distrust the UK government” handling of the protocol, compared with 44 per cent who distrust the European Commission.If Frost wants to trigger Article 16, and risk a full-blown confrontation with Brussels, Berlin and Dublin, the danger is that it will look like a highly partial act that doesn’t have the support of those who would be most affected.Indeed, only 39 per cent of respondents to the weighted LucidTalk poll considered that using Article 16 would be justified.As Hayward observes: “The fact that the opinion of MPs is so out of line with those of voters in Northern Ireland is of concern given that the future of the protocol is so much in the hands of the UK government. What the prime minister and Lord Frost decide to do — particularly over the triggering of Article 16 — will have huge and direct ramifications for Northern Ireland, economically, politically and socially.”More unmissable Brexit storiesThe US has overtaken the EU as the leading destination for UK financial services exports, according to a report by TheCityUK, a lobby group for the sector. Brooke Masters, meanwhile, wrote this week that the rivalry between the London and Amsterdam stock exchanges missed the point — Europe is being left in the dust by the US and the Chinese and Hong Kong markets in equity trading, corporate bond issuance and pretty much every other metric that matters.The UK is planning to give industry an extra two years to implement a new post-Brexit safety regime for chemicals. The move is the latest in a series of delays to implementing post-Brexit plans, many of which duplicate existing EU safety regimes, as I reported this week.The British government must put down the megaphone and pick up the telephone to start building a new relationship with Europe that can be the basis of a strong Global Britain, argue former UK ambassador to Washington, Nato and Israel David Manning and Jonathan Powell, chief of staff to Tony Blair from 1995 to 2007.Can the EU’s €300bn Global Gateway infrastructure investment project launched last week rival China’s Belt and Road Initiative? Martin Sandbu believes it can but says the EU must clearly articulate the benefits for partner countries. For now, he says, “it looks like a list of unrelated building sites”.
213  Beware the European trustbusters. Italy’s antitrust watchdog has landed a €1.13bn fine on Amazon, which is already under pressure from regulators across the globe. The penalty, equivalent to more than a third of the ecommerce group’s net profits in the third quarter, is among the biggest meted out to American tech giants in Europe.The magnitude is, however, of less importance than the signalling. Regulators in the US and Europe are gunning for Amazon and its ilk. Market dominance and troves of data give Big Tech big sway when it comes to granting access to third parties, be they vendors, advertisers or consumers. The Italian competition authority takes issue with Amazon’s preferential treatment of third-party sellers who use its own logistics and delivery services. Given overlapping concerns, Amazon wanted the case absorbed into a broader European Commission investigation, which was opened after the Italian one. It is appealing against the Italian decision.Third-party sellers account for more than half of sales made on Amazon. Those who do so via Fulfilment by Amazon, or FBA, which manages their logistics, last year accounted for more than 80,000 of the 185,000 small and medium-sized businesses in Europe that sell on the platform.Regulators reckon they are effectively pushed into this in order to benefit from access to Amazon Prime members, who spend more. Not so, says Amazon, insisting it does not discriminate between sellers who use its fulfilment services and those who do not.The Italian decision suggests European regulators will have little truck with this argument either. That involves a far bigger pool of platform vendors and could potentially produce a far heftier fine. The EU can theoretically levy fines of up to 10 per cent of overall annual sales. Based on Amazon’s expected revenues this year, that would be $46bn.Of course, regulators are unlikely to go even close to the maximum threshold. But the amounts are still meaningful, even for Big Tech. Google was fined €2.4bn for using its dominant search engine to funnel shoppers to Google Shopping.Big Tech is firmly on notice that regulators overseeing competition, data privacy and other issues are on the offensive. They have no bold, over-arching solution to the dominant positions of US giants. But they are happy to fight a war of attrition on a case-by-case basis.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Is this fine justified?

214  Austria will impose criminal fines of up to €3,600 on anyone over the age of 14 who refuses to be vaccinated, the government said on Thursday, under plans to make injections against coronavirus compulsory from February onwards.The move comes amid a shift across much of Europe towards increasingly harsh measures to crack down on vaccine hesitancy, as Covid cases surge and the emergence of the Omicron variant threatens to derail recovery plans.In a press conference at the federal chancellery, health minister Wolfgang Mückstein and constitution minister Karoline Edtstadler unveiled the first concrete details of the proposed vaccine law, announced three weeks ago.“I know that some are uncertain and angry,” said Edtstadler, describing the law as “the last resort.” But, she said, “in order to be able to live in freedom again, there is no other way but with this vaccine. There is a common enemy, and that is the virus.”The law would apply to all Austrians over 14, with exemptions for pregnant women and those with legitimate medical grounds, attested to by a doctor or qualified health professional.Three mandatory doses of the vaccine will be administered with quarterly deadlines while a central government register will be created to monitor compliance.Mückstein said he had long been opposed to compulsory vaccinations, but that recent events had changed his mind. “We have learned in the pandemic that we shouldn’t rule anything out and we shouldn’t promise anything,” he told reporters.The proposals have triggered a fierce political backlash in Austria, a country already in the throes of a tumultuous political crisis, with tens of thousands turning out on the streets of cities across the country in protest over recent weekends.The vaccination mandate is supported by four of Austria’s five largest parties, including the Social Democrats and liberal Neos, meaning it is almost certain to easily pass into law over the coming weeks.In parliament, only the far right Freedom party has stood against the proposals, and has ramped up its rhetoric against the government — a coalition of the moderate conservative People’s party and the Greens. The vaccine mandate was tantamount to “fascism”, the party’s leader, Herbert Kickl, has said, calling for “all forms of resistance” to be made against it.Polling has indicated that many moderate Austrians share his unease over the use of criminal law to compel people to get jabbed — if not his choice of language.A new political party, MFG — People Freedom Rights — won more than 6 per cent of votes in an important regional election in Upper Austria in September on a platform of opposition to vaccine mandates and vaccine passports.About 1.4m people in Austria — one in six adults — have yet to receive even a first dose of the vaccine. As such, the country’s vaccination rate remains one of the lowest in western Europe. The country has consequently suffered from a surge in cases of coronavirus this autumn that has outstripped the severity — by case numbers — of any previous wave of the pandemic. Hospitalisations and deaths are still well below their previous peak, however, which opponents of the vaccine law say shows it is not needed.
215  The writer is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a think-tankRussia has moved around 100,000 soldiers to its border with Ukraine, worrying both Ukrainians and Nato members a great deal. The risk of an invasion is clearly the primary concern, but Russia doesn’t have to send troops in to harm its south-western neighbour. The presence of soldiers is already spooking foreign investors — and has become in itself an excellent tool of aggression that Kyiv can do nothing to prevent.In March 2014, when Russia had just annexed Crimea, the international community was anxious that Moscow would move on to target other nearby countries. Investors, too, were concerned, and stock markets slumped. Now, financial markets are similarly on edge. Since Russia’s military build-up was detected last month, the Ukrainian hryvnia has lost value, Ukraine’s sovereign dollar bonds have nosedived, and the cost of protection against a Ukrainian default has increased.Financially speaking, Ukraine is already something of an acquired taste: given its history of corruption and oligarchic power, it appeals mostly to speciality investors with an elevated risk appetite. Last year, foreign direct investment in Ukraine was negative, while neighbouring Poland received a net FDI inflow of more than €10bn.For an economy as fragile as Ukraine’s, the spectre of war is a massive blow. Yes, Russian stocks are also sliding over war fears — but the Russian economy is ten times the size and can sustain far more turbulence. And while President Volodymyr Zelensky’s government can try to tackle corruption and the over-reach of oligarchs, it can do nothing to dislodge the Russian soldiers at the border. Neither has Nato been able to help de-escalate, even though members of the alliance are firm in their support for Kyiv.Deploying significant military formations at a neighbour’s border is a cunning strategy by Russia, because by frightening investors, Russia can also cause real harm to a country whose economy badly needs a stable currency and foreign investment. In fact, to hurt Ukraine, Russia need do little more than keep the soldiers where they are to prolong the uncertainty, and add the occasional snap military exercise near the border. Russia’s actions are a quintessential example of greyzone aggression — activities in the no man’s land between peaceful relations and formal armed conflict.If Russia wanted to further weaken Ukraine there is more it could do in economic terms. How about asking a few Russian oligarchs to speculate against the hryvnia? Or channelling more money into the pockets of corrupt officials, thus foiling Zelensky’s efforts to convince the world that Ukraine is cleaning up its reputation? For short-term effect, it could spread false rumours that the invasion is about to begin. Greyzone aggressors are limited only by their imagination.Moscow has a history of successful greyzone operations against Ukraine. In June 2017, Russia’s NotPetya cyber attack hit hospitals, power companies, two airports, some two dozen banks, card payment systems and the government. The resulting disruption caused public anxiety and a loss of faith among international investors.Of course, financially savvy activists in Ukraine and beyond could always turn on Moscow, shorting Russian companies’ stocks or mass-betting against the rouble.For the moment, however, Kyiv is vulnerable to investors and stock traders who have no geopolitical obligations. If they want to withhold their money from a country, or speculate against its currency, or assume it will default, they can. And the more Ukraine’s economy suffers, the more remote its chances of EU membership will become. Russia’s president Vladimir Putin could not hope for a better outcome. Who said those soldiers needed to cross the border?
216  When coronavirus hit us, it seemed like the pandemic could trigger a politics of “we are all in this together” — that is what motivates the rhetoric of “building back better”. But such politics always came with the challenge that the economic forces unleashed by the pandemic risked having the contrary effect, of intensifying the inequalities that had grown in the preceding four decades. That at least, was what many observers feared, including me.So what is happening to inequality? This week the latest issue of the World Inequality Report was published — a huge repository of information, drawing on the latest findings from the World Inequality Database (WID).It notes the evidence that lockdowns affected low-paid workers worse than high earners and that while the rich could increase their savings, the poor often had to run down savings or indebt themselves. But it highlights that it is still early days. In part, this is because the data on income distributions take time to arrive. But it is also because governments of rich countries incurred enormous deficits to cushion the blow — and the overall outcome on inequality depends on how that new debt is handled in the future. Historical evidence shows that premature fiscal austerity worsens inequality.There is much — much — more in the report about the current state of inequality, even if the impact of Covid-19 is elusive. Among the rich pickings, here are three findings that strike me as particularly interesting.First, global inequality (between countries) was pretty constant in 2020 compared to the year before — but that stalled a trend of falling inequality since the early 2000s.Second, global inequality of individual wealth took a jump last year, when the share of global wealth owned by the world’s billionaires increased by half (from 2.2 to 3.3 per cent) and that of the top 0.01 per cent wealthiest individuals increased by about a percentage point (from 10.3 to 11.1 per cent). At the same time, the wealth of the broader top 1 per cent group remained stable, both in the US and Europe, so the winners of greater wealth inequality were extremely concentrated at the very top.Third, Europe is the most egalitarian continent, whether measured by income inequality, wealth inequality, or inequality of individual carbon emissions, the WID’s data on which are fascinating and important. (They show that middle-income people in rich countries emit less than the top 10 per cent in some poorer regions.)What makes Europe more egalitarian than the US? Many think it is because European governments tax and redistribute more than Washington and the US states. But in a freshly published paper (with a good Twitter thread summary for those with no time to read), Thomas Blanchet, Lucas Chancel and Amory Gethin show that this is wrong. It is not redistribution that makes Europe the most egalitarian continent in the world, but “predistribution” — ie, its more equal distribution of rewards in the market itself, before governments transfer any money from higher to lower earners.I have made this point about the Nordics in the past. It surprises people to realise that these economies do not owe their famed equality to redistribution — of which they do about the same as other west European countries — but because market earnings are more equal to begin with. I made this point by comparing income distributions before and after taxes and transfers.It turns out that this holds more broadly for Europe, in comparison with the US. This is not immediately obvious by simply looking at pre- and post-tax incomes. Instead, Blanchet, Chancel and Gethin used a more sophisticated methodology called distributional national accounts. As the name suggests, it uses national income accounting concepts to allocate everything produced in the economy in a year — including that which does not feature on anyone’s payslip, such as undistributed profits in corporations — to some beneficiary. (It makes sense to attribute undistributed profits to shareholders, for example.)Do this, and two things become clear. The pre-tax income distribution in the US is much more skewed than in European countries. That is perhaps not so surprising but the differences are starker than we may have thought. But the US tax system is in fact more progressive than Europe’s: “[A]fter accounting for all taxes and transfers, the US appears to redistribute a greater fraction of its national income to the poorest 50% than any European country,” the paper says. One reason is Europe’s greater use of indirect taxes such as VAT, which are less progressive than direct taxes.Europe’s relative success in terms of extending prosperity to all is a result of creating an economy that is less unequal before taxes and transfers. That is not to say that government taxation and spending do not contribute to equality — what Europe proves is that creating an economy with opportunities for all takes work. Extensive public spending on services, for example, plays an important role even when it does not arithmetically reduce inequality (because they benefit everyone about the same). Conversely, mere redistribution does not make much of a dent to very skewed market opportunities. Prosperity for all requires fixing markets, not just compensating for their results.Which brings us back to taxation, because public services need to be funded. Since one thing we do know is that overall wealth and wealth inequality seems to have increased in the pandemic, it is natural to think that high wealth is a good tax base. The Resolution Foundation, in a new report, points out that a £3tn windfall to UK homeowners from house price growth in the past 20 years (one-fifth of the country’s total private wealth) is “unequal, unearned and untaxed”, and explores options for taxing it. The World Inequality Report estimates that a modest net wealth tax on the global top 1 per cent wealth owners can raise 1.6 per cent of global income in revenue. The debate on wealth taxation is only likely to get hotter.
217  New rules to give gig economy workers the same rights as those in full employment can stop “distortions” in other emerging parts of the digital economy, according to Brussels’ top official for jobs.Nicolas Schmit, the EU’s commissioner for jobs and social rights, told the Financial Times that companies such as Uber and Deliveroo must be constrained by tougher rules and that this would also rein in future “platform” employment models.The European Commission is due to publish draft legislation on Thursday that will place the onus on digital platforms to prove that those working using the platform — such as drivers — are self-employed. At present, these types of workers have to go to court to try to obtain workers’ rights.Speaking to the FT, Schmit said: “If we leave this business outside the normal standards and create distortions, I fear that finally this platform model will develop in many other areas.”If other sectors in the digital economy see that they can “escape social contributions”, said Schmit, they will “reflect on how I can build a platform model not to hire, not to pay all the social contributions”.Under the new draft proposals if a person meets at least two criteria, including whether a platform determines their level of pay or supervises their work, then they will be automatically classified as workers.The EU estimates that more than 500 digital platforms employ a combined 28m people across the union. The number of people employed in the gig economy is expected to rise to 43m by 2025. Currently, nine out 10 platforms classify people as self-employed.Separately, Brussels will also open a consultation on guidelines to allow self-employed people to bargain collectively for pay and working conditions. At present, self-employed workers found to be doing this would be deemed to be engaging in cartel-like behaviour and breaking competition laws.Campaigners on behalf of the platforms have argued that new legislation could lead to legal uncertainty and thousands of job losses, and that workers want the flexibility of being self-employed.Move EU, a trade body representing Bolt, Free Now and Uber, said: “The vast majority of drivers do not want to be employed and surveys across Europe consistently show that they do not want to lose the flexibility and additional revenue they get from being able to work for multiple platforms simultaneously.“Reclassification of drivers will not necessarily increase wages or secure earning opportunities . . . over 149,000 drivers could lose access to work and consumers will see services that they have come to rely on badly damaged.”Schmit pushed back on lobbying efforts and said people can have both a clear employment status and flexibility. He said: “Big social reforms were always contested by people directly affected. When in the UK in the 19th century people started to say ‘It’s unfair to occupy children in coal mines’, the reaction was very much, well this is the end of our industry.” But he added: “There is a life after changing the rules.”As for consumers having to pay more if platforms pass on increased costs as a result of new rules forcing them to boost their workers’ rights, he said: “If this means that my pizza costs €2 extra, then I have to live with that.”
218  Guten Morgen and welcome to Europe Express.A flurry of diplomatic trips will take place today and tomorrow, with the new bundeskanzler, Olaf Scholz, sending his foreign minister Annalena Baerbock to Paris and Brussels today before he makes the same stops tomorrow.In today’s profile, I look at the man Scholz has tasked with the job of two Merkel advisers. Jörg Kukies will be the chancellor’s top aide on all things Europe, as well as on international negotiations in G7 and G20 formats, and economic policy more broadly.Meanwhile in Paris, President Emmanuel Macron today is set to present the priorities of the upcoming French presidency of the EU, while his prime minister will carry the same messages to the European parliament in Brussels.And on the transatlantic front, US climate envoy John Kerry will be in Brussels today, meeting his counterpart Frans Timmermans after a stop in London and before a visit to Paris, in an attempt to accelerate climate action after COP26.Speaking of climate action, one of the envisaged EU proposals — a carbon levy on some carbon-intensive imports — is facing steep opposition from the very steel industry it’s supposed to protect. We’ll look at the arguments and the calculations they have put together.In his role as German finance ministry state secretary for financial markets and European policy, Jörg Kukies became well known in Brussels, especially after having been one of the architects of the Franco-German plan to issue common EU debt, which later became the bloc’s €800bn post-pandemic recovery plan.In his new job, however, the former Goldman Sachs banker will have quite a bit on his plate: combining roles formerly held by two advisers in Angela Merkel’s chancellor office — top EU adviser and top economics adviser who doubles as chief negotiator for the G20 and G7 meetings.“It’s a hell of a job,” says one EU diplomat who knows Kukies. “Combining economics and the EU in one person is huge.”But the 53-year-old former investment banker with Social Democratic credentials does not shy away from a challenge — or several. (During the Wirecard scandal, Kukies successfully deflected any personal blame and initiated sweeping reform of BaFin, the German financial regulator.)Scholz will probably expect him, in his chief economics adviser role, also to balance between the Green-led economy and climate ministry pushing for more investments, and the more frugal, debt-averse minister of finance, Christian Lindner.On Europe’s reform of its fiscal rules, Kukies is also likely to strike a balanced note. In previous interviews with the Financial Times, he declared his full support for greater European fiscal integration — as long as member states play by the rules.During his time at the German finance ministry, Kukies embodied a shift away from the austerity policies championed by Wolfgang Schäuble during and in the aftermath of Europe’s sovereign debt crisis. He is an avowed European (he studied in Paris) and told the FT that his job interview with Scholz in 2018 turned into a two-hour discussion about Europe.“We talked about the inherent contradiction of having an almost completed monetary union and a fiscal union that is rather weak,” he said.The FT has distilled the main challenges facing the new German government — and rampant inflation in a notoriously inflation-averse country is certainly one of them. How to strike the right balance between debt and funding necessary investments is another big one, as well as decarbonising the nation’s energy sources while meeting growing demand. (More here)Swaths of Europe’s steel industry could shut under the EU’s green proposals, according to Eurofer, the industry lobby, writes Andy Bounds in Brussels.The group has run the numbers on the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which should take effect from 2026.The CBAM, once approved by member states and the European parliament, is intended to help domestic producers by forcing imported steel to pay its carbon cost. (This is part of a set of measures aimed at reaching the EU’s target of a 55 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2030, also known as Fit for 55.)Steelmakers in the EU complain that while they must pay to burn fossil fuels, those outside the bloc do not.However, the proposal would also reduce the number of free emissions licences handed out to the industry under the Emissions Trading System, increasing their costs. Currently about 75 per cent of emissions are free.Based on a carbon price of €60 a tonne and annual production of 160m tonnes, the industry pays roughly €2.6bn a year. But carbon prices are rising fast and already above €80 a tonne. A Carbon Pulse poll of 10 market analysts expects the price to hit €97 by 2030.The European Commission’s impact assessment for CBAM modelled a price of €50 a tonne by 2030.The amount of free allocations for steel will drop 10 per cent annually between 2026 and 2030. Rather than 86m tonnes of free carbon, the industry would get 43m tonnes. Even if the industry cuts carbon output by a third by 2030 it would need to pay €8.4bn annually for the permits. That would wipe out its annual profits. Its members have roughly €160bn of annual turnover with profit margins about 3 per cent.Output has dropped 26m tonnes over decade as plants have shut.Axel Eggert, director-general of Eurofer, pointed out that in a globalised market such as steel “you cannot pass on the costs. You will lose market share.”Foreign competitors would only pay for the carbon emissions of steel sent to the EU. Because that is a fraction of their production they could produce it in their most efficient facilities and not have to reduce emissions at all.About 25 blast furnaces, which make steel directly from iron, are in the EU and UK. They will need to be converted to run on gas or hydrogen rather than coal, a process that will take several years given current technology and the slowness of national planning systems.Eggert said by 2030 the industry needed to spend €70bn to do so.“Reducing free allocations removes the possibility for us to invest,” he said. And lenders would not want to fund unprofitable companies.The commission contends — possibly optimistically — that countries such as Russia and South Korea are committed to carbon pricing, which will level the playing field.“Free allowances were supposed to be a temporary measure to deal with the risk of carbon leakage,” said an official. There will be a “careful, predictable and proportionate transition”.Rather than CBAM greening the EU industry, it would shrink it, Eggert said, reducing the bloc’s emissions but increasing carbon leakage as it imports dirtier steel from elsewhere.
219  The Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany was top of the list when US officials brainstormed potential sanctions that western countries could threaten against Russia to show President Vladimir Putin that any invasion of Ukraine would come at a heavy cost.Owned and built by Kremlin-controlled gas conglomerate Gazprom under the Baltic Sea, Nord Stream 2 is Europe’s most politically divisive infrastructure project.Moscow and Berlin have said it is a purely commercial enterprise that will safeguard European gas supplies. Kyiv, Washington and many EU countries say it will allow Russia to bypass gas pipelines through Ukraine, and give the Kremlin more leverage to use energy as a weapon against the EU.But with Russian troops deployed to the border with Ukraine and US intelligence warning of a planned invasion, the White House now wants Germany to commit to preventing it becoming operational if a Russian assault takes place.“If Vladimir Putin wants to see gas flow through that pipeline, he may not want to take the risk of invading Ukraine,” US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said following a call on Tuesday between Putin and US president Joe Biden.Few other projects encapsulate Europe’s complex relationship with — and energy reliance on — Russia than Nord Stream 2. When fully operational, the pipeline would ship 55bn cubic metres of gas to Germany every year: equivalent to about 15 per cent of the EU’s annual gas imports.The US has long opposed the $11bn pipeline. Former president Donald Trump authorised sanctions against companies involved in its construction, arguing that Europe could not ask for US help to deter Russia when it was at the same time funding the Kremlin through gas purchases.Biden waived those sanctions in May, arguing that the pipeline was almost completed and deciding that maintaining good relations with Berlin was more important.Russia’s military deployment on Ukraine’s border has shifted that calculus. Citing intelligence reports that the Kremlin could order an invasion as soon as next month, the White House has called on European states to join it in possible sanctions against Moscow to give Putin pause for thought.In addition to initiatives to target Russia’s financial system, getting a pledge from Berlin to block the opening of Nord Stream 2 would be a blow to Gazprom and the Kremlin’s gas export strategy — leaving them with fewer revenues and perhaps showing that Europe can cut its reliance on energy from Russia.It would also show how united western countries are in opposing Russian military action — after Germany has spent years defending Nord Stream 2.German chancellor Olaf Scholz was only sworn in on Wednesday, but US administration officials say they are already in touch with the new government.While broadly supportive of the pipeline, Scholz’s administration would consider halting Nord Stream 2 if an invasion took place, people close to the new government told the FT, as part of a wider slate of western sanctions against the Kremlin.There is groundwork already laid. In July Biden signed a deal with Scholz’s predecessor, Angela Merkel, in which Germany made a commitment to block the pipeline if Russia used it as a weapon against Ukraine.In Brussels, EU officials accept that while the 27-member bloc will agree on sanctions collectively, Berlin — along with Paris and Rome — will determine the most critical details. The lack of a prepared EU sanctions list detailing what member states would be prepared to put in place also means the bloc is on the back foot in negotiating a final package with the US.But a targeting of Nord Stream 2 would be likely to get warm support from the rest of the EU. Poland and the three Baltic states have been its fiercest critics, with Warsaw launching a slew of legal challenges in an attempt to block its construction.European unease about Nord Stream 2 and Russia as an energy supplier have risen this autumn due to a gas crunch and soaring energy prices. Many traders and analysts said the situation was partly due to Gazprom’s decision to limit extra supplies to the continent.Putin denies using energy as a weapon but, in the midst of the supply crunch, said the only way Russia could increase its gas output to Europe and ease the crisis was if Germany approved the pipeline.Nord Stream 2 was completed in September and Gazprom said it was ready to start shipping gas. But EU regulators have yet to give their approval. As a pipeline entering the EU, Nord Stream 2 is subject to Brussels legislation designed to promote competition.Primarily, the rules require “unbundling” — so that companies producing, transporting and distributing gas within the EU are separate entities. They also require that a pipeline such as Nord Stream 2 can be used by others — “third-party access” — and has a non-discriminatory and transparent pricing structure.Those demands are hard to square with Gazprom’s monopoly on exports.The unbundling requirement applied only to EU onshore pipelines until 2019, when the EU decided to extend it to pipelines and interconnections from third countries. Nord Stream 2’s exemption was rejected by German courts; the pipeline’s operator lodged an appeal in October.Germany’s regulator — the Bundesnetzagentur — started its four-month examination of the project in September. However, in November the regulator suspended the certification procedure, saying “it would only be possible to certify an operator.organised in a legal form under German law”.Nord Stream AG, the operating company, is based in Switzerland, and the regulator said the company had decided not to transform its legal form but planned instead to set up a subsidiary under German law solely to be the owner and operator of the German part of the pipeline.This means Berlin has leverage. Until the Bundesnetzagentur certifies Nord Stream 2 as an independent transmission operator, the gas will not flow.The US and European capitals are in intense consultations over the sanctions package, which is unlikely to be fully signed off at least before a scheduled European Council meeting of EU leaders next Thursday.Washington wants the full support of Berlin for its Nord Stream 2 threat as soon as possible, to be able to convey it forcefully to Moscow.Assuming no Russian invasion takes place, the pipeline still has a number of issues to tackle.Registering a company in Germany and showing assets and staff in place — as required by the German regulator — may extend the certification process by three to five weeks, which means the earliest the pipeline can start supplying gas to Europe is February, says Maria Belova, head of research at independent Vygon Consulting in Moscow.But to fully abide by EU regulations, Nord Stream 2 will also have to find a way to show that other companies have access to the pipeline and regulated tariffs, analysts say.Without the former, Gazprom, which has a monopoly on pipeline gas exports from Russia, may not be able to run the pipeline at full capacity. The Russian government has considered opening up pipeline gas exports to Russia’s second-largest gas producer Rosneft — a step Gazprom has previously opposed but which may expedite the EU’s approval for Nord Stream 2.As a worst case, the latest the start-up process could begin is June 2022, given EU rules on how long Brussels can take for a full review of the project and the maximum deadline for a final certification.Additional reporting by Roman Olearchyk in Kyiv and Erika Solomon in Berlin
220  The takeover last week of VKontakte, Russia’s largest homegrown social media platform, by companies tied to state-run gas giant Gazprom has the feel of a final act in a long saga of creeping state control over the company.In this, the Facebook lookalike’s trajectory has mirrored that of the Russian internet as a whole — from the freewheeling Ru-net of the 2000s to what is increasingly being dubbed sovereign-net by local media today — as the Kremlin secures ever more control.Founded by programmer Pavel Durov in St Petersburg in 2006, VKontakte was a maverick start-up that did not shy away from confrontation with the state when it demanded that accounts tied to the political opposition be suppressed.But the mass protests that rocked Moscow in 2012, often co-ordinated on social media, set the Kremlin’s sights on a crackdown — and VKontakte on a collision course. Durov left the country in 2014 after claiming he had been forced to sell his stake to pro-Kremlin investors. Mail.ru, which bought the 48 per cent stake, repeatedly denied that it was working on behalf of the Kremlin.Subsumed into the sprawling holdings of tycoon Alisher Usmanov, VKontakte began sharing user data with law enforcement (as legally required) and “adjusted itself to the Kremlin’s agenda”, said digital rights lawyer Sarkis Darbinyan.Now, critics say, indirect influence has morphed into direct ownership. Usmanov - whose USM Group said it denied any such indirect influence - last week sold his group’s shares in VKontakte’s parent company, VK, formerly known as Mail.ru, to insurance company Sogaz and to the Gazprom-Media holding, both affiliates of state-run Gazprom. The two will share a controlling stake.Boris Dobrodeev, VK’s chief executive, stepped down. His successor is likely to be Vladimir Kiriyenko, a top executive at Russian state telecoms group Rostelecom and the son of President Vladimir Putin’s deputy chief of staff, Russian media outlets RBC and The Bell cited sources as saying.“Close co-operation between the company and state agencies is only going to increase,” said Darbinyan, a co-founder of internet freedom group Roskomsvoboda. He added that he left the social media platform about five years ago, performing what he called his “digital hara-kiri” when the first signs of state influence appeared.Many Russians have turned to foreign social media platforms in recent years. Though VKontakte remains hugely popular, with about 71m monthly users in Russia, according to the Mediascope monitor, it has been outpaced by YouTube, with 79m. The use of Facebook and WhatsApp has also boomed — a bugbear for the Kremlin, which sees the role of western tech giants as a threat.Promoting VKontakte under the Gazprom umbrella could be a useful way to drive Russian users back to domestic platforms, said Alena Epifanova, of the German Council on Foreign Relations.“The long-term goal is to push out the foreign social media companies from the Russian market,” Epifanova said. “VKontakte is supposed to replace Facebook.”Through a string of court cases and fines, the Kremlin has piled the pressure on western tech firms, demanding that they comply with local data and content laws.“Honestly, I think YouTube has six months left in Russia,” said Andrei Soldatov, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis and co-author of The Red Web. “Next year, we will move to the stage of banning global platforms.”Gazprom-Media said it was interested in acquiring a stake in VK as it saw natural business synergies. “VK combines the country’s leading social networks with a multimillion audience and traffic, while Gazprom-Media Holding is the country’s largest producer of popular and in-demand content,” it said.With VKontakte and the other companies in the VK network, Gazprom-Media, one of the largest media holdings in Russia, now controls a vast swath of Russians’ online world, in addition to its TV channels, radio stations, printed press and film production. “A centralisation is taking place,” said Soldatov. “Corporations are being turned into ministries.”Gazprom-Media declined to comment on whether its acquisition of a stake in VK increased government influence over the social media site.German Klimenko, a former adviser to Putin on internet issues, said the choice of Gazprom-linked companies as buyers was purely a business move. “I don’t see a political element.The costs of such deals are high, and there are very few players able to buy.”The move did not bring the state deeper into the social network, Klimenko said — as it was already there. “[VK] is a Russian company, it complies fully with the law and with all demands that come its way,” Klimenko said. “There is currently no need, in Russia, to buy internet companies in order to control them or receive something from them. Say you wanted people to stop using swear words in VKontakte, you would just need to pass a law.”
221  Joe Biden has made a significant diplomatic concession to Moscow designed to prevent an invasion of Ukraine, signalling he wants to convene meetings between Nato allies and Russia to discuss Vladimir Putin’s grievances with the transatlantic security pact.Speaking on Wednesday, a day after he held a bilateral call with Russia’s leader, the US president said he hoped to announce high-level talks by Friday “to discuss the future of Russia’s concerns relative to Nato writ large”.The talks would explore “whether or not we can work out any accommodation as it relates to bringing down the temperature along the eastern front”, Biden added.The US president said he hoped the participants would include not just Washington and Moscow but also “at least four of our major Nato allies”, although he declined to name the specific countries.Moscow wants Nato to commit to halting any eastward expansion and to refrain from deploying troops and equipment that could be used to attack Russia from neighbouring countries.But Biden’s reference to finding a potential “accommodation” with Moscow in eastern Europe will startle many eastern Nato members and US allies, who fear Putin is using the threat of military force to win concessions on the US security presence in Europe.Putin on Wednesday reiterated his fear that Ukraine will join Nato, which he said would “undoubtedly be followed by the placement of relevant military contingents, bases, and weapons threatening us”.“We are working on the assumption that our concerns will be heard at least this time,” he added.Though Putin has periodically demanded similar talks for more than a decade, Moscow’s “red lines” have come to the fore in the past month after the US warned allies Russia was massing up to 175,000 troops at its borders in preparation for a possible invasion of Ukraine early next year.Putin said talk of an invasion was “provocative” but did not explicitly rule out any military activity, saying that Russia “has the right to ensure its security. in the medium and long term”.One senior official from an eastern Nato state told the Financial Times that “under no circumstances should the debate on guarantees in the context of European security be allowed to unfold”.Any talk of compromise with Moscow “must be immediately cut at the root”, they said, adding that this view was held by at least half a dozen EU members.Putin said Russia would send a draft security agreement “in the next few days” to the US after agreeing to have “substantive” discussions with Biden during the call. The two leaders agreed to “form a structure that would deal with it in a detailed and thorough way”, Putin added.Although a senior Biden administration official earlier in the week dismissed talk of red lines as unhelpful, the White House is keen to pursue a diplomatic route to dissuade Putin from invading Ukraine.Biden ruled out the unilateral use of force to confront Russia on Wednesday, instead focusing on spelling out what he said would be “severe consequences” were Putin to escalate the conflict in Ukraine.These included boosting military support to Ukraine, bolstering the US presence in Nato countries to reassure those on the eastern flank and assembling a punishing economic sanctions package.The sanctions would target debt and banking transactions and attempt to scupper the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that links Russia and Germany, which has been built but is not yet pumping gas, according to officials briefed on the plans.“I made it very clear [in the call with Putin] if in fact, he invades Ukraine, there will be severe consequences.economic consequences like none he’s ever seen,” Biden told reporters on Wednesday.“I am absolutely confident he got the message.”Additional reporting by Lauren Fedor in Washington
222  Germany’s new coalition government has promised to pursue a values-based foreign policy highlighting democracy and human rights and putting less emphasis on the country’s commercial interests, the overriding priority of successive administrations under Angela Merkel. Yet the day before he assumed office as Merkel’s successor, Olaf Scholz showed what a tightrope act this is likely to entail. Scholz took a tough line on Russian threats to Ukraine, Berlin’s most pressing foreign policy issue.When it came to China, the more consequential diplomatic challenge, the new chancellor sounded much like the outgoing one. Asked whether Germany would follow the US diplomatic boycott of the Beijing winter Olympics, Scholz obfuscated, promising to deliberate carefully and spouting pieties about international co-operation. If this was an occasion to set a different tone to relations with the biggest export market for many Germany companies, Scholz did not take it.And yet, the coalition agreement that Scholz’s Social Democrats have struck with the Greens and Liberals, does set a very different tone. Previous German governments regarded China as a strategic partner. This one treats it as a “systemic rival”, twice using a phrase that Merkel never uttered. It explicitly refers to human rights violations in Xinjiang, democratic backsliding in Hong Kong and to Chinese threats to retake Taiwan. Philosophically, it brings Germany closer to the US. At the same time, the coalition promises to “Europeanise” its bilateral contacts with Beijing and to devise a comprehensive China strategy in line with the EU’s. This European approach is particularly welcome. Beijing is adept at dividing and weakening the EU, and Germany’s single-minded pursuit of its business interests has often assisted it.A crucial part of the EU’s strategy is putting in place defences against unfair competition and economic bullying by Beijing. Measures include trade countermeasures, a clampdown on foreign subsidies, reciprocal access to procurement, due diligence requirements to eliminate the use of forced labour, a carbon border adjustment mechanism and a forthcoming anti-coercion policy. The new coalition should endorse these instruments, provided they are proportionate, instead of dragging its feet as Germany has done in the past, partly to please Beijing. The market opening Berlin has extracted in return — for example under last year’s abortive EU-China investment agreement — has been inadequate.Corporate Germany, understandably, frets that a values-based foreign policy will leave it exposed to retaliatory measures or a consumer backlash. Beijing has made such threats before. Like the Chinese government, German business leaders are hoping that it will be Scholz — who won the election vowing to emulate Merkel’s cautious and deliberative style of leadership — who will call the shots on China, and not Annalena Baerbock, the green foreign minister who is more hawkish. A bad outcome would be an emollient chancellor combined with a provocative foreign minister. It would undermine the credibility of German diplomacy and the cohesion of the coalition. Berlin needs to find a way of speaking truth to Chinese power, with Europe in solidarity.German industry — and, it should be noted, its European suppliers — have benefited enormously from China, not just its fast growth but increasingly its innovation. Nobody in Europe thinks decoupling is a good idea. But Merkel’s persistent faith in Wandel durch Handel — change through trade — proved to be misplaced. China has changed in the wrong direction. The new German government must adapt its foreign policy accordingly.
223  The negative side-effects of the European Central Bank’s bond-buying are increasing while its benefits are fading, one of its senior executives has said, warning that the policy is inflating asset prices and creating risks of financial instability.Isabel Schnabel, the ECB executive responsible for market operations, said asset purchases were “an important tool” during times of market turmoil or recession, “but their cost-benefit ratio deteriorates as the economy gains ground”.Bond purchases increased “moral hazard” by making investors reliant on them, Schnabel said, adding they may cause “excessive risk taking and overvaluations”, as well as creating a shortage of sovereign bonds in some countries such as Germany.Her comments are the latest signal that the ECB may only commit to maintaining its bond purchases for a short period when its governing council meets next week to decide on how much stimulus to provide next year.The central bank is expected to announce that it will stop new asset purchases in March under its €1.85tn Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), launched last year in response to the pandemic.Analysts have predicted that the ECB will cushion the impact on markets by expanding another, longer-standing asset purchase programme that it has kept running alongside PEPP. But the ECB may only commit to continue these purchases for a few months after March.The decision has been complicated by the surge in eurozone inflation to a record high of 4.9 per cent in November. The ECB is almost certain to raise its 2022 inflation forecast to well above its 2 per cent target next week, making it harder to justify continuing to buy large amounts of bonds.“By gradually shifting the policy mix away from net asset purchases when the monetary policy objectives are within reach, central banks can mitigate financial stability risks effectively,” Schnabel said.Since the ECB started buying bonds in 2015, it has built up a €4.6tn portfolio of assets. Analysts worry that any sign of a “hawkish” shift to withdraw stimulus earlier than expected could trigger a sell-off in eurozone bond markets.Schnabel said “the euro area remains vulnerable to fragmentation” and any “unexpected policy adjustments” could cause “changes in financing conditions that are sharper than intended”. She added that the ECB could benefit from having “a credible backstop that commits to counter such risks of fragmentation”. Other ECB policymakers have suggested that the ECB could keep the option open of restarting asset purchases under the PEPP, if needed, to counter market disruption. Schnabel said the scheme, which gives the bank extra flexibility in the timing and type of purchases, had “effectively provided such a backstop function over the course of the pandemic”. The German economics professor, who joined the ECB board almost two years ago, rebuffed the idea that the bloc’s central bank could raise interest rates before stopping asset purchases.She also said there was little point in raising interest rates in response to the “adverse supply-side shocks” that have pushed inflation above the ECB’s target this year. This would “risk choking the recovery and, given the long lags in transmission, exert downward pressure on inflation at a time when the shocks are likely to have already faded”, she said.
224  Germany’s Bundestag has elected Olaf Scholz of the left-of-centre Social Democrats as chancellor, bringing the curtain down on 16 years of conservative rule under Angela Merkel.Scholz will lead an unprecedented three-way coalition between the SPD, Greens and liberals that has pledged to modernise Germany, tackle climate change and pursue a slate of progressive social policies.But his immediate task will be to try to stem a fourth wave of Covid-19 that is putting unprecedented strain on Germany’s hospitals and to raise the country’s stubbornly low vaccination rate.MPs voted 395-303 with 6 abstentions to elect Scholz. Though a comfortable majority, the result fell 21 votes short of the 416 seats that the three parties in his coalition command in the Bundestag.Scholz, who has no religious affiliation, omitted the optional phrase “so help me God” from his oath of office, just like the last SPD chancellor, Gerhard Schröder who governed from 1998-2005. The Green co-leaders Robert Habeck and Annalena Baerbock, who will serve as economy minister and foreign minister respectively, did the same.A taciturn former labour lawyer, Scholz is only the fourth SPD chancellor since the second world war. He led the party to victory in September’s election by portraying himself as a safe pair of hands in uncertain times and therefore Merkel’s natural successor.Scholz will undertake his first foreign trip on Friday — to Paris, for talks with Emmanuel Macron, and to Brussels, where he will meet EU and Nato leaders.Merkel, who watched Scholz’s election from the Bundestag’s public gallery and who is retiring from politics, was given a standing ovation by MPs.The new government has agreed an ambitious plan to fight climate change by vastly expanding Germany’s renewables capacity, speeding up its exit from coal power and putting 15m electric cars on the roads by 2030. It also plans to raise the minimum wage and build 400,000 flats a year, a quarter of them subsidised by the state.In addition, the coalition parties want to legalise cannabis and liberalise immigration rules to ease the path to German citizenship.Scholz’s elevation to the chancellery caps a long career in politics. He was federal labour minister during the global financial crisis and mayor of Hamburg, one of Germany’s largest cities, from 2011-18.But he has often been mistrusted by leftwingers in his own party who never forgave his support of Schröder’s reforms to the German labour market and welfare system in the early 2000s.He lost the contest for the leadership of the SPD in 2019, but a year later, was chosen as the party‘s candidate for chancellor and oversaw a remarkable resurgence in its poll ratings. That culminated in a narrow victory over Merkel’s CDU/CSU in the September election.
225  Germany would consider halting Nord Stream 2, the pipeline that will bring Russian gas to Europe, as part of a package of sanctions imposed on Moscow if it invaded Ukraine, according to people with knowledge of Berlin’s position.Germany’s new chancellor Olaf Scholz is broadly supportive of the infrastructure project, as was his predecessor in the role, Angela Merkel. But the west has a broad palette of options for responding to a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine and stopping Nord Stream 2 is one of them, the people said.They were speaking after US president Joe Biden used a two-hour call with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Tuesday to warn him of “strong economic and other measures” if he sends troops into Ukraine.The Biden administration believes Russia, which has amassed up to 175,000 troops on its border with Ukraine, could be planning to invade its western neighbour “as soon as early 2022”.The dispatch of thousands of Russian troops into Ukraine would represent a huge escalation of a conflict that began with Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, which quickly spread to Donbas, an eastern region of Ukraine that was seized by pro-Russian separatists, and has already claimed more than 14,000 lives.Russia denies any involvement in Donbas but has supplied troops, logistics and material support to the armed separatists operating there, according to western governments.The US is considering imposing a package of sanctions that would include financial measures such as blocking the conversion of roubles into dollars and further targeting Russian oligarchs. But it has also made it clear to Germany that it would want to see Nord Stream 2 halted, too.The US has long opposed the project, which connects Russia to Germany bypassing Ukraine, saying it would increase Europe’s reliance on Russian energy and also expand Moscow’s ability to put pressure on its neighbours.After months of bickering over the pipeline, the US and Germany reached a deal in May under which the US agreed not to impose sanctions on the project. But the agreement also said that Germany would impose sanctions on Moscow to limit its energy export capabilities “should Russia attempt to use energy as a weapon or commit further aggressive acts against Ukraine”.Germany was largely supportive of Nord Stream 2 under Merkel. But the new coalition led by Scholz includes the Greens, who have long opposed the pipeline. Concern has grown in Russia that the Greens, who have now taken charge of the German foreign ministry, will block the project, say current and former officials in Moscow.Asked at a press conference on Tuesday about the situation on the Russian-Ukrainian border, Scholz said Germany was watching the Russian troop movements “with great concern”, adding it “would be a completely unacceptable situation if Ukraine were to be threatened”. But asked if he would pull the plug on Nord Stream 2 if Russia invaded Ukraine, Scholz demurred.US officials have said that Scholz cannot be seen to be yielding to US pressure on the pipeline so soon after being elected chancellor. However, they believe that he is broadly supportive of US objectives to exert pressure on Putin to prevent an invasion.Construction of Nord Stream 2 is complete but the pipeline but has not yet started pumping gas. It is currently being certified by Germany’s energy regulator, although it announced last month that it had “temporarily suspended” the process.The regulator said it could not yet approve the project, led by Russia’s Gazprom, because its owners had chosen to create a German subsidiary that had not been set up according to German law.Amid soaring gas prices in Europe, some western officials have criticised Gazprom, Russia’s state-owned gas monopoly, for not alleviating pressure on energy markets by increasing the volumes of gas it sells through spot trading.Putin denies using energy as a weapon, but has said the only way Russia can increase its gas output to Europe is if Germany approves the pipeline.
226  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.The much-anticipated Biden-Putin call yesterday yielded few signs that a de-escalation on Ukraine’s border was imminent, but a few hours beforehand, the head of the European Commission signalled full preparedness on the EU side to go for tougher sanctions on Russia. We’ll unpack what is actually feasible — amid demands from Washington for Brussels and Berlin to be prepared to take major steps against Moscow.Meanwhile, eyeing the other geopolitical rival, China, the commission today is set to unveil a brand-new trade sanctions mechanism aimed at deterring any foreign power from strong-arming European governments for political gains. The FT has an explainer of what to expect and why some countries are sceptical.Over in Berlin, the new government is finally being sworn in today and the new finance minister, Christian Lindner, has signalled some openness to more investments and possibly more flexible deficit and debt rules in Europe.And in more bad news for ride-hailing apps including Uber, the commission tomorrow will put forward a legislative proposal shifting the burden of proof on the companies whenever workers take them to court.Ursula von der Leyen’s vow to expand existing punitive measures against Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine comes against a confused approach to dealing with Moscow in the EU, write Henry Foy and Sam Fleming in Brussels.Back in June, EU leaders tasked the commission and its diplomatic wing to come up with “options for additional restrictive measures, including economic sanctions” against Moscow. This was twinned with a willingness to consider “selective engagement” with Russia on topics such as the climate and health (after Germany and France failed to convince the rest of the bloc to hold a summit with Vladimir Putin).The idea was to tee up a menu of measures for the EU that could, in part, serve as a deterrent to aggressive action by Moscow. The resulting draft paper became stuck in internal wrangling between EU institutions, before being seized by senior Berlaymont officials this autumn and finalised within a very small team.But since commissioning it in June, leaders have chosen not to discuss it, meaning it has sat gathering dust, its contents ignored, as Russia’s troops and tanks assembled on the Ukrainian border over the past month.As a result, instead of having the set of potential sanctions trigger-ready, the EU has appeared to have been caught flat-footed in recent days as the US takes the lead in demanding extreme and punitive measures aimed at deterring Putin from contemplating an invasion.Washington wants a block on Nord Stream 2 to be part of the package, alongside financial and economic measures that could restrict the ability to convert roubles into dollars, making purchases of Russian energy products complex. Both measures could be hard for many states — Berlin most prominently — to swallow.The topic will feature prominently in next week’s EU summit. Draft summit conclusions seen by Europe Express stress the “urgent need” for Russia to de-escalate tensions on the border.But they do not, at this stage, set out any indication of how the EU would respond, given this remains the topic of debate and planning in European capitals.In any case, the secretive options paper will most likely be overtaken by events (and by US demands for much harsher measures) by the time leaders will seek to agree on a common response.European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde last week said the bank was “very unlikely” to raise its deposit rate from minus 0.5 per cent next year, because it still expected inflation to fall below its target by 2023. Despite Lagarde’s comments, markets are still pricing in a 0.1 percentage-point ECB rate increase at the end of next year, though a month earlier investors were betting on two rate rises in 2022. (More here)Gig economy companies such as Uber, Just Eat and Deliveroo will be forced to prove that their workforces are self-employed contractors, not employees, under new draft EU legislation set to be published tomorrow, write Javier Espinoza and Sam Fleming in Brussels.The proposals are an attempt by the European Commission to rebalance a market where digital platforms have operated at low fixed costs thanks to the flexibility of hiring self-employed people. Courts have been flooded with cases where gig workers seek to prove they should be entitled to the rights enjoyed by those in full employment.The proposals, reported yesterday by the FT, follow months of discussions with unions and the private sector. They state that the burden of proof of workers’ status will lie with the platforms, which will have to demonstrate that they do not “control the performance of work”.Gig economy workers are generally considered self-employed, and therefore not entitled to minimum wage, sick pay or holiday leave. If they are unhappy with their rights, they have to take companies to court.Under the proposed EU law, companies will have to prove that workers are able to choose their own schedule and able to work for others, among the key criteria used to challenge an employment status claim.EU regulators said the overhaul will mean up to 4.1m individuals are expected to be reclassified as workers, a move that would grant them access to “rights and protections” in line with those in more secure forms of employment.Brussels estimates that by reclassifying workers, people who earn below the minimum wage would see a collective increase of up to €484m in earnings a year.The draft regulation says: “Those who, as a result of correct determination of their employment status, will be recognised as workers will enjoy improved working conditions.genuine self-employed people working through the platforms will indirectly benefit from more autonomy and independence.”Industry lobbyists are expected to push back. A study commissioned by MoveEU, whose members include Bolt, Free Now and Uber, concluded most drivers prefer the current “flexible” working arrangements and that a change in their employment status could lead to job losses.EU officials are likely to point at the myriad of court cases to show that not everyone is happy.The draft legislation comes after landmark decisions on the employment status of gig economy workers in countries across Europe, including the UK, Spain, Italy, Greece and the Netherlands.This summer, Spain reclassified gig workers as employees after the introduction of new laws. French authorities approved plans for workers to elect representatives to iron out collective agreements but gig workers were not granted employee status.Last February, the UK’s top court ruled Uber drivers are workers entitled to rights such as the minimum wage, which caused the company to voluntarily reclassify its UK workforce as workers.
227  If you could boil down Joe Biden’s foreign policy to its essentials, two things would stand out: competition with China, and the return of American values after the “aberration” of Donald Trump. Both are prevalent, although in tension, in Biden’s Democracy Summit, which the White House will host this Thursday and Friday.The virtual gathering will feature the heads of 111 governments and exclude China, Russia and most other autocracies. Even in America’s long history of proselytising freedom, nothing like this has been tried before.“It tells the world that America still believes in democracy and wants to put it back on the menu,” says Michael Abramowitz, head of Freedom House, which has registered a shrinkage in global freedom in each of the last 15 years. “The risk is that it is seen as a talking shop which could deepen cynicism about democracy.”Biden’s grand online gathering could hardly be more dramatically timed. It coincides with a formidable Russian military build-up on Ukraine’s eastern border and in the wake of escalating Chinese military activity around the island of Taiwan.On Tuesday Biden held a two-hour video conference with Vladimir Putin in which he threatened a drastic step up in western sanctions if Russia breached Ukraine’s borders. Whether Biden’s warnings have any effect on Putin’s territorial revisionism, which have so far appeared impervious to economic pressure, is an open question.Tensions in the South China Sea appear to have subsided a little following a call between Biden and Xi Jinping last month. It is a safe bet that the words “democracy” and “summit” did not dominate Biden’s discussion with either Putin or Xi. The contention that the world is in a struggle between democracy and authoritarianism is nevertheless at the heart of Biden’s foreign policy — and one that he hopes will reboot America’s alliances.Controversy over the usefulness — and wisdom — of the summit flared up last month when the White House released the guest list. It included 29 countries that Freedom House defines as “partly free”, such as Colombia, Indonesia and Kenya, and three that it classifies as “not free” — Iraq, Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo.This exposed Biden to criticism of smuggling realpolitik into a summit that was meant to be about values. Each discrete choice can be justified in geopolitical terms. As the most important potential bulwark against China, for example, India, which Sweden’s V-Dem, a research institute that measures levels of democracy, recently downgraded to an “electoral autocracy”, could not be kept off the guest list. Once India was on it, however, its arch-rival Pakistan had to be added too, even though it is a military-dominated state and a close ally of China.If curbing Beijing’s influence was a guiding aim, why were Singapore and Thailand left out? Israel could not be the sole country in the Middle East to be invited, which is why “not free” Iraq was included. Having suffered a coup earlier this year, Tunisia ruled itself out. It is hard to see any grounds to invite Angola and the DRC other than concern over China’s stranglehold on their resources, including materials that feed into lithium batteries and the iPhone.European critics asked why illiberal Poland was invited when illiberal Hungary was justifiably excluded? Likewise, what does Jair Bolsonaro’s Brazil, which is on the list, have over Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Turkey, which is absent? Others questioned the wisdom of inviting impeccably democratic Taiwan, which is not formally recognised as a country by the US, given China’s neuralgia over the island’s separatist potential. Similar flags were raised about the inclusion of Ukraine — by some measures as oligarchic and corrupt as Russia, which in recent weeks has amassed 175,000 troops on Ukraine’s eastern border. And so on.The White House counters that any possible list, however large or small, would have triggered accusations of double standards. Such objections should not make the perfect the enemy of the good, they say. Having spent the last four years watching Trump praise autocrats, such as Putin, and even North Korea’s Kim Jong Il, and disdaining European allies, the benefit of celebrating democracy speaks for itself.“The goal is for the summit to be a galvanising event — to be affirmative about democracy [as opposed to shaming weak ones],” says a senior official. “We want to increase that drumbeat. There are naturally going to be many different points of view.”The White House adds that their events, most of which will be streamed to the public via its website, will produce “deliverables”, such as a declaration on internet freedom, support for human rights and a pledge to fight money laundering.Though critics will dismiss such communiqués as toothless, officials say they will turn into action plans for the next democracy summit, which Biden plans to host in-person in 2022. One potential model is the 1975 Helsinki Accords on human rights that many wrote off as vacuous when they were signed but which played a crucial role over time in exposing the Soviet Union’s hypocrisies.A more recent point cited in the summit’s favour is how worried it is making China and Russia. Their ambassadors to the US wrote a joint letter last month to Washington’s National Interest magazine dismissing the summit as a product of “cold war mentality” that would heighten the dangers of “ideological confrontation”.On Sunday, China’s foreign ministry released a scathing 25-page white paper entitled “The state of Democracy in the United States”, which almost exclusively cited American sources on money’s grip over US politics, the widening wealth gap, racial discrimination and Washington’s “tragic mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic”. A surprisingly large share of US foreign policy experts may be dismissive of the summit’s value. Beijing, however, seems to be taking it seriously. “If the only thing this summit accomplishes is drawing China into a public debate on which system works best then it will have been worth it,” says Thomas Wright, a Brookings Institution scholar.But the summit’s pitfalls are attracting even more attention. These can be divided into three: allegations of US hypocrisy given its support for strongman regimes around the world; the self-defeating effect of talking about something rather than advertising it by example, especially at home; and the risk that depicting today’s global faultline as democracy-versus-authoritarianism will push autocracies closer together.The latter in turn would make it harder to work with them on global warming, pandemics, terrorism and other common problems. Running through all this is the concern that America’s values will clash with its interests, leaving both diminished — a recurring US dilemma.“It doesn’t seem as though Biden has thought this through very carefully,” says Stephen Walt, a professor at Harvard Kennedy School. “If democracy is our main goal then should we be siding with Saudi Arabia and Egypt? If containing China is our real purpose, then can we afford to be so choosy about who we talk to?”Such critiques echo cold war controversies, when US presidents heralded freedom as the core value while shoring up juntas that were willing to suppress pro-Soviet forces. These included ones that had been democratically elected, such as Salvador Allende’s socialist government in Chile, which was overthrown in a CIA-backed coup in 1973, or Ferdinand Marcos’s dictatorship in the Philippines and Jonas Savimbi’s Angola — each of which abused human rights on a par with Soviet-backed regimes. “Realists”, including those at Washington’s recently-formed Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, say that Biden risks falling into the same trap as his cold war predecessors.“This is the same playbook with ‘authoritarianism’ substituted for ‘communism’,” says Quincy’s Anatol Lieven. “The problem is that if you make democracy your absolute moral yardstick, every inconsistency will be leapt on as hypocrisy.”Examples include the Biden administration’s early decision not to sanction Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, even though US intelligence agencies expressed high confidence that he ordered the gruesome killing of Jamal Khashoggi, the US-based Saudi journalist. An even bigger one was Biden’s decision to evacuate US troops from Afghanistan last summer leaving its 40m people and thousands of human rights activists and journalists to the mercies of the Taliban. Biden has also continued to give billions in military aid with only minimal conditions attached to Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s dictatorial regime in Egypt.“Either democracy matters, or it doesn’t,” says a senior diplomat for a country allied to the US. “Why give America’s detractors such an easy opening? How will this improve the world in practice?”The charge of double-standards is applied most acutely to the condition of American democracy, which the Economist Intelligence Unit downgraded to a “flawed democracy” after Trump was elected in 2016. If anything, America’s friends feel even greater dread about US democratic backsliding since Trump was defeated last year. A majority of Republican voters have swallowed the myth that Biden stole the election. Though Biden can hardly be blamed for rising authoritarian sentiment on America’s right, or that Trump shows every sign of running again in 2024, his Democracy Summit risks being a distraction.Liberal supporters of Biden are increasingly vocal in criticising his reluctance to push aggressively for bills that would strengthen America’s electoral process against the kind of putsch that Trump’s allies attempted on January 6. Such federal legislation would check or undo moves by Republican-run states since January to strip local election officials of their independence.The fact that Trump could become president again, possibly through “election subversion”, also makes America’s partners wary of signing up to a US freedom agenda that may have a limited shelf life. Their instinct is to hedge against the risk that it might be Biden, rather than Trump, who turns out to be the aberration.“The best thing Biden can do for democracy is to protect it at home — it is always better to show than tell,” says Walt. “So far he has very little to show for it.”According to Pew Research, just 17 per cent of those polled around the world cited American democracy as “a good example to follow”. Harvard’s Institute of Politics found that only 7 per cent of American 18-29-year-olds described their country as a healthy democracy. More than half said it was either in trouble or had already failed.The third critique is that Biden’s summit will give countries like Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Cuba and much of the Arab world more incentive to embrace China than they had before. It will also present Beijing with easy propaganda.“The temptation is for China to ask, “Where would you rather live? Singapore or the Philippines? The United Arab Emirates or Iraq?” says Lieven. “Most people would probably choose undemocratic Singapore and the UAE.”It could also drive Russia more closely into China’s embrace at a time when Moscow is betraying hints of insecurity about Beijing’s reach into its “near abroad”. Hopes of prising Russia from China’s embrace — and exploiting fears of it becoming China’s little brother — may now seem academic given Putin’s ominous build-up on the Ukrainian border. Nevertheless, in the long-term Russia is unlikely to want to become a satellite of Beijing.Proclaiming democracy as America’s ultimate yardstick will also make it harder for Biden to get anywhere on other critical goals such as persuading China to give up its coal-fired power plants or share its research on emerging zoonotic viruses.“We do not yet know how Biden will integrate his democracy agenda with his other foreign policy goals,” says Abramowitz.Diplomacy’s ultimate measure is whether it can persuade others to do what you want of their own accord. If successful, Biden’s democracy summit would take time to yield results. It may be years before the world can judge whether he has planted a seed that will grow into something real, or whether he hosted another forgettable talking shop. White House officials stress that civil rights activists and dissidents have been invited from countries that are not on its list, such as Viktor Orban’s Hungary and Xi Jinping’s China. Giving them a voice on such a big platform could boost their cause. Equally, the event could turn out to be another transient exercise in moral grandstanding.America’s friends should be forgiven for fearing it might be the latter. In the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, George W Bush proclaimed freedom as America’s providential mission. Twenty years later, democracy scholars in the US and abroad blame Bush’s Iraq invasion and the war on terror for much of the subsequent “democratic recession” around the world. Freedom House now ranks less than 20 per cent of the world as fully free, down from 39 per cent last decade. Biden is a very different president to Bush. He is taking pride in bringing America’s “endless wars” to a close in Afghanistan and elsewhere. But good intentions are often bad predictors of outcomes.For many foreign policy experts, pursuing more tangible goals such leading an urgent charge to vaccinate the world, could lift democracy’s brand and boost America’s leverage without needing to highlight democracy at all. Biden often says that democracy delivers better results than the alternatives. Detractors and supporters alike agree that the way to prove that would be by example.“The test of Biden’s summit is whether it will produce concrete actions — on global data privacy, for instance, or human rights,” says Abramowitz. Harvard’s Walt adds: “My strong preference would be for America to show what it can do in the real world. We’re not in a great position right now to preach the virtues of democracy.”
228  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
229  The new German government being sworn in on Wednesday amounts to an unprecedented political experiment. The three coalition parties — Social Democrats, Greens and liberal Free Democrats — have never governed together before.And a host of urgent issues, not least a sharp escalation of the coronavirus pandemic, could subject their alliance to immediate strain. How they cope with the challenges outlined below will shape history’s verdict on their coalition.Olaf Scholz’s cabinet takes power with Germany in the grip of a fourth Covid-19 wave that has dwarfed previous surges. Infection rates are soaring and hospitals reaching the limits of their capacity.Faced with an inoculation rate that is far lower than in countries such as Spain, Denmark and Belgium, the new chancellor has advocated mandatory vaccinations for all. But even those willing to get a jab face hurdles: lengthy queues form every day outside vaccination centres and doctors’ practices have complained of a shortage of shots.Meanwhile, social tensions are growing: last week anti-lockdown protesters held a torch parade outside the home of a regional health minister, a protest widely condemned by politicians in Berlin.Scholz faces a much grimmer economic outlook than when his SPD narrowly won the election in September. Data released on Monday showed a far larger slump in factory orders than analysts had predicted.Industry has been plagued by shortages of raw materials and products such as microchips, which have led to delivery bottlenecks and production problems in the automobile industry.Meanwhile, inflation hit 6 per cent last month, its highest level since the early 1990s. Experts now believe Germany could take longer to return to pre-pandemic levels of economic growth than the eurozone overall.Business groups also fear that tough new restrictions on the unvaccinated, introduced last month, could suppress consumer activity in the run-up to Christmas.Nowhere are the new government’s ambitions so clearly in evidence as in its plan for fighting climate change. It wants to massively ramp up renewables capacity, exit coal power by 2030 — eight years earlier than originally planned — phase out petrol and diesel cars and have 15m electric vehicles on Germany’s roads by the end of the decade.But some experts have questioned how the country will be able to keep the lights on once all its coal and nuclear power stations are closed. It will need to build thousands of new wind turbines and solar panels, extensive new electricity grids and a swath of gas-fired power stations.Indeed, talk is of a looming “electricity gap”, with industrial and residential consumers facing a potential energy shortfall and rising prices. The new government will have to figure out how to bridge this gap and achieve its green targets without endangering Germany’s export-driven economy.Days before Germany’s new government took office, US president Joe Biden warned US allies that Russia may be poised to invade Ukraine. Germany, along with others in Nato and the EU, now accepts this assessment and will probably sign up for hefty new sanctions should the Russians do so.But that could prove to be one of the first big tests of the coalition’s cohesion. Many in the SPD are inclined to go easy on Russian president Vladimir Putin, in contrast to the more hawkish Greens.There is likely to be a row over what to do about Nord Stream 2, the gas pipeline from Russia across the Baltic, which the Greens oppose and the SPD backs. Faultlines over how to punish Russia could end up casting a dark shadow over what should have been the new coalition’s honeymoon period.Scholz last month promised the “biggest industrial modernisation of Germany in more than 100 years”, and his coalition seems determined to invest billions in greening Germany’s economy and upgrading its infrastructure.But the FDP insisted it would also abide by the country’s strict fiscal rules — in particular its constitutional cap on new borrowing, the so-called debt brake. Squaring this circle could become one of the coalition’s biggest challenges. Its 177-page agreement offers hints of a solution: much investment will be carried out by KfW, a state development bank, Deutsche Bahn and a federal property agency that will be used to build new flats.There will also be one last borrowing binge next year while the debt brake, which was temporarily waived during the pandemic, is still suspended. But rows between the pro-investment Greens and the pro-fiscal rectitude FDP over spending priorities seem preprogrammed.
230  The prospect of Mario Draghi stepping aside as Italy’s prime minister to assume the presidency is threatening to plunge the country back into political instability just as the government embarks on ambitious structural reforms and a coronavirus recovery plan underpinned by almost €200bn in EU funds.In a sign of the concern among Italy’s establishment, opera-goers at Milan’s La Scala theatre greeted President Sergio Mattarella, who was in the audience, with chants of “bis” — or “encore” — on Tuesday evening, imploring him to serve another term.Italy’s parliament is due to elect a successor to Mattarella in January as his seven-year mandate comes to an end. Long before the pandemic, Draghi was seen as the frontrunner to succeed him. But the appointment of the respected former European Central Bank chief as head of a national unity government in February has made a potential transition more complicated.Early elections would not be automatic if Draghi became head of state — a first in Italian history for a sitting prime minister. The parties that make up the coalition government could agree on a replacement prime minister to see the government through until the end of the parliamentary term in 2023. But officials and analysts believe that without Draghi, it is unlikely the administration will survive in its current form.“[Over the next year], coalition parties would inevitably squabble over spending priorities and tax cuts, which could paralyse the government,” said a minister speaking on condition of anonymity. “The only person who can keep a lid on this is Mario Draghi.” Mattarella called on Draghi to lead the government and marshal pandemic recovery plans following the collapse of the previous administration led by Giuseppe Conte after Italia Viva, a junior coalition partner, withdrew its support.In the 10 months since the former Bank of Italy governor took the helm, he has steered the country through the pandemic, implementing a controversial vaccination pass programme. His government has also detailed a series of structural reforms to be funded by EU pandemic recovery grants and loans — ranging from boosting digital networks and increasing energy efficiency, to lifting the number of childcare facilities and speeding up court cases.But much remains to be done. The most controversial structural measures, including long-awaited tax, labour market and pensions reforms, have yet to be rolled out. Meanwhile, investments under the Next Generation EU recovery fund have been outlined and some tenders published, but analysts warn the most complicated stage — implementation — is yet to come.Fitch Ratings upgraded Italy by a notch to a BBB last week, while S&P improved its outlook for the country from stable to positive in October based on the government’s reform agenda.“Draghi is a guarantor for the EU and Italian citizens that at least some of these reforms and investments will see the light,” according to Lorenzo Codogno, a former senior Italian treasury official and the founder of London-based advisory LC Macro Advisors.According to two members of the cabinet and senior bureaucrats, officials are racing to roll out recovery fund investments to avert the prospect of plans being thwarted by any changes in government.“Once the [recovery] plan is set in motion and there are experts in every ministerial department to oversee it, it is very unlikely any government, even the most Eurosceptic one, will want to undo it,” said another minister speaking on condition of anonymity.Recent opinion polls published by YouTrend suggested the biggest party after the next election would be the centre-left Democratic party (PD), followed by the far-right Brothers of Italy and the League.Both a potential progressive coalition, including the PD, the Five Star Movement and other smaller parties, or one made up of the two rightwing parties with the weakened centre-right Forza Italia, have a chance of surpassing the 40 per cent threshold required to form a government, according to YouTrend data. This increases the attraction of early elections for both camps.Forza Italia officials have said Draghi should stay in office at least until 2023 — partly because their leader and former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi is eyeing the presidency himself.But observers say the League sees political advantages in a presidency held by the ex-ECB chief, which would lend credibility and respectability to a rightwing government. The president has limited formal powers that include appointing the prime minister and other members of the government. But the head of state plays a big, behind-the-scenes role in ensuring stability and respect for Italy’s EU and international obligations.“[Mario Draghi] gives assurances that [such a] majority would always be fit for European affairs and for the international community. And, of course, on the public finances and the economy,” said one minister.Meanwhile, PD leader Enrico Letta sees elections as an opportunity to replace some lawmakers, many of whom were picked by the party’s former leader and prime minister Matteo Renzi, who ousted him from government in 2014.The party also wants to be the senior partner in a potential centre-left coalition. Another year in a fractious coalition government with the League could hurt their chances, according to PD lawmakers.Apart from Draghi, there are few potential presidential candidates likely to command the necessary two-thirds support in parliament. A centre-right candidate such as Berlusconi or someone from the centre-left would not receive the other camp’s backing, and insiders in Rome fear such a choice would cause political turmoil even if Draghi stayed on as prime minister.“The presidential election is a significant hurdle, none of the options before us are ideal,” one Italian official said.But the official also noted that at some point Italy would have to do without Draghi at the head of the government. “At the end of the day parties will have to take ownership of the Next Generation EU plan, which they voted for in parliament,” the official said. “Even if Draghi remains prime minister, it’s only for another year, not forever.”
231  China is preparing a blacklist that could tightly restrict the main channel technology start-ups use to attract international capital, and the US is pressuring Germany to block Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas in the event that Vladimir Putin invades Ukraine. Plus, the FT’s hedge fund correspondent, Laurence Fletcher, talks about Elliott Management, one of the most “fearsome” activist hedge funds.
232  The US has overtaken the EU as the leading destination for UK financial services exports after trade with the bloc dropped last year following Brexit.Financial services exports to the EU fell 6.6 per cent to £24.7bn in 2020, according to a report from TheCityUK, the sector’s lobby group, across a range of sectors from banking to insurance.However, exports to non-EU countries rose 4.1 per cent to £57.7bn in the same period, according to TheCityUK, within which exports to the US increased 5.3 per cent. This meant that the US accounted for 34.2 per cent of sector exports in 2020, while those to the EU fell to 30 per cent, roughly reversing the position from the previous year.The total value of UK financial services exports remained stable in 2020, at £82.4bn despite the upheaval of the coronavirus pandemic as global markets rebounded strongly in the second half of the year.The EU and UK failed to strike an equivalence deal for financial services, which would have allowed banks, insurers, law firms and accountants to work freely across borders after the UK left the bloc at the start of 2020.Although the UK and EU signed a memorandum of understanding on financial services, officials said progress has since been slow on striking any deal.David Frost, UK Brexit minister, told a dinner held by headhunters Odgers Berndtson last month that the UK was “unlikely to get extensive equivalence [on financial services] from the EU in the next year or two”. He added that the government policy was now “to work on that assumption”.The slowdown in UK trade with the EU has been countered by a rise in exports to other countries, however. In 2020, the year following Brexit and the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, total UK financial and professional services trade surplus increased to £79.3bn, according to the TheCityUK report, from £73.5bn in 2019.Financial services were generally more resilient during the pandemic, which hit supply chains and global trade in goods, according to TheCityUK.Anjalika Bardalai, chief economist at TheCityUK, said that “if the UK does not keep pace.other centres will continue to vie to attract business”.She added: “The UK’s status as a world-leading financial centre is at risk unless industry, government and regulators work together to boost long-term competitiveness, deepen key trade links and focus on new areas of future global growth.”UK banking sector assets totalled £10.3tn at the end of the first half of 2021, the third-largest in the world and the largest of any country in Europe, while the UK has the biggest legal services and insurance markets in the region.London had 352 foreign companies listed on the stock exchange in September 2021. During the first 10 months of 2021, the UK initial public offering market saw a resurgence in activity, with 93 companies raising capital through new issues and IPOs equivalent to £5.9bn.The London Stock Exchange had a 4.4 per cent share of global equity market capitalisation and 2 per cent of global equity trading by value in September 2021.The government hopes to boost further flotations by relaxing rules around stock market listings from this month, given criticism that countries including the US are more attractive to fast-growing, tech-focused businesses.
233  The US is putting pressure on Germany to block Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline as part of a package of sanctions that would be implemented in the event of Vladimir Putin invading Ukraine.The demand for Berlin and Brussels to prevent the pipeline from becoming operational is part of a sanctions package the US is proposing as it tries to stave off further conflict in the region amid fears in the intelligence community that Russia’s president is preparing for military action.It comes as US President Joe Biden on Tuesday used a two-hour call with Putin to warn him of “strong economic and other measures” if Russia’s leader sends troops into Ukraine.The threat to Nord Stream 2, which is built but not yet pumping gas, would be included alongside a package of sanctions being proposed by the US, which would include financial measures such as blocking the conversion of roubles into dollars and further targeting Russian oligarchs, two officials briefed on the plan told the Financial Times.Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, who listened in to the call, said “if Vladimir Putin wants to see gas flow through that pipeline, he may not want to take the risk of invading Ukraine”.“We’ve had intensive discussions with both the outgoing and the incoming German government on the issue of Nord Stream 2 in the context of potential invasion,” Sullivan added in a press conference after the Biden-Putin call.One western diplomat said Washington and Berlin had held “some pretty robust conversations” about the pipeline, adding: “Ultimately a consensus could emerge that if there is a serious invasion of Ukraine, Nord Stream 2 becomes untenable.”A US official said the new German government was expected to be “more helpful” to Washington’s pressure campaign against Russia, as the Biden administration tries to win European support for a strong package intended to make Putin wary of the costs of invading Ukraine.US officials are expected to travel to Germany as soon as the country’s new government, led by chancellor Olaf Scholz, is in place.“Nord Stream 2 is always an elephant in the room,” said the US official. “It looms large over anything to do with Russia, Germany and Ukraine.”Putin and Biden have told their teams “to follow up” on Tuesday’s call, according to a White House readout of their conversation.Also on Tuesday, Victoria Nuland, senior US state department official, said she thought Germany was ready to partake in significant actions against Russia if Putin were to invade Ukraine.“I believe they are [ready] and today is the first day of the new German government,” she said when asked about Nord Stream 2 during a Senate hearing. “We’ve already begun intensive consultations with them.”The Kremlin said the call between Putin and Biden was “frank” and “businesslike”. Putin told Biden the Ukrainian crisis had been caused by Kyiv’s “destructive behaviour” and what he described as Nato’s “dangerous attempts to take over Ukrainian territory and grow its military potential on our frontier”.The Kremlin added Russia’s president reiterated his call for legal guarantees that Nato would not expand eastward or deploy weapons systems in countries bordering Russia that could be used to be attack it.The US has spent weeks attempting to convince European partners of the risk that Putin might invade Ukraine early next year as it tries to secure allies’ backing for an aggressive response to deter him from such a move.It is unclear what type of military escalation would class as an invasion and trigger sanctions.In 2014, Putin denied that soldiers without insignia who seized the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine were Russian special forces and continues to insist Moscow is not involved in the separatist war in the country’s east — despite much evidence to the contrary.The EU earlier on Tuesday vowed to expand punitive measures against Russia in case of “further aggression”.Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, told EU ambassadors the bloc would “respond appropriately to any further aggressions” and take “additional restrictive measures” beyond economic sanctions in case of an invasion.Biden hosted talks with European partners on Monday ahead of the call with Putin so that he could enter the talks with his Russian counterpart with the claim that western allies were unified behind the US stance.EU sanctions being discussed would focus on ways to target Russia’s economy and financial system, western diplomats said.Western officials briefed on Washington’s approach said restrictions on converting roubles into western currencies would make selling Russian oil exports “much more difficult”.The US believes Putin is assembling the troops, equipment and disinformation campaign necessary for military escalation next year. A new invasion would reactivate a slow-burning conflict in Donbas, an eastern Ukrainian region on the Russian border, which has claimed more than 14,000 lives.US intelligence on Russia’s military preparations shared with European states in recent weeks had “created a sense of urgency” around new sanctions, a senior EU official said.Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula following a pro-western uprising in Kyiv. Since then, the Kremlin has supported separatist forces in the Donbas region, though it denies any direct involvement in the conflict.
234  French prosecutors have released a Saudi Arabian national a day after his arrest on suspicion of involvement in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, in what appeared to be a case of mistaken identity.The man had been detained on Tuesday at Charles de Gaulle airport as he was about to board a plane to Riyadh, the Saudi capital. The Saudi Arabian embassy in Paris had called for his release and said he was the wrong man.The arrest came days after France’s president Emmanuel Macron visited Saudi Arabia in an effort to improve relations with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and could have severely strained relations between the two leaders.French police had arrested the man on suspicion that he was a Saudi national wanted by Turkey in connection with the 2018 murder of Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by a team of Saudi operatives. A prosecution statement on Thursday said that it freed him after determining that the Interpol Red Notice issued by Turkey did not apply to him.Khashoggi was an outspoken critic of Saudi Arabia’s crown prince and one of the kingdom’s most prominent journalists. US intelligence agencies concluded in a report made public this year that Prince Mohammed had approved the Khashoggi operation, although he has denied involvement. The Saudi government called it a rogue operation.The kingdom later sentenced eight people to prison for the murder, without publicly naming them. Two senior aides suspected of involvement in Khashoggi’s killing, Prince Mohammed’s aide Saud al-Qahtani and deputy intelligence chief Ahmed Asiri, were cleared of wrongdoing.Macron weathered criticism from human rights groups over his visit to Saudi Arabia at the weekend, when he became the first western leader to visit Prince Mohammed in the kingdom since Khashoggi’s killing.Macron told reporters on Saturday he had discussed human rights with Prince Mohammed with “no taboos”, and addressed the Khashoggi affair in “direct” talks, adding that France had to speak to all sides to help peace talks in the region.“It doesn’t mean we approve or that we forget,” Macron said. In Jeddah, the state-owned Saudi Arabian Military Industries announced joint ventures with French companies Airbus and Figeac Aéro.
235  Germany’s incoming German finance minister has stressed the need for “stability” in the eurozone but said it should be combined with “growth and investment”, in a possible sign of openness towards reforming Europe’s fiscal rules.Christian Lindner told journalists on Tuesday it would be “advisable” for the eurozone “to remain committed to the idea of stability”. “That is a point the future [German] government will make when it comes to the review of the [EU’s] fiscal rules,” he added.But he denied that Berlin would now simply advocate a return to the austerity of the past. “Germany will respect stability and at the same time enable investments in competitiveness to be unleashed,” he said.Lindner becomes finance minister at a time when calls for reform of the EU’s fiscal rules are growing louder. A consultation is under way over how to amend the arrangements, enshrined in the Stability and Growth Pact, which were suspended when the pandemic began.Mario Draghi, Italy’s prime minister, last month said reform of the rules was “inevitable”, not only because of the high economic cost of the pandemic, “but also because of the future challenges of the EU, from the fight against climate change to new technologies, to the gigantic investments in semiconductors”.Meanwhile, Klaus Regling, managing director of the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone’s bailout fund, told German news magazine Der Spiegel in October that the 60 per cent ceiling on the ratio of public debt to GDP contained in the SGP “is no longer relevant” and should be raised.Lindner was speaking to reporters shortly after the three parties making up Germany’s new government — the Social Democrats, Greens and liberals — signed the coalition agreement that sets out their plans and policies for the next four years. The signing paves the way for the Bundestag to elect Olaf Scholz as Germany’s new chancellor on Wednesday.Lindner is leader of the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), many of whose members opposed the Greek bailouts during the eurozone debt crisis. In the course of the coalition negotiations he resisted attempts to increase taxes and loosen Germany’s debt brake, its constitutional cap on new borrowing.That has made him a figure of suspicion for some in southern Europe, who worry he will push for a return to the austerity policies pursued by the EU after the global financial crisis.Lindner noted the “big increase” in eurozone countries’ debts during the pandemic. “We must avoid. [having] fiscal dominance in the future,” he said. That refers to a situation where public finances are so burdened that central bankers are compelled to keep government borrowing costs lower than if they simply concerned themselves with inflation.Lindner also said the new government would be watching inflation “very closely”. Germany’s inflation rate reached 6 per cent last month, its highest level since 1992, though Lindner noted it was likely triggered by a pandemic-related “one-off effects”.He said he did not plan to raise new borrowing next year beyond the €100bn already outlined by the outgoing government, and reiterated his intention to reapply the debt brake — which was suspended in the pandemic — from 2023 onwards.
236  The EU is unlikely to approve Poland’s application for tens of billions of euros in pandemic-recovery financing before the end of the year, the commission’s executive vice-president has said, in a sign of the gulf that remains between the two sides over judicial independence.The European Commission was also unlikely to be ready to agree by December 31 on a bid by Hungary for its own slice of the EU’s €800bn Next Generation funding, added Valdis Dombrovskis, executive vice-president of the commission.The two countries both submitted bids for the recovery funds in May, but EU approval of the plans has been severely delayed because of deep differences over the rule of law. Brussels is pushing both nations to sign up to reforms that address longstanding EU legal concerns, as part of the milestones and targets they must agree to under the recovery programmes.Diplomats have in recent weeks perceived signs of progress in dialogue between the commission and Warsaw, even as Hungary’s plan remains stuck. But speaking after meetings of finance ministers on Tuesday, Dombrovskis played down the chances of any imminent deals.“The work is ongoing.It is unlikely that we can finalise this work still this year,” he said. “Movement on the substance is what really determines the speed. As soon as we are there in the substance, we can move forward.”Delays beyond the end of the year mean both countries would be unable to secure upfront payments worth 13 per cent of their total bids. That money would instead be folded into the overall payment plans when a deal is finally reached.Poland has applied for €36bn in loans and grants from the EU’s Covid-19 recovery fund, but Warsaw and Brussels have been at loggerheads for years over Law and Justice’s reform of the judiciary.Poland is under pressure from the commission to dismantle a controversial disciplinary chamber for judges that the European Court of Justice has found to be illegal. The Polish constitutional court in October also found that parts of EU law were incompatible with the country’s constitution, raising the stakes further.The commission meanwhile wants Budapest to address alleged deficiencies and weaknesses in the country’s procurement rules, which have stoked concern over corruption linked to the dispersal of EU funds.Brussels has also been considering whether to wield a new tool in its legal arsenal that would allow it to withhold EU funding where there are rule of law violations that pose a risk to the union’s budget.Hungary and Poland have sought to challenge that regime in the court. Last week those claims suffered a serious setback after a legal opinion from the EU’s advocate general recommended that the two countries’ legal action should be dismissed.The advocate general found that the new rule of law conditionality mechanism, which seeks to protect the bloc’s budget from violations by member states, was legally sound and compatible with the EU treaties.
237  Making dances has been the least of Lia Rodrigues’s concerns recently. The choreographer, a leading figure of Brazilian dance for several decades, runs an arts centre in the Rio favela of Maré, where her company and school are based. As Covid wreaked havoc in Brazil (which has recorded more than 600,000 deaths from the virus), Rodrigues stopped all rehearsals and threw her centre’s doors open to distribute food, masks and gel to hard-hit residents.In this context, the show she has put on this autumn in Paris is nothing short of miraculous. The Festival d’Automne à Paris, a prestigious multi-arts event, devoted one of its yearly “Portraits” to her. These tend to be retrospectives, but Rodrigues had a different idea: alongside a handful of her own productions, she asked 10 Brazilian choreographers, some of them past members of her company, to join her in Paris.It was a generous move, which brought new names to the fore. Not all the works shown were fully fledged, but there was promise in Volmir Cordeiro’s Métropole at La Briqueterie. Cordeiro danced with Rodrigues before moving to France, and he knows how to craft striking images. Masked and caped, with a long pink beard, his tall frame took on a shaman-like presence. Yet his stated aim, to explore systemic social violence, never quite translated into the choreography, and the text and many props often felt superfluous.Ana Pi brought food in lieu of props in O Banquete, presented at the Centre National de la Danse. In this whimsical piece, she is joined onstage by her aunt Mylia Mary, who cooks coxhinas (Brazilian croquettes) live; after the show, a buffet is offered to the audience. Yet the greatest treat was Pi herself, all undulating limbs, and entirely alive to the music.This Brazilian season culminated this month in a world premiere by Rodrigues herself, Encantado, at the Théâtre de Chaillot. For 20 minutes, it looked as if it might never make it past the scene-setting. In silence, at a snail’s pace, dancers unfolded a patchwork of colourful fabrics, which covered almost the entire stage. They then returned naked and sat or crawled under the makeshift carpet, like sandworms.Then Encantado shifted into high gear. In Brazilian mythology, “encantados” are spirits with healing powers, and the 11 cast members transform into similarly shape-shifting creatures. Using the fabrics as turbans, dresses, even swaddles, they launched into carnivalesque vignettes to a vibrant soundtrack: songs by Brazil’s Mbyá Guaraní people, recorded during a demonstration for the recognition of their lands last August.From a zany recreation of Beyoncé’s “Single Ladies” choreography to dancing human towers, the group swept the audience up with irresistible force. At one point, the men sitting to my left and right started tapping their fingers to the beat within seconds of each other. If there is any magic in Encantado, it was hard-earned — and we have Rodrigues to thank for it.★★★★☆‘Encantado’ runs at the Théâtre de Chaillot, Paris, until December 14; festival-automne.com
238  Mohamed Mbougar Sarr knew that winning the Prix Goncourt would not just be a literary affair. He had even outlined some of the potential pitfalls in his own book.In La plus secrète mémoire des hommes (The Most Secret Memory of Men), Diégane Latyr Faye, a young Senegalese author — Mbougar Sarr’s alter-ego, we suspect — is warned by a Parisian friend: “African writers and intellectuals, don’t be fooled. It’s not impossible that you’ll win acclaim from France’s bourgeoisie just so they can ease their conscience.But believe me, deep down you are and will remain foreigners, despite the value of your work.”About 300 pages later, in Dakar, he receives this Facebook message from a Senegalese youth activist: “White people can celebrate you all they want, give you all the prizes they want, talk about you in their big newspapers, but here you are nothing.You’re. a house negro.”Now honoured by France’s literary establishment as the first sub-Saharan African to win the prestigious prize, Dakar-born Mbougar Sarr is, for better or worse, navigating these complex times for real.A few days before our encounter, a stranger embraced him in a hotel lobby in Tours. The woman, a Malian, did not know how to read, she told him, but she was thrilled about an African winning such an award — she had thought it impossible. But his celebration has not pleased everyone: at home, some have deemed him unworthy of representing Senegal because he wrote about homosexuality — still a taboo — in a previous novel, Des hommes purs (Real men).Africans honoured in Europe are inevitably regarded with suspicion in their home countries, Mbougar Sarr tells me in the offices of his Parisian publisher Philippe Rey. “They are accused of collusion [with the former colonial powers], or of being uprooted,” he says. He adds: “Suspicion is a necessary phase to go through. So that with time, it will cease looking suspicious.”Mbougar Sarr’s win has been hailed as yet another sign of African literature’s vitality — this year alone, French-Senegalese writer David Diop won the International Booker Prize, South African author Damon Galgut received the Booker Prize and Zanzibar-born Abdulrazak Gurnah was awarded the Nobel. But this year’s Goncourt has an added layer of significance because so few writers from the Francophonie get to win the top prizes in French writing.What Mbougar Sarr sees in this rarity is France’s undue influence over its former colonies after the wars of independence. For decades, Paris remained the intellectual “centre” and its former colonies the “peripheries”, a phenomenon less prevalent in the former British empire, he says.This means that figures such as Zimbabwean writer Dambudzo Marechera, who won the Guardian Fiction Prize in 1979, and who died in 1987 from Aids-related illness, have been recognised earlier in the UK, he continues. “A lot of African writers have been published since the early 20th century in France — why aren’t they more recognised? Because they come from the margins. We could be a label, a niche, but there was a glass ceiling, that still exists in the media, commercially, editorially — which doesn’t mean that once in a while there isn’t a singular trajectory of an African author who gets an award.“But it’s changing. It has to change,” he adds. “This prize would not have been possible 20 years ago.”The 31-year-old, who lives in Beauvais, north of Paris, says being a symbol can be irksome “if this is the only thing people remember”. In his novel, which sets his protagonist Faye on the trail of a mysterious “black Rimbaud” engulfed in a plagiarism scandal in 1938 colonial France, Mbougar Sarr “seeks to question how a book and its author can be reduced to an identity, a skin colour, an origin,” he says. Turning his gaze to the bookshelves surrounding us, he adds: “That said, I know I can’t escape it — and perhaps I should not try to escape it.”Winning the Goncourt has mostly been a positive experience, he says. Describing the moment the award was announced last month, Mbougar Sarr remembers the media frenzy and “inside, a cocoon of deep and simple joy”. Since then, it has been an emotional whirlwind — and a life-changing outcome for his publishers, Philippe Rey and the Dakar-based Jimsaan, who have sold the book’s rights in more than 38 countries (Harvill Secker is expected to release the UK translation at the end of next year, Rey tells me).“What I can say is that I am a writer first, an African writer who received the Goncourt, that I am very happy, that this forms a whole. But this whole is structured around literature first, not politics.”And sure enough, La plus secrète mémoire des hommes is also structured around literature — its meaning, its value in society and its demands. The character known as the “black Rimbaud”, the elusive TC Elimane, is based on the life of Yambo Ouologuem, a Malian writer who won the Renaudot prize, another prestigious French award, in 1968, before being accused of plagiarism and disappearing from the literary scene.Reviews have underlined a rare plume (literally, the nib of a fountain pen) or “voice”, one of the most gratifying literary compliments in France. Adept at mise-en-abîme, Mbougar Sarr is a skilled raconteur — cerebral but never pompous, tortuous but also funny. We gladly follow the peregrinations of Faye, along the trail of dark arts that Elimane has left across three continents and over a century. Along the way, we meet magnificent female literary figures, such as the fearless “mother-spider,” a well-established sixty-something author who becomes a lover and a spiritual guide.Mbougar Sarr may have succeeded in writing his “essential book”, the one he believes each writer has in themselves and is “about nothing” in particular and “contains everything.”When it comes to style, Mbougar Sarr is clearly a perfectionist. His plume is sophisticated and refreshing in its boldness at twisting French expressions and overturning metaphors. There are a few linguistic trouvailles that fluent French readers will marvel at — and perhaps that are untranslatable (the ultimate literary compliment, according to one of his characters). Such creativity in French writing — which I have also lately relished in the work of Algerian author Kamel Daoud — is another reason why it is so vital for the Parisian literary world to open up more to francophone writers.Mbougar Sarr says anxiety creeps up when he writes because “very rapidly [he] faces his models” — “It’s not that I compare myself. But because they are my standards for literary excellence, it can become agonising. It’s as if all these writers, all these books are with me in the room,” he says.Winning the Goncourt has not given him more assurance, he says. “It is a bit early to say whether it has changed something in me, as a person or as a writer.The anxiety of writing, the bar I set for my writing, will stay the same. At least I hope it will stay the same,” he says with a smile.Francophone authors are often criticised for writing in the language of the former colonial power, but Mbougar Sarr feels unencumbered. “It’s perhaps a question of generation, but I have no tension with the French language,” he says. “It is my language too. It’s not my mother tongue, it’s a language I learnt at school, a language of the head, but it’s my writing language, for now. It’s one language among others, that carries part of my imaginary world and part of my history.”He continues: “That doesn’t mean I don’t know that it is a colonial legacy, and that as such it can pose problems. It is not an opinion shared by all the writers, there’s a debate.”Mbougar Sarr says he dreams “in several languages”. One day, he says, he will write in Wolof and Serer, his first spoken ones, once he masters them in writing to “explore what they have to offer, what parts of me they carry”.La plus secrète mémoire des hommes, by Mohamed Mbougar Sarr, Philippe Rey/Editions Jimsaan €22, 448 pagesAnne-Sylvaine Chassany is the FT’s world news editorJoin our online book group on Facebook at FT Books Café
239  It is not so much the guns as the grins that make the photo such a document of its times. “Santa, please bring ammo”, tweets US Congressman Thomas Massie as his seven-strong household pose with rifles in front of a blameless Christmas tree. His pun-strewn replies to accusations of bad taste confirm that this is “just” playful lib-owning at work. What, his entire being seems to ask, is the worst that could happen?Five years since the votes for Brexit and Donald Trump, it is still not understood how much populism boils down to antic rebellion rather than (the initial theory) economic grievance or (much more a leftwing thing) doctrinal belief. This is to some extent a movement of laughing cavaliers. Violence is not their wish, but nor do they recognise it as a plausible and unintended outcome of their doings.And why, given the lack of warnings from recent history, should they? Temporally, we are now almost as far from the second world war as it was from the American Civil War. Few voters in the west have ever seen their domestic politics go catastrophically, life-endangeringly wrong (at least until the Capitol siege of almost a year ago.) Their appetite for political risk is therefore only natural. Consider it the civic version of the rash consumption and investment at the end of a business cycle, when the last crash is too remote to remember. “Stability is destabilising,” said the economist Hyman Minsky, who should have tried his hand at political commentary.To define the west’s problem as one of casualness, not wilful malevolence, is not to minimise it. In fact, it is much the harder problem to fix. The implication is that nothing short of a violent crisis will restore to people a healthy fear of the political extremes. Social media can be tamed, electoral dark money banned and education improved to little effect. These are tactical answers to a problem that could not be any more structural: in today’s grating argot, a lack of “lived experience” of the consequences of populism.It is a problem that by definition gets worse with time. When the second world war veteran Bob Dole died at 98 last weekend, the US did not just lose a dry wit and once-productive senator. It lost one of its few remaining messengers from the dire first half of the last century. Praise for him is really a lament for the generations who kept politics more or less steady from 1945 to just before the millennium.Liberals have had half a decade to study populism in its modern form. They still miss its ludic element: its treatment of politics as a kind of low-stakes team sport. Even those who credit it tend to blame the innate frivolity of individuals, rather than a historic context in which no electoral choice has gone disastrously wrong in living memory. It cannot be a fluke that the most stable major democracy, Germany, is the one where the second world war, or rather its demagogic prelude, is simply never allowed to leave public discourse.If and when US democracy falls, giggling complacency, not moustache-twirling villainy, will be the presiding atmosphere. Of course, there are real believers and zealots on the American right. Former Trump aide Steve Bannon is one, as is the writer Michael Anton. But there were plenty of those in the 1990s and (in Barry Goldwater, a presidential candidate) the 1960s too. What has changed is the share of the wider populace who think no harm can come of extensively indulging them.In encounters with Trump voters and donors, a certain type recurs: unfailingly civil, vanilla in most of their tastes and often easier company than their leftwing equivalents. Some are just loyal conservatives. (Dole himself was not above a bit of tribalism.) Some, as is true of the most prominent Brexiters, relish an outsider cachet that was hitherto denied them by their own wealth and whiteness. Almost all are hurt to be thought of as enablers of civic damage to their country. In toying with the likes of Trump, their main failing is one of imagination, not of conscience. They can’t picture the worst-case scenario. Two or three generations separate them from any salutary historical lesson about what a fissile material politics is.To regard anything in public life as “inevitable” is to succumb to teleology. Still, with the passing of Dole and much of his generation, it is hard to avoid the thought that societies grow rasher and more reckless as their memories of past crises fade. In other words, for the west, whose last existential mess is now a human lifetime ago, there is no avoiding the wages of success. It should expect its politics to wobble and lurch until such time as citizens taste the consequences again.
240  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.How dangerous is the new Omicron variant? Is travel-related testing necessary even for vaccinated people? How soon should children get vaccinated against Covid-19?These are a few of the issues health ministers are set to discuss today with the heads of the EU medicine agency and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. I’ll unpack their agenda and look at why the flurry of national restrictions responding to Omicron need better co-ordination. We also have a cameo appearance from Emmanuel Macron on the topic of vaccines, days ahead of his planned news conference on the priorities for France’s EU presidency starting in January.In Brexit (aid) news, Ireland received Brussels’ green light for the first tranche of nearly €1bn in EU compensation for the economic damage to regions, sectors and companies hit hardest by UK’s departure from the bloc.Speaking of the single market, nearly 40 years after its creation, there is still ample room for improvement, according to a new report by leading industry chiefs.The arrival of Omicron in two-thirds of EU’s 27 countries has prompted a flurry of restrictive measures and accelerated vaccine uptake (including boosters). But it has also created confusion about what’s next — including whether to introduce mandatory vaccination and fines for refuseniks, as in Austria and Greece.Health ministers meeting in Brussels today will have an array of questions on the spread of Omicron and how to better co-ordinate their response.Here are some of the issues likely to be raised:Meanwhile, president Emmanuel Macron acknowledged last night that France had failed to produce its own Covid-19 vaccine but lauded the EU’s collective success in inventing, producing, distributing and exporting mRNA doses for the world, writes Victor Mallet in Paris.“It’s a wonderful achievement. We were able to vaccinate thanks to Europe,” Macron told a meeting to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Jacques Delors Institute, alluding to the BioNTech vaccine developed in Germany and marketed by Pfizer.“Sure, go ahead and be Hungarian, Polish or French nationalists, you wouldn’t be vaccinated, or only imperfectly,” he added. “Perhaps your Russian friends would have given you the Sputnik one that hasn’t been approved by the WHO — good luck with that!”France is set to take over the rotating EU presidency in January and Macron will hold a press conference on Thursday outlining his priorities, including on health.Even as official data point to a strong economic rebound for Ireland, the EU will this month start paying Dublin a nearly €1bn emergency handout designed to help the bloc’s hardest-hit regions, sectors and companies recover from the impact of Brexit, writes Jude Webber in Dublin.By dint of Ireland’s closely intertwined trade links with the UK, it will be the first member state to receive payment from the €5.4bn Brexit Adjustment Reserve. Payments to other affected countries should be finalised in the coming weeks, the commission said.A first €361.5mn payout — from a total €920.4m award for Ireland — will be sent this month, with the balance to be paid over the next two years. That is despite Ireland’s economy being on course to grow by 15 per cent this year, according to economists, and booming tax revenues, including a 31 per cent surge in corporation tax in November compared with the same month last year and a 25 per cent leap in value added tax.“Brexit has had a negative impact on many people’s lives,” Elisa Ferreira, commissioner for cohesion and reforms, said in a statement. “Within the EU, it is the people in Ireland who feel it most.the funding that Ireland will receive will contribute to improving living standards, support economic growth.and mitigate the negative impacts in local communities.”Neale Richmond, European affairs spokesperson for Fine Gael, one of the parties in Ireland’s coalition government, said the funding was a clear display of solidarity for Irish businesses and traders who have had to transform their trading models or switch to new routes or markets as a result of Brexit.“Ireland did not ask for Brexit, nor do we support it, but we must deal with the consequences of the UK’s decision,” he said. “This funding is crucial to ensure that the transition is as smooth as possible for our businesses.”The cash can be used to retrain people, help fishing and other industries, and mitigate the cost of customs red tape. Ireland’s fishing industry, for example, employs more than 14,000 people.The incoming German coalition is at odds over relaxing the country’s debt brake to allow for much-needed investments, so it plans to implement some creative workarounds, including by turning a state-owned development bank into an “innovation and investment agency” and using it to leverage private investments. (More here)A new publication by some of Europe’s industrial and tech leaders calls for deeper integration of the single market, nearly four decades after its creation, writes Javier Espinoza in Brussels.It took an oil crisis and rampant inflation in the early 1980s to set up the single market under the Jacques Delors commission. But a group that was an early advocate for slashing trade barriers within the union, the European Round Table for Industry is still unhappy with the result.It is calling for “more progress in the breadth, depth and governance of the single market”. Other business groups including BusinessEurope, Eurochambres and Eurocommerce have also urged renewed political investment in the project. The ERT publication, entitled “Renewing the Dynamic of European integration: Single Market Stories by Business Leaders”, offers 30 stories that expose issues related to the implementation of the single market — from labelling to free movement of waste and the scaling up of hydrogen.“Obstacles and obsolete restrictions persist while immense challenges are knocking at our door,” wrote Pascal Lamy, who was Delors’ chief of staff at the time the single market was created and then went on to run the World Trade Organization. “Let us vigorously resume the task of deepening our internal market with the new tools suited to the economy of tomorrow,” he added. Here are three key takeaways from the new report:
241  European Central Bank policymakers are reassessing the extent of their commitment to extra stimulus, reflecting rising doubts about how quickly inflation is expected to fall as the Omicron coronavirus variant fuels worries of further price rises.A trio of recent events has sown doubts in the minds of some rate-setters at the ECB, which has been forecasting for months that inflation would fall back below its target and justify the continuation of vast stimulus policies.The first was the surge in eurozone inflation to 4.9 per cent in November, well above the ECB’s 2 per cent target and a record since the euro was created two decades ago. This was followed by the emergence of a new coronavirus variant, which threatens to prolong the pandemic and with it the supply chain bottlenecks that have pushed up prices.Then late last week, the US Federal Reserve said it would accelerate the ending of its bond-buying programme to tackle inflation, putting pressure on the ECB to rein in its own asset purchase plans.Ahead of the ECB meeting next week, analysts worry that together the events increase the chance of a “hawkish” shift by rate-setters to withdraw stimulus earlier than investors have been expecting, raising the odds of a sell-off in the eurozone government bond markets.“On Omicron, it’s clear that it will keep inflation up for longer because the disruption of supply chains will last longer,” said an ECB governing council member.“The pandemic has changed the structure of the economy, with more homeworking, a higher carbon price and a shift away from globalisation,” the council member continued. “Over the medium-term, inflation could be higher than our target and then we would have to act.”The central bank is expected to announce at its meeting next Thursday that it will stop new bond purchases in March under the €1.85tn emergency programme launched in response to the pandemic. But ECB policymakers could also delay a further decision on how many more bonds they would buy in 2022 until early next year.“I would be very uncomfortable committing to anything beyond the end of the second quarter of next year,” said a second council member. “Markets are just going to have to live with that.”A third council member said a delay to its decision on future bond purchases was possible “depending on the pandemic and new data in the next two weeks”.The ECB has bought more than €2.1tn of bonds over the past two years, soaking up more than the total net issuance of eurozone governments in an effort to keep borrowing costs low.But analysts at UniCredit calculated that this could change next year, even though eurozone governments are expected to raise less debt, unless the central bank doubles the amount of bonds it buys under an earlier asset purchase programme to €40bn a month from April until the end of 2022.By continuing large-scale bond-buying next year, the ECB would be a significant outlier compared with other central banks that planned to halt asset purchases soon, including the Fed and Bank of England. The Bank of Canada has already done so.Consensus is growing on the ECB council that there is little extra benefit from increasing the monthly flow of asset purchases in terms of boosting inflation, according to two of its members. “There is no point expanding the asset purchase programme after March,” said one.Analysts think the ECB could commit to an extra “envelope” of bond purchases after March next year. But they said its decision was complicated by the fact that it was almost certain to raise its 2022 inflation forecast to well above 2 per cent next week, making it harder to justify a commitment to keep buying large amounts of bonds.“Upside surprises have been sizeable on inflation and the revision to the ECB’s 2022 forecasts will be one of the highest ever in the history of these forecasts,” said Frederik Ducrozet, strategist at Pictet Wealth Management. He expects the central bank to raise its forecast for inflation next year from 1.7 per cent to 2.7 per cent.Reinhard Cluse, economist at UBS, said: “The upcoming meeting is potentially one of the most difficult ones for the governing council in recent times, given the contrasting pressures on its inflation mandate.” Government bonds in the periphery countries of southern Europe “appear vulnerable to a shift in ECB communication”, he added.Christine Lagarde, ECB president, said last week that the bank was “very unlikely” to raise its deposit rate from minus 0.5 per cent next year, because it still expected inflation to fall below its target by 2023.Despite Lagarde’s comments, markets are still pricing in a 0.1 percentage-point ECB rate increase at the end of next year, though a month earlier investors were betting on two rate rises in 2022.“They’ve laboured that message so much that it’s finally getting through,” said Antoine Bouvet, rates strategist at ING. “Part of the reason it’s been so difficult is because of the Fed, whose influence leaks through into eurozone rate pricing.”The ECB has committed not to raise rates until it stops asset purchases, which economists say is unlikely before 2023, even if it keeps reinvesting the proceeds of maturing bonds long after that. “They could conclude asset purchases by mid-2023 and then it is feasible to see a first rate rise in late 2023,” said Katharina Utermöhl, economist at Allianz.
242  A proposed EU law that would allow swift retaliation against countries such as China and Russia over economic sanctions faces resistance from some member states.The anti-coercion instrument would give the European Commission sweeping powers to impose tariffs and quotas, restrict intellectual property protection and even lock countries out of EU financial markets.But some countries fear the regulation could breach World Trade Organization rules, increase protectionism and damage a fragile trading system.The plan must be backed by a majority of EU member states as well as by the European Parliament before it can come into force.A draft proposal seen by the Financial Times, to be endorsed by the commission on Wednesday, says the instrument would deter countries from targeting member states.Officials said it could be used in the dispute between China and Lithuania, which says Beijing has blocked all imports because of its policy on Taiwan. Lithuania allowed a Taiwanese Representative Office to open in November; China considers Taiwan as part of its territory.Under the new law, the commission would be able to respond swiftly. If talks with the other country did not solve the issue, it could, with member state approval, take 12 possible countermeasures.These include levying tariffs; banning chemical imports; suspending science co-operation; and “the imposition of restrictions for banking, insurance, access to Union capital markets and other financial services activities”. The measures could be taken against companies or individuals.The commission’s proposal defines economic coercion as “seeking to pressure the union or a member state into making a particular policy choice by applying, or threatening to apply, measures affecting trade and investment”.“There is an ongoing and significant use of economic coercion by third countries that threatens to undermine the rights and interests of the union and member states,” it adds.Using trade policy rather than foreign policy gives the commission more leeway. The regulation and any action taken under it only requires a qualified majority among member states to become law, rather than unanimity, which is necessary for foreign policy tools.Possible triggers would have included Russia’s boycott of EU produce in 2014 after the bloc first imposed sanctions over the downing of a Malaysia Airlines flight over Ukraine.The commission also cited as a trigger an effective ban by Indonesia on EU spirit imports in 2019, in response to action the EU had taken to tackle palm oil production causing deforestation.However, several member states believe the WTO is more effective than unilateral action. Sweden, the Czech Republic and Estonia have all questioned the need for the plan, while Finland and Italy are sceptical, according to diplomats.Several others, such as Germany, Denmark and Ireland, are waiting till they have seen the proposal before they endorse it.Japan has made a public objection, saying the instrument could break WTO rules, a concern shared by some EU capitals.Estonia, in response to a consultation, demanded that “the proposed instrument must be fully in line with WTO rules”. The commission should also assess “the possibility of exacerbating trade disputes, of inviting retaliation on the part of our trading partners, and of harmful effects on the rules-based multilateral trading system, in addition to the cumulative negative effect on the EU’s openness in terms of trade”.Sweden and the Czech Republic, in a joint submission to the commission, said any retaliation should be “a last resort”. They also warned that such moves could cause the EU more harm than good by hitting its own businesses. “It is crucial that member states are fully engaged in the decision-making,” they said.The US also had concerns, diplomats said. Washington declined to comment.
243  “Probe with a bayonet; when you encounter mush, push on; if you find steel, pull back.” This description of how Russia seeks to expand its influence abroad is attributed to Vladimir Lenin. But it could have been coined by Vladimir Putin. The Russian president is testing the resolve of the west with what US intelligence says are advanced preparations for a possible invasion of Ukraine.Having convinced its allies of the seriousness of the threat, Washington is trying to rally them behind a package of tough sanctions and countermeasures to deter Moscow from any further aggression. While it is unlikely that they would deploy their own forces or even provide significant weaponry to help Kyiv defend itself, the idea is to underline to the Kremlin the costs of a military intervention.Much will hinge on Berlin’s appetite for punitive measures against Moscow. It has taken some American effort to persuade Germany that there is real intent behind Russia’s mass deployment of troops and materiel along Ukraine’s border. Now Berlin appears to be on board with the US assessment, the discussion moves to deterrence and the potential hit to German economic interests that may follow if western allies have to follow through on a sanctions threat.Russia’s menace poses the first real foreign policy test for Germany’s incoming chancellor Olaf Scholz and his “traffic light coalition” of social democrats, greens and liberals. It will give an early indication of how the new government will depart from the patient diplomacy and continued engagement of the Angela Merkel years.“Nobody in the EU was as capable of dealing with Vladimir Putin through back channels as Angela Merkel,” says Cathryn Clüver Ashbrook, director of the German Council on Foreign Relations.It will also test the arguments put forward by critics of Berlin’s foreign policy that a century of German fears, sentimentality, and guilt towards its giant neighbour have left it deluded about Moscow’s real intentions. “Germany’s historically conditioned reflexes have distorted its view of Russia and continue to inhibit its behaviour,” John Lough argues in his new book Germany’s Russia Problem.The coalition contract published last month reflects the more hawkish views of the greens (and to a less extent liberals) about Putin’s threats to international peace and clampdown on civil liberties at home. Relations with Russia come after expressions of support for the people of Belarus in their struggle against tyranny and for Ukraine’s territorial integrity. It makes a point of acknowledging the deeper security concerns of Germany’s eastern EU partners.“We will take into account different threat perceptions and focus on a common and coherent EU policy towards Russia,” it states. But it also recites pieties about constructive dialogue and engagement. And it commits Berlin to “address the interests of both sides” when it comes to international security — a formulation that bears the fingerprints of the so-called Putinversteher, or Putin-whisperers within Scholz’s party.There is no mention of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, let alone a mandate to stop it, as the Greens would have liked. Instead, the issue has been handed to Germany’s network regulator, who can only certify it if it fully complies with EU energy legislation, which requires unbundling ownership of the pipeline and transparency of pricing. This has raised the hopes of the project’s critics, especially Ukraine’s gas operator, which stands to lose billions in transit fees if the Baltic Sea pipeline goes ahead. “It will be very difficult for Gazprom to comply without changing its business model,” says Yuriy Vitrenko, the head of Ukraine’s Naftogaz.Ultimately, it is Scholz as chancellor who will call the shots on Russia and he will have learned from Merkel’s experience, says Clüver Ashbrook. As a former finance minister, he may be better able to withstand pressure from business over deeper economic sanctions against Russia. But there is unlikely to be any sudden German conversion to the need for a steely deterrent against Russian aggression. “The biggest problem right now is that German population doesn’t sense the urgency,” says Clüver Ashbrook. “It doesn’t see the threat potential.”
244  A sustained rally that has brought the price of carbon allowances to new highs has triggered a market mechanism that could see the UK government intervening to bring down prices.The global energy crunch and renewed focus on emissions after the UN climate summit in Glasgow has fuelled a surge in the price of allowances issued under the both the EU and UK emissions trading systems.Under the systems, governments set a cap on the maximum level of emissions and create permits, or allowances, for each unit of emissions issued under the cap. Companies that are heavy polluters are obliged to buy credits granting them permission to emit one tonne of carbon.A gas shortage has led some energy producers, which are regulated under the systems, to switch over to cheaper but dirtier coal. Since coal is more carbon intensive than gas, demand for allowances has increased.In the UK, credits have remained at elevated prices for several months and came near a record of more than £75 a tonne last week. Meanwhile the price under the EU system hit a high of more than €81 on Monday. This compares with about €32 a tonne at the start of the year.Prices were “just crazy”, but remained supported by fundamentals, including the energy crunch as the European winter was setting in, said Ingvild Sørhus, lead analyst at Refinitiv Carbon Research.Consistently high prices since September triggered the UK’s “cost containment mechanism” (CCM) for the first time, which obliges policymakers to consider whether to intervene in the market. The government said it would announce whether to take action by December 14.Even before the energy crunch, EU and UK carbon prices were rising as companies and traders digested the implications of increasingly ambitious national decarbonisation plans prompted by the UN climate summit in November.Redshaw Advisors also noted on Monday that auctions for new allowances, under either of the systems, will not be held for almost a month following the final December sales.Under the UK rules, the government intervention mechanism is triggered if allowances trade at more than double the average price of the previous two years for three consecutive months.Since the system was established only in May, the threshold is calculated using a combination of historic UK and EU prices. The newer UK scheme has lower price and time triggers for the first two years it operates, compared with the EU’s equivalent mechanism.Whether and how the UK government intervenes will depend on its assessment of the reasons for the rally. Policymakers must consider whether consistently high prices “correspond to market fundamentals”. Action to push down prices could include increasing the number of credits due to be sold in upcoming auctions, which occur every two weeks, by bringing forward allowances from future years.Sørhus said it would be important for the government to explain “the basis for its decision”.There were “good fundamental reasons for prices to be where they currently are,” said Sebastian Rilling, EU power and carbon markets analyst at ICIS, the market intelligence group. In addition to the effects of the gas crisis, there was relatively little supply in the new UK market, but substantial demand, he said.Increasing the short-term supply of allowances is likely to reduce supply in the long term, since a finite number of credits are auctioned each year and the number sold annually is designed to fall over time to incentivise companies to reduce their emissions.“This is why we would expect the impact of any action taken to be limited,” said Rilling.
245  Western powers have presented a united front on the eve of a phone call between Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin, when the US president is expected to detail punitive measures that would inflict “severe” damage to Russia’s economy if the country invades Ukraine.The US president hosted consultations with the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and the UK on Monday, during which they “discussed their shared concern about the Russian military build-up on Ukraine’s borders”, according to a readout from the White House.The Biden administration has accused Russia of preparing for a military incursion in Ukraine by amassing up to 175,000 troops at its border, in a potential deepening of a conflict that began with Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.The White House said the leaders were calling “on Russia to de-escalate tensions and agreed that diplomacy. is the only way forward to resolve the conflict”.A senior administration official said Biden had consulted European allies ahead of the call with Putin on Tuesday “to make sure he goes into that conversation with allied unity and strong transatlantic solidarity”.“With respect to financial sanctions, we have had intensive discussions with our European partners about what we would do collectively in the event of a major Russian military escalation in Ukraine,” added the official, who spoke ahead of Monday’s call between Biden and Washington’s European allies.“We believe that we have a path forward that would involve substantial economic countermeasures by both the Europeans and the US that would impose significant and severe economic harm on the Russian economy, should they choose to proceed.”However, the official added that the US was not planning “to end up in a circumstance in which the focus of our countermeasures is the direct use of American military force”.Following the consultations on Monday, the Elysée Palace said French president Emmanuel Macron had discussed “the current tensions between Russia and Ukraine” with the other four leaders of the so-called Quint states.“The five heads of state and government.expressed their determination that Ukraine’s sovereignty be respected and declared their commitment to act to maintain peace and security in Europe,” the French statement said.Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, also spoke with Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, on Monday and reiterated Washington’s “unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty. in the face of Russian aggression”, according to the state department.The spectre of fresh hostilities in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, where a conflict against Russian-backed separatists has killed more than 14,000 people, has raised the stakes for Biden’s attempts to contain Putin’s geopolitical ambitions.“This may well be the last opportunity to move toward de-escalation,” said Samuel Charap, a Russia expert at the Rand Corporation, a US-based think-tank, of the call between Biden and Putin. “The stakes couldn’t be higher. Either it leads to a renewed diplomacy, or war becomes much more likely.”In recent weeks, Putin has made it clear that he wanted legally binding security guarantees that Nato will not expand to Ukraine or deploy weapons there — and warned that the west would face consequences if it crossed Moscow’s “red lines”.Biden’s team hopes to dissuade Putin from invading by trailing warnings of heavy penalties, working with allies on an unprecedented package of financial sanctions and developing military options to help Ukraine defend itself with additional weapons.“Nothing will be resolved in the call, but it’s a critical opportunity to shape the Kremlin’s calculus,” said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, Biden’s former Russia director at the National Security Council.The troop build-up was in part designed to dissuade hawkish elements of Ukraine’s government and armed forces from trying to quash separatists in Donbas by force, according to a former senior Russian official.“Nobody wants to fight, but they want to say: ‘Don’t even think about it, or we will completely flatten you’,” the person added. “It’s about containment.”Moscow has blamed the west for the tensions by funding the modernisation of Ukraine’s army and accused Nato of provoking it by adding new member states closer to Russia’s borders.Russia wants a prospective deal over Ukraine to be legally binding after claiming the west reneged on assurances it gave to the USSR in its final years that Nato would not expand beyond the former East Germany.The Kremlin may have already decided that it could weather whatever sanctions the US imposes, said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center.The most severe measure possible — exclusion from the Swift banking system — would make it difficult for Europe to buy the oil and gas exports that provide much of the continent’s energy. Previous sanctions blacklisting most of Putin’s entourage had the unwanted effect of rallying cronies and oligarchs around the president, Gabuev said.These oligarchs “are already under sanctions forever, so the west has no way to work with them”, Gabuev said. “That makes the troops on the Ukrainian border like Chekhov’s gun — if it’s hanging on the wall, then it’s going to go off.”Additional reporting by Victor Mallet in Paris
246  A video call on Tuesday between Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin promises to be one of the most difficult and consequential encounters between US and Russian leaders since the cold war. After positioning 90,000 troops near Ukraine’s borders, Russia has begun to signal what it aims to achieve. The Kremlin has said Putin will demand an agreement to “exclude any further Nato expansion eastward” to encompass Ukraine. Biden has rightly said he cannot provide such a guarantee. Deterring Russian aggression, while attempting to resolve the Nato conundrum without betraying Ukraine’s security or hopes for greater western integration, is the key to defusing tensions that pose a threat to stability in Europe.In reality, it is the Kremlin’s actions since the 2014 pro-democracy uprising that toppled Russian-leaning president Viktor Yanukovich that have left a majority of Ukrainians now in favour of joining Nato. Russia’s annexation of Crimea and fomenting of a separatist conflict in east Ukraine convinced many previously agnostic citizens that they need the alliance’s protection.Russia has also moved its red lines. Ukraine has not been granted a “membership action plan” that would be a step towards joining Nato. But Putin now argues “Nato” arms on its soil amount to a form of creeping, de facto membership — though Kyiv sought these defensive weapons to help it contain the Russian-supported eastern insurgency.An unfortunate irony of today’s situation is that while Russia is convinced Nato membership for its neighbour is only a matter of time, there is no consensus in the alliance in favour of it joining, which some countries see as a step too far. Blocking membership, however, would contravene a key post-cold war principle that European countries are free to choose their own alliances. Some western leaders also share Kyiv’s concerns that Moscow would treat such a declaration as carte blanche to march into Ukraine.For those reasons, Biden cannot provide the legal commitments Moscow is trying to extort. The US president’s first task must be to leave no doubt that further aggression against Ukraine would be met with sanctions that would impose an intolerable cost on Russia. Tony Blinken, secretary of state, says the US is preparing “high-impact economic measures that we’ve refrained from using in the past”. It must be prepared to follow through and EU partners must join them.Biden should at the same time send a message that the US and western partners are prepared to engage in talks with Moscow on reforming a European security architecture that looks increasingly precarious — subject to conditions. One must be that all Russian troops and hardware first return to their permanent bases.The US president must also make clear there can be no return to zones of influence in Europe imposed by force; the Putin circle have repeatedly hinted they are seeking a “new Yalta” — referring to the 1945 meeting where Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt carved up postwar Europe. Ukraine’s future cannot be negotiated — as Moscow wants — over the head of Kyiv, or its choice of allies blocked by threats or diktat. Russia’s illegal occupation of Crimea and Donbas must be part of any negotiation.Even sitting down for such talks would risk appearing to reward Moscow for aggression; making them a success would require bold and creative diplomacy. The US approach should combine toughness with incentives that in effect call the Russian leader’s bluff — and challenge him to break out of the perilous downward spiral in relations that he is creating.
247  Austria’s former interior minister Karl Nehammer was tasked with “restoring trust in politics” as he was sworn in as chancellor on Monday, becoming the country’s fifth leader in just four years.The law and order champion from the conservative Austrian People’s party takes office at a time of huge political tumult after the former chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, stood down amid a corruption scandal.He inherits the leadership of a government — a coalition with Austria’s Greens — whose popularity has collapsed in recent weeks amid public anger over the graft allegations and its handling of the pandemic.At the swearing-in ceremony on Monday, president Alexander Van der Bellen urged the new chancellor to “restore trust in politics that, I think, has been shaken for many people”.“Division harms all of us as citizens of this country,” Nehammer said in a statement after the ceremony, adding that his “primary objective” was to show angry Austrians “that we are listening to them and we take them seriously”. As interior minister, Nehammer was responsible for implementing Kurz’s hardline immigration policy and his pitch to Austrians, at least on paper, is that he offers a degree of continuity and the chance for change.Some analysts wonder whether now he is in charge he might plot a different course from his former ally Kurz and adopt a more liberal and consensual style of government.But even within his own party, Nehammer faces a tricky balancing act. He must differentiate himself from his tarnished predecessor, who dramatically quit politics last week, while preserving certain elements of the once hugely successful Kurz political playbook.“Nehammer is on the defence from the start,” said Thomas Hofer, a prominent Austrian political analyst. “The reality is that the People’s party does not have a Sebastian Kurz Two. This is as good as it gets.and meanwhile Nehammer is facing a social and political landscape in Austria that is going to be extremely challenging in the next few months.” In the spring of 2020, opinion polls gave the People’s party some of its highest ever ratings: with 44-45 per cent support, meaning Kurz was within striking distance of his dream of a single-party majority.Now it is polling at just 24 per cent and has slipped behind the Austrian Social Democrats, on 25 per cent. The populist rightwing Freedom party has meanwhile clawed back ground, and is now polling at 20 per cent.Kurz resigned as chancellor two months ago, after being named as a suspect in an investigation by state prosecutors into corruption. Even his closest advisers expected him to mount a comeback. But last week he also quit the leadership of the People’s party, pitching Nehammer forward as the party’s new boss, and obviating the need for Alexander Schallenberg to remain in office as a place holder chancellor (Schallenberg is to return to his previous job as foreign minister).Nehammer was close to Kurz during both his terms as chancellor. In his 2017-2019 administration — a coalition with the far right — he was elected as an MP and rose to become general secretary of the People’s party. When the second Kurz government was formed in January 2020 with the Greens, Nehammer became interior minister.The 49-year-old’s roots within the People’s party — and its traditional politics — predate those of the much younger Kurz, an outsider who came in and shook the party up — bringing a team of young loyalists to work with him in Vienna.Though originally from Vienna, Nehammer rose through the ranks of the party’s Lower Austrian branch — its most powerful and the least in hock to Kurz’s federal party revolution.Nehammer must now steer Austria through the pandemic. Covid-19 cases are soaring, but the government’s efforts to contain them through a highly controversial mandate for all adults to be vaccinated from February have inflamed tensions across the country.As members of the new cabinet walked with Nehammer to the presidential palace, the Hofburg, on Monday flanked by police, crowds of angry protesters, defying lockdown orders, jeered, whistled and booed.Nehammer’s challenge will be to try to bridge political divisions without losing the votes that a more abrasive style of politics, ushered in by Kurz, once won for his party.
248  When Vladimir Putin talks about Ukraine, he sounds like a spurned, abusive husband. A 5,000-word essay that the Russian president published in July, entitled “On the historical unity of Russians and Ukrainians”, is full of protestations of undying love for Ukrainians — combined with threats of violence if the love is not reciprocated. Ukrainians are variously portrayed as the blood brothers of Russians and as neo-Nazis.Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, joked that Putin must have a lot of time on his hands, to be able to write such a long article. But the contents of Putin’s essay look increasingly alarming when read alongside obvious preparations in Moscow for an invasion of Ukraine. There are now close to 90,000 Russian troops, as well as tanks and artillery, deployed near the Ukrainian border. Last week, Putin made a threatening speech, warning the west not to cross Russia’s “red lines”.Biden administration officials are briefing that Russia is planning an invasion of Ukraine “as soon as early 2022”. Policymakers in Washington and London fear that these war plans show there is genuine aggressive intent in the Kremlin and that it comes from the top.Searching for the sources of Russian conduct, western officials point to Putin’s July opus, which is regarded as an authentic expression of his deeply-held views. In it he emphasises the ties of history, language, ethnicity and religion that link Russia and Ukraine. He points out that these ties long predate the Soviet Union. Indeed Putin, who is often accused of nostalgia for the USSR, condemns Soviet leaders who set a “most dangerous time bomb” under the ties between Russia and Ukraine — by granting any part of the USSR the right to secede from the union. “Russia was robbed, indeed,” the president fumes.Putin insists that Ukraine is a failed state being led astray by scheming foreigners. This is where his argument takes a truly alarming turn. The west, he suggests, is playing a “dangerous geopolitical game” and is intent on using Ukraine as a “springboard against Russia”. This argument could clearly be used to portray a Russian invasion of Ukraine as defensive in nature.To avert a conflict, the Russians are demanding an explicit guarantee that Ukraine will never join Nato. That demand is likely to be central to the conversation between Putin and Joe Biden, scheduled for this week.Moscow’s demand sounds like something Washington might consider. The reality is that Ukraine is a long way from joining Nato anyway. Making that reality explicit may not seem like such a momentous concession — particularly if it can avert a conflict.But there are two reasons why the US and its Nato allies will be very reluctant to make that deal. The first is a matter of principle: Ukraine is a sovereign nation. It should be able to make its own choices without great powers making deals over the country’s head.The second reservation is prudential. Would giving Russia what it wants really end the possibility of a war? The logic of Putin’s love-hate letter is that the very independence of Ukraine is an abomination — a historical anomaly that has to be reversed. Make a concession now and Putin might move on to the next demand. Russia has already annexed Crimea, part of Ukraine, in 2014, and also demands a veto over aspects of its domestic policies.Putin’s fury about Ukraine seems to be about more than acknowledging a Russian “sphere of influence”. The contrast with his relatively relaxed attitude to Kazakhstan is instructive. Like Ukraine, Kazakhstan was part of the Russian empire and then the Soviet Union, before becoming an independent state.Putin has attempted to rebuild Moscow’s influence in Central Asia through the formation of a Eurasian Economic Union, including Kazakhstan. But Moscow’s ambitions have run straight into those of Beijing. In 2013, Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, announced China’s “Belt and Road Initiative” in Astana, the Kazakh capital. Kazakhstan now trades much more with China than Russia. Although some in Putin’s United Russia party still assert a territorial claim on northern Kazakhstan, the fact that this former Soviet republic is slipping out of Moscow’s zone of influence has not met with much resistance from the Kremlin.The Russians would argue that the difference is that Kazakhstan has not cultivated defence ties with China. But the growing closeness between Astana and Beijing has clear security implications.The real difference between Kazakhstan and Ukraine may be that Kazakhstan shows no sign of becoming a democracy. Ukraine, by contrast, has consistently resisted efforts to set up an authoritarian regime of the type that Putin has installed in Russia. The Ukrainian system is corrupt and dysfunctional in many ways. But the country has elections that are not a foregone conclusion, and a vibrant civil society.As Putin accurately observes, Ukraine and Russia are closely linked by history and culture. So the fact that Ukraine has taken a different political path from Russia raises awkward questions for the Kremlin — which likes to argue that “western liberalism” is completely unsuited to Russia. Perhaps that is the real reason why Ukraine excites such fury in Putin. Containing that fury, through the threat of massive economic sanctions, is suddenly the most urgent challenge facing the western alliance.
249  Hans-Werner Sinn, the forever Ordoliberal former head of influential Munich-based think-tank Ifo, has made a career out of warning about inflation. So, with prices rising at north of 5 per cent here in Germany, it’s not surprising that he’s back on our screens.Fans will be pleased to know that he’s lost neither the beard, nor the belligerence.Here he is on TV. Berlin last week vigorously shaking a bottle of Heinz’s finest to prove he was right all along that monetary policymakers’ low rates and bond buying “binges” were going to trigger spiralling inflation. (The bottle clip is around the 14 minute mark for those of you who can’t quite stomach the full 50 minutes.)What he’s getting at is clear enough. Policymakers have been shaking the bottle so hard that soaring prices are now being unleashed like big red blobs, creating havoc on the white plate of calm that characterised our lives in those bygone days when the European Central Bank was merely a glint in a French bureaucrat’s eye. The end result is, as the German commentator — borrowing from one of Sinn’s tracts — puts it, “Erst kommt gar nichts, und dann kommt ganz viel.”The theory doesn’t stand up to the reality that most of the inflation in the eurozone right now has its roots in supply chain bottlenecks. But we’re not quite sure how you counter Sinn through the medium of food. Empty supermarket shelves perhaps? Or even a ketchup bottle with an extraordinarily narrow end?While those of a dovish bent were quick to have a laugh at Sinn’s expense, he is not the first to turn to condiments to prove an economic point.Back in 2010, The Economist’s Buttonwood column delivered its take on the ketchup theory of inflation, quoting Tim Lee of pi Economics, who described it thus: “The central bank keeps ‘shaking the bottle’ (ie monetising debt) but no ketchup (ie inflation) comes out — so it shakes even harder.”More recently, the FT’s Martin Sandbu did what all right-thinking people do and turned the bottle on its head and waited, using the theory to explain why he thinks that the ketchupy nature of price pressures right now might actually lead to deflation once supply chain snags disappear.To be fair to Sinn, inflation’s clearly not a nothingburger. At the very least the theory underlines the, erm, pickle policymakers face in gauging just how pent up price pressures are.
250  Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor-designate, has appointed the MP and epidemiologist Karl Lauterbach as his health minister, putting a prominent voice of caution and a strong advocate of mandatory vaccinations in charge of the country’s pandemic response.Over the past year-and-a-half Lauterbach has emerged as one of Germany’s best-known and most-trusted experts on public health, and became renowned for his strong support of lockdown measures to fight the spread of Covid-19.He has backed stricter restrictions on the unvaccinated and called for the closure of all bars and clubs until the fourth wave of infections is over.Lauterbach’s appointment comes at a time when infection rates have been hitting levels not seen since the start of the pandemic. German authorities have signalled they will introduce obligatory vaccinations next year to tackle the stubbornly low inoculation rates.Scholz is due to be elected chancellor by the Bundestag on Wednesday, nearly 11 weeks after his Social Democrats (SPD) narrowly won national elections that brought the curtain down on Angela Merkel’s 16-year reign. He will lead an unprecedented three-way coalition with the Greens and liberal Free Democrats (FDP).The FDP and Greens have already announced their nominees for cabinet posts, and on Monday it was the SPD’s turn. The SPD and FDP at the weekend overwhelmingly approved the 177-page coalition accord between the three parties. The Greens will announce the results of a membership vote on the deal later on Monday.Lauterbach, who has been adjunct professor of health policy at the Harvard School of Public Health since 2008, said the country would “win the fight against the pandemic and we will be better equipped for further pandemics”. Vaccinations would “play a central role”, he added.Asked about the prospects for the Christmas period, he said a key aim would be “to bring the case numbers down so far that we can recommend travel without endangering people”.Confirming Lauterbach’s appointment, Scholz said Germans wanted a health minister who was a specialist in that field and someone who could do the job well.Naming a trio of women to head the interior, defence and development ministries, Scholz said: “In this government, security will be in the hands of strong women.” It means that for the first time in German history, it will have women foreign, defence and interior ministers.Nancy Faeser, a lawyer who leads the SPD in the southern state of Hesse, will become Germany’s first female interior minister, overseeing the federal police force and domestic intelligence.She told reporters that her focus would be “the fight against rightwing extremism” which she described as the “greatest threat that our democratic system currently faces”.Christine Lambrecht, outgoing justice minister, will move to the defence ministry, while Klara Geywitz, a Social Democrat legislator from the eastern state of Brandenburg, will become minister of construction.Hubertus Heil will stay on as minister of labour and social affairs, and Svenja Schulze, outgoing environment minister, will move to the ministry of economic co-operation and development, which is in charge of overseas aid.Scholz’s close aide, Wolfgang Schmidt, who was previously a state secretary at the finance ministry, will become chancellery minister — effectively Scholz’s chief of staff.The Greens and FDP have already named their nominees to cabinet posts. Green co-leader Annalena Baerbock will become foreign minister, co-leader Robert Habeck is to head the economics ministry and Christian Lindner, FDP leader, will be Germany’s next finance minister.
251  Hello from Brussels, which is braced for a Christmas in the shadow of the Omicron variant. Last week the government announced the latest restrictions. Restaurants and bars were spared limitations in hours (this is café culture Brussels, after all), and schools kept open for now, but with the ambitious instruction that all children aged six or above must wear face masks.As for Omicron’s impact on the world economy and trade, we’re somewhat optimistic that the blow will be smaller than with previous variants, which themselves weren’t fatal to globalisation. Today’s main piece is on the EU tooling up to take on the trade bullies, and Charted waters is on shipping delays.We’ve been going on for a while about how the EU is arming itself with an array of unilateral (sorry, we keep doing this, “autonomous”) trade instruments. The aim: to clobber trading partners whose companies are being unfairly state-subsidised to export cheap goods, bid for procurement contracts or operate in the EU single market, or which use forced labour or destroy the environment in the process of trading with Europe.A prototype of one of these weapons is being wheeled out of the European Commission workshop this week for examination by the European Parliament and the council of member states. The “anti-coercion instrument” (ACI) would aim to deter — and if necessary hit back with tools such as trade restrictions, divestment and blocks on government procurement — foreign governments from using unfair means to try to force policy change. The European Council on Foreign Relations has an excellent paper on the subject here.There are several intriguing things about this. First, it rests on a creative interpretation of a general principle of public international law, that (roughly speaking) governments are not bound by treaties with foreign governments that are exerting undue coercion, including economic and financial pressure. It was much discussed during the Arab oil embargo of 1973, an attempt to get oil-importing countries to withdraw support for Israel.If the targeted country then challenged the use of the ACI at the World Trade Organization, the EU would have to defend it using various provisions in WTO rules. The strategy is a bit suck-it-and-see — whack a trade restriction on a miscreant foreign government and see if you can convince a WTO dispute settlement panel that it’s justified. Full marks for entrepreneurial legal innovation, anyway.The second interesting aspect is that the likely target has changed, and with it the instrument’s probable scope. The original motive was to hit back at the US under Donald Trump, whose administration was threatening tariffs on imports of European handbags and other consumer goods to try to force EU countries into dropping their digital services taxes.The interim deal on digital services taxes means that rationale has gone, and a much likelier target is now China — which, let’s face it, has created a far richer and nastier array of coercive techniques than being beastly to French handbag makers. Just ask the Australians.The debate now is how to set the rules of deployment: who decides to use the weapon (if it’s the commission on its own, that’s a lot of power to hand it) and under what circumstances. Fans of the idea say it should be flexible and speedy with limited room for discretion. Bernd Lange, chair of the European Parliament’s international trade committee, says: “We should make a whole bouquet of measures possible, so that our measures are not calculable from the outset.” He also wants “a certain element of automaticity to prevent the EU and its member states from being vulnerable to being divided”.Sceptics (including Estonia, Sweden and Japan) are concerned it won’t actually limbo under the bar of WTO rules and will end up with the political management of trade. There is also, of course, the serious risk that the EU becomes a bully itself.As it happens, we’ve got a test case of coercion going on now. Lithuania (population 2.8m, GDP $63bn) has taken on China (population 1.4bn, GDP $15tn), not least by establishing strong relations with Taiwan. Strategic autonomy, indeed. Until now China has made only modest efforts to punish Lithuania, but Vilnius complained on Friday that all its exports were being blocked at Chinese customs. It’s not clear whether the measured response (until recently) is because Beijing thinks Lithuania is too small to matter or whether it fears wider repercussions across Europe.If the latter, would a formal anti-coercion tool help by formalising this threat on the Three Musketeers’ D’Artagnan principle of all member states for one and one for all? Interestingly, a report focusing on the Lithuania case by the Swedish National China Centre, a government funded think-tank — Sweden is the main other EU country subject to bullying by China this year — suggests perhaps not.First, it argues, China’s aggressive diplomacy is unlikely to be deterred by a threat of punishment, and so a cycle of retaliation would start. Rather than a precision instrument operating under closely defined criteria, the ACI would become a blunt weapon which, wielded clumsily, could do serious damage to the wielder. Business lobbies in the EU whose members are regularly caught in trade war crossfire, such as the drinks association spiritsEUROPE (the strange capitalisation is theirs), have urged the commission to make each use of the tool subject to a transparent consultation to evaluate the full economic impact. Second, the ACI can’t be used against coercive acts that are not made public either by the aggressor or the target, as many probably are not.Better than retaliation is “absorption”, the China Centre’s report says, helping coerced member states that find their trade with China blocked to develop other supply chains or giving them financial compensation through a solidarity fund.To some extent the principle in both cases would be the same, an equivalent to Nato’s Article 5 on collective defence: an attack on one member state obliges a collective response. It’s exactly the kind of thing the EU was made for. However, it’s not just the method that’s in question but the political will. Although general disaffection with China has been growing, member states often still vary considerably in their attitude to dealing with Beijing. It’s not just the design of legal tools that matters: it’s also the readiness to use them.Shipping goods across the world’s main trade arteries is not only super expensive right now, it’s also super slow. We’ve been hearing a lot of anecdotes about this, with much of the attention falling on the delays at ports such as Los Angeles and Long Beach. But what’s been lacking is a data set charting just how bad things have got over the course of the pandemic.Step forward Flexport, which has come up with an Ocean Timeliness Indicator to track journey times from the Far East to the US West Coast and back. Pretty grim, we’re sure you’ll agree. Claire JonesThe economist Daron Acemoglu says the supply chain crisis is a chance for a broader conversation about the economy and what it is for.FT reporters wonder whether recent inflation data will cause the Federal Reserve to withdraw stimulus more quickly.Only a quarter of British small businesses are ready for new border controls on imports from the EU due to be imposed in four weeks’ time, a trade body says.A summit between Narendra Modi and Vladimir Putin today may finalise (Nikkei, $) a long-awaited $681m deal to produce Russian assault rifles in India.Japanese brewer Kirin is seeking arbitration (Nikkei, $) to unwind its joint partnership with a military-affiliated company in Myanmar, following other multinationals such as Norway’s Telenor and South Korean steelmaker Posco that have had trouble with the junta.

252  Exchange traded funds have enabled the flow of billions of dollars from Europe into US equities as investors piled into ETFs exposed to this year’s huge US stock market rally, data from Refinitiv show.European flows into US equity ETFs industry surged to €27bn in the 10 months to the end of October 2021 — almost four times the €7bn of inflows recorded for US equities for the whole of last year, according to Financial Times calculations based on Refinitiv data. In contrast, European equity ETFs listed in Europe had attracted only €5bn of inflows by the end of October, although this too was a significant jump on the €2bn achieved last year.Deborah Fuhr, founder of ETFGI, a consultancy group, said the flows showed investors were chasing the best returns. “It has nothing to do with European equity ETFs per se. It is more about the exposure in terms of where [investors] think markets are going to be performing better, and also asset allocation,” she said.Jose Garcia-Zarate, associate director of passive research, Europe, Middle East and Africa at Morningstar, agreed that US equity had proved particularly attractive. “It all started at the end of 2020, when the vaccines started to be rolled out. And that set the stage for a resurgence of interest in equity, and particularly for equity in the US,” he said.The flows could partly be explained by the general preference among European institutional investors for passive strategies to access US equities, according to Guillaume Prache, managing director of BetterFinance.Garcia-Zarate agreed: “Passive vehicles, such as ETFs and index funds, are the default investment option for US equity. It is very difficult to find an active manager on the US equity market that can beat an index, such as the S&P 500.”But Patrick Wood Uribe, chief executive of Util, a sustainable investment data provider, said the trend pointed to potential difficulties in maintaining a commitment to sustainable investing if the focus was too much on performance.“If [investing in overseas equities] happens too much with European investments, there is going to be a dislocation between the source of the asset ownership and the kind of destination of the investment. And that is something that, if it doesn’t end up getting more dissipated over time, is going to be an issue.”According to Refinitiv, assets under management in the European ETF industry rose to about €1.3tn at the end of October. US equities ETFs accounted for the lion’s share with combined assets under management of €286bn, followed by global equities (€181bn) and European equities (€136bn).Click here to visit the ETF Hub
253  Winter holidays are fast approaching and the uncertainty surrounding the Omicron variant, combined with renewed Covid-19 restrictions (which saw Brussels’ European quarter descend into scenes of violence yesterday) risk damping down not only festive spirits but also economic forecasts. Eurozone finance ministers are gathering in Brussels today and we’ll take a look at the agenda.Meanwhile, on the foreign policy front, the Financial Times reports that weeks of sustained US diplomatic engagement and the sharing of intelligence normally reserved for Washington’s closest allies have helped convince some previously sceptical capitals, including Berlin, that Russia could soon invade Ukraine. US President Joe Biden will warn Russia’s Vladimir Putin against any invasion in a video call tomorrow, with the full backing of Nato and the EU for retaliatory measures.Over in Turkey, the leader of the opposition Republican People’s party spoke to the FT and we’ll unpack here why a regime change in Ankara may not be as straightforward as some in the EU think.And in digital regulation news, a lobby group representing luxury, apparel and toy brands has called for tougher measures against online platforms selling counterfeit goods.This article is an on-site version of our Europe Express newsletter.  to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every weekday morningThe Omicron variant doesn’t appear on the formal agenda of eurogroup meetings being held today, but the virus will nevertheless hang heavily over proceedings, writes Sam Fleming in Brussels. It will be the group’s first formal get-together since the emergence of the variant less than two weeks ago. The gravity of the upsurge was underscored on Friday by IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva, who said she already expected the fund’s October growth forecasts to be downgraded because of the outbreak. “A new variant that may spread very rapidly can dent confidence, and in that sense, we are likely to see some downgrades of our October projections for global growth,” Georgieva said at a Reuters conference. Georgieva will be in Brussels today on her first official visit to the EU since the beginning of 2020, where she will present the fund’s preliminary assessment of the euro area economy. The fund’s concern about the economic impact of the new variant is widely shared — and understandable given the renewed lockdowns that are being seen around the world and in Europe. As Laurence Boone, chief economist of the OECD, told the FT last week, the variant was “adding to the already high level of uncertainty and that could be a threat to the recovery, delaying a return to normality or something even worse”.Already in November the European Commission was listing the threat of fresh Covid-19 outbreaks among the downside risks to its otherwise buoyant growth forecasts, as it warned of mounting “headwinds” to the outlook. Now it appears that one of those risks is crystallising, triggering violent gyrations in financial markets. All this could have implications for the outlook for euro area fiscal policy, given talk has begun to shift towards ways of cautiously exiting the massive stimulus programmes that have been rolled out since last spring. But the reality is that it remains too early to draw strong conclusions about the economic repercussions of Omicron. While the strain displays a plethora of genetic mutations that could make it more transmissible and likelier to bypass vaccine protections, scientific evidence about its attributes remains partial. Anthony Fauci, Biden’s chief medical adviser, sounded a cautiously optimistic note yesterday, saying that while it was wrong to jump to conclusions, the early signals in terms of severity were “a bit encouraging”. What’s more, lockdowns have become progressively more targeted and less punishing during the successive waves of Covid-19, lessening the resulting economic damage. Booster campaigns are finally gathering pace in the EU, where two-thirds of the EU population is fully vaccinated, which may help governments avoid the need for draconian virus containment measures. Indeed, while US Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell acknowledged Omicron as a risk to growth last week, he spent far more time talking about the need to keep a lid on inflation. Some in the European Central Bank also worry that inflation will display greater staying power than expected. Omicron is heaping new uncertainty over the euro area’s economic prospects. The one confident prediction ministers can make is that the virus will continue to surprise them. MBA and executive MBA programmes taught in Europe dedicate a larger part of their courses to environmental, social and governance subjects compared with schools in the rest of the world. The average proportion of core MBA teaching hours dedicated to ESG in Europe is 75 per cent higher than the rest of the world, where only 12 per cent of the degree is related to ESG topics. (More here)The EU has been clashing with Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan for years, but a regime change would not necessarily be straightforward for the bloc, writes Laura Pitel in Ankara. An unlikely alliance of anti-Erdogan parties is convinced that it can topple the Turkish president in the next national vote, which is scheduled for 2023 but could be called earlier. “A large segment of society has embraced the idea that these people are on their way out,” Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the Republican People’s party (CHP), told the FT in an interview this weekend.Diplomats posted in Ankara say, however, that there is often naivete back home about what a post-Erdogan government might look like — especially when it comes to foreign policy. Kilicdaroglu insists that his party doesn’t believe in “using the outside world as a tool of domestic politics”. Yet at times the CHP has tried to outflank Erdogan. When the government sought to dial down tensions in a dispute over gas in the eastern Mediterranean in 2020 by calling a Turkish drillship back to port, Kilicdaroglu attacked the government for making a “concession”.Even more contentious is the party’s Syria policy, forged against the backdrop of strong anti-refugee sentiment among the general public.The CHP has said that, if it comes to power, it will send home the roughly 3.6m Syrians who fled to Turkey after the eruption of civil war in their country.“Of course no one will be forced to go,” Kilicdaroglu insists. Under his proposal, Turkey would restore diplomatic relations with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and then help to rebuild the war-torn country. Ankara would obtain reassurances from Assad that returnees and their property would be safe, Kilicdaroglu says. He would seek EU funds in support of this plan, even though European officials say that, without a political transition in Syria, that idea is a no-go.Kilicdaroglu rightly argues that many Syrians in Turkey live difficult lives marred by exploitation and low pay. But the plan he describes is seen by experts not just as a fantasy — but also a dangerous one that risks imperilling the safety of millions of Syrians.The CHP leader dismisses the notion that his policy is unrealistic. “Why would you, as a person provided with social security, a regular monthly wage, a job in a factory, and security for yourself and your property in Syria, stay and work in Turkey for half the minimum wage?”An organisation representing large companies including LVMH, Nike and Lego has ramped up its lobbying in the EU arguing that a key piece of digital legislation misses out on enforcing strong rules against counterfeit goods, writes Javier Espinoza in Brussels.EU regulators are ironing out details of upcoming pieces of legislation aimed at Big Tech. The Digital Services Act, aimed at setting clear rules on how large online platforms should police the internet, is particularly in the spotlight because lawmakers cannot seem to agree on a position to defend before member states and the European Commission next year.“It’s like everyone wants to put all the illnesses of the world in the DSA,” a lobbyist said.Europe Express has seen a letter signed by TAC Alliance, an anti-counterfeiting group representing large companies, flagging several shortcomings they perceive in the upcoming legislation. “As they currently stand, the limited scope and content of several obligations would not sufficiently prevent illegal goods or services, such as counterfeit or unsafe goods, from reaching consumers,” the letter reads.The current draft has a series of exemptions for smaller online platforms in a bid to shield them from unjustified costs, which TAC warns will be exploited to become a lucrative backdoor for the sale of knock-off goods. “Not only is this provision based on the false assumption that they would not have the means to implement those measures, but we believe it is also unfair and unjustified to protect small and medium platforms, when the majority of EU SMEs are in fact brick-and-mortar shops.who particularly suffer from significant revenue losses due to the increasing number of illegal products being sold online.”One country where this lobby has had an effect is France.

254  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
255  Now, they are also tightening their energy performance requirements, to force manufacturers to improve their products, and demanding clearer energy labels to help consumers.Reducing household energy consumption is essential if countries are to cut their emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and hit the UN target of limiting global warming to 1.5C.“Within buildings, appliances are among the key contributors to [energy consumption],” says Radhika Khosla, associate professor at the Smith School of Enterprise and Environment at Oxford university. “It’s so embedded in everyday life for many people. Cumulatively, [appliances’ energy use] adds up to a lot.”More than 120 countries now stipulate a minimum energy performance for appliances and require energy efficiency labelling, according to Jan Rosenow, director of European programmes at the Regulatory Assistance Project, an energy think-tank.Labelling was first stipulated by the European Commission in 1994 for a number of appliances. Later, the energy efficiency rating system used on the labels was expanded, to range from “G”, the worst, to “A”, the best.In March of this year, the EU simplified the energy labelling, as the top-three ratings under the previous scale (“A+, A++ and A+++”) had confused consumers.Now, the labelling is stricter so very few products are initially able to achieve an “A” rating for energy efficiency — leaving scope for more efficient products to be included in the future, according to the Commission.These new ratings apply to appliances including fridges and freezers, dishwashers, washing machines, television sets, and monitors, as well as lightbulbs and lamps. They will be extended to other products in the coming years.The EU has also banned the least efficient appliances under stricter requirements for energy use.Taken together, these energy labels and minimum efficiency requirements will create energy savings equivalent to the energy consumption of Spain and Poland combined — saving consumers an average of up to €285 each per year, EC estimates claim.Additional measures include requiring manufacturers to provide spare parts for up to 10 years after an appliance is no longer sold, to encourage people to use efficient appliances for longer.In the UK, the EU labelling and energy efficiency standards have already been passed into UK law.Then, last month, the British government published plans for further measures to encourage manufacturers of household and business appliances — including lighting, refrigeration and computer equipment — to make them less energy-consuming and easier to repair.Lisa Barber, head of home products and services at Which?, a UK consumer charity, says regulations should be strengthened so that energy efficiency labels also include information about the durability of a product and its ease of repair, to help consumers choose products that will last longer.But how confident are policymakers that improving labelling systems will deliver energy savings? Kadri Simson, EU Commissioner for Energy, told the Financial Times last week she had total confidence that the new labelling regime would help change consumer behaviour. “I am always confident in the impact of our policies, and in this case, we have data to back it up,” she said, citing an EU-wide survey in 2019, which found 79 per cent EU consumers said energy labels had influenced their purchasing decisions.However, others are less sure. Some say the evidence of labels’ impact on consumers is more mixed — especially in developing countries where minimum standards of energy efficiency for white goods are less widely used.Energy labels on appliances also differ in developed nations. In the US, for example, Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers says labels must give information on the annual operating cost of the appliance, its energy consumption rating, and a range of the highest and lowest operating costs for all similar models.But there is growing evidence that a carrot-and-stick approach of combining energy labels for home appliances with mandatory minimum standards for energy efficiency can lead to big reductions in energy use.Energy labels encourage or “pull” some consumers to make better-informed decisions about energy efficiency when buying products, argues Rosenow at the Regulatory Assistance Project. At the same time, minimum requirements for energy efficiency encourage product innovation and “push” the market away from the most energy wasteful products, he adds. In countries with long-running policies on minimum energy consumption and energy ratings, appliances are now typically consuming 30 per cent less energy than they would have done otherwise, a report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) has found.“Energy labels on their own have an effect on consumer purchasing behaviour,” notes Rosenow. “But they are much more effective if coupled with regulation that gradually takes the least efficient equipment off the market. We have seen this with lightbulbs.moving from incandescent lamps to compact fluorescent bulbs to LEDs, which now dominate the market.”Consolidating national energy labelling standards into international standards may accelerate the progress.At the UN COP26 climate summit last month, 14 countries — including the UK, Germany, India, Brazil and Nigeria — committed to doubling the energy efficiency of four products by 2030: lighting, refrigerators, air conditioners and industrial motor systems. These product categories account for about 40 per cent of global electricity consumption.Combining labelling standards with other measures — such as subsidies or tax incentives on appliances with high energy efficiency — could also help, the IEA has said.Technological developments, including an increase in “smart” appliances and homes gathering data on energy use, will also boost awareness of household energy efficiency and cut bills, experts say. “A smart washing machine can automatically start when it receives a signal from the grid that energy cost is at its lowest level during off-peak hours,” points out Paolo Falcioni, director-general at Applia, a trade association for Europe’s home appliance industry.Still, experts admit that labelling needs common international standards, and to be combined with mandatory minimum energy performance, if it is to have maximum impact.“[Energy rating] labels are really important, but they are important within a portfolio of minimum energy performance standards,” says Khosla of Oxford university. “In general, unless there are mandatory standards and [energy rating] labels they are unlikely to work as well.”Energy is the world’s indispensable business and Energy Source is its newsletter.

256  While it does not grab the headlines, every incremental effort to reduce energy consumption is vital if the world is to hit the Paris Agreement’s target of keeping global warming below 1.5C. The potential of energy efficiency measures to cut emissions is undeniable.However, a report last month on recent progress in rolling out energy-saving measures, published by the International Energy Agency, is damning. It found that global improvements have been well short of what is needed to put the world on track to reach net zero emissions by 2050. And the rate of improvements has been sliding since 2015, falling to its slowest in a decade in 2020.“There is no plausible pathway to net zero emissions without using our energy resources much more efficiently,” said Fatih Birol, IEA executive director, on publication of the report.The slow pace of investment has left facilitators — from electrical and capital goods companies to software providers and investment funds — exasperated that many businesses have still not taken readily available opportunities to reduce their carbon footprint. Jonathan Parr — a fund manager at Triple Point Energy Efficiency Infrastructure Company, which invests in projects such as recovering waste heat from industrial sites and retrofitting insulation or heat pumps in homes — says government incentives initially made renewable power projects attractive, but they have been winding down.“The very low-hanging fruit has now disappeared,” he says. “The balance has shifted somewhat.” He adds that “decarbonisation still carries a stigma that it’s more expensive than other polluting alternatives”.Frustration has been compounded by the fact that the incentive to cut energy use should now be even higher as power bills have surged due to soaring gas prices.Katie McGinty, vice-president and chief sustainability and external relations officer at Johnson Controls, which makes heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment, compares the missed opportunity in energy efficiency to “$20 bills littering the sidewalk and nobody [picking] them up”.She says big barriers to adoption have included a misalignment of interests — often, builders and owners do not want to upgrade buildings even if the tenants do — and the US federal government not taking the same lead on building standards as it does for appliances or cars.Olivier Blum, chief strategy and sustainability officer at Schneider Electric, a French electrical equipment and software group, says that the customer’s return on investment for energy efficiency projects is typically three years, but “the corporate world was slow to start”.However, he noticed signs of change around 2018 as the ambitions of the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015 seeped through to boardrooms in the form of net zero commitments, which are now being converted into action.“We see it coming,” he says. “It’s coming from investors and boards.” Parr says it is not just the pledges from private companies that are now driving momentum behind energy efficiency projects. “Housing associations and local authorities have been given clear instructions that they must decarbonise their housing stock,” he notes.Executives at groups involved in energy efficiency are also becoming more bullish that investment will flood into the sector. A need to triple annual investment in the sector worldwide by 2030 to hit net zero targets, plus companies’ need to demonstrate their progress, have driven this gear shift, the executives say.“We have realised that buildings represent 40 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, and there’s no decarbonising the planet without decarbonising buildings,” explains McGinty. “It has brought energy efficiency into the pantheon of tools next to solar, wind and electric vehicles.”That realisation has contributed to a rally in the shares prices of efficiency-enabling companies, helped by a rebound in manufacturing output after the initial impact of the Covid pandemic.Energy is the world’s indispensable business and Energy Source is its newsletter.

Britain’s Spirax Sarco Engineering, which makes steam management systems — an industrial staple that accounts for a ninth of US energy use, according to the country’s Department of Energy — has also enjoyed a share price boost.Scott Cagehin, an analyst at Investec, says investors are now on the hunt for less obvious industrial winners from the drive towards energy efficiency.“The likes of Schneider, Vestas and Spirax have run their course in terms of being well known as ESG friendly,” he says. “Who shall we look at who is not [yet] acknowledged for that?” His advice is: “You’ve got to sift through those putting ESG [environmental, social and governance criteria] slides in their pack just to improve their own credentials and then look at who is winning business and growing revenues because customers are wanting to buy their products to improve their own sustainability.”However, Blum of Schneider Electric warns of a moment of reckoning as many industrial companies try to jump on the energy efficiency bandwagon.“Many companies have seen a re-rating because of sustainability, but there will be a re-rating up and down of people that have talked about it and those who deliver it,” he says.
257  Germany’s new government wants to do two things that seem mutually exclusive — increase investment while sticking to Germany’s strict rules on public debt. Reconciling the two could turn out to be one of the hardest tasks it will face.But Olaf Scholz, the incoming chancellor, is confident he can square the circle. The coalition agreement he unveiled last month contains a smorgasbord of schemes for raising funds without violating the “debt brake” — Germany’s constitutional cap on new borrowing.The opposition has dismissed them as “tricks”, and some legal scholars are warning they could fall foul of Germany’s constitutional court.But others think, taken together, they add up to a reasonable plan of action.“These measures, if fully enacted, will ensure that the coalition has enough money to do everything it needs to do,” said Jens Südekum, professor of international economics at Düsseldorf’s Heinrich Heine University. “If their agenda fails, it won’t be due to a shortage of cash.”The coalition formed after national elections in September brings together three parties, Scholz’s Social Democrats, the Greens and liberals, who are not natural allies.The Greens campaigned on a promise to relax the debt brake and invest €50bn a year over the next 10 years to modernise Germany and make it carbon-neutral. The liberal Free Democrats (FDP) said they would block any attempts to raise taxes or make any changes to the debt brake, introduced in 2009 after the global financial crisis blew a hole in Germany’s public finances.Though their positions seemed irreconcilable before the election, the two managed to come up with plenty of creative solutions to satisfy both sides.One of them envisages turning the KfW, a state-owned development bank, into an “innovation and investment agency”, recapitalising it and using its expanded balance sheet to leverage private investments in green energy and digitisation.“The KfW would be able to, among other things, provide low-price loans to homeowners to insulate their houses or improve their energy efficiency,” said Südekum.The KfW has already granted almost €70bn of state-guaranteed loans to German businesses under a coronavirus support scheme launched at the start of the pandemic. These were excluded from official debt calculations, meaning the scheme could serve as a model for financing other areas of the economy such as digitisation or green energy, said one close Scholz ally.Similarly, the coalition wants to allow state-owned companies such as Deutsche Bahn and BImA — the Institute for Federal Real Estate — to take on debt that could be used for investments. It is already clear that Scholz sees BImA, a government agency which manages 460,000 hectares of state property, as crucial to implementing one of the SPD’s key goals — the construction of 400,000 new flats a year, 100,000 of them subsidised by the state.Another proposal involves tinkering with the rules of the debt brake, and in particular the “cyclical component”, which determines how much leeway the government has to raise debt depending on the state of the economy.Key here is the “output gap” — the difference between GDP and a measure of the economy’s potential: changing the way this is calculated could raise the amount of borrowing permitted under the debt brake. According to one estimate, this could allow the government to raise an additional €10bn a year.Lars Feld of Freiburg university, a former government adviser, has dismissed the proposal as “Pippi Longstocking economics — I make the world as I like”. But the new government clearly thought it important enough to include in its coalition agreement.And the idea could end up reverberating far beyond Germany’s borders. “If Germany really reforms this rule, it’s likely to feed into the debate about reforming the EU’s fiscal rules,” said Philippa Sigl-Glöckner of Dezernat Zukunft, a think-tank, one of the progenitors of the proposal. “The EU uses the same calculation on potential output as Germany does.”All the ideas for getting round the debt brake come at a time when the rule is not being enforced: it was suspended last year to allow the government to increase spending during the coronavirus pandemic and will only come back into force in 2023.One proposal in the coalition deal is for ministers to take advantage of this suspension to go on one last big borrowing binge. The debt raised would be squirrelled away in a “climate and transformation fund” to finance investments. This fund could also receive some of the €240bn in new borrowing that was approved for 2021 but not actually raised.But the suggestion is contentious. “Debts taken on during the pandemic have a specific purpose, which is to deal with the economic consequences of the corona crisis,” said Hanno Kube, professor of public law, public finance and tax law at Heidelberg University.Raising new borrowing and putting it in the climate fund invites “the question of whether there is enough of a connection to the [coronavirus] crisis. And there you enter something of a grey zone”.The coalition deal contains other ideas, too, to raise more funds. The legalisation and taxation of cannabis will help a bit, and ministers also plan to abolish a number of state subsidies, such as those for company cars with diesel engines. The timetable for paying off the huge debts taken on during the pandemic will also be extended, easing pressure on the budget.Also, planned tax revenues are forecast to come in much higher than initially expected — €15bn more a year over the next four years on average — which will give the new government more leeway on spending.But for some, the complex proposals being discussed underscore the absurdity of the debt brake and the need for fundamental reform of an arrangement that has outlived its usefulness.“You really have to ask yourself why we still have this rule if so much effort is going into getting round it,” said Sigl-Glöckner.Additional reporting by Martin Arnold in Frankfurt
258  Investor activism is poised to enter a “golden age” across Europe next year, while low valuations and heightened environmental, social and corporate governance concerns mean that British companies are the most vulnerable targets, according to a new report.In the next 12 months, 148 European companies are at risk of being targeted by activist investors, according to professional services company Alvarez & Marsal. This marks a 10 per cent increase from its last update in April 2021.Britain remains the most attractive country for activists — which buy stakes in a company with the aim of influencing its management — with 36 per cent of the European companies identified as “at risk” based in the UK.“The relative underperformance of UK corporates compared to their European peers is helping to make the UK a target-rich environment for activist investors,” said Malcolm McKenzie, managing director and head of European corporate transformation services at Alvarez & Marsal.Brexit, the pandemic and supply chain disruptions have contributed to widening the gap between the best and worst performing UK companies, which in turns may help activists “identify perceived value opportunities,” he added.The report forecasts that activists will hone in on fewer but larger targets, while a growing focus on environmental and social performance increasingly drives campaigns. The number of attacks motivated by such concerns has more than doubled since 2018. This momentum is set to continue as the UK’s commitment to reach net zero by 2050 has put companies’ environmental and social credentials under more scrutiny.Third Point has built a large stake in Royal Dutch Shell this year and called for the oil supermajor to break itself up. The activist hedge fund argues that Shell’s legacy business could handle fossil fuels, while a separate entity should focus on cleaner energy.Activist investor Bluebell Capital Partners meanwhile last month called on commodities group Glencore to spin off its thermal coal business and “chart a new future” without coal, the world’s most polluting fossil fuel.“The activists are supremely confident now,” said McKenzie, adding that no company is immune. The average market capitalisation of targeted European companies increased from €14.4bn in 2020 to €19.8bn in 2021. Other recent targets include Danone, GlaxoSmithKline and Europe’s biggest supermarket Ahold Delhaize.Healthcare companies continue to be high on the activist hit list, said Alvarez & Marsal, with opportunities to drive improvements in bottom-line profitability and cash generation. Britain’s GlaxoSmithKline has been targeted by US activist Elliott Management, which has called for the pharma group to overhaul its leadership.Private equity groups meanwhile have been snapping up UK companies at a record pace, fuelled by depressed valuations of public companies since Brexit and with buyout groups flush with cash.In Britain, worries about tense UK-EU trade relations and concerns about the withdrawal of monetary stimulus could see recovery “entering a more difficult period” in the next year, Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. She said it is “likely to keep a lid on valuations and see suitors for UK listed companies continue to circle’’.Elsewhere in Europe, Alvarez & Marsal expects Germany to become an increasingly fertile ground for activism, overtaking France as the region’s second biggest activist market. The report benchmarked the performance of 1,651 listed companies in Europe to gauge their vulnerability to activists. According to the researchers, Germany’s weakened financial performance and declining average price-to-earnings ratio relative to European peers are contributing factors.
259  Half a million jobs would be at risk under EU plans to effectively ban combustion-engine cars by 2035, according to European auto suppliers, the latest in a series of stark warnings about the costs of a rapid transition to emissions-free technology.More than two-thirds of those 501,000 roles would disappear in the five years before that date, according to a poll of almost 100 companies for the European Association of Automotive Suppliers, Clepa, making it difficult to mitigate the “social and economic impacts” caused by mass unemployment.But the survey by PwC also found that 226,000 new jobs would be created in the manufacturing of electric parts, reducing the net number of job losses to approximately 275,000 over the next couple of decades.The European Commission announced its intention earlier this year to eliminate 100 per cent of CO2 emissions from new cars by 2035. The policy effectively bans the sale of fossil-fuel powered vehicles after that date.While the commission did not order that these be replaced by battery-powered cars, automakers such as VW, the continent’s largest, have all but ruled out other technologies, such as hydrogen.Clepa, which represents more than 3,000 automotive suppliers, has long argued that the use of interim technologies would cushion the blow of the transition to cleaner transport.“Society’s needs are far too diverse for a one-fits-all approach,” said the organisation’s secretary-general, Sigrid de Vries. “The use of hybrid technologies, green hydrogen and renewable sustainable fuels will enable innovation as we redefine mobility in the coming decades.”Carlos Tavares, chief executive of Stellantis, told a Reuters conference on Wednesday that the speed of the transition to electric cars was “putting the industry on the limits”, adding that the costs of developing the new technology could lead to heavy job losses.His warning followed a similar claim from Germany’s largest listed car parts supplier, Continental, which cautioned that “social harmony would be jeopardised” if climate policies were not accompanied by programmes to create new employment opportunities for those working in fossil fuel-reliant industries.“We can transform, but we cannot have any discontinuity,” said Ariane Reinhart, a board member for human relations and Sustainability at the Hanover-based company. “Creating the necessary conditions for climate protection means not only accelerating the transformation, but also preventing large-scale unemployment,” she added.Last year, a government-sanctioned report warned that approximately 400,000 jobs could be lost in Germany due to the shift away from combustion engines.But Volkswagen chief executive Herbert Diess said such apocalyptic scenarios had “probably been a bit overstated”. “A lot of the car remains the same,” he added. “It’s still seats, paint, body work, interiors, wheels, axles.“For some, if you work in fuel injection systems or gearboxes, it’s probably a bigger transition. I would say for 70 to 80 per cent of the automotive supply industry, there is no transition”
260  The UK government is to begin trials next year of a “smart” customs border involving cutting-edge technologies that it hopes will reduce trade frictions for British importers.UK companies will this week be asked to submit bids to pilot the new system, with the aim of starting trials at a port in May, according to senior officials in Whitehall.The announcement of the plans, described as building a “Rolls-Royce system for moving goods”, comes as the government prepares to begin implementing full customs checks on EU imports from January.Last week the Federation of Small Businesses, a trade body, warned that only a quarter of companies were ready to handle the new paperwork, including real-time customs declarations and pre-notification to UK authorities of imports of animal and plant products.To smooth the post-Brexit border, the UK has committed to spending £180m to build a “single trade window” system by 2025, which will streamline customs processes by enabling UK border agencies, including HM Revenue & Customs and health authorities, to share information in real time.Among the ideas that are expected to be tested in the mid-2022 trials are shipping container seals that automatically alert the authorities when tampered with, and the geo-tracking of goods using GPS technology to catch any lorry making unscheduled stops or diversions.Officials said that in time, such technologies should help create highly auditable supply chains that can be easily monitored, allowing businesses to do more self-assessment than currently possible away from the border.They added the government hoped it would avoid the pitfalls of previous state-run IT projects by going direct to UK businesses and the technology industry. “We want big and bold solutions,” said one official.The venue for the six month-long trials is still to be determined, but will be a “live port environment” at which the port, technology providers and import-export businesses could demonstrate the effectiveness of the system.Ministers are expected to claim the new border as a benefit of Brexit, since the UK is no longer bound by EU rules. Last October, Lord David Frost, the UK Brexit minister, said Britain was “never going to adopt the same levels of checks” as the EU.However, the EU is also in the process of devising a “single customs window” that could in the future reduce some of the burdens on UK exporters to the bloc.Experts welcomed the UK’s plans to use technologies to reduce burdens at the border, which HMRC estimated in 2019 would require nearly 200m extra customs declarations at a cost of £7.5bn a year to British businesses.Sam Lowe, of Flint Global, a consultancy, said UK dependency on high-speed, “roll-on, roll-off” trade with the EU was likely to incentivise Britain to digitise its border even faster than the bloc.“In the next 10 years the UK will probably have one of the most efficient borders in the world out of sheer necessity, which you could say is a ‘Brexit dividend’ of sorts,” he added.William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, a business lobby group, said there could be benefits for trade facilitation if the trials proved successful, but the government should prioritise improving the EU-UK trade deal.“These trials should notbe seen as an alternative to deeper customs co-operation between the UK and EU,” he added. “Further agreements are what is truly vital if we are to smooth the navigation of the GB-EU customs border for traders.”David Henig, a former UK trade negotiator, said any aspiration to streamline trade was welcome but he cautioned that the government’s record on delivery of such projects had “not been great” in recent years.He added even if bureaucracy was reduced on goods entering the UK from mainland Europe it would still be “far greater than seamless trade the UK enjoyed as a member of the EU’s single market”.
261  A melee broke out at the first campaign rally held by Eric Zemmour, the anti-immigration polemicist who is running for French president, after activists from an anti-racism organisation sought to interrupt his speech.Soon after Zemmour began speaking to a crowd of more than 10,000 at a conference hall outside Paris, activists from SOS Racisme stood up to reveal black shirts spelling out the slogan “No to Racism”. They were set upon by Zemmour supporters, and video taken by journalists showed men punching the activists and chairs being thrown, while security officials tried to break up the fight.The episode ended quickly but showed how Zemmour’s far-right candidacy has provoked tensions in France as the television pundit and author has risen in the polls since summer. While his supporters waved French flags in a northern suburb of the capital, roughly 8,000 others took to the streets of Paris to denounce his xenophobic platform. Police said they had made 48 arrests.The 63-year-old, who argues that France is declining because of unchecked immigration and an excess of political correctness, had risen as high as second in the polls in early November. But his popularity has waned recently to fall back to third place behind President Emmanuel Macron and far-right politician Marine Le Pen, according to pollster Harris Interactive.Zemmour sought to get back on the front foot on Sunday with a combative, hour-long speech that laid out his policies to curb immigration and boost the economy with lower taxes, while hitting culture war issues such as banning affirmative action and so-called inclusive writing.“If I win that election, it won’t be one more political changeover but the beginning of the reconquest of the most beautiful country in the world,” he told the cheering crowd as he stood in front of a sign emblazoned with the name of his new political party, Reconquest.Zemmour has been compared to former US president Donald Trump because of his rabble-rousing populism and ambition to jump from TV fame as a pundit to national politics. His critics decry what they call his racist and misogynist views espoused in his best-selling books, and point to his two legal convictions for hate speech.“I’m not racist, and neither are you,” Zemmour told his supporters. “We are defending our country, our homeland, our ancestral heritage.[and want to] transmit to our children France as we have always known it.“In the first weeks of my administration, immigration zero will become the clear objective.” Zemmour’s rally came a day after France’s conservative Les Républicains party picked its candidate, the veteran politician Valérie Pécresse, which means the field of candidates is largely set. Macron is expected to announce his re-election bid early next year. The first round of voting will be on April 10.Additional reporting by Sarah White
262  EU and Nato allies have swung behind the Biden administration’s assessment that Russia may be poised to invade Ukraine following unprecedented sharing of US intelligence on Moscow’s military preparations.Weeks of sustained US diplomatic engagement with European governments, backed by a sharing of intelligence normally reserved for its closest allies, have helped convince some previously sceptical capitals, including Berlin, that the Kremlin could soon order its troops into Ukraine. The effort has galvanised support for the need for robust sanctions threats to deter the Kremlin.Joe Biden will warn Vladimir Putin against any invasion in a planned video summit on Tuesday, with the full backing of Nato and the EU for retaliatory measures, European defence and security officials told the Financial Times.Russia could be planning to invade Ukraine “as soon as early 2022”, a Biden administration official said on Friday, adding that half the military units that would be involved in such an offensive had arrived near Ukraine’s border over the past month.The US decision to share its intelligence among European states and issue public warnings stems from Washington’s hope that by cementing western support for sanctions, it would underline to Moscow the costs of any aggression. The details of threatened sanctions and other countermeasures are still under discussion.The Kremlin has consistently denied that it plans to invade Ukraine and has blamed increasing tension on US and Nato support for Kyiv.US intelligence reports depicting Russian military deployments along the border, evidence of possible attack preparations and analysis of the Kremlin’s perceived intentions were shared bilaterally and collectively with Nato members and through EU diplomatic channels, officials briefed on the documents told the FT.The quantity of material and detail shared among the other 29 Nato allies was described by one official as “extremely comprehensive”.The uncharacteristic level of intelligence-sharing was prompted by initial reluctance from some European allies to treat US claims of Russian preparations for an invasion as credible, four of the officials said.The disclosure of previously secret details began in early November ahead of a meeting of Nato ministers last week, which was subsequently dominated by discussions about Ukraine. The intelligence helped shift the conversation from whether the warning was correct to how to best deter it.“Many allies were not convinced that serious things were happening,” said a second official. “We were surprised about this [intelligence] gap — how and why the US were seeing things that we were not seeing.”“If I have to compare soundbites from before this info and then [at the Nato meeting] in Riga, there was a big shift towards the US version of things,” the official added.Biden said on Friday that he was preparing a “comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives” to deter Russian aggression.“We’ve been aware of Russia’s actions for a long time and my expectation is we’re going to have a long discussion,” he said of the upcoming call with Putin.The US said Russia had made preparations to deploy 100 battalion tactical groups totalling an estimated 175,000 military personnel at strategic locations along the Ukrainian border, backed by 100,000 reservist troops.Russian troops invaded Georgia in 2008, and invaded and annexed Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula in 2014. The Kremlin has supported pro-Moscow separatists that have fought a seven-year war against Ukrainian government forces in Donbas, a border region with Russia.In April, Russia rapidly and without warning moved 100,000 troops from other parts of the country to its border region with Ukraine alongside tanks, aircraft, naval forces, field hospitals and electronic warfare equipment, spooking Kyiv and western capitals. Some of those troops were eventually returned to their bases.Some EU states and Nato members that have called for dialogue with Moscow rather than confrontation have cited that de-escalation as evidence that Russia would not embark on a full invasion unless provoked. But the US intelligence on the recent troop deployments has shifted that analysis.The US and the EU have “the same coherent message.to show the price Putin will pay” for any action against Ukraine, a third European official said. “Some European states who were not reading the moves from Putin [in the same way that the US was] in terms of intentions, now are.”
263  Faced with two far-right rivals eating into her electorate, Valérie Pécresse, the newly appointed candidate hoping to lead France’s conservative Les Républicains to a presidential victory next year, has her work cut out even to scrape a place in the second-round run-off vote.But Pécresse’s triumph in a party primary on Saturday — confounding predictions about the favourites, which included the EU’s former chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier — could change the course of the campaign and potentially dent Emmanuel Macron’s chances of an easy re-election in April.A former minister for higher education and for the budget under Nicolas Sarkozy, and since 2015 head of the Île-de-France region that includes Paris, Pécresse has years of government experience. Analysts say her policies — tough on law and order and strong on fiscal discipline — could strike a chord with some of the more moderate conservative voters who flocked to Macron’s centrist, reformist platform in 2017.Her nomination, following a five-way race that included some heavyweights, has also gone some way towards rehabilitating the LR as a political force. The movement — descended from the traditional rightwing in France incarnated by former presidents Charles de Gaulle and Jacques Chirac — imploded at the last election when an embezzlement scandal derailed François Fillon’s campaign. It has since been plagued by internal rifts as supporters drifted away to the far right.The long process of choosing Pécresse showed that a party that had been having a triple crisis — ideological, financial and over leadership — could organise itself by finding a “very legitimate” candidate supported by the losers in the primary, said Vincent Martigny, politics professor at Nice university.The LR had never chosen a female candidate before, and could benefit from the more modern image provided by the selection of Pécresse, Martigny added.The gap Pécresse has to close to catch up with other presidential candidates, even if she can keep a lid on party dissent, is still large, however.The sudden rise in opinion polls of Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration polemicist who has sparked comparisons to Donald Trump, had proved the main upset until now, potentially ripping up the long-predicted scenario of a rematch between Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right Rassemblement National party, and Macron.Both Zemmour and Le Pen have a chance of qualifying for the second-round run-off against Macron, recent polls have shown, whereas Pécresse has until now been limping along with support of about 11 per cent in the first-round vote, less than half of Macron’s forecast score.One of Pécresse’s chief lines of attack will be to contrast her plainly rightwing views with Macron’s “neither right nor left” centrism. Pécresse has described Macron as “chameleonic”. Before cheering supporters on Saturday she labelled him a “zigzag” president who blows with the wind.“I won’t compromise with the truth or avoid difficult questions. I won’t necessarily tell the French what they want to hear,” Pécresse told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper in an interview.Pécresse is considered a moderate within the LR movement and is notable for putting climate change and the environment at the heart of her campaign. Still, with Le Pen and Zemmour pushing the nation’s political agenda sharply to the right she has taken to decrying “uncontrolled migration” as something she would tackle with tougher rules for asylum seekers and quotas for immigration.Pécresse is also a fiscal conservative, pledging to rein in public spending and cut 200,000 administrative jobs. She has stepped up attacks on Macron for “burning through cash”, especially during the coronavirus pandemic, when — like other wealthy economies — France stumped up billions of euros to help struggling businesses and employees, and the health service.“That will resonate with rightwing voters, who even if they thought Macron had done a good job on the economy, will have a classical reflex which is to think ‘this is all going to end up with higher taxes one day’,” said Bruno Cautrès, a professor at Sciences Po in Paris, adding that Pécresse’s nomination was “not very good news” for Macron.Macron came to power on a pro-business agenda and launched reforms, including a liberalisation of the labour market, early in his mandate, but he was also hit by large anti-government protests, in part over high living costs.In her own political movement, Pécresse’s main challenge will be to deal with the rightwingers whose policies on immigration and law and order are close to those of Zemmour and Le Pen. She defeated the most rightwing of the LR contenders in the primary, Éric Ciotti, but he came top in the first round and still captured 39 per cent of the votes in the final. Ciotti has said he would vote for Zemmour in the event of an election run-off between Zemmour and Macron.Zemmour and Le Pen have both pounced already. Zemmour called on LR members upset at Pécresse’s victory to join his first big election rally on the outskirts of Paris on Sunday.“I share the disappointment of Éric and his followers,” Zemmour wrote in an open letter. “We are so close and we have so much in common!” Le Pen made a similar appeal, while condemning Pécresse as a “Macronist”. In a gesture towards Ciotti — who said he would back the new LR candidate but immediately warned her that the presidency “will be won on the right” — Pécresse said she would kick off her presidential campaign in the southern village of Saint-Martin-Vésubie, where he is an elected official.She has at the same time taken a stand against the gloomy declinism of Le Pen and Zemmour, dismissing them in her acceptance speech on Saturday as divisive “merchants of fear” and declaring: “The republican right is back.”
264  UK prime minister Boris Johnson has ordered his team to de-escalate tensions with French president Emmanuel Macron, telling colleagues not to retaliate against what London regards as recent provocation from Paris.Johnson is convinced that Macron is going to win a second term, according to allies, and wants to prepare the ground for better relations after next April’s presidential elections, possibly via a new Anglo-French treaty.With Macron reportedly labelling Johnson a “clown” — amid a bitter row over how to respond to the deaths of 27 migrants who last month tried to reach the UK by crossing the English Channel in a small boat — the idea of any post-election “entente cordiale” seems far-fetched to some diplomats.Johnson is regarded by Macron as not “serious” and the prime minister has antagonised Paris on a range of issues beyond migrants, including Brexit and a new security partnership between Australia, the US and the UK that will enable Canberra to build a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines.Downing Street now wants to draw a line under the cross-Channel war of words. “There have been a whole series of comments that we have just let go,” said one ally of Johnson. “There has been a lot of sucking of teeth.”Number 10 did not hit back at Macron’s reported comments to colleagues, outlined by French satirical newspaper Le Canard enchaîné, that Johnson was behaving “like an idiot” and that it was sad Britain was being “led by a clown”.There was then only a modest plea by Number 10 for people to choose their words “carefully” after Macron said the handling of post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland were a matter of “war and peace for Ireland”.Nor was there a robust British response to claims last week by Clément Beaune, France’s Europe minister, that migrants were attracted to the UK by an economic model featuring “quasi modern slavery”.Some diplomats, however, believe Johnson has left it too late to smooth tensions and is deluded in thinking that Macron’s attacks are down to electioneering — they think the French president is simply fed up with a prime minister who he regards as unreliable and trivial.While Macron’s comments have attracted headlines in the UK, they have generated little interest in France. Aside from a row over the UK’s allocation of licences to France’s fishermen operating in British waters, French media are much more focused on Covid-19, immigration and relations with Germany.Sir Peter Westmacott, Britain’s former ambassador to Paris, said: “I don’t think the French are nearly as obsessed about what goes on in Britain as we are about what’s happening in France. I don’t think it wins Macron votes.”Downing Street insiders do not buy that argument. Johnson and his team expect relations to remain rocky for the next few months but think that the expected re-election of Macron could offer the chance of a fresh start.There have been signs in recent days of some cooling of tensions: a recognition that the two countries are condemned by geography, economics and security considerations to work together.The allocation of 40 fishing licences by Guernsey, a British crown dependency, to French boats was a sign of the dispute starting to ease, although it is not over.The threat by France to carry out “reinforced” checks on British goods crossing the Channel in retaliation over the dispute was a reminder of how Paris could swiftly choke Britain’s trade routes if it wished.Meanwhile, Jean Castex, France’s prime minister, wrote to Johnson last week suggesting a “possible new framework for co-operation between the UK and EU” to tackle the small boats migration crisis in the Channel.But the fact that it was Castex who contacted Johnson, rather than Macron, is an indication of the toxic state of relations between the two leaders.Johnson’s allies have floated the idea that once the presidential elections are over, there could be scope for improved relations, possibly through a new treaty between the two sides.British officials said a treaty might focus on defence and security co-operation — building on one part of the UK-France relationship that is functioning well — but also cover science, technology and culture.Defence options being examined on the UK side include joint aircraft carrier operations, nuclear co-operation and the possibility of Britain and France working more closely in the Indo-Pacific with the “quad”: Australia, India, Japan and the US.But Lord Peter Ricketts, another former British ambassador to France, said: “There’s such a big gap between the idea of a new treaty and the way the two governments are treating each other, it can’t happen at the moment.”In Paris, the Macron administration suspects the idea of a new treaty is another attempt by Johnson to appear reasonable in public while persisting with difficult behaviour on the ground, according to French officials.For Macron’s team, a much more important issue is whether the UK can prove itself once more to be the reliable partner France wants in the aftermath of Brexit.Tensions over Johnson’s attempts to rewrite parts of his Brexit deal in relation to Northern Ireland could resurface early next year if the prime minister seeks to suspend the trading arrangements for the region.Diplomats question whether — even if Macron is reinstalled in the Elysée Palace in April — any new entente cordiale can be reached given the president’s deep distrust of Johnson.
265  Better late than never, and better something than nothing. That would be a justified, if curmudgeonly, reaction to the Global Gateway, the infrastructure investment plan the EU launched last Wednesday with the unspoken but evident intention to counter China’s Belt and Road Initiative.The plan fulfils a promise Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, made in her September State of the Union address. Her rationale was that “it does not make sense for Europe to build a perfect road between a Chinese-owned copper mine and a Chinese-owned harbour. We have to get smarter when it comes to these kinds of investments.”Back then I suggested that we should judge the initiative on three things. Was it going to be big enough to rival BRI? Would it limit itself to supporting infrastructure “hardware” or also seek to share the EU’s institutional “software”, the rules and regulations that boost economic integration? Third, the lighter but not unimportant matter of a more inspiring name. (The Marco Polo project? The Magellan network?)The name stuck. What about the other two tests?In terms of size, Brussels promises €300bn over seven years. Cynics have called out the financial engineering behind that number, which includes funding “mobilised” from private investors by the EU’s own much smaller stake. The objection is fair, but unimportant if €300bn worth of infrastructure does in fact get built. The problem is not the source but the amount of finance.That sum would have been a game-changing commitment in the mid-2000s. It would have been adequate as late as 2013, when Chinese president Xi Jinping first announced “the project of the century”. Today, it looks underweight against a BRI funded by more than $100bn yearly before the pandemic.While it is not fully up to the task, €300bn nevertheless buys you a lot if the whole amount materialises. And each euro will pack a greater punch because the EU is indeed adding its software to its hardware.The new plans are explicit about this. Infrastructure projects will be designed “to reinforce convergence” with the EU’s data privacy and digital competition rules, and with European standards in transport.This is as it should be. The EU has no choice but to try to mould its external economic relations in its own image if it wants to outmuscle BRI. And this is what is at stake, though European leaders rarely put it this way.The mantra in Brussels is “links, not dependencies”. That’s understandable: dependencies are precisely what BRI projects have created in the form of indebtedness or data capture, as Britain’s new spy chief highlights. Indeed the point of Global Gateway is to give countries a “nice” alternative to those traps.But this is misleading. The EU wants — and should want — to create dependencies. Regulatory convergence does that, as would Global Gateway’s stated aim to “strengthen digital, transport and energy networks”, and offer “supply chain integration”. That is, after all, why Beijing pursues similar aims: to make all economic relationships bend towards China and adapt to its norms.The EU’s doctrine must be that not all dependencies are equal, and that tying yourself to Europe gives you a better shot at both freedom and prosperity than throwing your lot in with BRI.As well as the necessary financial heft, two additional things required to make such a doctrine realistic are missing. One is an explicit vision of how the bits fit together. For now Global Gateway looks like a list of unrelated building sites. But what is the shape of the network these projects are intended to constitute — if there is such an intention at all?If the goal is to build a deeply EU-centric international economy, then saying so would be more honest and make the initiative better co-ordinated.That would be a good goal. But the other missing piece is a proper articulation of partner countries’ role in such EU-centric networks — a formal model for countries to link into the EU’s market physically, legally, and institutionally. An offer of a deeper tie-in than trade deals provide, yet less comprehensive than full single market membership, would be attractive enough for many countries to turn down infrastructure subsidies from Beijing.Economic gravity is like the physical kind. For small bodies, it determines their possible orbits. For big ones, it’s the force with which it attracts others. Europe, a large bloc of small and middling countries, is still learning what economic size means.
266  Last autumn, in the early months of the Covid pandemic, the flash new Berlin Brandenburg Airport opened its doors — 10 years late and at an overall cost of at least €7bn, two and a half times the original budget.Widely seen as a national embarrassment, the state-run 30-year airport project is not an isolated case in Germany’s transport infrastructure record. Construction of Stuttgart’s new railway station, now the subject of fraud allegations, has cost €8.2bn, up from an initial €2.5bn.For the FDP, the “amber” member of Germany’s incoming traffic light coalition government, such examples highlight the shortcomings of entrusting large-scale infrastructure projects to public sector managers and budgets.As the administration prepares to take office this week, the 176-page coalition agreement that underpins it bears the clear influence of the FDP, particularly in the section on “future investments and sustainable financing”.Tempering the spending instincts of the dominant SPD and the Greens, there is insistence that the country’s “debt brake”, which limits Germany’s structural deficit, be maintained, even as the coalition promises “a decade of investment”. The plan includes “unprecedented additional spending” thanks in part to a pledge to “activate more private capital for transformational projects”.Specialist infrastructure operators, the country’s cash-rich insurers and the capital markets, re-energised by a hoped-for EU-wide Capital Markets Union, will all be essential providers of that private capital, according to senior officials.One key paragraph, inserted at the insistence of the FDP, advocates the expansion of public-private partnerships, a key plank of UK infrastructure renewal since the 1990s — though less so recently. Data from Britain’s National Audit Office show volumes peaked in 2007 at £8.6bn, when more than 60 deals were struck, dwindling to virtually nothing in recent years.German enthusiasm for PPP has shown a similar pattern of decline, although the numbers are much smaller — at the 2007 peak, 38 deals worth a combined €1.5bn were done, according to Partnerschaft Deutschland, an advisory group. In 2019, the last year for which data are available, only three deals were done, worth just €66m.Those patterns reflect a mixed verdict on the effectiveness of PPP. The UK NAO has been critical of the value for money achieved on an array of projects since the 1990s. German advocates, such as the BDI employers federation, point to benefits: a world-leading swiftly-upgraded Autobahn network would not have been possible without private sector partnership. The price paid — by drivers via toll roads — divides popular opinion.The new coalition agreement is clear that private sector money should be used to support a wide variety of investment priorities — environmental protection, digitalisation, education, research and infrastructure.The tension, by design, is between a government that wants to minimise cost and a private sector that is keen to maximise returns. That is not acknowledged in the coalition agreement, though some figures in the new administration are clearly sceptical of private sector money, especially given the ultra-low interest rates on German government debt. “When we can raise funds at zero, why should we pay money to the private sector?” asks one.Officials’ view of private money as relatively expensive debt finance is wrong-headed, says one top insurance executive: for one thing, private sector money should bring with it operating expertise; for another, cash is best employed not as debt but as equity, protected by a state-backed first-loss buffer, to help control the kind of cost overruns that scuppered the Berlin airport budget.With or without PPP, the new government has other strategies to escape the restrictions of the debt brake. KFW, the existing development bank, for example, looks set to be recapitalised — a process that should not add to government debt. The bank then could help finance large transformational projects. The agreement suggests a similar approach to supercharging the financing wherewithal of the state-owned Deutsche Bahn and state property agency Bima.As Olaf Scholz, the incoming SPD chancellor, thrashes out the right balance to strike with his new FDP finance minister Christian Lindner, they should perhaps look skywards. Even in Covid times, enough aircraft are flying overhead towards Brandenburg Airport to provide a regular reminder of how not to do it.
267  For years, Turkish opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu suffered ridicule for his mild-mannered demeanour and failure to make inroads at election after election. Lately, though, the head of the Republican People’s party (CHP) has discovered a taste for boldness.On Friday, he turned up uninvited at the country’s statistical agency and accused it of manipulating inflation data under the orders of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s president. Standing outside its locked gates after being refused a meeting, he starkly warned the country’s civil servants to “do the right thing”.With the country gripped by economic turmoil, a plunging currency and double-digit inflation, Kilicdaroglu has been buoyed by polls showing that the combined votes of the opposition alliance that he helped to build are higher than those of Erdogan and his allies. The loose coalition is convinced that it could topple the president in a national vote scheduled for 2023, but which could be called earlier.“We have.a government that has seriously lost its capacity to govern,” Kilicdaroglu, a 72-year-old former bureaucrat who has led the CHP for more than a decade, told the Financial Times. “A large segment of society has embraced the idea that these people are on their way out.”Kilicdaroglu is not an obvious leader of the opposition’s improbable alliance of nationalists, Kurds, leftists, rightwingers, secularists and religious conservatives.The CHP that he leads was established by the country’s founding father Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and has long been seen as a standard bearer for secularism, bringing it into conflict with Turkey’s conservatives. Describing itself as social democrat, the CHP also has a strong nationalist vein that has alienated the country’s millions of Kurds.But after years of failing to dent the popularity of Erdogan, whose Justice and Development party (AKP) has ruled for almost two decades, Kilicdaroglu has emerged as the architect of the unlikely grouping now challenging Erdogan’s grip on power.The coalition began in 2017 when rival parties buried their differences to campaign together for a “no” vote in that year’s referendum on abolishing the country’s parliamentary system and consolidating the president’s control.Their side narrowly lost, but the campaign laid the ground for further collaboration. This bore fruit two years later when the opposition’s unity candidates won mayoral elections in Istanbul and Ankara, ending 25 years of dominance by Erdogan and his allies over Turkey’s two biggest cities. Since then, Kilicdaroglu has carved out a role as a go-between with six other parties.The president has attempted to break the alliance by exploiting its ideological faultlines. But the grouping has so far hung together by uniting behind a call for Turkey to return to a parliamentary system and by focusing on the state of the economy.Inflation that has risen above 20 per cent, combined with the collapse in the Turkish lira, which has lost nearly half of its value against the dollar this year, have contributed to an erosion of the AKP’s popularity. The party’s vote share now hovers somewhere above 30 per cent, according to polling — down from a peak of almost 50 per cent in the 2011 elections.“There’s huge unemployment, life is expensive, people cannot make ends meet,” said Kilicdaroglu, who has repeatedly called for early elections so that the public can issue their verdict on Erdogan’s economic management. “People are looking for a way out. Naturally, the way out is through politics.”Analysts warn that the increasingly authoritarian Erdogan might not go quietly if he lost the vote. They point to the Istanbul mayoral contest in 2019, when the president cited fraud and cancelled the results after opposition challenger Ekrem Imamoglu won.Kilicdaroglu waves away such concerns. Pointing to the public backlash against Erdogan’s decision to rerun the Istanbul contest, which resulted in an opposition landslide in the second vote, he said the president would have to leave power peacefully if defeated. “Istanbul was a trial run,” he said. “He will not want to leave power, but we will get him out.” Erdogan’s supporters also had nothing to fear from an opposition victory, he said: “We will not run the country with malice, anger and revenge.”Conscious of the CHP’s troubled reputation among conservatives, Kilicdaroglu last month made a plea for forgiveness for the party’s past mistakes, such as its opposition to women wearing the headscarf.Despite such overtures, a recent survey by the Turkish pollster Metropoll found that almost 70 per cent of AKP voters, many of them devout Muslims, were fearful of the prospect of a government comprised of the CHP and its allies from the rightwing nationalist IYI party.Some of the CHP’s key policies are also contentious internationally, including a pledge to reconcile with Bashar al-Assad, Syria’s president, and return Turkey’s 3.6m Syrian refugees.The opposition could also trip itself up, analysts warn. Some within the CHP worry that Kilicdaroglu will suggest himself as the best candidate to challenge Erdogan for the presidency, despite polling showing that he would be less popular than Imamoglu or Mansur Yavas, Ankara’s mayor.Kilicdaroglu refuses to rule out the prospect of a presidential run. But for now, he said, the opposition should focus on the country’s economic problems. “There’s a fire in the kitchen,” he said. “Everyone is desperately looking for an escape route.”
268  When Alexander Lukashenko visited a group of migrants stranded on Belarus’s border with Poland after their attempts to cross illegally were blocked by Polish forces, he urged them to keep trying.“If you want to go west, we won’t choke you, grab and beat you. It is your choice. Go across!” Belarus’s autocratic leader told the group, who had gathered outside a warehouse near Bruzgi — their temporary shelter as eastern Europe’s icy winter sets in.“Go! That’s the whole philosophy. I know that what I said will not please everyone, especially abroad, but it is true, they should know the truth,” Lukashenko said in a visit on November 26 that was filmed and televised.Lukashenko’s very public orchestration of a humanitarian crisis — European officials have accused his regime of simplifying entry for Middle Eastern migrants into Belarus and then directing them towards the border — is perhaps the most blatant recent example of coercive diplomacy using displaced people as a weapon.Increasingly, that weapon is being aimed at the EU as a way of exploiting its deep political divisions and public fears over uncontrolled immigration. The phenomenon is driving a further hardening of attitudes within the union towards migration and asylum seekers, as member states seek new ways of strengthening their borders and deterring displaced people from heading to the EU. The goal, according to Marcin Przydacz, Poland’s deputy foreign minister, is “to check the resilience of our countries” by “shaking the emotions of public opinion”.Governments are grappling for ways to respond to weaponised migration alongside other coercive tools aimed at social and political destabilisation, such as cyber attacks and disinformation, which have been refined into a sophisticated military doctrine of “hybrid war” by Moscow and copied by others.“The classic distinction between war and peace has been diminishing,” Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said last month as he unveiled the EU’s new “strategic compass” or foreign policy strategy. “It is not black and white. The world is full of hybrid situations where we face intermediate dynamics of competition, intimidation and coercion. And what we are seeing today at the border of Poland and Belarus is a typical example of that.”Europe is hardly the only region where immigration is a sensitive issue. But the EU has a unique set of features that its adversaries such as Lukashenko can exploit.National governments are primarily responsible for external border control but there is borderless travel inside much of the bloc, no system for managing internal flows and no functioning mechanism for sharing responsibility for asylum seekers.Some member states are much more exposed than others, either as entry points or as preferred destinations. And there are divisions among countries and, moreover, within them, that make the issue politically radioactive for leaders.“Belarus picked on something it identified as our fragility,” says Natalie Tocci, director of the Institute for International Affairs in Rome and a visiting professor at Harvard. “It was absolutely right.”Margaritis Schinas, European Commission vice-president, argues the Belarus episode marked a shift in the political weather across the union by highlighting the extent to which the entire bloc is exposed to migration issues. This, he argues, may foster a greater sense of solidarity.There were previously doubts in parts of the union as to whether migration was really a common problem, he said. “Now the attack by Belarus has galvanised European public opinion and contributed significantly to a convergence of views that we will never be able to cope externally unless we can cope internally.”Use of migrant flows as a tool of aggression or intimidation is neither new nor rare. Kelly Greenhill, a US academic and author of the book Weapons of Mass Migration, has documented at least 76 instances since the 1950s and concedes there are probably many more.Some are vast in scale. A crackdown by the Pakistani military in 1971 sent 10m Bengali refugees into India in part to pressure New Delhi into ceasing its support for the Bengali rebel movement. Fidel Castro permitted and then encouraged 125,000 Cubans to flee to the US in the Mariel boatlift of 1980, partly to extract political concessions from US president Jimmy Carter, who had initially welcomed the influx before it turned into a tide.Some coercers have been explicit about their motives. Attempting to play on racial tensions within Europe, Libyan leader Muammer Gaddafi in 2010 demanded €5bn a year to stop illegal African migration. “Tomorrow Europe might no longer be European, and even black, as there are millions who want to come in,” he said.Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly threatened to flood the EU with some of the 4m refugees living in his country. Last year officials bussed thousands of them to Turkey’s land border with Greece, leading to tense clashes with Greek border guards.Erdogan complained that Turkey was overburdened and that the EU was not doing its part. Turkey struck a deal with the EU in 2016 to staunch the flow of mostly Syrian refugees into Europe in return for €6bn in aid and an EU promise, so far largely unfulfilled, to admit more recognised asylum-seekers.“After we opened the doors, there were multiple calls saying ‘close the doors’,” Erdogan said at the time. “I told them, ‘it’s done. It’s finished. The doors are now open. Now, you [Europe] will have to take your share of the burden’.”Other states have used the same intimidatory techniques with far narrower objectives. In May, Moroccan authorities encouraged thousands of migrants, including many of its own citizens, to swim round a border fence and enter the Spanish North African territory of Ceuta. Some were duped into thinking that the footballer Cristiano Ronaldo was playing a match in the enclave.The stage-managed invasion was an act of protest and of pressure. Rabat was furious that Spain had allowed in Brahim Ghali for emergency medical treatment. Ghali is a leader of the independence movement for Western Sahara, over which Morocco claims sovereignty.For months Rabat had been pushing Madrid to follow the Trump administration’s recognition of Morocco’s sovereignty claim. It had allowed the number of migrants arriving from its waters to Spain’s Canary Islands to rocket, says a Spanish official: “They couldn’t force Spain to change its mind, so they used this very hybrid form of war to pressure the country.”Madrid refused to bow to Moroccan pressure although Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez subsequently replaced his foreign minister.To the north, the short 13km span of the Strait of Gibraltar between Africa and Spain stands as a symbol of Europe’s vulnerability to weaponised migration. Geography leaves Europe exposed to turmoil in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, as well as to the effects of huge discrepancies of wealth and opportunity between relatively short distances.“What makes Europe susceptible is that we are surrounded by neighbours who are in trouble,” says the Spanish official. “And the neighbours of our neighbours are in even greater trouble.”Geography is only one reason for the EU’s susceptibility. Its adversaries are using the EU’s political foundations against it, says Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations and author of The Age of Unpeace, a book about how interdependence between countries creates conflict.The EU was built on multilateralism and free and open markets and then it tried to extend the model to the rest of the world through global institutions and trade agreements.“For Europeans this was a kind of ideology as well as an opportunity,” Leonard says. “We found ourselves much more bound into the world so we are much more vulnerable.”Those who seek to weaponise migration meanwhile understand that the EU is still grappling with the destabilising effects of the 2015-16 crisis, when around 1.5m asylum seekers and refugees poured into Europe.Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision to welcome Syrian refugees to Germany will be remembered by many as a noble humanitarian gesture. But other leaders were horrified by a unilateral decision that sowed divisions among EU member states, exacerbated east-west tensions and fuelled anti-establishment Eurosceptic forces.It may have tipped the balance in favour of Brexit. It also created a civil war inside Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union from which it is still struggling to recover.“This cannot happen again. This is on the mind of everybody,” says Camino Mortera-Martinez of the Centre for European Reform in Brussels.The episode has left Europeans deeply divided about how much immigration is needed and how much is tolerable without harming social cohesion or national identity.One legacy of the 2015-16 crisis has been the EU’s inability to put in place a vital missing component of its putative migration “pact”: a relocation scheme allowing member states to apportion asylum seekers and/or the financial burden. Similarly absent is a more level-headed debate about integrating refugees and using them to plug labour market shortages.Schinas says the best way of addressing Europe’s exposure to hybrid attacks is by moving towards agreement on the pact. He adds that the EU needs to create a better-connected “circuit” of measures, including relocations of asylum seekers, financial support and the use of its Frontex border force.“In the EU there is not a shred of doubt that migration is a common European problem and member states are pooling sovereignty, resources and more and more political will to get it sorted out as a European problem together. This will happen,” he says.Some EU diplomats are less convinced. Member states remain deadlocked over ways of bolstering solidarity and finding ways of distributing asylum seekers entering the EU via its frontier states. Some central and eastern European countries, including Poland and Hungary, have been notably resistant to the plan. Mortera-Martinez says forcing people on to certain EU countries “is not going to happen”.Amid the debate about managing migration internally, the EU has invested in beefing up its external controls, in what critics decry as a “Fortress Europe” policy.It has outsourced the policing of migrant flows to regimes far less concerned about human rights standards, controversially providing financial support for the militia-backed Libyan coast guard as it seeks to reduce Mediterranean crossings. EU overseas aid is increasingly tied to border security.The stand-off with Belarus is meanwhile hardening approaches towards asylum in the EU, analysts say. Poland, Lithuania and Latvia have all used laws or temporary decrees to curb the right to asylum as thousands of individuals sought to enter the countries from Belarus. The EU Commission on Wednesday approved rules permitting temporary suspensions of some asylum protections.Countries including Greece have also been accused of pushing back asylum seekers, which is against international law. In early October, member states including Greece, Cyprus, Poland and Austria called in a letter to the commission for a toughening in the Schengen code, demanding that EU external borders be protected with a “maximum level of security”, including the use of EU-funded physical infrastructure. Ursula von der Leyen, commission president, has ruled out deploying EU money to pay for fences and walls.Hanne Beirens, director of the Migration Policy Institute Europe think-tank, says the rethink on migration was “part of a wider effort by the EU to make itself less vulnerable to actions by third countries and to strike a tougher posture in broader geopolitical struggles”.“Reviewing the Schengen border code and building fences tackles a symptom, but fails to address the underlying pull and push factors that bring migrants to Europe in the first place,” she says.Whether a more complete European migration regime would have helped defuse the Poland-Belarus stand-off is moot. EU governments have closed ranks behind Poland, despite strained relations over its rule of law breaches.But unlike Latvia and Lithuania, whose crises on the Belarus border quickly dissipated, the nationalist Law and Justice government in Warsaw rejected help from the EU and cast itself as a sole bulwark against illegal immigration. It was a political gift. “This has the potential to win them another election,” says Mortera-Martinez.Greenhill, the US academic, has concluded from her research that using migration as a weapon is more successful than other types of intervention, coercion or aggression.For Lukashenko, the episode helped to distract some of the attention from the deteriorating human rights situation in Belarus after he stole last year’s presidential election, says Michal Baranowski, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Warsaw.The autocrat has spoken directly to Merkel twice in the last month, having been ostracised by western leaders since his crackdown — suggesting his efforts to get more attention from the west have met with some success.Lukashenko has been far less successful on other fronts, including his desire to trigger a political crisis in Poland, or isolate it within the EU, or force a reversal in EU sanctions against Belarus.Przydacz, like many others in Europe, sees President Vladimir Putin’s hand behind Lukashenko’s provocation, given the Belarusian dictator’s dependence on Kremlin support, although Russia’s direct involvement is unclear.“One of Lukashenko’s objectives was to present Poland.as an inhumane country that does not observe basic principles, while Putin is giving us lessons on humanity as the president of Russia. I think every European or American reader can see the difference,” says Przydacz.Nevertheless, many of the Middle Eastern people who amassed in Belarus remain trapped at the border, even after some have returned home. With the winter setting in it is a human misery that leaves many Europeans both deeply uncomfortable and polarised over the right response.Through his Belarusian puppet, says Tocci, Putin “shames us in the eyes of the world”.
269  Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden will hold a phone call next week amid mounting military tensions on the border between Russia and Ukraine, with Washington warning that Moscow could launch an invasion in early 2022.The two presidents will speak on Tuesday, following a meeting this week of top US and Russian diplomats, where warnings were traded about the military situation. The White House said Biden would convey “US concerns with Russian military activities on the border with Ukraine and reaffirm the United States’ support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.”The US warned on Friday that Russia could be planning to invade Ukraine “as soon as early 2022” with an estimated 175,000 troops. Moscow has denied having plans to attack and has called the warnings inflammatory.Speaking on Saturday, Lloyd Austin, US defence secretary, said the Pentagon remained very concerned about the situation on the border.“As we look at the numbers of forces that are in the border region, as we look at some of the things that are occurring in the information space, if you look at what’s going on in the cyber domain, it really raises our concern,” Austin told the Reagan National Defense Forum in California.Concerns about an invasion spiked in April when Russia deployed thousands of troops but did not invade. Asked how concerned he was that Putin was not bluffing this time, Austin said, “They have invaded before”, in a reference to the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014.Austin said the US was “committed to helping Ukraine defend its sovereign territory”. He pointed out that Washington had previously provided Kyiv with lethal and non-lethal weapons and was looking for ways to provide additional help.Referring to the upcoming call between the two leaders, Austin said there was “a lot of space here for diplomacy and leadership” to resolve the crisis.“We’re going to remain engaged with our allies.and our partners in the region. And we’re going to continue to do everything we can to help provide Ukraine the capability to protect their sovereign territory.”A Biden administration official said Moscow’s plans “call for a military offensive against Ukraine as soon as early 2022 with a scale of forces twice what we saw this past spring during Russia’s rapid military build-up near Ukraine’s borders”.This would include “extensive movement of 100 battalion tactical groups with an estimated 175,000 personnel, along with armour, artillery and equipment”.According to the administration official, half the units were already near Ukraine’s border, having arrived in the past month. Russia had already moved to established a “ready reserve of contract reservists” to prepare for the offensive.Before heading to the presidential retreat at Camp David on Friday evening, Biden said: “We’ve been aware of Russia’s actions for a long time and my expectation is we’re going to have a long discussion.”A spokesperson for the Russian embassy in Washington said: “Russia is not a threat to any country. The deployment of Russian troops on the national territory is our sovereign right and no one’s business. It is Nato and its member states that are recklessly moving their military forces and infrastructure to the Russian borders.”Details of the US assessment of Russia’s plans, first reported by The Washington Post, emerged a few hours after Biden said he was in “constant contact” with European allies and Ukraine about the threat. He warned that he would try to stop Putin from following through with this plans, hinting at punitive measures.“What I am doing is putting together what I believe.will be the most comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives to make it very, very difficult for Mr Putin to go ahead and do what people are worried he may do,” the US president said. “But that’s in play right now,” Biden added.The National Security Council said Washington was “deeply concerned by evidence that Russia was stepping up its planning for significant military action against Ukraine” — noting this had been discussed by Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, on a trip to Europe this week.“The Biden administration has been consistent in our message to Russia: the United States does not seek conflict, and the best way to avert a crisis and a negative spiral in the broader relationship is through diplomacy and de-escalation,” the NSC said.The strength of the US intelligence assessment has surprised some European officials, and authorities on both sides of the Atlantic have spent weeks comparing and contrasting their evaluations. The Biden administration is seeking to flag the risks of a Ukraine invasion as part of a diplomatic push to deter Putin from deciding to act.
270  Emmanuel Macron brokered a call on Saturday between Saudi Arabia and Lebanon’s leaders in a bid to end a diplomatic dispute that led to the imposition of sanctions on Beirut by Gulf states.The French president, the first western leader to visit the kingdom since the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, pushed for the call during a meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Jeddah, during a tour intended to underline France’s influence in the region.Saudi Arabia recalled its ambassador and expelled the Lebanese envoy in October after Lebanon’s information minister George Kordahi criticised the Saudi-led coalition’s war against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. It also banned imports from Lebanon, which is enduring its worst economic crisis in decades. Other Gulf countries followed suit in recalling their envoys from Beirut.Macron said an important step had been taken with Saudi Arabia prepared to re-engage financially with Lebanon after a first round of three-way talks.“We worked together on Lebanon and we then called [Lebanese] prime minister Mikati together to pass on the clear message from Saudi Arabia and France that we fully want to engage,” Macron told reporters in Jeddah.“We want to engage so we can help the people of Lebanon and do everything so that an economic and commercial opening can happen.”Although sparked by Kordahi’s comments, the root of the Gulf states’ dispute is the influence of the Iran-backed Hizbollah, despite billions in Saudi Arabian financial aid to Beirut over recent decades.Kordahi resigned on Friday, saying France had requested that he step down before Macron’s visit. French officials said Saudi Arabia had agreed to send its ambassador back to Beirut, but it was not clear it would do so.Kordahi told the Financial Times he had asked Lebanese caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati whether his resignation would restore diplomatic relations. Kordahi said Mikati responded by saying “frankly, there is nothing”, but still decided to step down out of concern for Lebanese communities in Gulf states.A French proposal to have Mikati visit Jeddah for a trilateral meeting with Macron and Prince Mohammed was rejected.But a joint Saudi-French statement said they agreed a “joint-mechanism” for transparent humanitarian aid to Lebanon, as well as the need to restrict weapons to legitimate state institutions, a veiled reference to Hizbollah.Western leaders have shunned visits to Saudi Arabia since Khashoggi’s murder by Saudi agents in the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul. The CIA concluded Prince Mohammed must have authorised the operation. He has denied any involvement with Riyadh, blaming the killing on a rogue operation.Macron brushed aside criticism of his visit. “Who really thinks for a second that we can help Lebanon, that we can try and preserve the stability that we’re working towards in the Middle East, if we say ‘we’re not talking to Saudi Arabia any more’”, he said in Dubai on Friday.Macron said France, the former colonial power in Lebanon, had a role to play in the discussions. “It doesn’t mean we approve or that we forget,” he said. “It does not mean we’re not demanding partners.”A French official said Saudi Arabia’s agreement to re-engage with Lebanon was a quid pro quo for the high-profile visit by a western leader.A regional official said France had escalated pressure over the past few weeks. “With upcoming French elections, it’s important for him to make progress on this file,” the official said.Macron is being accompanied by a business delegation. In Dubai he announced a $19bn sale of Rafale fighter jets and helicopters.In Jeddah, the state-owned Saudi Arabian Military Industries announced joint ventures with French companies Airbus and Figeac Aéro.
271  Valérie Pécresse, who heads the Ile-de-France region around Paris, has been chosen as the candidate of the conservative Les Républicains party in next year’s French presidential election.Pécresse — who will try to win back the support that switched towards Emmanuel Macron at the last election while seeing off challengers from the far right — would become the country’s first woman president if she were to win in April.“For the first time in its history, the party of General de Gaulle, of Georges Pompidou, of Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy will have a female candidate to run for the presidential election,” Pécresse told cheering supporters.LR party members picked Pécresse in a final round of primary voting at the weekend after she won pledges of support from other losing candidates and saw off Eric Ciotti, a member of the National Assembly from the south and the most rightwing of the LR contenders. She beat Ciotti by 61 per cent of the votes to 39.Two of the initial favourites in the LR race, former EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and Xavier Bertrand, a regional leader from Hauts-de-France in the north, were knocked out early, shaking up analysts’ predictions ahead of the election in the spring.Pécresse’s nomination signals the launch in earnest of the French campaign season.All the main candidates except Macron himself have declared themselves, including Marine Le Pen of the far-right Rassemblement National; Eric Zemmour, an independent anti-immigration polemicist whose sudden rise to prominence has been likened to that of Donald Trump; and Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo, who is trailing in opinion polls as the candidate for the Socialists.Macron is expected to officially declare his re-election campaign in early 2022.A former education and budget minister under Nicolas Sarkozy, Pécresse, 54, is regarded as a moderate in the LR. She has presented herself as an environmentalist, as well as a fiscal conservative, and pushed a strong law and order agenda.Her programme includes cutting administrative jobs in France — although she has said she wants to pour more money into the justice system — and boosting salaries for lower income workers by reducing their social security payments.On immigration, a fixation of the far-right candidates and one of the major campaign battlegrounds, Pécresse has said she would introduce quotas and toughen the asylum system.Ciotti’s unexpectedly strong performance in the primary — he led after the first round — underlines the risk for Pécresse and the LR that the support of conservative republicans will bleed away to Zemmour and his radical defence of France as a Judeo-Christian culture that is supposedly under assault from mass Muslim immigration.Pécresse made a nod to the increasingly strong far-right wing of her party, condemning violent crime, “the rise of Islamist separatism” and “uncontrolled immigration”.“Together we will restore French pride and protect the French,” she said.But whereas Ciotti on Saturday repeated his call for the party to champion “identity, authority and liberty”, Pécresse endorsed only the last two and pointedly replaced “identity” with “dignity”. In her address, in which she tagged Macron as a “zigzag” president who shifted between right and left, Pécresse said she would take aim at the bureaucracy and public debt weighing down France in her view, and advocate “a less naive Europe.”Macron, who sought to shake off traditional political tags when he came to power in 2017 and swayed voters from different side on a more centrist platform that was “neither right nor left”, has nonetheless encroached on conservative turf.His push for reforms, including an overhaul of labour rules, earned him backing from many business leaders, and he profited in 2017 from the fall from grace of François Fillon, the LR candidate once seen as a shoo-in for the presidency, who was hit by an embezzlement scandal during the campaign.Pécresse will be looking to recover some of those voters. Polls carried out before the results of the LR race had put her on about 11 per cent in the first round, at half the level of Macron in first place and well behind Le Pen and Zemmour. If she fails to improve on that score in the first vote in April, she will not qualify for the second round of the presidential election.Pécresse sought to distance herself from the divisive and declinist views of extremist candidates such as Zemmour. “Contrary to the extremes, we will rip up the page of the Macron era without ripping up the history of France,” Pécresse said after winning the nomination.
272  After a series largely stuck in corporate offices and convention centres, Succession, the hit HBO series, finally hits the road this weekend. In the penultimate episode (to be screened on Sunday in the US and Monday worldwide) the feuding Roy family will decamp to Italy for a glamorous wedding in a Tuscan villa.And though it might look like something from a fairytale, the villa is in fact, real — and available to rent. Villa Cetinale is old world Italy at its most alluring, a 17th-century country home set among rolling hills seven miles from Siena.It is a monument to Baroque grandeur, boldly embossed with the coat of arms of its creator Cardinal Flavio Chigi and stuffed with heirlooms — a baldachin bed, silver ornaments, a bas-relief commemorating a visit by Grand Duke Cosimo III de’ Medici.What makes it different to so many other Tuscan villas you can rent, is this one is still lived in for the three months of the year when guests are not in residence. That texture, being a real home, is what gives the house a different kind of class, inflected with the exquisite taste of interior decorator, Camilla Guinness, and the attention of Cetinale’s long-standing house manager, Isabella Barsottini. It’s owned by Ned Lambton, son of Antony Lambton, a former Tory politician who in 1973 was photographed in bed smoking marijuana with two prostitutes. Following the scandal he resigned, retired and four years later bought Cetinale and moved out to Tuscany, working hard to restore the house and gardens until his death in 2006.Today, there are 13 bedrooms, a pool, a vaulted loggia and frescoed dining room, but the secret garden is where the parties happen, on long tables set among the striped shadows of cypress trees. A mile-long avenue leads to a “scala santa” or “sacred staircase”, climbing steeply to an abandoned hermitage. A grove of ilex and oak trees flanks the villa’s boundary. In the late 1600s, Siena’s famous Palio took place in these “Holy Woods”, encircled by a wall almost three miles long. The forest’s shadowy passages are studded with statues — Greek demi-gods, saints, mystical beasts — and frescoed chapels. This is where you feel the true spirit of Cetinale, in the way mythology and nature converge in a fantastical dream, vibrating with an abundance of story, danger and pleasure.
273  When Ahmed, a Syrian man now living in the UK, decided to flee his country in 2019, he sought the help of a smuggler to negotiate the frontier between Syria and neighbouring Turkey. Once safely through he began a year-long odyssey to the French coast, then across the Channel to England, his final destination.The journey taken by Ahmed — not his real name — involved a series of ad hoc arrangements that most migrants make as they move across continents. He hired another smuggler to cross the Mediterranean from Turkey to Greece, clung to the bottom of a truck to cross from Hungary into Austria, walked across the Austrian border into Germany and paid a friend fuel money to drive him into France. Finally, he boarded a small boat to cross the channel to England.His route illustrates how the networks that facilitate migrants’ journeys are more complex than many realise, mixing personal initiative, help from other migrants, opportunistic criminals and organised gangs. “It is not as smoothly executed as it might appear,” said Tuesday Reitano, deputy director of the Geneva-based Global Initiative Against Transnational Organised Crime.The question for law-enforcement agencies across Europe is how these different groups can be tackled, particularly when victims often regard them as offering a helpful, life-transforming service.The dangers facing migrants were highlighted last month when 27 people drowned after their boat sank during a crossing of the English Channel. The smugglers who arranged the trip were described by Tom Pursglove, UK immigration minister, as “evil criminal gangs” who treated individuals as “cargo”.According to Reitano, the dangerous borders on the edges of the EU, such as the intensively monitored Channel or the Mediterranean, require organised specialists to manage crossings. Criminal gangs have stepped in to meet the demand.“There are definitely specialists who do different borders,” including the Sahara and the Mediterranean, she said. “There are a small cluster — one group, essentially, or a group with small splinters — who are monopolising the Channel crossing,” she added.But the distinction between smuggler and smuggled is frequently blurred. In places, some migrants, known as rehber from the Turkish word for “guide”, use co-ordinates supplied by the smugglers to lead fellow travellers across borders or through other difficult terrain.Maddie Harris, founder of Humans for Rights Network, which advocates for people travelling to seek asylum, said she had encountered “all kinds of different people” involved in smuggling.“Often what we see is young men coerced and manipulated into fulfilling the function of a smuggler, whether that be closing a lorry door or the equivalent on a small boat, in exchange for a more affordable passage or simply just passage,” she said.Harris spent two years working at refugee camps in northern France, and faced threats from some of the smugglers who operated there. “They’re rapists, they’re murderers and it’s an incredibly dangerous place,” she recalled.Benny Hunter, project co-ordinator for the Da’aro Youth Project, which helps people who arrived in the UK as unaccompanied minors from Eritrea, said migrants were pushed to smugglers because all other routes were closed.“These are people who are just providing a service based on a need that exists because of the way the asylum system is set up,” he said, adding that in one case a young Eritrean boy’s smuggler acted as “a kind of childminder” to him.Migrant journeys work differently depending on the nationality of the person travelling. Nando Sigona, an immigration expert at Birmingham university, said that for people like Ahmed, who are fleeing a country with an active conflict, the initial impulse was simply to move somewhere safe.“The next step is you go in a place and spend enough time there and you meet people from your country of origin, who speak your language,” he said. “It’s fragmented.”However, people travelling from wealthier countries often make an arrangement with a smuggler before leaving home, according to Sigona. Migrants from China, for example, can travel to Albania without a visa so only need to take a short clandestine journeys onwards to western Europe, he said.Fernand Gontier, chief of France’s border police, this week told a press conference in Calais that his officers had encountered smugglers from Vietnam — one of the wealthiest origin countries for migrants — among people it arrested in the first 10 months this year.“They are particularly organised at the international level, very integrated, with funding that starts from the country of departure up to the countries of arrival,” Gontier said.In most cases, though, the identity of those running the most exploitative operations is less clear than the nationalities of their customers.Reitano said her research suggested the Channel operation was run by North Africans, either born in countries such as Morocco or of North African origin living in France.But Ahmed said he had not encountered any North Africans, adding that the best-known smuggler was an Iranian known as Benjamin, whose operations were rarely disrupted by the police.Gontier differentiated between loosely run efforts co-ordinated by people from African countries and the more tightly organised trips, which he attributed mostly to Iraqi Kurds. “This is serious organised crime, acting on an industrial scale,” he said.Ahmed’s ultimate success underlines the challenge of eradicating the trade. The smugglers helped him get across the Channel in January, after “seven or eight” attempts foiled either by the police or by problems with the boat.“They would gather us and take us to different points on the beach and we would sit and wait until a car that they were in touch with arrived,” Ahmed said. “They’d tell the driver where to stop, then he would stop and they would rush over to it, and pull out the dinghy.”Ahmed said he had been fortunate to arrive in Calais, where he spent about four months, in late 2020. Coronavirus lockdowns were hitting trade so while most migrants paid between £2,100 and £2,500 for the trip, the smugglers were willing to accept less than £760 from Ahmed.The British government has since recognised him as a legitimate refugee and granted him residence rights. The lure of winning such protection will outweigh the risks of being smuggled as long as there is no alternative route, said Reitano.The UK has resisted demands to offer would-be refugees the chance to make asylum applications from outside the UK. Supporters of the reform say it would remove the incentive for future Ahmeds to cross the Channel to lodge claims. The government is instead introducing legislation to deter migrants by eroding the rights of those who reach the UK by illegal means.Reitano predicted the English language and the UK’s established immigrant communities would trump those measures.“You can tell them to stay in France but they don’t want to because they don’t want to learn French and they don’t have a family there,” Reitano said. “Creating safe routes and, obviously, closing down the success of the illegal ones is ultimately the route to success.”Additional reporting by Guy Chazan
274  In one of her final speeches as chancellor Angela Merkel did something she had almost never done in her 16 years in office: she talked about herself, and her East German past.Merkel was hurt by an essay recently published about her Christian Democratic Union party, which described her history as “ballast”. Quoting from a dictionary, the chancellor said ballast was cargo used for balance then discarded.“A personal life story of, in my case, 35 years of state dictatorship and repression — ballast?” she asked on the October anniversary of German reunification.“I say this as a citizen of the east.who went into German unity with this life story, and who continue to experience such evaluations — as if their life before German unity didn’t really count.”It was a subject Merkel long avoided in public. She is the first chancellor to come from communist East Germany, a past that weighs on those who grew up in it.Three decades since the fall of the Berlin Wall, east-west divisions still resonate — particularly for former citizens of East Germany, who feel Merkel never promoted their history, nor worked to heal the divide still felt with the west of the country.Many Ossis — the informal name for people from the former East — say her economic and migration policies exacerbated schisms, which created fertile ground for far-right populism.And despite Merkel’s own status as one of the world’s most powerful democratic leaders, many easterners feel Wessis continue to dominate their reunited nation.Eastern Germans still earn less, and work more. According to a study by the Allensbach Institute, 40 per cent see themselves as “East German” rather than “German”.In Merkel’s childhood home of Templin, her newfound embrace of shared historical grievances felt bittersweet. It comes just weeks before Olaf Scholz, of the centre-left Social Democrats, takes the reins of Europe’s largest economy.“She was a bit late,” joked Erika Benn, 83, who was Merkel’s Russian coach for school district language competitions.The white-haired, bespectacled teacher — a staunch leftist — never voted for Merkel but now appreciates that “she has realised she has to talk about her life here”.Today, Templin gets as many visitors curious about the aloof chancellor as about its medieval walls. Unlike much of eastern Germany, emptied by economic westward migration, the town has flourished as a retreat for nearby Berliners, who in summer flock to the picturesque town and its nearby lakes.Although she was born in Hamburg, West Germany, Merkel’s family was moved east by her father, Horst Kasner, a left-leaning pastor. The future chancellor grew up in a green, two-storey house at Waldhof, a Protestant seminary, nestled among trees and rolling pastures.Merkel’s childhood was a privilege and a burden, said Wolfgang Seyfried, a retired Waldhof director who knew the family. Many priests were regarded as potential western spies. But they enjoyed material advantages, with West German churches sending supplies from washing machines to cars.“It was not only an East German upbringing, but a unique one, easy to stigmatise,” Seyfried said. “That becomes who you are for life, for better and for worse.”Merkel’s relative silence on her past might have been a missed opportunity for healing divisions, but was also probably something she needed to maintain, said Hans Vorländer, of the Technical University at Dresden. “She did not politicise it, because it could have been used to mobilise against her,” he said.Behind the scenes, he said, Merkel did more for fellow East Germans than she gets credit for. Her government’s decision to spend billions of euros to subsidise the closure of mines was, Vorländer said, probably done for the sake of East German coal miners who would soon be jobless.“A lot, a lot of money has been transferred from west to east German states,” he said. “She has always had the interests of eastern Germany in mind.”Yet traumas linger from long before Merkel’s time as chancellor. Eastern Germany suffered in the 1990s from deindustrialisation, when western companies shut down countless eastern factories and thousands lost their jobs. The migration of younger, skilled East Germans has left small towns empty until today.The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) tapped into that anger, developing a strong following in the east.A decision by Merkel — which SPD politician Sigmar Gabriel has described as being motivated by her East German experience and Christian values — deepened that faultline. Her acceptance of nearly 1m mostly Syrian refugees in 2015 sparked a popular backlash, used by the AfD to enter the Bundestag. It was the first far-right party to do so since the second world war.“All of a sudden they were just shouting: Stop now, Merkel! Away with Merkel!” Vorländer recalled. “The strength of the AfD can be explained by the fact it has taken up this anti-Merkel substance.”In September’s elections, the AfD became the strongest party in the eastern states of Saxony and Thuringia.One of Merkel’s greatest contributions, some Templiners said, may instead have been to Wessis — by changing the conservative treatment of women. (Her political mentor, Helmut Kohl, called Merkel his Mädchen, or girl.)Templin mayor Detlef Tabbert said Merkel’s childhood readied her to make history as Germany’s first female chancellor.“[East German] women had the same rights, the same pay, the same opportunities to advance. So women raised in the east were more self-confident,” he said. “She never thought: I’m a woman, I have to get in line.”At Thursday’s military ceremony to bid her farewell, Merkel nodded to her roots with a request that the band play an East German punk rock song, Du hast den Farbfilm vergessen — “You forgot the colour film.”A veiled critique of the drabness of East German life, its famous chorus is: “No one will believe how beautiful it was here.”
275  Russia’s largest social media network VKontakte has come under state control after a series of deals gave a majority stake to companies linked to state-run gas monopoly Gazprom.Boris Dobrodeev, chief executive of VKontakte’s parent company VK, said on Friday he was stepping down, a day after Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov’s USM Group said it had sold its interest in VK to Gazprom affiliate Sogaz, an insurance company, while Gazprom Media said it had also acquired a stake.The two will share control over VK, which was known until recently as Mail.ru, as well as other popular brands in its network, such as social media platform Odnoklassniki. VKontakte, which offers messaging and news, has about 100m active users, making it the largest social media network in Europe, according to Similarweb.The Kremlin has recently stepped up its decade-long campaign to assert control over the internet, which has previously seen it increase its engagement with domestic internet companies.In September, Apple and Google’s app stores dropped a tactical voting app made by supporters of the jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny ahead of parliamentary elections, after coming under pressure from the Russian government.Sogaz is considered Gazprom’s insurance arm and counts Yuri Kovalchuk, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, among its shareholders.Russian media outlets RBC and The Bell cited sources who said Dobrodeev’s successor at the top of VK would be Vladimir Kiriyenko, who is head of Russian state telecoms group Rostelecom and the son of Putin’s deputy chief of staff.Analysts at VTB Capital said in a note that Gazprom-linked structures had now become controlling stakeholders in VK but added that “it is not clear at this stage how the change of control will affect VK”.“The change of the actual controlling shareholder of VK does not imply any changes in the fundamental valuation of the company as such, but we still anticipate further corporate changes, which may become an impetus for the growth of share prices,” VTB Capital analysts wrote.Alexei Miller, chief executive of Gazprom, who is also chair of Sogaz, described VK as a “promising investment”, the Interfax news agency reported.“The deal is done on market conditions,” he added. “I would note that as a result of the transaction. one controlling legal entity has not been created.”Former Arsenal shareholder Usmanov’s decision to sell VK also follows disagreements with state lender Sberbank over a $1.6bn joint venture that involved some of the companies under VK’s umbrella, the FT reported in March.USM said it would now focus on other companies in its group, including in the metals and mining and telecoms sectors.Moscow has deployed a range of different tools in recent years to exert control over the Russian internet, from using law enforcement to tackle dissent online to attempting to slow down some websites or ban certain VPNs and apps outright.In recent months, it has focused on targeting foreign internet giants with fines and lawsuits in an attempt to force them to remove some content and comply with local data laws. It has framed this push to bring western internet firms to heel as protecting what it describes as its “digital sovereignty.”But it has also sought to play a role in leading domestic internet companies. Yandex, Russia’s largest tech company, in 2019 set up a special foundation after lengthy negotiations with the Kremlin over its company structure. The foundation can remove Yandex management should it deem this in the national interest, among other powers.VKontakte founder Pavel Durov left Russia in 2014 after claiming he was pressured into selling his shares in the social media company by Kremlin-friendly oligarchs. Durov then shifted his focus to developing the Telegram messaging app, which Russia’s communications watchdog tried and failed to ban in 2018.Sogaz said on Thursday it had acquired a 45 per cent stake in MF Technologies, the vehicle through which Usmanov’s USM held 57.3 per cent of voting shares in VK. Gazprom Media said on Friday it had received a stake transferred from Gazprombank, which had earlier bought 36 per cent in MF Technologies.
276  One big question has hovered over Inditex, the world’s largest clothing retailer, for at least a decade: what happens when Amancio Ortega goes?The 85-year-old founder of Spain’s biggest and best-respected company stepped down as chair 10 years ago, but comes in every day to its headquarters on the Atlantic coast and still holds a majority stake in the €89bn giant, making him the country’s richest man.Now the question has an answer: the Inditex board announced this week that, as of April 1, Ortega’s 37-year-old daughter Marta will take over as chair of the Zara owner.The contrast is stark with her reclusive father, who started work as a shop assistant at 13, has never given an interview, rarely wears his company’s products and refused to be photographed until just before Inditex listed in 2001. Marta’s appearances at fashion shows, on the French and Italian Rivieras and at society weddings have become a staple of ¡Hola! and other celebrity magazines.“She loves fashion, the world of the image and combining them,” says a company insider of Ortega, who was educated at a Swiss boarding school and Regent’s University in London. “It’s something she lives very intensely.”After working discreetly at the group for 15 years, Ortega announced herself to the public in an interview with the Wall Street Journal in August, wearing clothes from the Zara and Massimo Dutti ranges for an accompanying photo shoot. “I will always be wherever the company needs me most,” she said on that occasion.Inditex staff and analysts say Ortega has followed her father closely where it matters. Like him, she eschews an office in Inditex’s headquarters in an industrial estate in A Coruña’s outskirts, preferring to confer with colleagues at a communal desk. And like him, her primary interest is the Zara Woman collection (Zara accounts for almost 70 per cent of Inditex’s sales).“It’s a very natural process for a father to hand over to a daughter in this way: clearly the time has come and she’s been a lot more involved in the business than we realised,” says Anne Critchlow, an analyst at Société Générale, of Ortega’s ascension. “She’s been under the radar.”But critics see a familiar tale: an impatient scion of a business dynasty elbows aside a professional who has successfully managed the group — in this instance Pablo Isla, the outgoing executive chair, under whose watch Inditex’s market capitalisation multiplied six-fold and who has been acclaimed by Harvard Business Review as the world’s top performing chief executive.“It’s the typical story of Spanish family companies — a moment comes when the second generation, which has felt under-appreciated, convinces itself that it can run the business better than the professionals,” says Lorenzo Bernaldo de Quirós, president of Freemarket, a Madrid-based consultancy.The company fiercely rejects any such characterisation, arguing that Inditex will be run more along Anglo-American lines, with a new CEO taking on the leading executive role and its management committee gaining more powers.“It isn’t really a case of Marta taking over from Pablo,” adds Critchlow. “Marta’s role is not executive, while Pablo was executive chair.” She says the shares fell because of Isla’s replacement by “a relatively unknown person”, not Ortega’s arrival.Óscar García Maceiras, the new CEO, has been with Inditex only since March and his principal experience is as a lawyer. It will be him investors will look to as Inditex seeks to increase digitalisation and its operations’ sustainability.But Ortega’s rise remains a story of family ties, two marriages that shaped Inditex and the futures of Spain’s biggest fortune and its leading brand. Indeed, just as her appointment this week heralds a shake-up of the group, so did her birth in 1984.When Marta was born, Amancio was still married to his first wife, Rosalía Mera, who helped him start the clothing business that prefigured Inditex, making gowns and lingerie. According to a biography of Mera, until the birth she was unaware of her husband’s relationship with Flora Pérez, Marta’s mother.Today, Pérez — Amancio’s second wife — represents the family’s 60 per cent shareholding on the Inditex board and two of her brothers, both of whom have worked for the group for decades, run Zara and Massimo Dutti. Marta’s husband, Carlos Torretta, also works for Zara.com.By contrast, Ortega’s older half-sister, Sandra, plays no role in Inditex’s management, but on Mera’s death in 2013 acceded to Spain’s second largest fortune after Amancio himself — estimated by Forbes at €6.3bn to his €67bn.The company says Ortega will retain her role at Zara even when she takes her place heading Inditex’s board, on which her mother and father remain.“These two things are very compatible,” said one person close to the company. He adds that Inditex’s top management — including family members — is “a professional team with a lot of experience who have been there for many years”.Others are not convinced. “This company is like a fantastic ocean liner,” says Bernaldo de Quirós. “It’s been handed over in the best condition possible. The problem is that in 10 years’ time, you might look at it and see that it isn’t the Queen Mary any more.” 
277  Lithuania said on Friday that China had blocked all imports from the Baltic state in an escalation of a diplomatic dispute over relations with Taiwan.Vilnius said Beijing had delisted it as a country of origin, which meant goods cannot clear customs, and was rejecting all import applications.Beijing downgraded diplomatic ties with Lithuania and suspended consular services there after the country permitted a Taiwanese Representative Office to open in November.China considers Taiwan to be part of its territory.Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuanian foreign minister, denounced the “unannounced sanctions” on Friday and said Lithuania would ask the European Commission for help. It was “unprecedented when one EU member state is being partially sanctioned”, he said.The country exported €300m worth of goods to China in 2020, less than 1 per cent of its total exports.“We have been informed that Lithuanian shipments are not being cleared through Chinese customs and import applications are being rejected. We are in contact with Vilnius and the EU Delegation in Beijing in order to collect all possible information and clarify the situation,” the commission said.The move comes days before Brussels proposes a law allowing it to retaliate against such economic sanctions.The anti-coercion instrument, to be agreed by the commission on Wednesday, would allow the EU to retaliate more swiftly against the measures and US action against companies trading with Cuba and Iran.However, it faces opposition from several EU members which fear it could breach international rules and damage global trade. The 27 EU members and the European parliament must back the law before it comes into force.Estonia and Japan have lodged public objections, along with business lobbies in Denmark and Sweden. Their governments were also sceptical, diplomats said.Tokyo said the instrument could break World Trade Organization rules, a concern shared by some EU capitals.“Deterring/counteractions themselves may have a potential inconsistency with the WTO Agreement as a prohibited unilateral measure,” Tokyo told the EU in a consultation on the proposal in March.Estonia demanded that “the proposed instrument must be fully in line with WTO rules” in its submission. “The cornerstone of EU trade policy is its compatibility with the multilateral rules-based trading system, embodied by the rules of the WTO.”EU diplomats said Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Italy and the Czech Republic had concerns about the plan.“It is not clear to us that the problem is large enough to justify the proposal,” said Sweden in a letter to the commission seen by the FT. “If implemented, this instrument would likely have a significant economic impact on trade, businesses, and on the relations between the EU and other countries.”Global Times, the Chinese state-run media outlet, said in an article on Friday that Lithuania had been “dancing” with the US and making inappropriate remarks on Taiwan. It said Beijing had no choice but to lower Lithuania’s diplomatic status and that Vilnius must “bear all the consequences” arising from this.Additional reporting by Eleanor Olcott in London
278  France has secured its biggest overseas order for its Rafale combat jet with the United Arab Emirates as President Emmanuel Macron looks to deepen ties with an important Middle Eastern ally.On a visit to Dubai on Friday ahead of meetings in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Macron cemented the sale in a ceremony with the UAE’s de facto leader Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan as part of broader economic and security talks.The €17bn-plus deal involves 80 Rafale jets and 12 Caracal helicopters made by France’s Dassault Aviation and Airbus, in what Macron called “the biggest military contract in our history”. Dassault shares surged as much as 9 per cent on news of the deal.The contract follows Rafale orders from Croatia, Greece and Egypt this year. Its value tops the share of France’s Naval group in the €56bn submarines contract that Canberra scrapped in September, according to the defence ministry.Relations between France and the UAE have strengthened in recent years as Macron and Sheikh Mohammed have been aligned on many issues in the Middle East.In Libya, the two states have supported Khalifa Haftar, the general who controls much of the country’s east. They both have had challenging relations with Turkey and share a deep mistrust and concern about Islamist movements such as the Muslim Brotherhood.The UAE has also backed France’s efforts to combat Jihadi groups in the Sahel states of sub-Saharan Africa with funds and by flying out aid to the region.The two leaders “reaffirmed their common support for elections and the withdrawal of mercenaries in Libya”, the French presidency said, referring to the departure of foreign fighters that was part of a ceasefire agreement brokered by the UN. Libya is holding the first round of its presidential election on December 24. Macron also called on the UAE to step up humanitarian efforts in Lebanon.The Gulf state followed Saudi Arabia’s lead in withdrawing its ambassador from Beirut in October, ostensibly over comments made by a Lebanese minister about the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen’s war, but also because of concerns about the influence of Hizbollah, the powerful Iranian-backed political and militant movement. On Friday, George Kordahi, the Lebanese minister at the heart of the row, said he would step down after France requested his resignation to give Macron’s initiative to improve relations between Lebanon and the Gulf a chance.Abu Dhabi is longtime client of France’s Dassault — it bought Mirage 2000 fighter jets — and France has long been one of the UAE’s main security suppliers alongside the US.The Rafale deal follows a decade of negotiations, and comes as the UAE’s attempt to acquire US-made F-35 jets, which was agreed by the Trump administration, has come under scrutiny in Washington. The Biden administration has expressed concerns over the F35 deal due to worries about Abu Dhabi’s use of Huawei’s 5G telecommunications network and the risk of technology transfer to China.“France has shown itself to be a more willing defence and security partner to the United Arab Emirates, and a number of other Arab states,” said Charles Forrester, an analyst at defence consultancy Janes. He added that flexibility from French manufacturers in allowing buyers such as the UAE to integrate home-made weapons and equipment into aircraft made their offer attractive and gave the Gulf state more security on supply chain issues.The Rafale deals have not been exempt from criticism, including after Macron said he would not make the Egyptian order conditional on human rights demands, as he did not want to undermine efforts to fight Islamist terrorism in the region.Human rights campaigners lashed out at the Egypt weapons deal, saying France was only encouraging the regime of Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has led a repressive crackdown across civil society.Human Rights Watch has also criticised the UAE deal because the country has been part of an Arab coalition led by Saudi Arabia that is fighting Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. The UAE withdrew most of its troops from Yemen in 2019.Macron said he was an “ardent defender” of a deal that would boost French industry and jobs. He said France had a role to play in the Middle East and the “power to provide balance”.“We cannot act to help Lebanon, to help Iraq, we cannot act against terrorism in the region.if we don’t put ourselves in a position in which we can talk to everyone and have trusting and strategic relations with our partners,” Macron told reporters.Macron is supporting efforts to try to broker a peace deal between Yemeni rebels and Saudi Arabia.Additional reporting by Samer Al-Atrush in Riyadh
279  Europe’s top human rights body has launched disciplinary action against Turkey for its refusal to release a jailed businessman and philanthropist, striking a fresh symbolic blow to the country’s relations with the west.The decision caps a difficult week for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, marred by the resignation of his finance minister against the backdrop of a currency crisis that has seen the lira lose 40 per cent of its value against the dollar in the past three months.The Council of Europe voted narrowly in favour of launching “infringement” proceedings against Ankara over the detention of Osman Kavala, who has remained behind bars even after an order by the European Court of Human Rights for his release.The infringement process — likely to take at least 18 months, according to diplomats — could ultimately result in a suspension of Turkey’s voting rights at the Council of Europe, which oversees the ECHR.It could even lead to the country’s expulsion from the Strasbourg-based institution that it has been a part of since 1950, severing a crucial link between Turkey and Europe at a time when its hopes of EU accession have faded.Kavala, who has been detained for four years without any conviction, was at the centre of a recent row between Erdogan and 10 western nations after they signed a joint statement calling for his release. Turkey accused the Council of Europe of taking a “biased and selective approach” to enforcing ECHR judgments.The decision came after Erdogan faced a tumultuous week on the domestic front, with mounting public discontent over the rising cost of living and growing accusations that his government was manipulating inflation data.Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of Turkey’s main opposition party, added to the pressures on the government on Friday by paying a visit to the statistical agency as new official data said inflation rose 21 per cent in November.The latest figure was higher than analysts’ forecast of 20.7 per cent. But Kilicdaroglu, who stood outside the locked gates of TurkStat after officials refused to grant him a meeting, accused the agency of manipulating the data. “TurkStat has stopped being a state institution and has become an institution of the [presidential] palace,” he said.The lira has suffered its worst plunge since a 2018 currency crisis after the central bank, acting under the orders of Erdogan, began cutting interest rates in September despite rising inflation.The Turkish president has long believed, contrary to established economic orthodoxy, that high interest rates cause inflation rather than helping to bring it down.He has insisted that more rate cuts will follow, flying in the face of warnings that, in a country heavily reliant on imported energy and raw materials, an ever-weakening lira could trigger a vicious cycle of currency depreciation and inflation.Erdogan’s fixation on low rates had caused tension with his finance minister, Lutfi Elvan, who was the last remaining voice of economic orthodoxy within his cabinet. On Thursday, the Turkish president accepted Elvan’s resignation and replaced him with a loyalist who has praised his economic approach.Shortly after Elvan’s departure, the central bank announced that it would return to the controversial policy of using its foreign currency reserves to support the lira, which hit a new record low of 14 to the dollar this week.The central bank spent an estimated $1bn on the first intervention, according to Goldman Sachs. On Friday, it announced that it would sell foreign currency for the second time in three days.The rating agency Fitch downgraded its outlook on Turkey from “stable” to “negative” and warned that sustained intervention by the central bank “will not by itself address the main causes behind the depreciation pressures”. It said the policy “risks further undermining the already weak central bank international reserves’ composition”.
280  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
281  The president of the European Central Bank said it was unlikely eurozone interest rates would increase next year, calling the current rise in inflation a passing “hump”, but added that the ECB would act swiftly if needed to staunch the increase in prices.Despite eurozone inflation hitting a record high of 4.9 per cent in November, well above the ECB’s target of 2 per cent, Christine Lagarde said it was likely to have peaked and would decline next year.“I see an inflation profile that looks like a hump.and a hump eventually declines,” she said at a Reuters virtual event. Lagarde also repeated her assertion that the ECB was “very unlikely” to raise interest rates next year.Her comments contrast with a recent policy shift at the US Federal Reserve, whose chair Jay Powell this week said it would speed up the withdrawal of its bond purchases to fight soaring inflation, fuelling expectations that it was likely to raise rates next year.Lagarde said it was too early to say what impact the Omicron coronavirus variant would have on Europe’s recent economic recovery and on inflation. “We have to wait for the scientists to tell us [more about the variant],” she said.“But equally, we need to very clearly indicate that we stand ready [to act] in both directions,” she added. Once inflation is on track to stay above 2 per cent for the next few years, fulfilling the conditions set by the ECB for rates to rise, she said the bank “would not hesitate to act”.Some economists have said the new variant could mean inflation stays higher for longer as fresh restrictions disrupt trade and shift demand from services to goods, worsening supply chain bottlenecks that have pushed up prices around the world.However, Lagarde said 55 to 60 per cent of recent inflation came from soaring energy prices and there was “reason to believe that by the end of 2022 it will have declined significantly”.Given the rising uncertainty over the economic impact of the pandemic, Lagarde also said the central bank’s policymakers were unlikely to make any long-term policy pledges when they meet in two weeks.“There are ways to give clarity without making long-term commitments and I would err on the side of not making very long-term commitments because there is too much uncertainty,” Lagarde said.The recent surge in Covid-19 cases and the spread of the Omicron variant have made some ECB policymakers reluctant to commit to maintaining its stimulus for a long period when they meet on December 16, especially after inflation consistently overshot their forecasts this year.Some conservative “hawks” at the ECB have said it could end all asset purchases next year, much earlier than many investors expect.Klaas Knot, head of the Dutch central bank, said on Friday the ECB could raise rates in 2023 if inflation stays higher than expected next year.Lagarde said new bond purchases under its flagship €1.85tn pandemic emergency purchase programme were still expected to end in March, but she added that the ECB had other tools available to “ensure conditions remain favourable” after that point.She said the ECB could still “act on markets” by reinvesting the proceeds of maturing bonds and by continuing new purchases under its traditional asset purchase programme, which some investors expect to be expanded from its current pace of €20bn a month.Eurozone unemployment, which is close to pre-pandemic levels after dipping to 7.3 per cent in October, was higher than in the US and there were fewer signs of labour shortages or widespread cases of people leaving the workforce in Europe, Lagarde said.
282  The writer was UK ambassador to Washington, Nato and Israel and is a director of Gatehouse Advisory Partners. Jonathan Powell, chief of staff to Tony Blair from 1995 to 2007, also contributed to this articleWe were promised an amicable Brexit. Boris Johnson said that while the UK might be leaving the EU, we would still be a positive part of Europe. Instead we risk a series of cross-channel crises turning into permanent confrontation.But there is a model for better relations right under our noses. After a decade of strain between France and Italy, President Emmanuel Macron and prime minister Mario Draghi recently signed a new bilateral treaty undertaking to co-operate closely on a range of issues. We should sit down with the French and do the same, while setting up a new systematic structure of consultation with the EU as a whole.But first we have to stop pretending that the Indo-Pacific region is more important than Europe to the UK. The integrated review of defence and security policy published earlier this year argues that Britain should pivot to the Indo-Pacific in recognition of China’s emergence as an increasingly dominant great power, and in response to the growing importance of Asia economically. We should certainly take account of these new realities, but our engagement in Asia is not a substitute for defence co-operation in Europe.Nor does it change geography. China is some 5,000 miles from Britain; France is 20. The immediate threat to the UK and its European neighbours is from Russia, which has murdered people on British soil and seeks to undermine western cohesion in both Nato and the EU.If we are serious about making “Global Britain” more than an empty slogan, we cannot pretend that we are an Indo-Pacific power while ignoring the continent to which we belong. It is not a question of choosing either Asia or Europe; we must choose both.We need to defuse the war of megaphone diplomacy with our neighbours and try to restore trust.First, we must rebuild confidence with France so that the two European nuclear powers, with the strongest military forces, can work closely together. We should consider a new bilateral treaty as a framework for relations, pulling together existing agreements.The two Lancaster House Treaties of 2010 remain in force. The first commits the UK and France to joint exercises and training, to work together on military doctrine, to the exchange of military personnel, access to each other’s defence procurement programmes, and to the pooling of military resources in military operations.Some bilateral co-operation continues: France contributes 300 troops to the Nato force in Estonia of which the UK is the framework nation. The crisis in Belarus has increased the threat in the Baltic area and eastern Europe. London and Paris could work together with Germany, the Nato framework nation in Lithuania. An enhanced tripartite approach by London, Paris and Berlin, compatible with our respective Nato commitments, would send a strong signal of joint intent.There is also scope for further nuclear co-operation. The second of the Lancaster House Treaties provides for bilateral co-operation on nuclear issues, including a 50-year commitment to share the same facility to check the safety and security of our nuclear warheads. As the threat of proliferation grows, there is more that we can do together.We should develop the Combined Joint Expeditionary Force (CJEF), which provides for a joint UK/French force to deploy rapidly for high-intensity operations, as well as peacekeeping, disaster relief and humanitarian assistance. And there is a case for revisiting the 1998 St Malo agreement on European defence co-operation. This provides for European autonomy of the kind that Macron wants, and for the increased role in burden sharing that successive US presidents have been demanding. It also offers the basis for a new post-Brexit UK-EU security relationship.Second, the UK should take up the EU’s offer of a new framework for our relations on foreign policy and defence, which we turned down during the Brexit negotiations. The integrated review claims we can be more nimble now the UK is no longer in the EU. But the truth is we are also easier to ignore.Existing mechanisms for co-operation between the EU and other states would not suit us. We need a specially tailored set of arrangements that provide for regular meetings at ministerial and official level to co-ordinate policy and convene emergency meetings when faced by a crisis. We need to be able to take joint and co-ordinated action with our European allies when we deal with crises in Hong Kong, or over the Uyghurs, or Taiwan, or the Sahel or the threat to Ukraine. Such a relationship would not impinge on our sovereignty or autonomy. Europe and the UK are better able to deal with these threats when we are united than when we are divided.Any British government of the past 40 years would be considering these ideas now and developing a plan. But the current government appears not to be doing so. Instead it is escalating the tension across the Channel. The UK will be paying the costs for many years to come.So let’s put down the megaphone, pick up the telephone and start building a new relationship with Europe that can be the basis of a strong Global Britain. If this government doesn’t do so, the next one will have to.
283  General Mark Milley, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, warned America’s adversaries not to assume that the country was weak or unwilling to take military action to defend its interests in the wake of its withdrawal from Afghanistan.Critics have argued that US rivals interpreted the Afghan exit as a sign of weakness and lack of appetite for conflict after two decades of war. That debate has continued as Russia has deployed about 100,000 troops on the border with Ukraine.Asked if Russia’s president Vladimir Putin might be preparing for an invasion, Milley declined to single out Russia, but he warned adversaries not to be complacent and make faulty assumptions about US resolve.“It would be a mistake for any country to draw a broad strategic conclusion based on the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and then take that event and automatically apply it to other situations,” said Milley during a flight from Seoul to Washington. “The United States is a difficult country for other countries to understand sometimes.”Milley’s comments came as tensions soar between the US and Russia over Ukraine. Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, held tense talks with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, on Thursday, a day after he warned that an invasion would trigger “severe” consequences, including “high-impact economic measures”. Russia denies that it has plans to invade.On Ukraine, Milley declined to specify what options the US was considering, but he said, “the full range of diplomatic, economic information and military activities are certainly out there, depending on what and if Russia does something”.“It remains to be seen whether that military activity that we’re seeing on the Russian side of the border is going to turn into something very aggressive,” he added. “We don’t know yet. But it is significant, and it’s real.”Concerns about a Russian invasion spiked in April when the Russian military positioned tens of thousands of troops on Ukraine’s eastern border and in Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014. But Milley said the current build-up, coupled with other developments, suggested that Russia was more serious about military action.“Last time, it turned out to be a series of exercises. One of the most noticeable differences between now and April is the rhetoric,” said Milley. “The public rhetoric coming out of Russia seems to be a little bit more strident than it was before.”Milley said the Pentagon prepared for numerous contingencies but did not provide any details related to Ukraine. He also stressed that diplomacy was going to be the most important channel to resolve the crisis.“The issues that are at stake in Ukraine.can and should be resolved diplomatically in a way that doesn’t lead to violence or armed conflict.”Speaking in Seoul on Thursday after he and Milley had met their South Korean counterparts, US defence secretary Lloyd Austin declined to say if Washington would threaten military retaliation to deter Moscow.“I don’t care to speculate on potential responses. I would just say that we’ll continue to use the best methods to address whatever the situation is that occurs,” Austin said.
284  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.Two significant political events are taking place today and tomorrow: France’s centre-right Les Républicains are selecting their candidate for the presidential election and Europe’s far-right leaders are gathering in Warsaw in yet another attempt to cobble together a grand coalition. We’re looking at the odds of such an alliance and how far-right ideas have seeped into the mainstream’s discourse.In Germany, the FT reports Joachim Nagel (currently with the Bank for International Settlements) has emerged as the favourite to run the Bundesbank, in one of the first major appointments by the country’s incoming government.On the eastern front, the EU and the US co-ordinated their fresh batch of sanctions against the regime in Belarus — with the country’s state airline, sovereign debt and a swath of companies and individuals targeted in this round.In EU litigation news, Poland and Hungary unsurprisingly were told off by the top court’s legal adviser for challenging the bloc’s new sanctions regime on the rule of law. But Warsaw also received an olive branch from the European Commission, which closed one of its countless legal proceedings after Poland rolled back its retirement scheme for top judges.The commission also closed its legal case against Germany after receiving sufficient assurances about the supremacy of EU law put into question by a ruling of the country’s constitutional court.Good news also on the trade talks front — we’ll explore what the latest is on the EU-Australia negotiations put on ice earlier this autumn.In Covid-19 news, the Belgian government is likely to announce new measures today seeking to limit social contacts, after Germany also went that way and has paved the way for mandatory vaccination as of February.The president of the EU commission has recently called for a bloc-wide discussion on vaccine mandates. What is your take on mandatory inoculation? Click here to take the poll.Poland will today be the scene of a fresh attempt by a menagerie of far-right parties to reinforce their political weight, write Sam Fleming and Henry Foy in Brussels. They will have to bury a lengthy history of failed attempts at marriage, however, if the parties are to have any chance of formally joining forces.The far-right has gained clout in many parts of Europe in recent years. Countries including Poland and Hungary are run by conservative-nationalist parties, and in France serious challenges to Emmanuel Macron in next year’s presidential election come from hard-right candidates including Marine Le Pen.Yesterday’s narrow victory of Éric Ciotti in the first round of the conservative Les Républicains’ primary vote carried further evidence of the rightward lurch in parts of the French electorate, although Valérie Pécresse, a more mainstream candidate, is likely to muster the most support in the second round as losing candidates lend her their backing.The voting comes as the French elections are disrupted by the arrival of anti-immigration polemicist Éric Zemmour as an additional force pushing politicians to the right.Ahead of the meetings in Warsaw, Le Pen said a goal of the event was to seek a rapprochement between the two far-right groupings in the European parliament — namely the Identity and Democracy (ID) group, which includes her party, and the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), which is dominated by Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party.The departure of Viktor Orban’s Fidesz from the centre-right EPP Group in the parliament this spring has only added to speculation that a broader rightwing bloc could be in the works.However, privately, participants in the events in Warsaw do not put high odds on any grand coalitions taking shape. The meetings are likely to yield bombastic statements and rhetoric in favour of traditional, conservative, Christian family values, but areas of common ground in terms of actual policy are far too poisoned by mutual enmity for the parties to suddenly jump into bed together.Poland’s anti-Russian Law and Justice party, for example, is deeply suspicious of the pro-Putin sympathies held by parties such as Fidesz and Le Pen herself. ECR and ID are respectively home to rival national parties, such as Italy’s League and the Brothers of Italy or Right Answer and Party for Freedom from the Netherlands.“Fortunately or unfortunately, they won’t create anything new,” said one EU official. “It is about political declarations, not alliances.”“[Law and Justice leader Jaroslaw] Kaczynski is not popular in Hungary,” he added. “Le Pen is not popular anywhere.”A previous attempt to forge an alliance from rightwing MEPs who typically stand on platforms of disliking others fell apart when one Italian member — a granddaughter of former fascist dictator Benito Mussolini — labelled Romanians “habitual lawbreakers”, prompting her Romanian colleagues to, unsurprisingly, quit the group.Cas Mudde, professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia, said far-right leaders often have little experience with compromising, either inside their party or with other parties, making it hard to create a meaningful and stable transnational federation. Historical disputes or prejudices between countries can make matters even more difficult.“In the end, this is yet another attempt which will ultimately fail,” he predicted.Bond markets are flashing a warning signal over the outlook for global growth as a combination of inflation fears and the spread of the Omicron coronavirus strain sparks a shift in investor expectations. (More here)EU’s trade talks with Australia, suspended abruptly in September over the so-called Aukus defence deal that left France blindsided, are likely to restart in February, officials briefed on the matter told Andy Bounds in Brussels.Paris had demanded that free trade agreement negotiations be put on ice after Canberra scrapped a French submarine purchase agreement to buy Anglo-American ones.Now trade commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis feels brave enough to raise his periscope, if not to fully surface.His officials recently informed member states that the talks would restart in February. “It wasn’t on the agenda but introduced as ‘any other business’. It was about a minute and then the meeting ended so there was no time for anyone to intervene,” said one diplomat present.Paris has not yet blocked the move and may be inclined to turn a blind eye given that a deal will not be concluded until after the French EU presidency in the first half of next year.Where talks are more advanced, France is still raising objections to the final agreement of a deal with Chile, and slowing negotiations with New Zealand.Diplomats say Emmanuel Macron does not want talk of cheap chicken and beef imports ruffling feathers among French farmers ahead of presidential elections in April.
285  On June 24 1921, the British public was presented with extraordinary news. Prime minister David Lloyd George had invited Éamon de Valera, the leader of Sinn Féin, to meet him for talks in London with the object of ending the war in Ireland. Up to then, imminent and overwhelming use of military force to settle the Irish question had been widely expected. Now the leader of rebels in open war with Britain, a man described by the chief secretary for Ireland as “[belonging] to a race of treacherous murderers”, was coming to parley in Downing Street. As Winston Churchill later wrote: “No British Government in modern times has ever appeared to make so sudden and complete reversal of policy.”The events that followed Lloyd George’s invitation would resonate for a century. A year later Ireland was plunged into civil war. The partition of Ireland, consolidated by the Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 6 1921, created a longing for a united Ireland that contributed to the Troubles and has underpinned Irish republican activism ever since. Today, the border that runs through Ireland has been disinterred as an external EU frontier, and the spectre of customs posts returning to reverse the gains of the Good Friday Agreement haunts the ongoing Brexit protocol negotiations.I was immersed in the dramatic events of 1921 as part of my research for a novel when Ireland suddenly went into pandemic lockdown. Libraries, bookshops and universities shut their doors; my preferred sources were blocked. Shortly afterwards, I went to a shelf of books that had once belonged to my father, a row of venerable spines I had been staring at for decades but never really seen. Soon I realised that these old memoirs and biographies, many annotated in the 1960s and early 1970s, had probably been read back then by Dad as the 50th anniversary of Ireland’s independence had approached.Like many of my generation, I had been brought up with only the bare bones of modern Irish history, served with partisan seasoning. My family from Waterford in the south-east was strongly anti-de Valera, their opinions formed not only by his activities in 1921 but also because my grandfather’s livestock exporting business had been devastated by the tariffs that had arisen in the 1930s from de Valera’s “economic war” with Britain. Families all over Ireland had taken opposing sides from the time of the treaty. But as I read, I was riveted not only by the many twists and turns in the drama but by the fascinating personalities of those involved.Lloyd George had in de Valera someone not directly associated in British minds with shooting British officers. The Irishman, whose death sentence for his part in the 1916 Easter Rising had been commuted, had subsequently escaped from Lincoln prison and in May 1919 gone incognito to America where he had remained until the end of 1920. The Liberal prime minister needed cover to appease the Conservative party on whose support his coalition government increasingly relied. De Valera, already with the aura of power about him, provided that cover in a way that an infamous figure such as Michael Collins could not.Nor, it seemed, would the English electorate now tolerate an earth-razing campaign of the kind needed to subdue Ireland, advocated by those like Sir Henry Wilson, the intransigent chief of the British Imperial General Staff. “Unless we crush the [Irish] murder gangs this summer we.lose Ireland and the empire,” he noted even as reprisals by the Black and Tans were being greeted with dismay in parts of the British press and by the clergy.De Valera had already been in receipt of overtures made on Lloyd George’s behalf by General Jan Smuts, prime minister of South Africa. Following further contacts through back channels and a conciliatory speech by King George V at the inauguration in Belfast of the Northern Parliament in June, a truce was called. Prominent Sinn Féin members, including Arthur Griffith, already frail at 50 years of age, were released from prisons, and talks began in London on July 14.Negotiating with de Valera, a man of labyrinthine disposition, was, Lloyd George complained, like trying “to pick up mercury with a fork”. (“Why doesn’t he use a spoon?” de Valera is said to have responded.) Both men irritated each other. The prime minister, who addressed the Irishman as “Mr de Valer-era”, was inclined to make asides in Welsh to his secretary, Tom Jones, to which Dev (his name to most of Ireland) responded by speaking Irish with his own delegation.Although these talks settled nothing, they established a platform for going forward in an atmosphere that, for the moment, was a hopeful alternative to the resumption of war. After a summer of false starts and diplomatic hedge-hopping, de Valera promptly accepted Lloyd George’s September 29 invitation to a conference in London in October to settle the issue. Preparations in Dublin and in London began.Ireland’s goal was to be recognised by Britain as a sovereign, independent island state, and for Britain to renounce all claims over Ireland. De Valera proposed a form of external association with the British empire. Britain, however, was resolved to grant only a limited form of home rule to 26 of Ireland’s 32 counties, and dominion status within the empire, but no autonomy when it came to defence or matters fiscal.Overshadowing all was Northern Ireland, already established under the Government of Ireland Act 1920 as a separate parliament with limited autonomy and a defined land border. The act had envisaged parliaments north and south, both answerable to a crown-appointed viceroy, and nominating delegates to a “Council of Ireland”. But, by 1921, the south, with its own Dáil, or parliament, albeit proscribed, wanted nothing to do with such a British-centric proposal.Some hope remained for a united Ireland. Substantial Catholic minorities were “trapped” in Northern Ireland’s border counties. The Irish would be given reason to believe that Britain, through a Boundary Commission, could force a redrawing of Northern Ireland’s border to bring in these Catholics under a southern parliament. In such circumstances, the logic went, the subsequent much-reduced size of Northern Ireland would make the statelet unviable and force her into unity with her larger southern neighbour.The picking of Irish delegates rested with de Valera. Dev, ever enigmatic, announced he would not go to London. Collins, the Dáil’s minister for finance, at 31 already a national hero, pleaded with him to change his mind. De Valera was adamant. His reasons have been the subject of extensive analysis from that time forward, for within his crucial decision lay the seeds of the tragic outcome that would eventually unfold. His closest allies, out-and-out Republicans such as Cathal Brugha, the incendiary minister for defence, and Austin Stack, minister for home affairs, were fundamentally opposed to dialogue on the basis offered, and were fully prepared to go down fighting, which in Brugha’s case would be a destiny fulfilled.The Irish team was named. Griffith, minister for foreign affairs, and Collins were the backbone. Robert Barton, 40, an ascendancy landlord from County Wicklow, was a staunch de Valera ally and minister for economic affairs. Another Dev ally, George Gavan Duffy, had defended Sir Roger Casement, the Irish nationalist hero prosecuted in 1916 for treason. Eamonn Duggan, a veteran of the 1916 Easter Rising, was appointed liaison officer.Two secretaries were nominated: John Chartres, a civil servant who had Griffith’s confidence, and Erskine Childers, an Englishman, who had not. Childers, Barton’s first cousin, was a character fiction could not have outdone. Author in 1903 of the bestselling spy thriller, The Riddle of the Sands, in 1914, with Molly, his American wife, they had sailed their yacht into Howth, County Dublin, with a consignment of German rifles destined for the Irish Volunteers. Regarded by de Valera as a constitutional genius, Childers was distrusted by Collins and detested by Griffith.On the insistence of de Valera, who had become “a particularist in the niceties of statecraft”, according to one biographer, the Irish delegates were appointed as plenipotentiaries by the Irish Dáil — but again, Dev’s ambivalent hand intruded. At a final cabinet meeting, in a scribbled pencil note to Griffith, he instructed that the plenipotentiaries make no decision without prior sanction of the cabinet, a seeming contradiction of the terms under which the delegates had just been appointed.The main Irish delegation to London, 25 persons including six female secretaries and a cook, sailed in the first week of October. (Collins and his entourage crossed separately some days later.) The conference was set to begin in Downing Street on Tuesday October 11.The British appointees were seasoned politicians and unrepentant Unionists whose distaste for Irish rebels could not be overstated. Compared to the Irishmen, without experience in world affairs, the English side had recently concluded the Treaty of Versailles. Austen Chamberlain, leader of the house, emphatically opposed any autonomy for Ireland. Winston Churchill, secretary of state for the colonies, was the dogged son of Lord Randolph Churchill, a legendary champion of Ulster. The secretary of state for Ireland, Hamar Greenwood, a shameless apologist for the Black and Tans, was someone Collins had sworn never to shake hands with. The Earl of Birkenhead, in 1916, as attorney-general had successfully procured the death sentence for Sir Roger Casement.Little was known in London of the Irishmen, which had led Birkenhead to privately commission résumés. The resulting dossier summarily relegated the lesser players: “Duggan (Catholic) .completely under the influence of Collins; recognises that he is not one of the strong men.Barton (Protestant) .educated at Rugby and Christchurch;.a substantial farmer; has no outstanding quality.Gavan Duffy (Catholic) .vain and self-sufficient, likes to hear himself talk.”Then the two remaining Irishmen: “Arthur Griffith (Catholic) .will start somewhere about AD1100 and argue up to the sovereign independent right of every nation.usually silent.is more clever than de Valera, but not so attractive; is the real power in Sinn Féin. Michael Collins (Catholic). “Minister of Finance” [sic].full of physical energy; quick thinker, a Cork man, therefore impetuous and rather excitable; the strongest personality of the party.’The dossier concluded: “All the delegates will be very nervous and ill at ease.In overcoming their nervousness they may be a bit rude and extravagant in speech.”At the opening session Lloyd George placed the delegates on opposite sides of the conference table before introducing them. Collins’ ability to quickly sum up men is evident from the notes of his first impressions: he disliked Lloyd George, distrusted Churchill and loathed Greenwood. Of Birkenhead: “Concise. Clearness of ideas.A good man.” Later, he wrote: “I prefer Birkenhead to anyone else.”Over the remaining weeks, the English in essence negotiated with Griffith and Collins as the other Irish delegates were pushed out into sub-conferences. Progress was slow. After work, Collins usually withdrew to his separate quarters in Cadogan Gardens, provided to him by Lady Hazel Lavery, while Griffith went to the theatre or played chess in his delegation’s rented quarters in Hans Place. Disaster was narrowly averted following the uninvited intervention of Pope Benedict XV, whose message of goodwill for the talks to King George V elicited a response from the sovereign which seemed to confirm Ireland as a de facto member of the imperial family.Now the Conservative party conference loomed and Lloyd George, closeted with Griffith, pleaded with the Irishman not to allow the talks to break down over Ulster, the core Unionist issue, for fear the Conservatives would bring down his government. The prime minister hinted at a Boundary Commission; Griffith privately promised to forbear.On December 3, the Irish delegates were back in Dublin with a bleak draft for cabinet. Ireland was to be granted no more than dominion status; Northern Ireland’s established position would remain unchanged; some concessions on defence could be expected. Brugha, combustible to an alarming degree, accused Griffith and Collins of betraying the core Irish position. The bitter split in Sinn Féin was now clear. The draft proposals were rejected and the delegates, divided among themselves, returned in gloom that night to London.On December 4, discussions resumed and Irish counterproposals were presented. The Irish suggestion of external association with the empire was once again rejected. Again and again Griffith insisted he would accept association with the crown only on conditions of Irish unity, notwithstanding the confirmed status of Northern Ireland as a separate legislative entity. All the emphasis was on the political with scant attention paid to financial or economic details. A clause that transferred part of the UK’s national debt to the Irish state-in-waiting went undisputed, with economic implications that would lie unattended until 1925.On December 5 one last attempt began. In Ireland, rosary vigils for peace were being held as two armies faced each other under an increasingly uneasy truce. Griffith, to the surprise of his colleagues, was reminded by Lloyd George of his promise not to break on the question of Ulster; Griffith hotly confirmed his promise, made albeit in a different context. Birkenhead’s legal skills were then called on to provide a form of words in the oath to the sovereign acceptable to both sides. After much discussion on defence, Churchill yielded that the new Irish state be permitted to construct naval vessels to protect revenue and fisheries.Griffith then agreed Ulster be excluded from further discussion provided a government-appointed Boundary Commission be established. The British agreed.In a final bid, Lloyd George offered fiscal autonomy but the Irish still demurred. At that point, the prime minister’s tone changed. The British Army garrisoned in Ireland was on high alert, he said with force. The alternative to agreement that night was “immediate and terrible war”. The chastened Irish left Downing Street having agreed to return by 10pm with a final decision.“I have never,” wrote Churchill of Collins, “seen so much pain and suffering in restraint.”Shortly afterwards, Collins announced to his colleagues that he would support Griffith. Duggan indicated likewise. For hours Griffith and Collins entreated Barton to sign. Barton eventually agreed; Gavan Duffy followed Barton’s example. At 11pm the exhausted delegates returned to Downing Street where a sombre British side awaited. The Irish announced that they would sign the treaty creating the Irish Free State.As the Downing Street typewriters clattered out the final draft, Birkenhead would recall how the reserve between the two sides collapsed and how they “laughed and jested until copies of the treaty were brought in for signature”.“I may have signed my political death warrant tonight,” Birkenhead remarked to Collins, who replied: “I may have signed my actual death warrant.” Seven months later, Ireland was ravaged by civil war fought between pro-treaty and anti-treaty forces. On August 22 1922, Collins was ambushed and shot dead less than 20 miles from his birthplace in County Cork.Ninety-nine years later, in June 2020, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, the political descendants of the respective Irish civil war belligerents, along with the Green party, entered government in Ireland together for the first time, something my grandfather would never have thought possible.‘Freedom is a Land I Cannot See’, a novel by Peter Cunningham, is published by Sandstone Press
286  Overall, prices rose 9.2 per cent across 55 countries in the 12 months to the end of June, according to research from Knight Frank, a property agent. The developed world led the way with a 12 per cent gain, well ahead of the 4.7 per cent increase in developing countries.The price surge is a result of the gush of cheap money that central banks released into the markets as their co-ordinated contribution to helping the global economy avoid disaster during the Covid-19 outbreak. The funds helped to reassure investors that asset prices would be stabilised in the face of the pandemic’s economic shocks.However, as the charts show, the advances largely bypassed London and New York, and other leading global cities, such as Tokyo, Hong Kong and Paris, where prices marked time, albeit at historically high levels. Instead, the increases were posted in centres where investors saw catch-up opportunities: San Francisco, Los Angeles and Toronto, for example, and Shanghai, Seoul and Moscow.In some cases, expatriates have been buying property in their home countries, often out of concern that, in a post-pandemic world, it might be harder to move around the globe. Alongside them are domestic and international investors, including many wealthy families, who have been encouraged by ultra-low interest rates to add to their property portfolios.How much more can prices surge? There are signs that the extended price appreciation in property and financial assets could now be accompanied by more general price inflation, triggered by the post-pandemic economic recovery and the re-emergence of shortages of everything from microchips to lorry drivers.Central bankers initially insisted that the price surges were transitory. Now, though, they seem to be less sure about that. The spike in energy prices has uncomfortable echoes of the 1970s, when an oil supply shock helped trigger years of persistent inflation. Meanwhile, labour shortages are fuelling wage hikes, which tend to spiral as companies compete with each other for staff.All this generates pressure on central banks to raise rates from the ultra-low levels of much of the past decade. Other things being equal — which admittedly they rarely are — that will weaken the property price surge. As Knight Frank says: “Despite strong price growth, there are signs of softening demand in some markets.”What happens next depends on what kind of interest rate hikes come. Financial traders are betting on step-by-step increases, which are least likely to upset confidence. And that is what central banks are likely to aim for. Having spent years assiduously bolstering economic growth with near-zero rates, they are not likely to change gear suddenly, if they can avoid it.But the risk exists that central banks might be forced to take unexpectedly drastic action, especially if they are shown to have delayed too long in their response.Still, it seems clear that, whatever the gyrations of the markets, most of us seem to have an innate fondness for real assets, starting with owning a place we can call home.For the rich, the attraction of property is particularly compelling. The wealthy put about a third of their assets into property, a figure that rises to nearly half in Asia, wealth managers say. They like to have homes in the leading cities, seaside resorts and ski villages. They buy apartments close to prestigious private hospitals and top-class schools and universities.Shifts in interest rates may influence the timing of such purchases and the prices paid, but the basic allure remains undimmed.
287  UK ministers have rejected Washington’s linking of the lifting of metal tariffs with a dispute over post-Brexit trading rules in Northern Ireland, describing it as a ‘false narrative’.The Financial Times reported on Wednesday that the US was delaying a deal to remove Trump-era tariffs on steel and aluminium because of concerns that Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, is preparing to unilaterally suspend parts of the UK-EU trade deal. The US agreed to lift the tariffs on EU steel and aluminium in October.Penny Mordaunt, UK trade minister, told the House of Commons on Thursday that the Johnson government did not accept such a link. “It might be true in terms of how some people in the United States feel, but it is a false narrative. These are two entirely separate issues,” she said.Johnson’s spokesperson added he was “not aware” of the US administration linking the two issues. “We are working closely with the Biden administration,” he said, adding that Washington was looking to “de-escalate the issue”.Anne-Marie Trevelyan, UK international trade secretary, will travel to the US on Monday for a three-day visit to New York and Washington. One Whitehall official confirmed the tariffs would be “one of the issues she will raise” in meetings, including with commerce secretary Gina Raimondo.Trevelyan told MPs she remained hopeful of striking a broad UK-US trade pact. “We have always been clear that a good deal is better than a quick deal and we are here when the US are ready to continue those discussions.”UK steelmakers warned that unless there was a deal on the Trump-era tariffs within days they would lose further sales to EU producers, as their tariffs would be lifted on January 1. The two sides should “strain every sinew” to get a deal, UK Steel said in a statement.“Since those tariffs came in, our exports to the US have declined from 350,000 tonnes in 2018 to 200,000 tonnes in 2020,” it said. “While many of our US customers have stood by us, it is imperative that all parties work together to come to an agreement that provides the UK with the same tariff-free quotas the EU has already secured.”Johnson is facing pressure from Washington, Brussels and Paris not to trigger Article 16, the safeguarding clause of the Northern Ireland protocol that overrides part of the UK’s exit from the EU. British ministers have suggested this is now unlikely to happen before Christmas.Democratic legislators in Washington have publicly warned that by threatening to trigger Article 16, Britain could destabilise trade relationships and “hard-earned peace”.The UK prime minister argues that the protocol needs to be changed to safeguard the peace process. Unionists complain that increased border checks on trade from Great Britain to Northern Ireland has put strains on the union.Emmanuel Macron, president of France, said this week that the NI protocol was “an existential question” for the EU and was a matter of “war and peace for Ireland”.Downing Street on Thursday responded: “When it comes to the protocol it’s vital we use measured and appropriate language given the sensitivities involved.”Negotiations between UK Brexit minister Lord David Frost and Maros Sefcovic, the EU’s Brexit commissioner, will continue on Friday. The Commission said that despite a lack of progress over the last six weeks, it would keep talking.“We continue to work intensively with the UK to find joint solutions to tackle the practical problems people are facing in Northern Ireland. We are working around the clock,” a commission spokesperson said. “I am not going to create new deadlines.”Many EU member states remain prepared for Frost to trigger Article 16 after Christmas. “We will be back to the threats in January. I don’t think the US pressure will make a difference,” said one EU diplomat.
288  France has told the UK that it needs to take responsibility for solving the crisis of thousands of migrants seeking to reach England from France in small boats by making it harder for people to find illegal work and by providing a “pathway for legal migration”.The proposals, made a week after 27 migrants died when their small boat collapsed in the Channel, were contained in a letter sent to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson from French PM Jean Castex on Wednesday night.“A large part of the solution lies not in France but the UK,” Castex wrote. “Indeed only you can dissuade the migrants who shouldn’t be settling in the UK from going there by running a more effective policy of returning them home.“Only you can weaken criminal people-smuggling networks by opening paths to legal immigration to those who have legitimate reasons for going to your country. Only you can ensure that your labour market is sufficiently regulated to discourage those who try to work illegally.”However, Castex’s letter also struck a constructive note after weeks of cross-Channel tensions over the migration issue and spoke of “the basis for a possible new framework for co-operation between the EU and UK”.He said both sides should look at “strengthening migration co-operation between the EU and UK” and that “could include a mechanism of virtuous transfers between the United Kingdom and the European Union”.France and the UK, their relations already soured in the aftermath of Brexit by disputes over trade, fishing and the status of Northern Ireland, have been arguing about where to lay the blame for the accident and for the rising numbers of people, many from the Middle East and Afghanistan, taking to small boats in an attempt to reach England.At least 26,611 people have completed clandestine crossings in small boats to the UK this year up to November 25, more than three times the total for the whole of 2020. The method has become the main means of clandestine migration to the UK after stepped-up security and reduced traffic flows made it far harder for would-be migrants to hide in trucks or under trains.Emmanuel Macron, president of France, was particularly angry about the way Johnson sent him a letter last week about proposed solutions and then publicised its contents before he had time to read it. Asking a subordinate of Macron’s, in the form of the French prime minister, to send his reply will be seen as a calculated snub.Johnson laid the responsibility for the dangerous Channel crossings at the door of the French, calling for French and British maritime patrols to be stationed in each other’s territorial waters. He also asked that migrants who reach the English coast to be returned to France.French ministers have rejected those ideas and suggested instead that the UK send protection officers to France who could examine the asylum demands of those seeking to reach Britain and so deter them from taking to small boats.The UK has opposed the idea of examining asylum claims on French territory, arguing that such a centre would serve only to encourage would-be refugees to travel to France, possibly via routes such as Mediterranean crossings that are almost as dangerous as Channel crossings.A senior French official on Thursday said: “The very great majority of these migrants want to go to the UK, and without a part of the solution dealing with legal migration, asylum and family reunion, we won’t solve the problem.”Additional reporting by Domitille Alain
289  Belarus’s state airline, sovereign debt and a swath of companies and individuals were hit by sanctions on Thursday as part of a co-ordinated western response to Minsk’s orchestration of a migrant crisis on its border with the EU.Brussels said it would sanction the airline, Belavia, for having “helped incite and organise illegal border crossings through Belarus to the EU”. Officials said the bloc was prepared to go further if autocratic president Alexander Lukashenko did not stop the flow of people to its borders.The US Treasury said it would prohibit transactions involving new issues of Belarusian sovereign debt in the primary and secondary markets, as well as adding 20 Belarusian individuals — including Lukashenko’s second son Dzmitry — and 12 entities to its sanctions list.Meanwhile, the UK announced sanctions on eight individuals and said it would impose an asset freeze on Belaruskali, a state-owned potash producer that is one of the main sources of foreign currency for Lukashenko’s regime.Minsk’s use of migrants, largely flown in from Middle Eastern countries such as Syria and Iraq, to pressure eastern EU members this summer has grown into a wider European issue, as those crossing the border travel on to western states such as Germany and contribute to rising numbers of people attempting to cross the English Channel into the UK.In a joint statement, the EU, US, UK and Canada demanded that Lukashenko’s regime “immediately and completely halt its orchestrating of irregular migration across its borders with the EU”.“Those, in Belarus or in third countries, who facilitate illegal crossing of the EU’s external borders should know this comes at a substantial cost,” they said.Although the numbers of people trying to enter the EU via Belarus have subsided since the bloc stepped up its pressure on airlines last month, thousands remain stranded in Belarus as eastern Europe’s freezing winter sets in.Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, said the latest round of sanctions were a response to Belarus’s repression of its people, undermining of security in Europe, and “abuse” of “people seeking only to live in freedom”.“The migrant crisis is only the latest example of the [Lukashenko] regime’s repressive brutality and blatant disregard for international norms,” he said.“It is unjustly detaining nearly 900 political prisoners, with some languishing in prison on fabricated charges for more than a year, while others are serving lengthy prison sentences for exercising their fundamental freedoms.”The US sanctions on Belarusian state debt follow similar moves in June by the EU, the UK, Canada and Switzerland.Josep Borrell, head of the EU’s foreign policy arm, said Thursday’s sanctions were “another example of our determination to act when human rights are violated”.As well as Belavia, the EU sanctions also included Syrian airline Cham Wings, Belarus’s state tourist agency, Tsentrkurort, two Minsk hotels and various border guard officials.The US sanctions also targeted Tsentrkurort, as well as defence and security companies and the potash sector, and identified three aircraft as blocked property.Belarus’s foreign ministry hit out at the EU sanctions, saying that it would respond with “tough, asymmetric, but adequate measures”.
290  Joachim Nagel, a top executive at the Bank for International Settlements, has moved into pole position to head Germany’s central bank in one of the first major appointments by the country’s incoming coalition government, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.Nagel, 55, who spent most of his career at the Bundesbank before joining the BIS as deputy head of the banking unit last year, has emerged as the preferred candidate to succeed Jens Weidmann, who announced last month that he would step down as president at the end of the year.Other contenders for the role included Isabel Schnabel, a member of the ECB executive board, and Jörg Kukies, a state secretary in the finance ministry, but they are no longer in the running, people with knowledge of the discussions said. A decision has yet to be finalised however, they cautioned.Nagel’s views on monetary policy are little known, as most of his 17-year career at the German central bank was spent supervising capital markets.Weidmann’s replacement is one of the first big decisions for Olaf Scholz, who is set to replace Angela Merkel as chancellor next week after his Social Democrat party won general elections in September. Scholz has formed a coalition with the Greens and the liberal party to govern.The appointment comes at a tense time for the Bundesbank, where officials have grown worried by the surge in eurozone inflation to a record high of 4.9 per cent last month — well above the European Central Bank’s 2 per cent target.A person familiar with the talks said Scholz was leaning towards Nagel partly out of a desire to install a central banker rather than an academic at the helm of the Bundesbank to maintain the stature and influence of the institution.The Bundesbank has traditionally been uncomfortable with the ECB buying vast amounts of bonds, fearing it will stoke runaway inflation, encourage asset price bubbles and reduce fiscal discipline by lowering borrowing costs for profligate governments.Inflation has risen even faster in Germany, where it recently hit a three-decade high of 6 per cent, causing growing political angst. “We should not be aiming for high inflation like we have today,” Scholz told Bild TV this week, adding that if it did not fall as fast as expected “we have to do something”.Weidmann will depart soon after the ECB governing council meeting on December 16 that will discuss plans to start winding down its flagship response to the coronavirus crisis — the €1.85tn Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme.Nagel, who studied economics at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, was a consultant to the Social Democrat party in the 1990s before moving to the US as a researcher and then joining the Bundesbank in 1999, where he was head of markets and later a board member responsible for international relations and IT.After leaving the Bundesbank in 2016, he joined the executive board of KfW, the German state-owned development and investment bank. Just over a year ago he joined the BIS senior management team.While his experience is stronger on the financial supervision and markets side of central banking than the monetary policy side, Nagel built support by talking to all three political parties that agreed to form the next government — including the Greens and the liberal Free Democratic party.Schnabel’s appointment would have left Scholz with the difficult task of finding another woman to replace her at the ECB, while Kukies is now expected to have an important role in the chancellor-elect’s team.
291  Eric Ciotti, the most rightwing of the would-be French presidential candidates for Les Républicains, and Valérie Pécresse, president of the Ile-de-France region around Paris, will vie for the conservative party’s nomination after winning the first round of the primary vote.Pécresse, competing to become the first woman president of France, is now the favourite to secure the party’s nomination in the second round of voting at the weekend, having won pledges of support from the three losing candidates.Although the vote was close, LR members made a surprise choice in voting out two of the five candidates considered to be the favourites — Michel Barnier, the EU’s former Brexit negotiator, and Xavier Bertrand, the combative leader of the Hauts-de-France region. Bertrand was rated in recent national opinion polls as having the best chance of beating the incumbent Emmanuel Macron in next April’s presidential election.LR leader Christian Jacob said on Thursday that Ciotti had secured 25.6 per cent of the votes cast, just ahead of Pécresse with 25 per cent, Barnier with 23.9 per cent, Bertrand with 22.4 per cent and Philippe Juvin with only 3.1 per cent.Pécresse, 54, was minister of higher education and for the budget in Nicolas Sarkozy’s government. She is seen as moderate within the LR and presents herself as an environmentalist and a feminist as well as a fiscal conservative.All the party’s candidates have shifted sharply to the right in recent months, partly in response to the emergence of the anti-immigration polemicist Eric Zemmour as a popular independent candidate.“The country has never been so much on the right,” Pécresse told the Financial Times earlier this year, arguing that the LR should be able to win power at the national level by building on its presence in local and regional governments across the country. “If the real issue for the right in France today is winning the battle for credibility, we have that in our regions,” she said.For a time, Zemmour overtook Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right Rassemblement National, in the polls as the main challenger to Macron. Most candidates on the right and centre of the political spectrum have competed with each other to call for tougher immigration controls and declare their attachment to law and order.Ciotti, a 56-year-old party veteran and an MP in the Alpes-Maritimes region, confirmed his reputation as the most radical of the five contestants after his victory on Thursday by echoing Zemmour and former US president Donald Trump by declaring that his country was “on the road to demotion and decline”. Zemmour, who officially launched his own candidacy on Tuesday and has attracted plaudits from LR supporters, congratulated Ciotti on Twitter. “Dear Eric, happy to see our ideas so widely shared by LR members,” he wrote. Le Pen said the vote showed how divided the LR was, even if “the harder line on immigration within the party has won”.Les Républicains members will choose between Ciotti and Pécresse in a vote that starts on Friday and the winner of the primary will be declared on Saturday.Additional reporting by Leila Abboud in Paris
292  The US and Russia traded threats of “serious consequences” should either side escalate tensions on the Ukrainian border following weeks of rising concerns in the west that a Russian build-up of military activity could spill over into war.Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, met his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on Thursday for the first time since Washington warned its allies that the Russian troop surge suggested Moscow was preparing another invasion of Ukraine. Moscow has said it has no plans to attack and was “a threat to no one.”Russia seized the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 after a western-backed revolution in Kyiv and has since supported a separatist war in the country’s eastern region of Donbas by providing weapons and equipment to separatists, according to western officials. Moscow has denied involvement in the Donbas conflict, which has claimed more than 14,000 lives.The US warning of more Russian aggression against Ukraine has become a flashpoint in strained relations between Moscow and Washington.At closed-door talks in Stockholm, Blinken said that if Russia “decides to pursue confrontation, there will be serious consequences,” reiterating that Washington had “deep concerns about Russia’s plan for renewed aggression against Ukraine.”In response, Lavrov warned that Moscow would respond with “retaliatory measures to redress the military-strategic balance” if western military support for Ukraine continued to rise.“Ignoring Russia’s legitimate concerns and dragging Ukraine into US geopolitical games against the background of the deployment of Nato forces in proximity to our borders will have the most serious consequences,” Lavrov said in a statement after the talks, which took place on the sidelines of a meeting of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe.Russia would offer a plan for a new European security pact to focus on preventing Nato encroachment east, he said.Lavrov said western arms shipments to Ukraine were encouraging Kyiv to escalate in the Donbas.Ukraine tensions have dominated the Stockholm meeting and the bilateral ministerial meetings on its sidelines, with Nato member states seeking to underline their support for Kyiv and the range of potential responses, including possible sanctions, if Russia were to attack.US defence officials have prepared a package of options to provide “lethal aid” to Ukraine, but the Biden administration has yet to make an announcement of additional support. Blinken warned this week that Nato was “prepared to reinforce its defences on the eastern flank”.“The Ukrainians may not win but they can make the Russians fight a land war, and that’s a big deal,” said Daniel Fried, former senior state department official who covered Russia and Ukraine, adding there would likely be significant casualties in such a scenario.At a dinner on Wednesday evening ahead of formal start of the OSCE talks, Blinken and Lavrov exchanged heated remarks over the situation in and around Ukraine as the more than 50 other delegates looked on, according to people briefed on the conversation.Their official meeting on Thursday ended on time after 30 minutes, Bloomberg reported. Blinken described the talks as a candid and direct exchange of views, adding that it was now up to Russia to de-escalate tensions.Blinken met with Dmytro Kuleba, Kyiv’s foreign minister, on Thursday. The US has “a strong, ironclad commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,” he said.Ukraine is seeking a comprehensive deterrence package, Kuleba wrote on Twitter after the meeting, “to demotivate Russia from further aggressive moves.”Russia president Vladimir Putin this week warned the west against crossing Moscow’s “red lines” in Ukraine, saying it would be forced to respond “if Nato continued to expand its infrastructure”, including through the alliance’s potential deployment of its own similar missile systems.Blinken and Lavrov also discussed Iran. “There was a ‘synchronisation of watches’ on the situation around the Iranian nuclear programme,” Lavrov said after the talks.
293  It is a curious axiom of politics in France, where an overwhelming majority of people live in towns and cities, that candidates need to stress how rooted they are in the provinces and how they love the countryside if they are to win national office.So, while French politicians fervently disagree on everything from immigration to economic policy as they start their campaigns for next year’s elections, there is broad consensus that hunting wild animals, including boars and rare birds, is a worthy rural pastime deserving of government support.Even an outcry over hunting accidents — the latest fatality was a 67-year-old man driving on the main road between Nantes and Rennes, who was struck in the neck by a stray rifle bullet — failed to dampen the enthusiasm of most politicians seeking the votes of the nation’s 1m licensed hunters. One of the few to break from the pack is Yannick Jadot, presidential candidate for the French Greens, but the hunting ban he proposes would apply only at weekends and during school holidays — not to preserve animals, in other words, but to save hikers and cyclists.All five of the leading politicians of the conservative Les Républicains party are dismissive of such a ban, which they argue is variously a slippery slope leading to a total prohibition, an assault on “an ancestral tradition”, and an infringement of one of the people’s liberties achieved by the French Revolution, before which hunting was the preserve of the king and the nobility. Xavier Bertrand, the LR president of the northern Hauts-de-France region, has taken particular pains, arguing that hunters are “guarantors of our biodiversity”.Hunters are certainly needed to control exploding populations of wild boar, which routinely damage crops, and roe deer. In the 2019-2020 season, 800,000 wild pigs and more than 600,000 deer were shot. When it comes to wild birds, however, the claim by the hunting lobby that its members are guardians of nature is worse than dubious. France allows more than 60 bird species to be hunted, far more than any other EU state, and the number includes 20 rare ducks and other birds on the endangered species list kept by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.Yves Verilhac, who heads France’s League for the Protection of Birds, says the group has now succeeded in gaining short-term reprieves from the country’s State Council for only three of those 20 — the black-tailed godwit, the European turtle dove and the Eurasian curlew. The Council has already outlawed the traditional practice of using glue traps to catch songbirds, a decision that prompted Willy Schraen, president of the National Federation of Hunters, to complain that “punitive action against the countryside continues”. Claims by hunters, and by the country’s politically powerful farmers, that they are guardians of nature have also been called into question by their hostile reaction to the growing presence of rival, non-human predators. Since the 1990s, wolves that first returned to France across the Alps from Italy have steadily extended their range. All but exterminated in western Europe by a century ago, wolves now number around 600 in France. In mid-November, there was a confirmed sighting of a wolf photographed in a field west of Paris for the first time in living memory.Brown bears are back too, reintroduced in the Pyrenees and agitating both farmers fearing for their sheep and hunters fearing for their lives. Last month, a 70-year-old boar hunter was badly injured by a bear with two cubs. He shot the bear dead, leaving the cubs motherless.It was one more episode in a long-running stand-off between those who condemn what they see as cruel and outdated hunting practices, and those who complain about pro-animal extremists and “green ayatollahs” who do not understand rural life.In France, the hunting lobby has the upper hand. Even Emmanuel Macron, the most urban of presidents, won favour after taking office in 2017 by halving the price of the hunting licence to €200 and offering to restart the abandoned tradition of presidential hunts on the grounds that “they represent French culture”. Such statements are unlikely to hurt his re-election campaign.
294  European antitrust regulators have fined HSBC, Credit Suisse, Barclays and RBS a total of €344m for colluding to rig the global currency market, bringing to an end a long-running investigation.Authorities in Brussels on Thursday levied the penalties on the banks after finding that their foreign-exchange traders had used online chat rooms, including one called Sterling Lads, to share information and sometimes co-ordinate trading strategies.“Foreign exchange spot trading activities are one of the largest financial markets in the world,” said Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner. The collusive behaviour of the banks “undermined the integrity of the financial sector at the expense of the European economy and consumers.”The settlement brings the total amount of fines handed down by Brussels over the scandal to €1.4bn since the investigation began.Authorities imposed a collective fine of €261m on Barclays, RBS and HSBC, a figure reduced because the banks co-operated with the investigation. Credit Suisse was fined €83m, missing out on any reduction because the European Commission said it did not co-operate.However, EU regulators said they did shave 4 per cent of the penalty because the bank “is not held liable for all aspects of the case”. Authorities also settled with UBS, which was spared a €94m fine for first revealing the existence of the cartels.The third and final investigation by regulators found that traders had used the Sterling Lads professional chatroom to share sensitive information and trading plans “and occasionally co-ordinated their trading strategies”.The existence of the chatroom allowed some traders to “stand down”, whereby they would temporarily withdraw from the market to avoid interfering with another trader, the commission said.Authorities settled their first two investigations into the currency market in May 2019 for €1.1bn with fourteen banks. The total fines are smaller than those Brussels levied after its probe into the manipulation of the Libor market.In a statement, RBS parent company NatWest said it was “pleased to have reached the settlement”. UBS said: “We are pleased the matter is resolved.” HSBC, Credit Suisse and Barclays declined to comment.Letter in response to this article:The EU fines the lenders but not the perpetrators / From Mark Lenczner, Tokyo, Japan
295  Germany has tightened curbs on unvaccinated people and paved the way for mandatory Covid-19 vaccinations next year as it ramps up pressure on those refusing the jab.Chancellor Angela Merkel and chancellor-designate Olaf Scholz announced the measures after a hastily scheduled meeting with the leaders of Germany’s 16 states.The country has hit its highest level of Covid infections since the pandemic began, putting unprecedented strain on hospitals.“The fourth wave must be broken,” Merkel told journalists after the meeting. “The situation is very serious. The number of infections has stabilised but at far too high a level.”The leaders decided to hold a vote in the Bundestag on whether to make vaccines mandatory, which would be likely from February. They also issued a decree that will require jabs for workers at care homes and hospitals, similar to rules in Greece, Italy and France.The idea of mandatory vaccines is under growing scrutiny in Europe. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, called this week for discussion of a “common approach” to compulsory jabs. Austria last month said it would make vaccines mandaroy.The German regulations laid out on Thursday will severely curb access to public as well as private activities for those who are unvaccinated, at present about 28 per cent of the population.“We have many who have been vaccinated,” Scholz, who is expected to succeed Merkel as chancellor next week, told journalists. “But ‘many’ is not enough.”Using what is known in Germany as the “2G” rule, soon only the vaccinated and those who have recovered from Covid will be able to go into shops and cultural institutions.Once the rules are implemented, a household of vaccine holdouts will only be able to meet two people from another household.High infection rates could also affect the vaccinated, after the leaders agreed that bars and clubs should be closed in areas with more than 350 cases of coronavirus infection per 100,000 people over seven days. They will also bring in tight curbs on private parties in these places.On Thursday, the overall seven-day incidence rate across Germany was 439.2, though the exact number varies in each region.European leaders are braced for the effects of the Omicron coronavirus variant, which the EU’s health agency has warned could account for more than half of infections in the bloc within a few months.The agency said that, as of Wednesday, 70 Omicron cases had been reported in 13 EU and European Economic Area countries.It warned that travel restrictions had a limited shelf life and advised countries to continue to prioritise the vaccination of the most vulnerable groups. It also encouraged other measures such as physical distancing and the use of face masks.In Germany, the leaders who met on Thursday announced plans to accelerate the country’s vaccination campaign for both the unvaccinated and those in need of boosters. They vowed to “make vaccination available by Christmas to all who choose” and expected this to require an estimated 30m jabs.
296  After Recep Tayyip Erdogan embarked on a robust defence of his pursuit of low interest rates in a speech to Turkey’s ruling party MPs two weeks ago, he was met with rapture from all those present — except one.His finance minister, Lutfi Elvan, who had made clear his growing discomfort at the president’s idiosyncratic views on the economy, held his hands in his lap as those around him applauded.Elvan’s resignation on Wednesday evening, in the midst of a currency crisis, came as little surprise after weeks of rumours he was on the way out.But analysts said his replacement by an Erdogan loyalist with close links to the president’s son-in-law, the former finance minister Berat Albayrak, underlined the extent to which control of the country’s $795bn economy was now in the hands of one man.“Erdogan is now fully in charge,” said Turgut Kisinbay, an economist at Invesco, the asset manager. “In the past, Erdogan delegated economic policy to ministers, the central bank, institutions and eventually his son-in-law. Finally, I think it’s just him now.”Elvan, a bureaucrat turned politician, was welcomed by Turkey’s business community when he replaced Albayrak as finance minister in late 2020. His predecessor’s tenure, defined by the decision to spend tens of billions of foreign currency reserves in an ultimately futile bid to defend the lira, drew strong criticism from Turkish opposition parties and foreign investors.Though detractors accused Elvan of lacking backbone, business executives and government officials say he privately advocated for fiscal discipline. He also made the case for a more orthodox monetary policy even as Erdogan, an ardent opponent of high interest rates, pushed the central bank to repeatedly lower the cost of borrowing despite inflation running at an annual rate of almost 20 per cent.By contrast, his successor, Nureddin Nebati, last week published a 12-part Twitter thread defending Erdogan’s determination to lower interest rates despite warnings that it could usher in runaway inflation and financial instability. The lira fell as much as 4 per cent following his appointment.As he was sworn in on Thursday, Nebati echoed the president’s narrative by declaring that Turkey was embarking on a mission for economic independence. “Our priority will be investment and employment, not high interest rates,” he said.Emre Peker, an analyst at the Eurasia Group consultancy, said the administration would now be “unequivocally aligned” behind the president’s economic policy, which would “prioritise investments and exports driven by low rates over price stability, despite the cost of a weak lira”.Nebati, who hails from a landowning family in the south-east province of Urfa, with his brothers established a company importing clothing as well as producing its own garments for export.He is known as a conservative and is a member of several religious foundations linked to Erdogan’s Justice and Development party (AKP). In 2013, he proposed closing Turkey’s 56 state-run brothels, a suggestion rejected by the ruling party.One Turkish businessperson who knows him well described Nebati as having “a good heart” and “devoted” to the AKP and to Erdogan.Nebati’s perceived links to Albayrak, who is married to Erdogan’s daughter Esra and who was once viewed as a possible successor as president, has prompted renewed speculation that the leader’s son-in-law continues to wield influence behind the scenes.Several others with ties to Albayrak have been promoted to senior economic positions this year. They include Erisah Arican, his former thesis supervisor who was made de facto head of the country’s wealth fund, Sahap Kavcioglu, the central bank governor, and Mehmet Mus, the trade minister.One senior Turkish banker said Nebati’s appointment, which came just hours after the central bank resumed Albayrak’s contentious policy of currency intervention, may lead to a return to “a more strict defence” of the lira that could reverse a recent improvement in the country’s foreign currency reserves.Others suggested Nebati would use publicly owned banks as a tool to try and soften the impact of rapidly rising inflation and falling living standards by ramping up cheap lending to households and businesses.“The new minister is more likely to use state banks’ balance sheets for defending the Turkish lira and aggressive credit growth,” said Okan Akin, a credit analyst at AllianceBernstein, the asset manager.“However, given the state banks’ profitability is still suffering from the implications of a similar policy in 2020 during minister Albayrak’s tenure, he would need to inject capital to state banks first.”Others said it was largely meaningless who occupied the finance ministry at a time when the only voice that mattered was that of Erdogan’s.“It’s not that relevant who holds the post any more,” said Maya Senussi, a senior economist at Oxford Economics, the consultancy. “They can do little to influence policy.”Additional reporting by Funja Guler in Ankara
297  Hungary and Poland’s legal challenge to the EU’s crackdown on rule of law breaches has suffered a serious setback after a legal opinion recommended their claim should be dismissed.The EU’s advocate general found that the new rule of law conditionality mechanism, which seeks to protect the bloc’s budget from violations by member states, was legally sound and compatible with the EU treaties.The conditionality mechanism was agreed by the EU last year as part of the budget deal that ushered in the bloc’s €800bn recovery fund. Poland and Hungary subsequently launched a legal challenge calling for the rules to be annulled, claiming they were not compatible with the treaty and breached principles of legal certainty.The European Commission’s main concern regarding Poland centres on threats to the independence of the country’s judiciary by the ruling Law and Justice party, the subject of a long-running battle between Brussels and Warsaw.Poland is under pressure from the EU to dismantle a controversial disciplinary chamber for judges that the European Court of Justice has found to be illegal. The Polish constitutional court in October found that parts of EU law were not compatible with the country’s constitution, raising the stakes further.The commission has asked Budapest to provide clarification over “persistent” deficiencies and weaknesses in the country’s procurement rules that have stoked concern over corruption linked to the dispersal of EU funds.Thursday’s recommendation by Manuel Campos Sánchez-Bordona, the advocate general, is not binding on the European Court of Justice, but it is an indication of where the court’s ultimate decision could go. The opinion, if affirmed by the court in the coming weeks, would remove a political roadblock to the commission beginning formal proceedings against either or both Hungary and Poland for jeopardising EU funds because of alleged rule of law violations.That would put in question tens of billions of euros of EU funding to the countries.The advocate general found that the new regulation did not clash with existing sanctions mechanisms under Article 7 of the EU treaty, and that it established a “sufficiently direct link” between rule of law breaches and the implementation of the EU budget.Sebastian Kaleta, Poland’s deputy justice minister, hit back on Thursday, saying the opinion marked “one of the worst days in the history of the EU”, as he insisted that the proposed regulation was “against the treaties”. Assuming the ECJ follows the advocate general’s opinion, this should clear the way for the commission to commence formal proceedings under the conditionality mechanism. Brussels sent letters last month to both Poland and Hungary setting out a detailed list of questions on possible breaches to the rule of law, in an informal step in that direction.Hungarian justice minister Judit Varga said on Facebook: “The opinion ignores the fact that the conditionality regulation suffers from a number of obvious legal errors, each of which already justify its annulment. Its legal basis is incorrect, it circumvents the treaties and it violates the fundamental requirements of the rule of law, in particular the principles of legal certainty and clarity.”Poland’s Kaleta told the Financial Times that the advocate general’s opinion would allow “EU funds to be blocked on the basis of arbitrary and political decisions”.He added: “As Poland we cannot accept that such a mechanism, in fact a political blackmail mechanism, may be used in a family of equal partners. From now on, the rule of equality between member states is dead.”
298  The writer is a former Nato secretary-generalRussia’s recent anti-satellite test is the latest example of Vladimir Putin’s game of brinkmanship, from his troop build-up on the Ukrainian border, to using migration as a political weapon. But the test should also act as a wake-up call to mankind as we risk turning Earth’s celestial neighbourhood into a junk yard. Unless we change course, the opportunities of space to improve our lives on earth could be closed off for generations.When Moscow deliberately destroyed a satellite last month, the blast reportedly created a debris field of at least 1,500 pieces of unguided shrapnel, and potentially many thousands more non-trackable but lethal, smaller fragments. Travelling at speeds of around 7km per second, even a fleck of paint can cause critical damage to infrastructure in space. Astronauts in the International Space Station were forced to take precautionary measures following the Russian test. According to the French, this one test alone has increased by five per cent the risk of a Kessler syndrome — the effect where debris-creating collisions cascade until our orbits are rendered inaccessible. This would literally ground mankind on planet Earth and bring all the economic, environmental and scientific benefits of space to a screeching halt.Just one incident has caused this much damage and risk. The rules governing the use of space by governments and the private sector are no longer fit for an age where space is increasingly congested and contested. While the 1967 Outer Space Treaty bans the stationing of weapons in space, it does not stop Russian satellites snooping on other satellites which are beaming critical data to Nato forces on the ground. Nor does it prevent adversaries from mounting potentially hostile operations against other satellites.Yet in the coming years we intend to saturate space — especially Low Earth Orbit of around 500km-600km — with tens or even hundreds of thousands of satellites, known as mega-constellations. These promise greater global connectivity for both military and civilian use. But just as space opens to those new possibilities, the reckless rush to launch many thousands of objects into orbit is in danger of shutting it down. Until now, most communications satellites have operate in much higher orbits of around 36,000km, each circling the planet in its designated slot, not causing significant risk or interfering with other operators.The major misconception is that space is big enough to sustain all this activity. The opposite is true: the space within our orbits is finite. Every satellite launched increases the risk of collision. Research suggests the debris from a collision of two mega-constellation satellites would be similar to that produced by the Russian missile test. The problem with Kessler syndrome is that we will not know it has begun until it is too late.Space regulators need to dust off their rule books, which date back to a time when satellite companies were launching only a handful of satellites. With larger numbers in orbit, the hazards rise exponentially; but the regulations have not responded to the heightened risk. It is no surprise that space insurers are increasingly raising the alarm on this unsustainable behaviour.Before setting new rules, however, we need to understand what volumes of satellites our orbits can safely sustain. This is exactly what we did with civilian airspace. In an ideal world, the UN or the International Telecommunication Union would set these new rules. Unfortunately, despite the best intentions, consensus on meaningful rules is very unlikely. Nato members and space powers like the US, France and the UK share the same concerns about hostile behaviour in space by Russia and China. But they are also competitors in the commercial space field and would not necessarily welcome new rules.This is where the EU needs to step in. Europe is the only major jurisdiction not to have conducted an anti-satellite test in space and it has leverage over how its national governments grant market access to satellite operators. If European and national regulators were to set clear conditions to lower the risk of collisions, this could influence other key markets like the US. The European Commission should take the lead in providing ready-made criteria for national governments to deploy. Brussels took a similar approach to national security concerns over 5G networks.Space is the new frontier for mankind’s unsustainable behaviour. If we fail to design rules that prevent our orbital activity from becoming self-defeating and destructive, we will soon find we have squandered another of earth’s greatest resources.
299  The leadership of the World Trade Organization could, it seems, teach global supply chains a thing or two about resilience. After Omicron forced member countries to cancel this week’s big ministerial at short notice, director-general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was quick to come out and say that no one was giving up, and to start plans to resume talks. There’s some idea of rescheduling the ministerial for March, though that seems a bit ambitious to us. But in any case, Okonjo-Iweala said she would try to push forward the big issues such as fisheries subsidies and the intellectual property waiver for Covid-19 vaccines through negotiations at ambassador level in Geneva.A WTO deal on domestic services regulation, not huge but symbolically helpful, is also reaching fruition. We’re still highly sceptical about progress with the IP waiver, though there are some more hopeful noises about fisheries. At least they’re going to give it a shot. Today’s main piece looks at what the change of government in Berlin will mean for German and EU trade policy, while Charted waters shows us why the latest surge in Covid cases in Germany is set to feed into supply chain snags.The traffic light era is almost upon us, with the new Social Democrat/Free Democrat/Green coalition about to take power in Germany. On some issues, the parties come from, let’s say, contrasting perspectives — the fiscal sadism of the ordoliberal FDP versus the relative sanity of the SPD. You might predict a similar contradiction in trade between the traditionally free-market FDP and the Greens, who have been given the economy and climate ministry, which runs trade policy. The Greens have been critical of Angela Merkel’s strategy of friendly engagement with China, and they want to load up trade deals with concerns about human rights and the environment.In practice, there might be more coalition unity than that, and more continuity with Merkel. The German Greens in the Bundestag are actually quite pragmatic about relations with business: Mikko Huotari, executive director of the Merics think-tank, points out that they have a record at state level of supporting Germany’s export industry. The big industrial players such as Volkswagen are anyway pretty good at promoting their interests no matter who is in government. In any case, Olaf Scholz’s chancellery will no doubt retain a big say in trade policy.The most interesting part is the overall context. With disillusionment setting in within the German public and businesses about dealing with China, German policy has been drifting towards a mindset sceptical of traditional trade deals that are focused purely on access to export markets.Reinhard Bütikofer, the veteran German MEP and the China hawks’ China hawk, who was part of the Greens’ coalition negotiating team, this week improbably quoted former SPD chancellor Gerhard Schröder, not typically one of his political heroes. Regarding foreign policy, he said, “Wir wollen nicht alles anders, aber vieles besser machen” (“We don’t want everything different, but we want to do a lot better.”). His quote reflects an instinctive respect for consensus, given that the German electorate has placed a coalition government in power for the entire postwar period.Bütikofer argues that an emergent China-sceptic consensus is aligning the German business, human rights and national security communities. One salutary lesson was the fate of the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) which Merkel’s government, doing the German export sector’s bidding, jammed through in the dying days of its EU presidency last year. China’s subsequent move to slam sanctions on parliamentarians across Europe (including Bütikofer, to his evident satisfaction), and even on think-tanks such Merics, meant that CAI was slung into the deep freeze.It’s possible that CAI could get support from Germany and a majority in the European parliament if sanctions were lifted and Beijing did some serious work on rapprochement. The SPD, with its roots in the industrial trade unions, instinctively wants to support German manufacturing. But China’s increasing belligerence and its “dual circulation” strategy, prioritising the domestic economy over exports, suggests CAI could be a pivot point in EU-China relations. “I’ve never advocated decoupling,” Bütikofer said. “On the other hand, we do see some decoupling with Chinese characteristics and we have to deal with that.”More broadly, the grain of EU policy in general, under continual pressure from France, has shifted towards scepticism about the traditional model of trade deals.A case in point is the stalling of the EU-Mercosur trade deal because of EU environmentalist concerns about Brazil burning down the Amazon, a view also conveniently espoused by French cattle farmers threatened by beef imports. Merkel, responding to public opposition, last year prudently expressed “considerable doubts” about the deal and stopped actively pushing for it. The new coalition statement goes further and explicitly demands strong measures against deforestation as a condition of ratifying.Another example: the European Commission has prepared an array of unilateral (sorry, “autonomous”) weapons against foreign skulduggery (not the technical term) including an anti-coercion instrument, new corporate due diligence responsibilities for environmental and human rights standards, and a tool to deter subsidised foreign companies from snaffling government procurement contracts in the EU.Germany has often been cautious about these tools, warning the commission not to put heavy burdens on industry or invite foreign retaliation against exports. Huotari said that, particularly with regard to procurement, “the message to the commission now will be that what you guys are doing is good, and we are not going to put as many blocks in your way as we have in the past”.There are other aspects of German trade policy we’ll examine in future newsletters, particularly carbon border pricing. But our preliminary conclusion is this: it’s not just the swapping of Scholz for Merkel we need to watch for but fundamental movements in the European centre of gravity on China and trade.Regular readers will be aware of our view that much of the mess we’re seeing in supply chains is down to a huge shift in demand, away from services and towards consumer durables. With the world and his grandma using the pandemic as an excuse to stock up on everything from laptops to dumbbells, it’s little wonder the system is under pressure.To get a sense of the scale of the shift — and the degree to which it still matters — we present to you the chart below. It shows that the surge in Covid cases in Germany has triggered a cancellation in restaurant bookings. That will free up even more disposable income to be spent on physical goods in the run-up to Christmas. Claire JonesScoop from Aime Williams and Andy Bounds in Brussels: the US is holding back from settling the dispute on steel and aluminium tariffs with the UK because it says London is threatening Northern Ireland’s Good Friday Agreement.The US Progressive Policy Institute’s trade fact of the week says that Donald Trump’s tariffs probably added about 0.5 per cent to inflation.Chad Bown, from the Peterson Institute, looks systematically at why Trump/Biden trade policy is the way it is.Intel’s chief executive said that, pending US legislation to secure semiconductor supplies, the government should invest more in American companies (Nikkei, $) than in Samsung and TSMC to keep intellectual property from “going back to Asia”. Good news for trade, less so for the planet. Large coal miners in Indonesia swung back to profit (Nikkei, $) in the first nine months of the year, with China, India and neighbouring south-east Asia as the main export destinations.

300  Here at Free Lunch we have finally got through the very long governing platform agreed by Germany’s election winners: the Social Democrats led by chancellor-to-be Olaf Scholz, the Greens and the centre-right liberal Free Democrats.For a detailed list of the many proposed policies, you will have to read the document yourself, or the much shorter but still fulsome extractions in Adam Tooze’s summary. (My personal favourite is the commitment to set aside one-fiftieth of Germany’s land area to wind power!) I want to give my sense of the overall governing philosophy, which I think could be as important as any specific policy decision.The three parties are not straightforward bedfellows, so how they profess to overcome their differences is important. The FDP’s traditional ordoliberalism is in tension with the other two’s embrace of government intervention in the economy. The Greens’ desire for ambitious decarbonisation threatens the interests of the SPD’s working-class voters. And the two smaller parties are much bolder on social and foreign policy than the traditional centre-left has been.The big question, therefore, is whether the “traffic light” coalition is one of lowest common denominators — an unambitious compromise more suited to cobble together the majority to take power than to wield it — or something more ambitious.The hard-headed tendency among commentators has been scepticism and a focus on how incompatible the parties are. But I think this misses something important. The coalition agreement sets out a vision that fundamentally updates the German government’s understanding of the economy. It is best expressed in the sentence: “Our goal is a social-ecological market economy” — that is to say, a transformation of the German (and European) social market economy in the direction of net zero carbon emissions. And, as the rest of the document makes clear enough, in the direction of a fully digitised society.This is not mere rhetoric. It is evident from the governing programme that the parties understand and indeed embrace the deep structural changes this ambition requires. And that means adopting a new view of the state’s role in the economy that breaks with ordoliberalism, with the more general Washington consensus type of economic thinking that has dominated international discussion (including in Europe), and also with old leftwing views of state control.Instead, there is a family resemblance between the new German government’s approach and the economic theory set out by US president Joe Biden’s administration: a progressive supply-side economics. In both Washington and Berlin, smart government interventions in the form of strong investment and active regulation are seen as instruments to make the private sector stronger — not as substitutes for it (as per the old left) or a ball and chain around its ankle (as the traditional right would have it). And there is plenty of just such interventions in the coalition agreement, which suggest to me the parties’ hunger for deep change is much more than rhetorical.The sceptics will, for now, remain sceptical. Many commentators who endorse the turn in policy thinking I have described treat FDP leader Christian Lindner much like they would a tiger promising to change its stripes. They are wary of the man who will become finance minister and at whose behest the coalition programme stands by the much-maligned constitutional debt brake (maligned by those same commentators, that is). Their worry is that Lindner and the FDP will stymie any attempts to make the investment ambitions a reality by blocking both borrowing and higher taxes.Looking at the same facts, I reach the opposite conclusion. The FDP has accepted such a long list of financial manoeuvres that the debt brake begins to resemble a fig leaf more than a constraint. Most important is the decision to transfer the budgeted but unused borrowing allowance for next year (when the brake remains suspended) into a fund that can be drawn down freely in years to come. (I reported on this possible sleight of hand back in June.) It is not a great exaggeration to say this allows the coalition to borrow next year everything they will need for the next four, all within the rules. In addition come promises to boost the financial capacity of state lending institutions and reassess the technical calculations of what the debt brake actually requires.There are other signs of an important shift in policy. Take European economic policy. Even commentators who tend to be harshly critical of German obstructionism in Europe, such as Shahin Vallée and Lucas Guttenberg, have found things to like.Of course, we will have to see how these aspirations fare once the coalition faces the challenges of office and day-to-day politics. But for now, I see three reasons to be optimistic that we are about to see a real change in German policymaking. The first is the groundwork already done to significantly turn round economic policy that I describe above. The second is what the coalition talks and the agreement’s explicit discussion of respect for difference suggest. There is a striking willingness here to see different starting points as an opportunity for “more for more” bargains on the basis of some deeply shared goals of structural change, rather than defensive “less for less” compromises.Finally, the nature of both the green and liberal electoral successes matters. These are parties that win their votes among the young and are therefore committed not just to policies for the future but a politics that is not encumbered by the past — social liberalism is a case in point. But that also helps them free themselves from old left-right divisions. Right after the election, both parties declared their intention to work together and be open to picking a third coalition partner from either the centre-left or the centre-right. And their sister parties elsewhere have shown the wisdom of transcending the old left-right line — from Spain’s decimated Ciudadanos liberals (who refused to do so) to Austria’s Green party (which took power with the conservatives).What is happening in Germany, in other words, may be nothing less than the end of 20th-century politics.
301  Europe’s chemicals industry has warned that EU efforts to tighten the regulation of more than 10,000 substances threaten its future just as it grapples with the pressures to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.The European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic) on Thursday took aim at two measures within a wide-ranging plan to clean up the environment through stricter rules on hazardous chemicals first set out by Brussels in October.Although Europe’s chemical groups insist that they do not object to the ambitions of the plan, they warn that in its current form the EU Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability (CSS) threatens to wipe out €70bn of their revenues.The proposals would target up to 12,000 substances used in everything from paints and detergents to electric-car batteries and semiconductors, forcing chemical companies to develop substitutes or reformulations — a process that can take years.“CSS in its current form puts a big question mark over the future of chemicals in Europe,” Martin Brudermüller, president of Cefic and chief executive of BASF, told the Financial Times. “All additional costs coming in a region like Europe with very low growth rates is my major concern.”The trade body said that as well as knocking 12 per cent off revenues, the planned changes would imperil 40,000 jobs on the continent.Brudermüller urged European policymakers to work more closely with the industry on how to replace or reformulate substances. Funding for research would be needed, he added, while the EU’s ambitions needed to take into account the pressures the industry faces from climate change.“It’s concerning that what we do here is additional cost and bureaucracy,” he said. “We have to talk about the means, prioritisation and timelines.”The EU proposals come as large European chemicals groups are trying to revamp their portfolios on speciality chemicals such as battery materials, hydrogen, pharmaceuticals and personal care.A Commission spokesperson said that the analysis from Cefic would “feed into the consultation process for the regulation, as it considers the concrete policy measures to deliver the objectives of the chemicals strategy.”
302  Guten Morgen and welcome to Europe Express.The political winds of change in Berlin are also bringing about a tougher stance on Covid-19 measures, with incoming chancellor Olaf Scholz speaking in favour of vaccine mandates, after Austria announced plans to make inoculation binding by February. That prompted European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen to flag the need to discuss and co-ordinate potential vaccine mandates across the bloc. I’ll look at Germany’s new man in charge of the vaccine rollout — an army general — and how he fits in this new approach.We’ll also explore why Italy’s manufacturing data for November was at a record high, in stark contrast with Germany, Spain and the Netherlands whose indices were at record lows.After Portugal and Italy’s successes entrusting military commanders with Covid-19 vaccination campaigns, the incoming government in Berlin is also turning to the army’s top brass for the job.Carsten Breuer is a 57-year-old major general who was already co-ordinating the Bundeswehr’s deployments to combat the pandemic, for instance in care homes and hospitals.In pre-Covid times, Breuer co-ordinated the dispatching of soldiers to areas hit by natural disasters. He also served in Afghanistan, Kosovo and had a stint in Brussels at Nato. During Ursula von der Leyen’s term as German defence minister, Breuer was put in charge of crafting the ministry’s strategic plan.His appointment comes at a time when the incoming chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has said he is in favour of introducing vaccine mandates — following Austria’s plan to make inoculation mandatory by February.Scholz is expected to take office next week, ending the two-month transition from outgoing chancellor Angela Merkel — a period of executive vacuum largely blamed for Germany’s slow response to the latest surge in Covid-19 cases in the country.Just 68.4 per cent of Germany’s population is now fully vaccinated, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control — below the 75 per cent minimum that the outgoing government had hoped for.Italy’s full vaccination rate under the leadership of army general Francesco Paolo Figliuolo has reached 84.5 per cent of those above 12 years old.And Portugal, where a navy vice-admiral was put in charge of the vaccination campaign in February, has achieved a vaccination rate of 85.6 per cent. Henrique Gouveia e Melo (we profiled him here) returned to his military duties in October after being celebrated as a hero for achieving one of the highest rates in the world (98 per cent of adults and youngsters eligible for vaccines).Even as both Italy and Portugal have relatively low numbers of people reluctant to take the vaccine compared with other parts of Europe, support in both countries for mandatory vaccination for adults is quite strong, according to a survey published yesterday by Euroconsumers. Spain and Belgium also took part in the poll, which showed that two out of three respondents were in favour of vaccine mandates for adults. Support was less strong when it comes to obligatory vaccination for children.The Omicron variant threatens to intensify imbalances that are slowing growth and raising costs, the OECD said yesterday as it significantly increased its inflation forecasts from three months ago. Monetary policymakers should be “cautious”, the OECD added, saying that the most urgent policy requirement was to accelerate deployment of Covid vaccines globally. (More here)For Italy, 2021 hasn’t only been a record-breaking year for sports: the country’s Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to record high at 62.8 in November, according to data released yesterday, writes Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli in Rome.This compares to weaker readings in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands.“It doesn’t mean the mood is negative in those countries. When the reading is above 50 it’s always positive, it’s just that this time it’s more positive in Italy than elsewhere,” said Marco Taisch, professor of advanced and sustainable manufacturing at the Politecnico di Milano.Businesses have been ordering greater quantities than their current needs, anticipating higher costs in the near future. Taisch also said companies were benefiting from productivity improvements that meant they were able to satisfy a “significant increase in demand”.Another factor which has helped Italian businesses is the government’s management of the pandemic and the vaccination campaign, according to experts. Italy has been able to avoid far-reaching lockdown measures by imposing restrictions only on the unvaccinated. This has limited the impact on businesses.In Austria and the Netherlands the outlook has taken a recent knock as authorities introduced curfews for everyone and limited the opening hours of non-essentials shops.Polls show Italian businesses and workers are widely in favour of existing measures — which include proof of a negative Covid swab or full vaccination to enter the workplace — as a means of sustaining business activity and avoiding damage to the economy.
303  As France’s election season gathers steam, the fishermen from Saint-Brieuc on the north Brittany coast have had a stream of illustrious visitors, including the EU’s former Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.But instead of discussing Brexit and fishing, Barnier and other conservative politicians have focused on a different bugbear: a €2.4bn offshore wind farm project that has sparked such ire among locals that a flotilla took to the sea to protest when underwater construction work started earlier this year.Dubbing it a “failure” and a “disaster”, Barnier, who is also a former environment and agriculture minister, joined a chorus of demands for the project to be stopped.Barnier has been one of five politicians running to be the centre-right candidate in the presidential election in April — in a campaign where wind power has played a surprisingly large role. In the first round of voting on Thursday, he narrowly missed out on making it to a weekend run-off.What would normally be a local dispute has spiralled into a polarising national election issue as France gears up for what could be a tumultuous campaign. Grumblings over the Saint-Brieuc plans have been swept up in a broader backlash against wind farms that is hogging airtime in television debates and has become a rallying cry on the right.Just weeks after the COP26 summit in Glasgow, when governments made bold pledges to reduce their emissions, the growing battle over wind power is becoming a crucial issue for France. Although support for wind power is strong among the French public, concerted opposition has already sharply slowed investment plans — even before the issue became so prominent in national politics.As a result, the government is behind on its targets to produce more electricity from wind at a time when it is pushing hard to decarbonise its economy.The controversy has been particularly acute for offshore wind. A decade after the first projects were announced, the first wind farms will only start operating next year, with Saint-Brieuc now scheduled to come online at the end of 2023.“People are really asking when it will be finished,” says Henri Labbé, the mayor of the nearby port of Erquy, who laments how politicised the project has become. “It really annoys me. First the senators came — they were originally in favour, and now they are against — and departmental politicians came too. [President Nicolas] Sarkozy launched it, [François] Hollande continued it and [Emmanuel] Macron inherited it. If he stops it today, it will cost France a lot.”France’s ageing energy infrastructure and the pressure to reduce its oil and gas consumption over the next decades are forcing the country to completely rethink its power strategy.Europe’s nuclear power champion since the 1960s and a big developer of hydroelectric energy, France has for years lagged unnoticed behind its biggest neighbours in rolling out renewable alternatives such as wind farms and solar plants, though investments are now being ramped up.Like the rest of the EU, France has pledged to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. At the same time, Macron has set a target of cutting the reliance on nuclear energy for its power output to 50 per cent by 2035, from just under 70 per cent now. Though providing France with a low-emission source of energy, the country’s reactors are reaching the end of their planned 40-year lifespan.Attacking green policies has proved fertile ground for politicians on the far right before, especially since the motorists’ gilets jaunes demonstrations that erupted in 2018 when Macron introduced a fuel tax, which he later withdrew.Named after the yellow vests that drivers carry in their cars in case of accidents, the protests morphed into a broader series of grievances against the administration barely 18 months into Macron’s tenure.Partly rooted in the perceived disconnect between Paris and the rural world, that sentiment has found its expression in some of the backlash against wind farms too.“Wind energy has become very symbolic and fits in with existing themes, like rural life and the preservation of the French countryside, which are then politicised,” says Alexandre Roesch of France’s SER renewable energy lobby group.Opposition to wind power is particularly strong and uniform on the far right.Eric Zemmour, a TV talk show polemicist and extreme-right presidential hopeful who launched his campaign this week, has called offshore wind farms a “catastrophe” that would wreck parts of the French coastline spared destruction in the second world war.Marine Le Pen, currently the favourite to make it to an election run-off against Macron, has said she would even take down existing turbines. Two years ago, in an incendiary remark, she managed to combine two contentious political topics — immigrants and wind turbines. “Everyone thinks they should be there, but nobody wants them next door,” she said.But it has also become a big issue among Les Républicains. Politicians such as Xavier Bertrand — who heads the northern Hauts-de-France region — like to compare their provincial roots to the supposedly foppish Paris elite who go to work on electric scooters and have no idea about the travails of small-town motorists or villagers resentful of giant wind turbines in their backyards.Even the most pro-wind of the centre-right candidates, Valérie Pécresse, who made it to the run-off on Saturday, called for a total rethink on her own tour of the Saint-Brieuc area.As rightwing contenders for the election try to outflank each other, the opprobrium has reached new levels, with wind farms singled out as either useless or destructive and taking centre stage in televised campaign debates.In one this week, Bertrand said he would end all projects if elected president in April. Asked in a primetime television interview last month about his views on energy, Barnier said bluntly: “I am against wind farms, pretty clearly.”Barnier’s campaign was marked by a surprise lurch to the right on other election issues including migration and security, when he had long been seen as more moderate.“When you see at Saint-Brieuc how they are trying to plant turbines in the middle of the sea, when the economics of it make no sense, it’s not serious,” said Barnier, who favours solar energy instead, as well as fresh investment in nuclear power.Despite the vocal opposition of conservative politicians, polls consistently show a majority of French people support wind energy — much more so than nuclear plants.But age and political affiliation do make a difference. When asked for their feelings if a wind turbine were to be installed next to their home, over 60 per cent of far-right or centre-right sympathisers would oppose it, an Odoxa survey from September for France’s Figaro newspaper showed, compared to widespread support on the left. Older voters were also more inclined to want a slowdown in the wind farm rollout.The bay of Saint-Brieuc is one of France’s richest fishing areas — from scallops and whelks to cuttlefish, spider crabs and lemon sole — and fishermen fear the noise disturbance from construction and the release into the sea of aluminium from the anodes that protect the underwater steel structures from electrochemical corrosion.Initial acceptance of the project in the area has given way to scepticism and even outright opposition, exacerbated by long delays in approvals. The start of drilling in recent months in the hard rock of the seabed to build the turbine’s foundations caused an uproar after a boat leaked hydraulic fuel, pushing Spanish developer Iberdrola to temporarily halt work.Some are now delighted that the protesters’ demands have been thrust into the spotlight. Grégory Le Drougmaguet, a marine biologist appointed by the local fishing committee to monitor the project, says that fishermen in the area “are full of hope because of the presidential election”.“The construction makes us very, very afraid,” says Le Drougmaguet.Emmanuel Rollin, the head of Ailes Marines, the Iberdrola-owned group behind the project, says the environmental impact is limited and within legal limits, and the wind farm would come on stream as planned.But wind energy proponents in France are concerned that a small but dogmatic anti-wind movement could contribute to souring the mood nationwide, including through disinformation campaigns.One example has been alarmist social media posts about “wind farm cemeteries”, after photos of decommissioned turbine blades piling up in a landfill began circulating in France several months ago.While extracted from a real report about the problems posed by the blades, often made with hard-to-recycle composite materials, the pictures were from landfills in the US, not France, where there are strict rules on how to recycle such materials.“It is simply not true that wind power doesn’t effectively address climate disruption, that wind turbines only operate 25 per cent of the time, that they aren’t recyclable, or that there are gigantic blade graveyards in France,” French energy and environment minister Barbara Pompili wrote in a September paper for the France Energie Eolienne (FEE) lobby which represents wind farm developers and manufacturers.According to FEE head Michel Gioria, French opposition to wind power is small, but “very organised, virulent and with a lot of financial backing”. Public hearings around wind farm projects often draw 300 to 400 people who come from neighbouring regions in an orchestrated fashion, he adds.“It puts us on the wrong track when we need society to be trying to reach a consensus on these issues [like energy],” says Gioria, adding that at its current pace of renewable energy rollout, France would reach “none of its targets, on all matters related to the energy transition”.Labbé, the mayor of Erquy, recalls how residents’ fears quickly subsided in a nearby village where he used to live after they watched the installation of three wind turbines over a decade ago.“There was a farmer who was worried the chickens wouldn’t lay their eggs, but the day we put up the turbines the chickens looked up and couldn’t have cared less,” Labbé said. In Erquy, he added, many objectors were owners of second homes who lived in Paris, and most residents were over-60s who tended to object to any new developments, including a skateboard park he wanted for the seafront.France is not alone in facing a politicised backlash. In the US, where President Joe Biden has launched a plan to roll out wind farms off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts over the next decade, his predecessor Donald Trump has slammed the projects.Trump called turbines “monsters” that “kill all the birds” in a British TV interview this week.But delays to projects on top of the brewing political storm are already giving some companies in France the jitters. One senior executive at a big French company involved in rolling out renewable energy plants says some board members had even begun to question the virtue of investments in France.“Local opposition to any wind projects is vitriolic and problematic, tying up projects for years in bureaucracy and court cases,” the executive says, adding that “even some backers have lost faith”.The wait has also taken its toll on manufacturers. GE Renewable Energy, previously Alstom, withdrew from two out of three deals to supply upcoming French offshore plants in 2019, citing excessive delays which left one of its blade factories running under capacity.Macron has so far sought to straddle both camps, recently signalling his support for next generation nuclear reactors in France as well as a continued commitment to renewable energy.But nuclear power can only help so much. Even if the working life of France’s reactors were extended, several new ones built and other renewable power sources ramped up, France would still need to have between 65 and 103 gigawatts of installed capacity from onshore and offshore wind farms by 2050 to reach carbon zero, according to estimates from grid operator RTE — up from 17.6GW at the end of 2020.France aims to derive 40 per cent of its energy production from renewable sources in 2030, from just under a quarter last year.“If we want to reach net zero [in France by 2050], it can’t be done without wind farms,” said Vincent Bales, the head of Wpd offshore France, a wind specialist working with the likes of EDF on projects off the Normandy coast.France’s three other offshore wind projects awarded in 2012 alongside Saint-Brieuc are at least scheduled to get off the ground without as many difficulties or rows over fishing grounds.The first, off France’s west coast by the Saint-Nazaire shipbuilding hub, is due to come online in 2022. Backed by France’s EDF, Canadian pipeline company Enbridge and Canada’s largest pension fund, the site, with 80 turbines and a capacity of 480MW, still had to overcome legal wrangling, but got the green light from France’s Conseil d’Etat — the highest court for administrative matters — two years ago.“Since 2019, there’s been a real accelerator effect, and orders started to really come through,” says Matthieu Blandin, head of offshore wind at Valorem, a French company which worked on developing the Saint-Nazaire project alongside its main backers, and is now vying for maintenance contracts.France has made some tweaks to its system, with future legal appeals on projects set to be fast-tracked straight to the Conseil d’Etat, bypassing intermediary courts.But projects are still dealt with on a case-by-case basis, without the broader regional planning some countries have adopted, which can also ease the process of public consultations.“It’s true that France decided after others to invest in offshore wind, and once it decided it also did take more time [to proceed] than other countries,” says Rollin of Ailes Marines.He is adamant, however, that even the electoral backlash will not stop the Saint-Brieuc project now it is under way.“There are some very strong positions that have been taken by politicians,” says Rollin, adding that critics in the public sphere had never asked the company for information about the project. “They have never contacted us. They are political positions.”
304  Rising Covid-19 infections, a new coronavirus variant and the reimposition of pandemic restrictions are threatening the eurozone’s economic rebound, with fewer people going out to shop, eat at restaurants and visit cinemas, high frequency data show.The slowdown creates a further challenge for the European Central Bank, which must also deal with rising inflation that hit a record 4.9 per cent in November, its highest since the single currency was created over two decades ago.Although the eurozone notched up strong growth in the three months to September, thanks largely to a burst of consumer spending, high frequency indicators that track restaurant bookings, cinema ticket sales and other measures of mobility suggest the rebound lost momentum in November.“Mobility in the eurozone started to slow down even before governments announced new Covid restrictions,” said Bert Colijn, economist at ING.Austria entered its fourth Covid-19 lockdown on November 22, while other countries ranging from the Netherlands and Belgium to Germany, Ireland, Slovakia, Italy and the Czech Republic also stepped up their efforts to curb steep rises in infections.The threat of the Omicron variant has also led to calls for a renewed lockdown in Germany, after the national academy of sciences published a paper advising Berlin to introduce restrictions on public and private gatherings, including for the vaccinated.However even in countries such as Spain, where the health situation has remained more stable, measures of consumer spending have softened as well.Across the eurozone, visits to shops, bars, restaurants and entertainment centres declined sharply in November, according to Google mobility data which shows a fall in the use of public transport and more time spent at home.The eurozone recovery indicator, a measure of activity published by Oxford Economics, also fell to its lowest level since June, while the OECD’s weekly economic tracker, which is based on keyword searches for terms related to spending behaviour and the labour market, turned negative in many eurozone countries.One startling piece of data shows German restaurant bookings dropping below their November 2019 levels.Encouragingly, economic activity has not yet fallen as much as in past periods of high infections.“This suggests that precautionary measures or voluntary changes in behaviour are still mild and that the fear of the virus is not yet very strong,” ING’s Colijn said.Moreover, while virus-sensitive sectors such as hospitality may have been hit, “this has by and large not, yet, spilled over to the rest of the economy”, said Silvia Ardagna, economist at Barclays.Even so, cinema revenues across the eurozone’s largest economies dropped around 20 per cent in the third weekend of November compared with the previous week, according to Box Office Mojo, which tracks revenues.Hotel bookings also fell sharply, data from travel consultancy Sojern shows, reversing a steady improvement through the autumn. Flight numbers saw a similar fall in November after months of recovery.Although the economic impact of pandemic restrictions has been less than in previous waves of infection, Ana Boata, economist at Euler Hermes, nevertheless forecasts that eurozone economic growth will slow to 0.6 per cent in the final quarter of the year from 2.2 per cent in the third quarter.“But it’s not negative growth,” she said, rather “a delayed recovery”.“The labour market is recovering quite strongly and there are high backlogs of work,” Boata added. “It’s a matter of time” before growth returns after the restrictions are lifted.Still, the tension between slowing economic growth caused by tighter Covid-19 restrictions and the Omicron variant’s potential threat, versus rising inflation caused by supply and labour shortages, creates a difficult mix of challenges for the ECB.“If Omicron turns out to be malign enough to prompt tighter restrictions, we suspect that the net result would initially be for inflation to be lower,” Capital Economics’ Simon MacAdam wrote to clients on Wednesday. “But by worsening.shortages, restrictions on household activity could end up keeping inflation above targets for longer,” he added.Jay Powell, chair of the US Federal Reserve this week signalled his support for a quicker withdrawal of the Fed’s huge asset purchase programme. But, Boata said, “other central banks could be in wait-and-see mode”.
305  Gideon talks to Kadri Liik, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, about Russia’s military build-up on the Ukraine border and about how policymakers in Nato and the EU are responding.
306  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
307  More than half of EU companies received some form of state support during the pandemic, allowing many more of them to preserve their investment plans than initially expected, according to research by the European Investment Bank.While almost half of EU businesses suffered a drop in revenues after the coronavirus pandemic struck last year, the massive support provided by governments helped many to stay afloat and to continue investing, according to the EIB’s survey of 13,500 companies.European companies were also less responsive in the crisis, according to the survey published on Thursday. It found a far lower proportion of businesses in the EU than in the US took short-term action in response to the pandemic, such as becoming more digital, launching a new product or shortening their supply chain.In the EU, 46 per cent of companies surveyed said they had become more digital in the past year, but that is well below the figure in the US, where 58 per cent of businesses said this was the case. In Europe, a little more than a third of companies that had not yet implemented advanced digital technologies took the crisis as an opportunity to push their operations in that direction.“The pandemic called for a quick and bold response. And governments and the EU gave it,” said Ricardo Mourinho Félix, EIB vice-president. “This support was crucial in helping companies make it through the lockdowns. It helped to safeguard the investment capacity we urgently need to accelerate the green and digital transformation.”The EIB found 56 per cent of EU companies said they had received state support. More than a third of small businesses said they would have faced an existential threat without the aid, which in many cases did not have to be paid back.After the pandemic hit Europe in March 2020, many of the region’s governments spent billions of euros to support companies and workers with furlough schemes, state-guaranteed loans, grants and tax deferrals. The EU also launched an €800bn fund to finance governments’ rebuilding plans.This seems to have cushioned the impact of the crisis on corporate investment, even though the EU was plunged into a record postwar recession last year.There were 8.5 per cent more businesses in the region saying they had cut their investment than had increased it last year, according to the survey. That is much less than was indicated by the previous year’s EIB survey, which found 28.2 per cent more companies planned to cut their investments in 2020 than increase them.Highlighting how the global economy has bounced back from the pandemic recently, this year’s survey found there were 17.8 per cent more companies planning to increase their investments than to cut them in 2021.“If you exclude airlines, where there are certain one-off effects, we are now close to pre-pandemic levels of investment, which is in contrast to the global financial crisis when it took more than a decade to return to pre-crisis levels of investment,” said Debora Revoltella, chief economist at the EIB.One area where European companies seem well ahead of their US counterparts is in investing to tackle climate change, which 43 per cent of EU companies said they had done, against only 28 per cent of American businesses.
308  Turkey’s finance minister has resigned and been replaced by a loyalist to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan amid a sharp plunge in the lira.Lutfi Elvan, who was seen as the last remaining voice of economic orthodoxy in the Turkish leader’s cabinet, asked to be relieved of his duties, according to the country’s official gazette.After weeks of rumours that he was seeking to step down, the former technocrat was replaced by Nureddin Nebati, who last week made a fulsome public defence of Erdogan’s policy of cutting interest rates despite rising inflation.Nebati, who served three years as a deputy finance minister prior to his appointment, said Turkey had for years been trying to implement a policy of low rates but had faced strong opposition. “This time, we are determined to implement it,” he wrote on Twitter, adding that there was “no problem” with keeping interest rates low in current market conditions.The lira has lost close to 40 per cent of its value since the start of September as Erdogan, a life-long opponent of high interest rates, has pressed the central bank to repeatedly cut them, lowering its benchmark rate to 15 per cent despite annual inflation of close to 20 per cent.That approach has prompted warnings from economists that the government risks causing runaway inflation and financial instability.Nebati, a former businessman turned politician, is seen as close to Erdogan’s son-in-law Berat Albayrak, who served a highly contentious term as finance minister from 2018 before resigning in November 2020 after the president announced a shake-up in the management of the central bank.Albayrak and Nebati were pictured having lunch together in a restaurant in Istanbul in August.Elvan, 59, was respected by the business community but had been seen as increasingly isolated in recent months. He had publicly insisted that the government was still seeking to bring down inflation and maintain a stable currency even though the central bank had cut its benchmark interest rate for the third month running in November.Erdogan made a thinly veiled attack on Elvan for his stance last month. “We will lift the scourge of [high] interest from the backs of our people,” Erdogan said in a speech to parliament. “I’m sorry to our friends [from the ruling party] who defend [high] interest but I cannot and will not walk the same path as them.”Elvan’s resignation came after Turkey’s central bank announced a return to a controversial policy of intervening in currency markets in an attempt to steady the tumbling lira, despite limited foreign exchange reserves.The central bank said on Wednesday that “unhealthy price formations” had prompted the decision to sell hard currency including US dollars in an effort to support the lira.Turkey has not announced a direct currency intervention since it sold $3.2bn in early 2014. However, the country burnt through tens of billions of dollars of its foreign currency reserves in 2019 and 2020 in an unofficial and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to prop up the lira that drew strong criticism from the country’s opposition.
309  The US is delaying a deal to remove Trump-era tariffs on UK steel and aluminium because of Washington’s concerns about London’s threats to change post-Brexit trading rules in Northern Ireland.Brussels and Washington have repeatedly warned London that unilaterally changing the EU-UK accord that sealed Britain’s exit from the bloc in 2020 could threaten peace on the island of Ireland.In a communication seen by the Financial Times, a US commerce department official stated that talks with the UK on easing metals tariffs could not move ahead.The official cited US concerns at British threats to trigger Article 16, a safeguard clause in the post-Brexit Northern Ireland protocol that overrides part of the UK’s exit with the EU and would suspend checks on goods travelling to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.Washington had informed the UK of the reason for the hold-up, the communication said. Three people familiar with the matter also said talks were stuck after pressure from Congress over the UK’s threats to trigger the clause.Boris Johnson’s government has said it will invoke Article 16 if a deal is not struck with Brussels to ease what it says are unworkable restrictions on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland imposed by the protocol. Despite recent signs that the UK has softened its stance, Downing Street insists that the option remains on the table.The EU and US agreed to suspend tariffs on billions of dollars of steel and aluminium in October.The deal provides relief from Trump-era tariffs of 25 per cent on steel and 10 per cent on aluminium to European manufacturers, but leaves UK steelmakers at a disadvantage because they still face steep duties on exports to the US. UK retaliatory duties on US bourbon whiskey and other products have also remained in place.Martha Dalton, a whiskey importer in the UK who co-founded the Bourbon Alliance to represent the industry, said that alliance members were “deeply concerned by the lack of movement on the. negotiations”. “We were optimistic that the brokering of a deal between the US and EU would lead the way for some positive news for our UK-based members,” she added.Under the Brexit deal, Northern Ireland remained in the EU single market for goods to prevent a trade border on the island of Ireland. Instead, all goods travelling from Great Britain into Northern Ireland must conform to EU rules, which means increased paperwork and delays in shipments.The EU has suggested easing controls but London says the proposals do not go far enough and has instead threatened to trigger Article 16. The clause can be invoked by the UK or EU if either side believes the arrangement has caused “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties” or the “diversion of trade”. The issue has attracted the attention of a substantial Irish diaspora in the US Congress, which has repeatedly called on the UK to honour the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that ended the region’s three-decade-long conflict. In November, senior Democratic legislators publicly warned that by threatening to trigger Article 16, the UK threatened to destabilise trade relationships and “hard-earned peace”.Joe Biden, US president, told Johnson as recently as September not to allow the post-Brexit dispute with Europe to destabilise peace on the island of Ireland.The National Security Council at the White House insisted that there was “no link” between the talks and the UK’s position on the Northern Ireland protocol.The commerce department declined to comment on the communication seen by the FT. It referred to an earlier statement saying that the US and UK were “consulting closely on bilateral and multilateral issues related to steel and aluminium”.The US trade representative’s office said that talks with the UK were ongoing.The UK department of trade said: “We do not see any connection with this particular issue and the Northern Ireland protocol and it will in no way affect the UK’s approach. That is because significant changes are needed to the protocol in order to protect the Belfast (Good Friday) agreement and Northern Ireland’s place in the UK internal market.”It added that the department had “regular discussions with both US trade representative Katherine Tai and commerce secretary Gina Raimondo on the issue” and remained “focused on agreeing a resolution that sees damaging tariffs removed”.
310  It is 500 years since the Spanish conquest of Mexico but a line winding around a Madrid block shows that the legacy of half a millennium is more than rancour.The queue was for an exhibition last month at the Casa de México cultural institute — a display about the Day of the Dead that attracted 65,000 visitors, overwhelmingly locals. Families patiently waited to see traditional altars heaped with model skulls and ceramics, great green glass candelabras and other examples of popular Mexican art.That level of interest, in a city where rival attractions include some of the world’s great museums and galleries, contrasted with a transatlantic slanging match between politicians.Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexico’s president, stepped up his campaign for Spain to ask forgiveness for its conquest of his country. Isabel Díaz Ayuso, the leader of Madrid’s regional government, contested that Spain had given the Americas the Spanish language, Catholicism, “and as a result, civilisation and freedom”.This was always set to be a turbulent year for relations between the old capital and the former colony: 2021 also marks the 200th anniversary of Mexico’s declaration of independence from Spain.Perceptions of the colonial period differ drastically. Mexico is so marked by the experience that people say “mande” — “command me” — instead of “what”? As a former Mexico reporter now in Spain, I still do a double take when I walk past streets named after the likes of Hernán Cortés, the conquistador who remains many Mexicans’ public enemy number one. Cortés is a sinister, simpering presence in Diego Rivera’s great murals in the National Palace in Mexico City, where the viceroys ruled and López Obrador now holds court.Yet even as politicians shout past each other to rally their bases, culture can be a meeting point. One reason my family went to the Day of the Dead exhibition was because my son, like many other primary-school kids in Madrid, is learning about Mexico.Some Europeans appreciated Mexican art from the first. In 1520, the German artist Albrecht Dürer visited an exhibition of plundered Aztec treasures in Brussels and wrote: “All the days of my life I have seen nothing that rejoiced my heart so much as these things, for I saw among them wonderful works of art, and I marvelled at the subtle ingenuity of men in foreign lands.”While those gold necklaces, sceptres and mosaics have disappeared, melted down for their gold amid the despoliation of the Aztec empire, the much humbler exhibition at the Casa de México is an exercise in bridge building. “We are a window into Mexico in Spain,” says Ximena Caraza Campos, its director-general.As a Mexican cultural institution the Casa, which gets over 130,000 visitors a year, has government representatives on its board. But its day-to-day operations are privately financed and it was founded by Valentín Díez Morodo, a son of Spanish émigrés who has made millions with Grupo Modelo, Mexico’s biggest brewery (now part of AB InBev). The Casa is his bid to bring the two countries closer, by fostering cultural and also business ties.Those ties run deep. Mexico has a place of pride, particularly among the Spanish left, for taking in republicans during and after the Spanish civil war. Among them was Luis Buñuel, the Aragón-born surrealist film-maker, who made, among other Mexican masterpieces, Los Olvidados, about Mexico’s City’s street children.When I lived in Mexico City, 25 years ago, I used to stroll in Parque España, where a statue of an open hand pays tribute to Mexico’s welcome to the exiles. After landing a freelance job with the Financial Times, I celebrated by taking a slow train to Veracruz, and travelled to La Antigua, the first Spanish town in Mexico, where tropical forest grows among the ruins of Cortés’s house.By contrast, when the Spaniards built on the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, which became Mexico City, their works endured. Mexico remains the country of mestizaje, or mixing, its Spanish legacy an essential ingredient as the two countries’ cultures criss-cross the centuries. Places such as the Casa de México make the subtle ingenuity of people in faraway lands just that little bit closer.daniel.
311  The European Commission president has called for a debate about mandatory vaccinations in Europe as momentum grows in some member states for holdouts to be pressured to accept jabs.Ursula von der Leyen told reporters in Brussels that she believed it was appropriate to have a “discussion” on the matter given how many people remain unvaccinated against Covid-19 in the union — although she stressed that such rules were strictly a decision for member states.Her words come as Germany’s political leaders prepare to meet on Thursday to discuss pushing forward a vaccination mandate as they seek ways of bolstering coverage. The talks have taken on added urgency given the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant, which was identified last week.“It is understandable and appropriate to lead this discussion, how we can encourage and potentially think about mandatory vaccination within the EU,” von der Leyen said on Wednesday. “This needs discussion — this needs a common approach.”Von der Leyen said she was concerned about low vaccination rates. According to figures compiled by Our World in Data and the Financial Times, about 147m people in the EU are not fully vaccinated. The president said she would never have imagined that so many people were turning down “life-saving vaccines” despite the pandemic raging worldwide.The president stressed that she was expressing a personal view, rather than suggesting a new EU policy. Her intervention comes as appetite grows in a number of member states to increase pressure on the unvaccinated even before cases of the new variant were reported in Europe.Olaf Scholz, Germany’s incoming chancellor, this week said he wanted to make Covid-19 vaccines mandatory as soon as February or March. He will meet current chancellor Angela Merkel and representatives of Germany’s states on Thursday to discuss a vaccine mandate, which would need to pass through the country’s legislature.Last month Austria became the first country on the continent to decide that Covid-19 vaccinations would become compulsory for its population. The measure, announced by chancellor Alexander Schallenberg, was a response to low vaccination rates and surging caseloads.From mid-January Greece will impose monthly fines of €100 on over-60s who refuse a vaccine, while other countries have insisted on vaccines for healthcare workers and people working in long-term care facilities.However, measures vary widely between member states, and the notion of compulsory vaccination risks provoking a backlash in countries where there is widespread resistance to jabs.In Slovakia, the government has offered hospitality vouchers worth €500 to senior citizens who get inoculated as it seeks to lift one of the EU’s lowest vaccination rates.“Not everyone is happy with her wading into this given it’s very much a member-state competence,” said one EU diplomat about von der Leyen’s comments. “Given how sensitive this topic is in some member states it’s not clear whether her intervention will help.”Addressing the Omicron variant, von der Leyen said it was necessary to “hope for the best and prepare for the worst” as scientists develop their analysis of the threat posed, with results expected in two to three weeks.If it became apparent that existing vaccines did not work so well against the new variant, the EU had precautionary measures in place, she said, pointing to terms in the bloc’s contracts with drugmakers allowing for updated versions of the vaccines.
312  “Wishing will make it so, just keep on wishing and care will go”. Vera Lynn’s uplifting lyrics may have made her the “forces’ sweetheart” but they rarely feature in diplomatic manuals. And yet this song seems uncomfortably close to the UK’s apparent desire for better relations with the EU, and France in particular.The last month offered up signs that at least some in Downing Street can see the advantages of a reset. Lord Frost, the chief Brexit negotiator, has drawn back at least temporarily from threats to suspend the Northern Ireland Protocol. Media allies have been briefed on the desire for a new “entente cordiale” with France. The growing pressure to halt uncontrolled Channel crossings is the clearest example of how often domestic problems require European assistance.But this reset is an end for which few are prepared to will the means. Boris Johnson wants better relations but sees few domestic benefits to a softer line — especially with his party’s troublesome right flank. John Bew, his foreign policy adviser, is making the case but, in the words of one seasoned observer, “he is cutting a pretty lonely figure”.One European diplomat says the British approach is “always tactical rather than strategic”. Progress is swiftly followed by reverses, most recently following the deaths of 27 migrants in the Channel. The tweeting of a provocative letter to Emmanuel Macron led to the UK being disinvited from a summit on the issue. One former diplomat noted: “The French are world champion flouncers but they were bound to react badly to that letter and no one seems to have thought about that. It was done for domestic consumption.”There is little evidence of meaningful bridge-building. “I’ve not had any sense of a real desire to re-engage,” says a foreign office insider. Foreign secretary Liz Truss’s primary focus is the US and the Indo-Pacific region. Where her interests are drawn towards the EU she has focused most heavily on eastern European nations, notably those defying EU rules. And the tone of EU relations is set by Lord Frost. Elsewhere in cabinet, the chancellor Rishi Sunak exasperates otherwise-admiring officials with his lack of interest in engaging with EU counterparts. Home secretary Priti Patel is cordial in private but her public tone alienates the allies she seeks.Defence is cited as a foundation for a reset, especially with France. But the UK’s integrated foreign policy review barely bothered itself with the issue of European security and Britain still seeks to bypass EU structures. Hopes for broader rapprochement were severely undermined by the Aukus deal. While the White House rushed to salve wounds, Johnson punched the bruise telling Macron to “prenez un grip”. Defence co-operation continues, notably on nuclear testing, but rather than easing tensions, it is in spite of them.Nor does the picture look rosier with other capitals. The coalition agreement for the new German government stresses the need for a common EU position in dealing with the UK and “full compliance” with existing agreements. Others note waning patience among formerly supportive leaders such as Mark Rutte of the Netherlands. Meanwhile, Europe is moving on. Building ties with Olaf Scholz, the new German chancellor, is the priority for most EU states.Brexit, of course, lies at the root of the problems. The UK is now seen by European leaders as an unreliable ally, ripping up agreements within months of signing them. Macron may be the most outspoken in berating Johnson as untrustworthy and unserious, but he is not out of step with other EU leaders.The new default is a more tense and transactional relationship. British ministers may lament the French desire to show that Brexit has not been a success and to weaken the City of London but this should have been priced in, if not from the start then at least once the UK prioritised fish over financial services.A more fundamental question is whether this government is capable of securing the thaw it purportedly seeks. Some ex-diplomats are doubtful. “I don’t believe this can be fixed under this prime minister. The relationship with France is so broken,” says one.There are steps which could help. The first would be to end the threats to suspend the Northern Ireland Protocol and accept the proposed European Commission reforms on the implementation of customs checks. This will disappoint hardline Unionists but they are going to be disappointed sooner or later.The second step would be to listen to the mandarins and remember that the essence of diplomacy is persuading others to do things you want — it therefore demands more consideration of their concerns and temperament. The UK needs to stop viewing European relations as part of an endless zero-sum game of continuing Brexit negotiations.Third, it could entertain the French suggestion of UK asylum processing centres in France though this might also mean accepting more migrants.Yet even listing these steps highlights the problem. The character of the prime minister and his government, with its taste for brinkmanship, mistrust of diplomats and campaigning instinct to rile up its base, militate against the pragmatism required for a reset.Tensions can ease but a true thaw demands a strategic decision from an endlessly tactical government. That some wish for better relations is a start. But wishing it is some way short of willing it.
313  Turkey has announced a return to a contentious policy of intervening in the currency markets in an attempt to steady the tumbling lira, despite a previous commitment not to do so and limited foreign exchange reserves.The central bank said on Wednesday that “unhealthy price formations” had prompted the decision to sell hard currency such as US dollars in an effort to support the lira.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan backed the move, telling reporters that the central bank’s statutes had a provision that permitted currency intervention. “If they need to intervene in that way, they do it,” he said.The move comes after the lira tumbled to a record low of TL13.87 against the US dollar earlier on Wednesday, a decline of 46 per cent compared with where it started in 2021. The announcement sparked a strong rally, with the currency strengthening to about TL12.5 in London dealings — later trimming some of its gains to sit at TL13.2 to the dollar.Turkey has not announced a direct currency intervention since it sold $3.2bn at the beginning of 2014. However, the country burnt through tens of billions of dollars of its foreign currency reserves in 2019 and 2020 in an unofficial intervention that attempted to bolster the lira through a complex arrangement with state banks.That policy, spearheaded by Erdogan’s son-in-law Berat Albayrak during his time as finance minister, was highly contentious. Opposition parties popularised the slogan: “Where is the $128bn?” — a reference to one estimate of how much money was spent on the ultimately futile intervention.The scheme was halted in November 2020 when Erdogan brought Naci Agbal, a respected former bureaucrat, to the helm of the central bank and Albayrak resigned. Agbal was fired less than four months after his appointment.Wednesday’s intervention was of limited size of between $300m and $500m, according to two sources in the financial industry.“The volume of intervention doesn’t seem to be very big, which makes sense given that their net reserve position is somewhere between very poor and negative depending on the exact definition,” said Paul McNamara, of asset manager GAM.“This intervention on its own isn’t going to work,” he added. “The market will keep pushing back until they see [the central bank] steps in again. If they make it clear they are willing to intervene repeatedly and drain their reserves, it can work for a while. But it’s not a sustainable position.”The country’s international reserves fell to a 20-year low last year as the multibillion-dollar currency intervention took its toll.The central bank’s foreign currency war chest had recovered significantly this year, with gross reserves in particular showing an improvement thanks in part to swap agreements with other central banks and a one-off allocation from the IMF.But net reserves — which offer an indication of the bank’s firepower to defend the currency — remain deeply negative once borrowed money is stripped out. The country’s net reserves, excluding funds exchanged through swaps with Turkish commercial banks and other central banks, are estimated at minus $46.8bn, according to Goldman Sachs. Gross reserves were $128.4bn in the week to November 19, the Wall Street bank said.Central bank governor Sahap Kavcioglu said in October that the bank did not plan to return to currency interventions, which had drawn strident criticism from international investors.But the lira has plunged through a succession of record lows as the bank has repeatedly cut interest rates despite inflation of almost 20 per cent. Erdogan has signalled that more rate cuts will follow.
314  Opposite the Moscow headquarters of the FSB, successor to the KGB which once employed Vladimir Putin, stands a large slab of rock on a plinth. Known as the Solovetsky Stone, it was brought from a former labour camp constructed in the 1920s in Russia’s icy northern wastes. It was placed on Lubyanka Square in 1990 at the initiative of the human rights group Memorial to commemorate the millions of victims of Soviet repression.Now state prosecutors are taking action to shut down Memorial, a step that signifies a dual assault on modern Russian civil society and on the nation’s wider struggle for historical memory and justice. Dunja Mijatovic, human rights commissioner of the 47-nation Council of Europe, correctly describes Memorial as “a symbol of the relentless fight for freedom, democracy and human rights in the post-Soviet area and beyond”. But the threat to Memorial also illustrates how, more than 20 years into his rule, Putin’s crackdown on dissent is inextricable from a desire to control Russia’s past.Memorial emerged in the late 1980s as Soviet society began to break free from decades of glacial silence about the mass crimes committed by the state’s communist rulers against their own people. One of Memorial’s founders was Andrei Sakharov, nuclear physicist and Nobel Peace Prize winner, and the moral core of the Soviet human rights movement. After 30 years of painstaking work, Memorial has compiled a database of more than 3m victims of Soviet political repression, mostly people who were executed, imprisoned, sent to labour camps or exiled during Joseph Stalin’s 1924-1953 dictatorship.Under Putin, the Russian state not so much ignores these horrors as sidesteps the question of who was responsible. It prefers an alternative historical narrative focused on the Soviet victory over Nazism. In an increasingly intimidating intellectual climate, Memorial has come under attack for being “unpatriotic” in drawing attention to the Stalinist repressions that peaked in the 1930s but continued during and after the second world war. Yury Dmitriyev, a historian who discovered a mass grave of the Stalin era in the region of Karelia, was jailed for 13 years on what supporters regard as trumped-up charges of sexual abuse.Memorial’s investigations are necessary because, in contrast to postwar West Germany, and later the reunified German state, the authorities of post-communist Russia do not view an honest appraisal of history, no matter how painful, as a moral duty to their citizens. Instead, they crave a distorted version of the past that props up their power. Matters stood differently in the freer atmosphere of the 1980s and 1990s under Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin, but that era is now viewed as a time when historical truth-telling was a symptom of social disorder and the weakness of the state.Memorial angers the authorities because its historical research and commemorations blend into human rights activities. This aspect of the group’s work began in the 1990s in response to the ferocious Russian military offensives in Chechnya. Memorial publishes regular updated lists of Russian political prisoners, among whom it includes Alexei Navalny, the jailed opposition leader so reviled in the Kremlin that Putin and his propagandists rarely even mention his name.In the shrinking space of Russian civil society, Memorial is far from the only organisation struggling to survive. In June the courts outlawed Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, which has published several reports on alleged high-level graft, as an extremist group.Memorial’s roots lie in an era when hopes ran high for a Russia at last becoming confident enough to speak the truth to itself. Its liquidation would be the bitterest blow to the brave Russians who try to keep these hopes alive.
315  The writer is a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of BusinessUnder the benign gaze of the Draghi government, the US private equity group KKR is bidding for Telecom Italia, one of the last large firms in Italian hands. Italy, the eighth largest economy in the world, has only six companies in the Fortune Global 500, three of which are controlled by the state. This compares with seven for Spain, whose economy is ranked 14th in the world by gross domestic product, and 26 for France, which is seventh.Some blame successive Italian governments for not resisting foreign acquisitions. They point to outgoing German chancellor Angela Merkel blocking Fiat from buying Opel in 2009 and French president Emmanuel Macron delaying Fincantieri’s acquisition of STX in 2017.Others regard this latest bid as a sign of the ultimate triumph of the European single market. But I see a failure of the Italian economy to move into the 21st century.The problem is not that foreign companies acquire Italian ones. It is that Italy’s entrepreneurs seem incapable of building companies that are able to compete in the global economy.Why is this? First, Italian entrepreneurs are obsessed with control. In order to retain majority control of the companies they found, they build fragile pyramid structures, burden them with debt and ultimately do not expand much beyond Italy’s borders, since doing so would require using equity to pay for acquisitions.This obsession with control is not just a psychological matter. In Italy corporate control is highly valuable, because whoever has it can easily take advantage of minority shareholders without fear of legal retribution. Anticipating this risk, savers are reluctant to invest in the equity market and finance the expansion of Italian firms.The second reason for underperformance is the parasitic relationship between domestic big business and the Italian state. For decades, Fiat was heavily protected from Japanese competition, while in the 1990s Olivetti was granted the second mobile phone licence by a sympathetic government.This parasitic relationship reached its peak when Silvio Berlusconi was in power, first in the mid-1990s and then again in the early 2000s. The country’s telecommunications strategy was subordinated to the private interests of the billionaire prime minister. Used to making quick profits at home thanks to their political connections, Italian companies were unwilling to take the risks needed to succeed in the global marketplace.A belief that “small is beautiful” also helped to prevent Italian firms from achieving the economies of scale necessary for global success. Italy invented the pizza, for example, but still does not have a large pizza chain. The concept of the coffee bar is Italian in origin, but the country is not home to a significant coffee chain. The country is one of the world’s biggest tourist destinations, but it does not boast a large chain of hotels. And while Italy is one of the global capitals of fashion, the biggest Italian-owned fashion company is ranked only 17th in the world by market value.Finally, consider the failure to create world-class universities. The success of Montecatini and Olivetti in the 1960s was driven by technology developed in Italian universities. But who remembers the last Italian firm to have prospered on the back of technology developed by researchers at home? In the 2021 Shanghai ranking of world universities, there is no Italian institution in the top 150.Many of these problems have been decades in the making. Yet efforts to address them have been limited. Reforms to speed up civil trials are welcome, but have the unfortunate defect of shortening the statute of limitation for criminal offences, helping corrupt entrepreneurs to escape punishment for their crimes.Moreover, not only does the flood of money provided by the Next Generation EU recovery programme foster the parasitic relationship between business and government, the way that cash is disbursed entrenches the cycle of dependence. Some €11bn is earmarked for the promotion of university research, yet that is well under 1 per cent of GDP and does not even cover the annual gap in R&D between Italy and the rest of Europe. No serious attempt is being made, as far as I can see, to help Italian companies develop the economies of scale to compete in the global marketplace.To win the challenge of global competition in the 21st century, Italy must not stand in the way of the process of creative destruction. It should instead foster the development of new giants capable of taking on the world. If the Next Generation EU recovery funds are not used to aid this process, a huge opportunity for the Italian economy will have been missed.Letter in response to this article:In Italy, individuality and quality always win out / From Johan Boelts, Vienna, Austria
316  The Omicron coronavirus variant threatens to intensify imbalances that are slowing growth and raising costs, the OECD said on Wednesday as it significantly increased its inflation forecasts from three months ago.The new variant, which was identified last week, could delay the world economy’s return to normality, the Paris-based international organisation of largely rich country members warned.Monetary policymakers should be “cautious”, the OECD added, saying that the most urgent policy requirement was to accelerate deployment of Covid-19 vaccines globally.The recommendations came alongside its twice yearly economic outlook, which left global growth forecasts similar to those three months ago but significantly raised expected inflation.Across the G20, the OECD raised its inflation forecast for 2022 from 3.9 per cent in its September predictions to 4.4 per cent now. The largest increases were in the US and UK, where inflation forecasts for next year rose in both countries from 3.1 per cent to 4.4 per cent.Laurence Boone, chief economist of the OECD, told the FT that the Omicron variant was “adding to the already high level of uncertainty and that could be a threat to the recovery, delaying a return to normality or something even worse”.She did not contradict the hawkish stance voiced on Tuesday by Jay Powell, chair of the US Federal Reserve, or recent comments by the Bank of England, commenting that these central banks had already been cautious and that more persistent inflationary pressures in the US and the UK required a slightly tighter monetary stance.“There is no one-size-fits-all [monetary] policy because you have a very different situation in some emerging market economies with high inflation rates. The US is also different from Europe and also different from Asia where there’s much less of an inflation issue,” Boone said.She stressed the need for policymakers to communicate clearly that they would not raise interest rates as a result of supply shortages, but would be ready to act if price pressures broadened and become self-reinforcing.The OECD noted that the global recovery had been much stronger than it initially expected in 2021, but said this had now created a series of damaging imbalances that could persist longer than expected. “Supply shortages risk slowing growth and prolonging elevated inflation,” Boone said.In the automotive sector alone, the OECD calculated that supply disruptions knocked more than 1.5 per cent off the size of the German economy this year and more than 0.5 per cent in Mexico, the Czech Republic and Japan.Alongside such mismatches between supply and demand, the OECD’s main message was that there were many other large imbalances emerging in the global economy.These range from the supply of vaccines — which is far greater in rich countries; a growing gap in economic performance between advanced economies and emerging markets; and a divide between the labour market performance of European countries and the US.In Europe, employment is better protected and higher than pre-pandemic levels, but economic output had not fully recovered lost ground. In the US, the reverse is true.Boone said the European protection of jobs had been beneficial to people “but some of the necessary reallocation of jobs may not have taken place”. She also said that part of this important trend was likely to be because the initial coronavirus hit was harder in Europe than in the US.In the OECD’s economic forecasts, it projected world economic growth slowing from 5.5 per cent this year to 4.5 per cent in 2022, followed by a 3.2 per cent expansion in 2023.Inflation in G20 countries was likely to fall to 3.8 per cent in 2023 after hitting 4.4 per cent next year. However, the OECD forecast that inflation would be below 2 per cent in the eurozone in 2023, vs 2.4 per cent in the UK and 2.5 per cent in the US.
317  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.Negotiations are inching forward as Poland seeks to land a deal with the European Commission over its bid for a €36bn slice of the recovery fund. We’ll look at the signs of progress, and ask if Warsaw will give the assurances on judicial independence necessary to unlock a deal in the coming days. Even if it does, the country will still not be off the hook next year (looking at you, Berlin).Over in Strasbourg, the refusal by Turkish authorities to release a jailed businessman and philanthropist could cost Ankara diplomatically, as the Council of Europe is considering steps today that may end up with the withdrawal of the country’s voting rights in the inter-governmental human rights body.In EU woke news, the commission yesterday recalled its internal document on inclusive communication (we wrote about it here), describing it as “not a mature document” and failing to meet the commission’s “quality standards”. The document prompted a backlash in Italy over the recommendation that EU officials talk of ‘holidays’ instead of ‘Christmas’.It’s now over half a year since Poland submitted a bid for €36bn of grants and loans from the EU’s recovery fund. As the year nears its end, some diplomats spy signs of progress as the commission considers whether to sign off on the plan, write Valentina Pop, Sam Fleming and James Shotter.Clinching EU sign-off before the year-end would enable Warsaw to tap into billions of euros of pre-financing. However, as we enter December, the window is perilously narrow.Poland has made some concessions in talks with Brussels over the past few weeks, but the remaining gap is still a serious one.It’s noteworthy that the incoming coalition government in Berlin has been striking a much harsher tone when it comes to rule of law matters than the outgoing German chancellor, Angela Merkel.The new coalition agreement makes it clear that Germany will not want to see any EU money disbursed if the independence of the judiciary is not ensured. That suggests it will insist on Brussels taking a tough line in holding Poland to its reform commitments if the plan is approved.As things stand, the main sticking points include calls for the reinstatement of suspended Polish judges, and demands for written guarantees about the nature of any regime that replaces the Polish disciplinary chamber for judges, which the EU wants to see dismantled.Meeting those requirements will not be easy. The hardline Polish justice minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, is trying to amp the pressure on the country’s prime minister to not give in to the EU’s demands.“The European Commission does not just want the scrapping of the chamber, but also the annulment of almost 600 rulings issued by it. I will never accept that,” he said in an interview earlier this week with the rightwing magazine Sieci.“Poland is supposed to pay €1m per day because it does not want to allow such judges to return to the judicial bench.This is what the EU expects from us today — to return them, discontinue the proceedings [against them] and presumably also pay compensation. That is unimaginable,” he added.Nevertheless, as the year-end nears, the political pressure is also rising on Ziobro and his allies to relent — and soon — in order to allow the EU cash to finally start flowing.Inflation in the eurozone rose to 4.9 per cent in November, a record high since the single currency was created, mainly driven by soaring energy prices. The rise is likely to put more pressure on the European Central Bank to reduce its monetary stimulus. (More here)There were nerves among European diplomats in the run-up to a debate on Turkey today at the Council of Europe, the continent’s top human rights body, writes Laura Pitel in Ankara.Some feared that they would struggle to secure the 32 votes needed to follow through on a pledge to reprimand the country for refusing to implement an order by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to release Osman Kavala, a jailed businessman and philanthropist.Kavala, 64, has spent the last four years behind bars despite not being convicted of any crime.Failing to approve a motion to launch “infringement proceedings” against Turkey would have been a “disaster” for the credibility of the Council of Europe, which oversees the ECHR, one European official warned.That was echoed by human rights groups, which said that refusing to censure Turkey would not only send the wrong message to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan but also to other autocrats across the continent.“This is a test of the entire human rights system that governs Council of Europe member states,” said Milena Buyum, a senior campaigner on Turkey at Amnesty International. “It’s obviously very crucial for the individual involved — in this case Osman Kavala — but it will also have an impact on the whole system of human rights that these countries are bound by.”After intense lobbying by both sides, those in favour of being tough on Erdogan now expect that the 47-member body will back a proposal to launch “infringement proceedings” against Turkey when they vote tomorrow after a debate that takes place today.EU member states are expected to be divided on the issue, with Poland among those said to be considering a vote against, said two people familiar with the behind-the-scenes discussions. A spokesperson for the Polish foreign ministry declined to comment.The infringement process is likely to be long and arduous but could ultimately lead to a suspension of Turkey’s voting rights or even expulsion from the Council of Europe if it continues to refuse to release Kavala.The proposal is only the second time that infringement proceedings have been brought against one of the institution’s 47 member states since the mechanism was introduced in 2010.The first instance was against Azerbaijan, which was reprimanded in 2017 for refusing to implement an ECHR order to release jailed opposition leader Ilgar Mammadov. He was later released and acquitted of the charges against him.
318  Earlier this year, Germany’s Bayerische Landesbank quietly decided it did not want to do business with defence companies any more.“BayernLB has not announced it to the public yet,” a bank spokesman told me this week. “We are fading out business relationships with companies.[having] above 20 per cent turnover in defence.” The decision has sent shivers through Europe’s defence industry. Bavaria is, after all, home to some of Germany’s biggest defence companies such as Airbus Defence and Space and Hensoldt. If Bavaria’s state-controlled bank believes defence is too controversial to deal with, why should private sector banks step in?Now a bigger threat is coming, this time from Brussels where a discussion is under way about what constitutes socially sustainable finance.Europe’s classification system for green investment — known as the environmental taxonomy — will soon be published. But officials are already working on a “social taxonomy” to define which activities contribute positively to society, those that do no significant harm, and those that are harmful.In draft proposals presented this year, the defence industry was grouped with gambling and tobacco as harmful and, so, potentially not socially sustainable. The draft moots limiting the label “harmful” to activities banned by international treaties, such as chemical or biological weapons. But the language remains unclear.Another proposal suggests barring companies from qualifying for an eco-kitemark to be used for retail financial products, if more than five per cent of turnover comes “from the production or trade of conventional weapons and/or military products used for combat”. This time there is no qualification about controversial activities.Not surprisingly, Europe’s defence industry is raising the alarm. ASD, the European defence industry’s trade association, has written to the commission to warn that these proposals could undermine the bloc’s security by restricting defence companies’ ability to secure finance and so to invest.“It is a problem if we are defined as not socially viable,” said ASD president Alessandro Profumo, who is also chief executive of Italy’s defence champion Leonardo. “Without security we cannot have a sustainable society.”Already the proposals are having an impact. Jan Pie, ASD secretary-general, cites examples of banks cutting ties with defence companies in Germany, Finland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Sweden. One Belgian group has even had to pay employees from non-EU bank accounts, he says.Germany’s defence industry trade body has found that more than a third of members face urgent issues with banks, such as refusal to provide standard services or export insurance.The pain is being felt most acutely by smaller companies, crucial to the supply chain and innovation, says Profumo. But the proposal also risks deterring civil companies, which provide increasingly important technology to defence projects.There are good reasons to be critical of the defence industry. Transparency International has found that just 12 per cent of the world’s top 134 defence companies show a high level of commitment to fighting corruption. But there are many international treaties defining legitimate trade in conventional weapons and Europe’s defence industry is still crucial to the bloc’s security.European politicians including Commission president Ursula von der Leyen have recently stressed the need for a strong defence industry in the face of growing global threats.There is an incoherence in defining defence companies as “socially harmful” if they are at the same time vital to the EU’s peace and stability. Defence is not the same as tobacco and gambling, where it is difficult to see any wider social good.Some may not like defence, according to consultant Francis Tusa of Defence Analysis, “but then they have to do a better job of explaining how we would work without it”.The commission should think carefully about the consequences of indiscriminately labelling the sector as unsustainable. Making it more difficult for law-abiding companies to raise finance will either force governments to shoulder more expense, or buy more from abroad — where Europe will have even less control over behaviour.Of course weapons are harmful. But they are even more harmful if those who threaten you have them and you do not.
319  There was live music, dancing and bottles of Sekt sparkling wine. The chancellor, the president, the mainstream party leaders and the media bosses were all there, in black tie and sequinned evening dresses.What made last Friday’s gala extra exclusive, though, was that it was also the only legal party in the country — a charity fundraiser at Austrian state broadcaster ORF which, according to organisers, means that it counted as an “official” work event.Four days earlier, the government had banned all other parties when Austria became the first nation in Europe this winter to reinstate a hard national lockdown. The new restrictions were coupled with a highly controversial announcement that vaccinations would be mandatory for all adults from February onwards. Austrians have to stay at home until mid-December, non-essential shops are closed and children can only to go to school if strictly necessary.One political group and its leaders were conspicuously absent from Friday’s bash — Austria’s far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ).As images of the gala circulated widely on Saturday morning, the leader of FPÖ Vienna, Dominik Nepp, held a press conference. Austrians are “locked up” in front of their TV sets, he thundered, but “our federal government is partying.without social distancing, without masks and, above all, without shame”.Even before the emergence of the new Omicron variant, a number of European governments were facing growing resistance to pandemic-related restrictions that have been put in place to deal with an early-winter surge in infections. The potential for political pushback is likely to increase as governments, nervous about a new variant that might be more resistant to vaccines, seek to impose new measures on their populations — potentially including more vaccine mandates.In some countries, at least, the pandemic is now creating new political space for the politicians of the right and left who have spent the last decade trying to surf a wave of anti-establishment sentiment. Across the continent, populist parties are rethinking their strategies and casting themselves increasingly as the parties of vaccine scepticism and anti-lockdown libertarianism.As public frustration grows, populist politicians are finding themselves singing from a well-known songsheet, with anger directed at hypocritical ruling elites and seemingly out-of-touch scientific experts. The pattern is most striking in central and eastern Europe, where vaccine scepticism has been higher than other parts of the continent and new social curbs, as a result of rising cases of Covid-19, have already begun to be reimposed.Until now, the pandemic has been regarded as bad for populist parties. A YouGov-Cambridge Globalism study found in November that populist beliefs had “broadly declined” in 10 European countries over the past three years.But populist parties are starting to see opportunities in public discontent with a rapidly changing and seemingly never-ending pandemic. Shortly after the hard lockdown in Austria was announced last month, 40,000 demonstrators took to the streets of Vienna in one of the largest political protests in years. In the Netherlands, the same weekend, protests turned to riots in Rotterdam and The Hague, with dozens of arrests. Meanwhile in Brussels, 35,000 people turned out to demonstrate against new curbs on their lives, including mandatory homeworking for four days of the week. The Czech Republic, Germany and Switzerland have all seen rallies in the past few weeks, with thousands in attendance.Whether or not established populist parties can turn public frustration into political support will depend on the course of the pandemic, as well as the particularities of individual countries. So far, populist parties in Europe have had mixed success in funnelling public discontent into votes.But some parties are beginning to seize the political opening presented by the pandemic. “The past three years may have been bad for European populists. But what is interesting now.is how populists are changing their nature and what that will mean for the future,” says the political scientist Ivan Krastev, chair of the Centre for Liberal Strategies in Sofia. “Suddenly populists all over Europe have had a libertarian baptism.” The pandemic has taken Europe’s populists a step closer to their counterparts across the Atlantic, Krastev adds. In the US, nationalism has long been entwined with libertarianism as a powerful anti-establishment force. “I think we are going to have a very turbulent political decade ahead of us in Europe,” he says.On a frosty Saturday in mid-November, thousands of protesters gathered at Zurich’s Turbinenplatz ready to march through the city centre. It was a ragtag assembly. Alongside supporters of the populist rightwing Swiss People’s Party were Buddhists and free-market liberals. There were Freiheitstrychler — “Freedom Ringers” — heavy-set men in traditional alpine dress carrying huge cowbells over their shoulders, and students from Zurich’s world-renowned technical university.The peaceful protest, which drew an estimated 2,000 people, according to police, was the latest of dozens across Swiss cities in the past month. The protester’s target was a November 28 referendum on the government’s legal powers to enforce the use of vaccines and Covid test certificates. The government won. But 38 per cent of the population voted against it.Switzerland is rich, efficiently governed, with an economy that has barely been hit by the pandemic and with a well-resourced healthcare system that has kept Covid-19 deaths notably low. Yet it has seen an upswell in support for campaign groups and movements opposed to both vaccinations and, more broadly, to any restrictive measures imposed by the government.It is, as such, an interesting example of how the pandemic is galvanising a populist backlash in some surprising ways.“We’re fighting against forced vaccination,” said Isidore Kasper, a young carpenter from Biel from a middle-class family, who describes his politics as “green and ecological”. He supports the “Free Left”, a protest movement broadly opposed to vaccines and lockdowns that emerged in the summer and is unofficially led by Simone Machado, a green city councillor from Bern. “I know of someone who had the vaccine and two days later he had a blood clot. He’s not been the same person since,” Kasper added, as he set up his stall to make crepes for rally attendees. “This is a huge issue. If things don’t change then we will go and live in Mexico.” Just how young many attendees at protest rallies in Switzerland, Germany and Austria have been is striking.A recent pan-European poll by the European Council on Foreign Relations teased out the generational divide: 57 per cent of those under 30 said their lives had been affected by the pandemic, compared with just 35 per cent of over-60s. Moreover, 43 per cent of under-30s said they were suspicious of government motives in introducing lockdowns, compared with 28 per cent of over 60s. Some of this anti-government sentiment is fuelling emerging movements on the right and left. “We are a movement of the youth, by the youth, for the youth,” says Nicolas Rimoldi, one of the organisers of Mass-Voll, a Swiss group set up to protest coronavirus restrictions. “We are a civil rights movement,” he adds. “All the things that are normal for young people have been robbed from them by governments.” The growth in support for populist groups is a far from uniform phenomenon in Europe. Across the border in Germany, the loose coalitions of lockdown opponents and vaccine sceptics that have sprung up have not yet translated into ballot box success for established populist parties.For much of the pandemic, the far-right Alternative for Germany has been the most outspoken opponent of coronavirus measures in politics. Its politicians have railed against what they call the “corona dictatorship” and campaigned vociferously for a lifting of the long lockdown last winter.The party’s position has gained it some support in a country where vaccination uptake has been slow compared with other parts of Europe. In Germany, 68.5 per cent of the population has been fully vaccinated, compared with 79.4 per cent in Spain.A survey carried out by Forsa, a polling company, after the federal election in September found that 50 per cent of unvaccinated voters had chosen the AfD, indicating that it had become strongly associated with vaccine resistance. Meanwhile, the German public has become increasingly dissatisfied with the government’s response to the crisis. According to the YouGov-Cambridge poll, 27 per cent of German responders said their government was doing a bad job of handling the pandemic in 2020. That rose to 52 per cent this year. In Spain and France, by contrast, support for government pandemic policy has increased.But the AfD’s image has been tarnished by its strategy. Its association with anti-vaxxers and coronavirus conspiracy theorists turned off the more traditional rightwing voters it had previously won cautious support from with its tough stance on immigration. The AfD’s share of the vote fell from 12.6 per cent in 2017 to 10.3 per cent in September’s election.“The AfD discovered that it was harder to mobilise voters with opposition to the corona lockdowns than it was with the issue of immigration,” says Hans Vorländer, a political scientist at the Dresden University of Technology.The party’s extreme positions were opposed to those of the liberal Free Democrats, who did not support the lockdown but didn’t deny the severity of the pandemic and was behind the vaccination campaign from the start. Political analysts say the FDP was able to scoop up the votes of moderate coronavirus sceptics and is now part of the new government coalition that should be sworn into office this December.However, the emergence of the new variant could lead to a sharpening of political tensions in Germany over the pandemic. On Tuesday, chancellor-designate Olaf Scholz said he was in favour of mandatory vaccinations for everyone. If the Bundestag now adopts such a requirement, it could galvanise the anti-vaxxer movement in Germany and potentially lead to a wave of social unrest.Like in Germany, established populist parties in the Netherlands have had mixed success in winning voters. Following a campaign against lockdown measures in the general election this year, the Freedom for Democracy party of Thierry Baudet — dubbed the Donald Trump of the Netherlands — won eight seats in parliament. It then lost three of them to political defections after MPs reacted in disgust to a party poster comparing lockdown to the Nazi occupation of the country during the war.The new wave of infections has been a particularly difficult issue for the government in Poland, which is led by the populist Law and Justice party (PiS). Early in the pandemic it responded relatively strongly, closing the country’s borders in March 2020, introducing lockdowns and mandating mask-wearing in public places.But as cases have soared again in recent weeks it has been reluctant to take similarly aggressive measures, even though the country’s relatively low level of vaccination has sparked fears that the health service will again come under heavy pressure.“We’re a slightly different country.we are set up differently culturally,” deputy health minister Waldemar Kraska explained on the radio station RMF FM. “I think that we approach restrictions, which are imposed by our government, with a big dose of caution. For many centuries, we have had in our genes a gene of resistance.” Ryszard Luczyn, an analyst at Polityka Insight, says that the government’s reluctance to introduce stronger curbs was being driven by several factors, ranging from fear of upsetting its voters — most of whom do not want new restrictions — to worries about the cost of another lockdown.“No one wants to take the responsibility for implementing strong measures,” he says. “It’s a perfect storm of a lack of leadership, lack of support for tough restrictions, and lack of money.”Another factor, he adds, is that PiS is also wary of allowing Confederation, a far-right grouping that entered parliament in 2019, to build its position by hoovering up the support of anti-vaxxers and lockdown opponents.“There is pressure from anti-vaxxers both inside and outside the parliament,” he says. “PiS has always tried to prevent anyone emerging to the right of them, and Confederation is there now, and PiS really, really don’t want to strengthen them.”In Austria, too, it was the emergence of a new party opposed to vaccine restrictions, People-Freedom-Rights (MFG), that appears to have pushed the FPÖ into taking a harder line. MFG won 6 per cent of the ballot in regional elections in September — drawing a large proportion of its support from former FPÖ voters.The key question for the months ahead, says Austrian political commentator Thomas Hofer, is whether populist parties will be able to fuse the various and growing strands of anger and discontent circulating in pandemic-weary populations into something more durable.“Can they transfer this issue about freedom and personal rights to other issues? The potential is there and I wouldn’t underestimate it,” he says, pointing to Austria. “Can the Freedom Party close the circle? They could perhaps, if you imagine them taking this anti-establishment message built around personal rights and freedom from the establishment and join that up with taxes, with the cost of living, with the cost of heating, with the burden we are going to see imposed because of the climate transition.”Already, Austria’s Freedom Party has seen its poll ratings begin to steadily rise. If there was a federal election tomorrow, FPÖ is on track to win 20 per cent of the vote, up from 10 per cent at the beginning of the year.“I think we are most probably facing a new cycle of political instability,” says Krastev. The pandemic, he says, has fractured parts of the European liberal consensus without many governments yet really having realised it.The certainties that Europe arrived at in response to its last big three crises have all been revisited, he says. In the war on terror, Europe argued for privacy and civil liberties, but the pandemic ushered in the biggest restrictions on personal freedoms in a generation. With the financial crisis, Europe pledged to maintain fiscal discipline and control spending, but national debt has soared since Covid emerged. And with the migration crisis, Europe championed open borders and integration, whereas coronavirus has made it a fortress.“The pandemic is a decisive moment,” Krastev says. “But maybe not in the sense of the train changing direction, but rather, speeding up.”Additional reporting by Javier EspinozaLetter in response to this article:Europe’s lockdown sceptics echo Enlightenment critics / From Sebastian Woller, Zurich, Switzerland
320  The head of Spain’s employers’ federation has pleaded with Madrid to scale down or delay labour rule changes that the government has promised Brussels it will deliver this year in return for billions of euros of EU funds.In an interview with the Financial Times, Antonio Garamendi, head of the Spanish Confederation of Business Organisations, or CEOE, said botched reforms could hurt companies’ competitiveness.The changes being negotiated between Garamendi, the unions and the government are Spain’s highest-profile EU commitment this year. They affect areas such as the rules for collective bargaining, temporary contracts, subcontracting and retraining schemes.“A minimalist agreement could well be much more efficient in the time [available] than a maximalist disagreement,” said Garamendi, whose organisation represents more than 2m companies. “It is not easy to sit down and talk for 20 days and change everything under an approach [that applies to] the whole workforce.” He said the promise to deliver the reforms by December 31 was of the government’s choosing, suggesting the talks could be extended beyond that date — an idea the administration has shot down.The dispute shows the potential pitfalls of the work programme that the minority government has hammered out with Brussels — containing deadlines for about 100 reforms.The EU says the reforms have to be carried out on time if Spain is to access the €70bn of grants under the bloc’s coronavirus recovery plan. The next instalment of €14bn is due in the first quarter of next year.The government’s labour rules plans are particularly contentious. They build on a key provision in the agreement that set up Spain’s leftwing coalition government — to scrap 2012 reforms that reduced businesses’ costs by cutting severance pay and privileging business-specific over sector-wide negotiations.The government says those changes hit workers unjustly, pointing out that Spain remains a high unemployment country — the jobless rate is more than 14 per cent — and that a quarter of employees are on temporary contracts.Critics say the 2012 reforms helped Spain export its way out of the deep recession that followed the financial crisis.“The European Commission, the ECB, the OECD, the Bank of Spain all say that the labour reform secured the recovery,” said Garamendi. “There are things we can improve, for example, regarding the use of temporary contracts, but be careful of changing things that work.We must have competitive businesses.”The government’s plans would, among other changes, restore the priority of sector-wide negotiations, increase the rights of subcontractors and limit the use of temporary contracts.The CEOE’s call for a slimmed-down accord and a possible extension of the deadline is particularly significant because the EU recovery programme workplan signed by Madrid and Brussels requires the government to negotiate the changes with business and unions “respecting social dialogue”.But Yolanda Díaz, Spain’s communist employment minister, said this week that the government was “committed to go ahead with this reform and we will do so on time, as it has to be”.Her staff argue that the changes have been worked on for months. They add that the changes will have to be implemented by year-end, with or without an agreement with business.Garamendi highlighted that the CEOE had already reached 12 accords with the government. But recently the employers’ organisation has dissented over government moves to increase the minimum salary and revise the regime for contributions to state pensions — the other big reform Madrid promised to Brussels this year.Those plans are set to increase employers’ social security contributions.
321  Moored off the small Arctic town of Pevek is the Akademik Lomonosov — a floating nuclear power plant that shows how President Vladimir Putin’s ambitions for Russia’s far east are taking shape.This port on the northern coast of Siberia was once notorious as a Soviet gulag. These days it is part of Moscow’s plan to open up a major shipping lane through the Arctic and bring natural resources within easier reach.Pevek’s harbour is only ice-free for four months a year but is intended to become a hub for commercial shipping on the so-called Northern Sea Route as climate change gradually eases the passage through the Arctic. And the power provided by the Akademik Lomonosov is intended to help Pevek become a gateway to Chukotka, a region close to Alaska and rich in gold, silver, copper, lithium and other metals.“Without the NSR, without the port, there would be no Pevek,” said Maxim Zhurbin, Pevek’s deputy mayor, during an interview in the town in October.Few in Pevek seem concerned by the nuclear reactor in the harbour.“Fear? We have none. Perhaps Russians are not afraid of anything any more. We have seen and lived through everything. We have to be optimistic,” said Igor Ranav, a locally born businessman. “We were told the plant is made with the latest technology and it is safe, and I hope so.”“It is excellent that it is here,” said Natalia Koveshnikova, a retired accountant who has lived in Pevek most of her life. “It is the first year we have had heating and hot water year round.”Development of the NSR is in the hands of Rosatom, the state nuclear corporation. As well as commissioning the Akademik Lomonosov, Rosatom is also in charge of nuclear-powered icebreakers that the company expects will help to open up year-round Arctic navigation by the middle of the decade.Rosatom has not revealed how much it is investing but insists its Arctic ventures will make a return. “For us it is mainly business. And creating the conditions for the projects now, we base it on the investment viability,” said Rosatom’s head Alexei Likhachev.Upon full ramp-up by 2023, the nuclear plant in Pevek is expected to power several resources projects including Mayskoye, a gold mine developed by UK-listed miner Polymetal, and Pyrkakay, one of the country’s largest tin deposits.Rosatom plans to install four more floating nuclear plants by the end of the decade across the Chaunskaya Bay to provide power to the Baimskaya copper mining project. The large deposit — of a metal now in high demand for its use in renewable energy technologies — was discovered in Soviet days but lack of technology, equipment, and infrastructure delayed its development.“The project is in the middle of nowhere. There is no electricity, no roads, no access,” said Oleg Novachuk, chief executive of Kaz Minerals, the miner in charge of the $12bn project, which is expected to start production by 2028.With the floating reactors, the project will have a power source at predictable costs for about 60 years.Developing Chukotka along with the rest of the Arctic has long been a goal for Putin and Russia, which this week is hosting a plenary meeting of the Arctic Council, where the eight countries of the region are represented.“Russia should expand through the Arctic, as this is where it has its main mineral resources,” Putin said in 2017, when Russia first produced liquefied natural gas in the Arctic and exported it via the NSR.NSR shipments have increased from 1.5m tonnes in 2000 to 33m tonnes last year, mainly of gas and oil. After his latest re-election in 2018, Putin said volumes should reach 80m tonnes in 2024.Rosatom expects the volume of all Russian exports going via the route to reach 110m tonnes in the next decade, while also attracting international transit, which it estimates will start around 2025 and reach at least 30m tonnes in 2030.Rosatom believes the standstill in the Suez Canal this year, when trade was disrupted by a stranded container vessel, boosts its case for the NSR. It says the route is often shorter and so can be competitive despite the need to hire icebreakers to escort ships in winter.For example, a trip from South Korea’s Busan to Rotterdam in the Netherlands would take 27 to 28 days via the NSR compared with 40 days via the Suez Canal, according to Rosatom.“Twelve days of difference, when you’re shipping cargo worth $1bn, is a sizeable figure,” said Kirill Komarov, first deputy head of Rosatom.DP World, the United Arab Emirates logistics company and port operator, became the first international company to sign an NSR transit partnership agreement with Rosatom in July, pledging a $2bn investment in its infrastructure and additional fleet.The coronavirus pandemic, which interrupted global supply chains, is also showing the need for more routes, said Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, chief executive of DP World.Managing efficient shipping all year round remains a challenge for Rosatom, although the overall climate change is playing a part. In the past 40 years, the Arctic ice cap has halved in the warmest month of September and by 10 per cent in the coldest month of March, according to the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute.By mid-century, the institute expects ice levels to lose another two-thirds in the summer, and to halve in winter.The warming ocean is expected to help cut shipment cost. Less ice means fewer icebreakers and faster journeys.Still, weather forecasting and safety in the winter ice remain an issue, especially in the NSR’s eastern leg. Ice covered the Arctic seas sooner than expected in November and trapped 24 ships.Rosatom’s Likhachev attributed the situation to an inaccurate weather forecast, an increased demand for the route and shifting shipping schedules due to the pandemic.Meanwhile, the residents of Pevek are getting the rare sense of being part of a growing economy.“We came to a dark city. For the first couple of years life was fading out here, people were leaving and there were rumours the town would get closed,” said Pavel Rozhkov, an IT specialist who came from Moscow nine years ago as a Baptist missionary.“Then came the news that they will build a floating nuclear plant.large investment has started flowing into the town, the town has started developing.”This story has been changed since publication to remove a reference to the Akademik Lomonosov as the world’s first floating nuclear plant
1  WHEN RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN speaks, the Turkish lira generally listens, shudders, and falls off a cliff. For once, something different happened. Facing a crisis of his own making, Turkey’s leader took a dramatic step to save the lira on December 20th, moments after the currency had plummeted to a new record low. The government, he announced, would guarantee bank deposits in lira, protecting them from swings in the exchange rate. The lira rebounded spectacularly on the news, moving from 18.36 to as low as 11.11 against the dollar, its biggest rally for nearly four decades. Under the new plan, the Turkish government will compensate holders of lira deposits whenever the currency’s depreciation tops the interest rate offered by their banks. For example, were the lira to slide by 30% against the dollar in a single year, an account holder at a bank with a 14% deposit rate would pocket the difference, courtesy of Turkey’s treasury.Turkey’s economy is not close to being out of the woods. But at the very least, Mr Erdogan’s stopgap solution has, for now, reassured investors that Turkey’s leader is aware of the need to rescue the lira. The scheme may have also prevented a run on the banks. Turks have been converting their savings to dollars at a record pace over the past month. Lately, some of them had begun considering withdrawing their savings altogether. “People had begun to lose trust in the banking system,” says Ozlem Derici Sengul, founding partner at Spinn Consulting in Istanbul. “The decision stopped this.”The lira’s collapse was triggered largely by Mr Erdogan’s decision to bring interest rates down sharply, no matter the cost. Before this week’s drama, the currency had lost nearly 50% of its dollar value in just two months. Mr Erdogan seemed unmoved, defending his rate cuts and pledging to stay the course. He invoked an Islamic injunction against usury. “As a Muslim,” he said on December 19th, “I will continue doing what [our religion] tells us.”Yet the plan he has come up with is in fact an indirect interest rate hike indexed to the dollar. “You receive the current deposit rate and on top of that you can get the differential, so that’s an incentive for foreign currency holders to switch into lira,” says Emre Akcakmak, managing director of Greenwest Consultancy in Dubai. But it is no alternative to monetary tightening. “It’s not sustainable,” says Mr Akcakmak, “because the burden on the treasury will grow as long as this is in place.”Until now, it was Turkish depositors who have been shouldering the risk of wild swings in the exchange rate. From now on, it will be Turkish taxpayers. “The public finances, considered to be a pillar of strength over the past decade or so, now risk crumbling,” writes Jason Tuvey of Capital Economics. The measures also risk adding to Turkey’s inflation woes. The official inflation rate, which most Turks consider to be well below the actual rate, climbed to over 21% in November. Analysts expect it to reach up to 50% in the first half of 2022, especially after a 50% increase in the minimum wage, announced earlier this month, goes into effect. Mr Erdogan’s new scheme risks making things worse. Any further substantial fall in the value of the lira means the central bank may end up having no choice but to print money to reimburse lira depositors. Mr Erdogan may have thrown a blanket over a fire he himself started. The blanket too might soon catch fire.
2  THE HIGHLY infectious Omicron variant already accounts for a majority of covid-19 cases in London. It is now surging in continental Europe, prompting governments there to rush in new rules. Germany is imposing a 14-day quarantine on all travellers arriving from Britain, starting on December 20th. France closed its borders to tourists from Britain on December 18th. Restrictions on international travel will not be enough to contain the spread of the variant, however. On December 19th the Netherlands introduced a strict new lockdown, which will last until at least January 14th. Tighter rules are in prospect elsewhere, too.The scramble comes just as many European countries had begun to turn the corner on a prior wave of infections caused by the Delta variant. A peak had been passed in Germany and the Netherlands; the rate of increase in new cases in France had also begun to slow. Omicron is upending such trends. It is taking over in Denmark. The variant is spreading across the rest of Europe at “lightning speed”, said Jean Castex, the French prime minister, on December 17th, with the number of new cases due to Omicron doubling every two to three days. Oliver Véran, the French health minister, says that the variant could make up a majority of cases in France by Christmas.Even if Omicron turns out to be less severe than Delta (which is still not clear), the scale of this oncoming wave means that the number of serious cases may rise. Many front-line health workers may themselves be off work due to infection, putting further pressure on hospitals. To win some time, and ease this pressure, European governments have two principal weapons at their disposal. One is to accelerate the roll-out of booster jabs, in order to increase protection. The other is to limit social interactions, with the hope of slowing transmission.Start with boosters. The western edge of the European Union in particular has made good progress in administering first doses of covid-19 vaccines. Nearly 89% of the Portuguese, 83% of the Spanish, 80% of the French and 79% of the Italians have received at least one vaccine dose. This compares with 76% in Britain, 73% in Germany, 73% in America and even lower proportions in parts of central and eastern Europe. But booster shots seem to afford more significant protection against Omicron, and against severe cases in particular. Britain is ahead in this race: more than 40% of its population has had a booster, compared with 18% in America. The share is only 30% in Germany, 24% in France, and 23% in Italy.Europe is now racing to step up its booster roll-out. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, in late November opened up boosters to all over-18s. He also warned the over-65s that the French covid pass, a digital certificate required for entry to restaurants, bars and other indoor venues, would expire in mid-December unless the bearer had received a booster. Arms are now being jabbed at a decent rate. Karl Lauterbach, the new German health minister, announced that 1.5m boosters were given on one day last week. France set a new record on December 16th, with nearly 900,000 in a single day.But the European health agency warned on December 15th that even with a faster booster roll-out, health-care systems could struggle to cope unless rules on social contact are “further strengthened without delay”. This is why European countries are turning to their second weapon, tighter restrictions on travel and other activities. The Dutch have imposed the toughest new rules on their own citizens to date. All bars, restaurants, cinemas, non-essential shops and indoor sports centres have now closed for a month. Sporting events will take place in empty stadiums. Families will be allowed to invite only four guests aged 13 and over into their homes during Christmas. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, said that he had no choice given that the variant was spreading “even faster” than had been expected.For now France has imposed neither a lockdown nor a curfew. But Mr Castex did say on December 17th that he is planning to turn the country’s covid pass into a proper vaccine pass. Currently, a negative covid-19 test can also be used to gain access to restaurants and other public places. A new law, to go before parliament in January, would limit entry to those who have been jabbed. When Mr Macron tightened the rules governing the covid pass back in July, and said that vaccination would be compulsory for health-care workers from September, this acted as a big nudge to get vaccinated. The government hopes that the new rule, if passed, will have a similar effect. Italy has already imposed a similar rule. Austria has gone further still: vaccination will become mandatory there in February, with a large fine for those who refuse. Germany is considering a similar step.The timing of the Omicron wave is particularly awkward in France, for two reasons. One is economic: hotel and restaurant businesses in the Alps, which rely heavily on British tourists over Christmas and New Year, have warned of a disastrous start to their season because of the border restrictions. But the bigger problem is political. France holds a presidential election in April, and January is traditionally the start of the campaign season. Mr Macron, who is expected to run for re-election, is in no mood to impose a fresh lockdown or to close schools. The French were under a nightly curfew for months last winter, and memories of the strain of that period linger.Omicron’s arrival could mean that the national political conversation will shift. So far, under pressure from populist-nationalists, immigration and identity politics have dominated the debate. These could now be eclipsed once again by public health. That could be to Mr Macron’s advantage, as voters seek reassurance and continuity. But nobody, the president included, will relish the idea of campaigning as the national mood darkens.All our stories relating to the pandemic can be found on our coronavirus hub.

3  WHEN DANES think about Lolland, which is not very often, they tend to feel sorry for it. The island in the Baltic sea, a flat expanse of fields and beaches, enjoyed brief notoriety in 2015 thanks to a TV documentary series, “On the Ass in Nakskov”, about privation in its largest town. Nakskov fell on hard times after its shipyard closed in 1986. People have been leaving the island for decades. Since 2007 its population has dropped from 49,000 to 41,000. Those outsiders Lolland still attracts are largely low-income households seeking cheaper lodgings than they can find in Copenhagen.Listen to this story. But now work has begun on a tunnel linking Lolland to the German island of Fehmarn, 18km (11 miles) away. When it opens in 2029 Lolland will no longer be “just a small rural community as far from Copenhagen as you can get,” says Thomas Knudsen, its top civil servant. It will cut in half, to 90 minutes, the time it takes to drive to Hamburg. More German tourists will flock to Lolland’s beaches, he hopes. Green industries will set up shop, taking advantage of the windy island’s surplus of renewable energy.If Lolland is to fulfil its ambitions it will need immigrants. The Fehmarnbelt tunnel will itself require thousands of workers, many of whom will be non-Danes. Unlike the national government in Copenhagen, Lolland has no qualms about welcoming them. In August the local government opened an international school. Its 55 pupils have origins as far afield as Tanzania and India. Some are Muslims. The locals’ response has been “optimistic positivity”, says Dominic Maher, the school’s head teacher.Lolland does not just need tunnellers; it has placed English-language adverts to recruit doctors, too. Private firms need everyone from “engineers to unskilled labour”, says Mr Knudsen. Lolland would happily take Afghan refugees. Its plans to recruit foreign labour were blessed by the local branch of the generally anti-immigrant Danish People’s Party.One reason for its openness is earlier experiences of immigration. Poles came to harvest sugar beet in the years before the first world war. Some refugees from the Balkan war in the 1990s stayed and thrived. The refugees Mr Knudsen is most worried about are those “from the Copenhagen real-estate market”.That puts the islanders at odds with the national government, which wants to keep immigration from non-Western countries as low as possible. But they do not disagree about everything. Lolland would not welcome poorly educated refugees who would burden the economy rather than buoy it. But in this part of Denmark, productivity matters more than passports.
4  MJOLNERPARKEN, A HOUSING project in Copenhagen’s multi-ethnic Norrebro district, is pleasantly landscaped and dotted with sports pitches. The only signs of anything amiss are banners hanging from white balconies bearing slogans like “I’ll never move”. By next autumn many of the 1,500 residents may have to. That is because Denmark’s government deems Mjolnerparken to be a “parallel society”. Too many of its residents are hard-up, or jobless, or poorly educated, or have criminal records and are of “non-Western” origin. To comply with its policy of breaking up what the government until recently called “ghettos”, Mjolnerparken’s owner is to sell two of the four apartment blocks to investors. Other citizens will move in.Listen to this story. This is one of a number of ways in which Denmark is trying to control where and how immigrants live. On December 1st its Social Democratic government enacted a law to prevent the formation of parallel societies by obliging local authorities to give preference in “prevention areas” to well-educated people with jobs when assigning housing. It is even keener to deter migrants from arriving in the first place. In March it was the first EU country to say it would send Syrians back to Syria, arguing that Damascus and its environs are now safe. Mette Frederiksen, Denmark’s prime minister, has set a goal of “zero asylum-seekers”. On December 13th a Danish court sentenced Inger Stoejberg, who was immigration minister in an earlier centre-right government, to 60 days in jail for ordering unlawfully that married asylum-seekers younger than 18 be housed separately from their spouses. She says the policy’s intent was to discourage child marriage. Anti-immigrant parties hail her as a martyr.Denmark is hardly the only country to pull up the drawbridge. Europe suffered political convulsions after an influx of refugees in 2015; most governments are eager to avoid a repeat. But in some ways Denmark stands out. Unlike their counterparts in Hungary, say, its politicians do not denounce immigrants to distract attention from their own failings. Denmark differs from neighbouring Sweden, which in 2015 took in more Syrian asylum-seekers as a share of its population than any other European country except Turkey. Sweden “cherishes multiculturalism”, says Tina Gudrun Jensen, an anthropologist at Malmo University. “In Denmark multiculturalism is really a negative word.”This approach is earning Danes a bad press. “Denmark leading the race to the bottom” ran a recent headline. But for some governments it is a role model. Mattias Tesfaye, the immigration and integration minister, said recently that he had just hosted a delegation from Greece and expected one from Austria. Britain has reportedly talked to Denmark about co-operating to process asylum applications in some faraway place such as Rwanda. Even Sweden is becoming more like its southern neighbour.The Danish difference has deep roots. After the Danish crown lost the largely German-speaking duchies of Schleswig and Holstein to Prussia in 1864 it drew the lesson that the country must “stick together [and] be homogeneous”, says Ulf Hedetoft, a scholar of nationalism at the University of Copenhagen. A law two years later stipulated that only people who spoke Danish and wore Danish clothes could become Danes. It is still difficult. MIPEX, an index that ranks countries according to how well policies promote integration of immigrants, scores the access Denmark gives to citizenship as a “halfway favourable” 41, compared with Sweden’s “favourable” 83.In the 1960s and 1970s Denmark recruited “guest workers”; refugees from Vietnam and Iran came in the 1970s and 1980s. The welcome waned in the 1990s with the arrival of refugees from the war in what had been Yugoslavia. The nationalist Danish People’s Party (DF), founded in 1995, agitated to shut the door on them. In 2001 it backed a conservative-liberal government, which devised today’s two-pronged strategy of repelling would-be migrants and remoulding those who settle.Its policies included lengthening immigrants’ wait for permanent residency from three years to seven and ending schools’ obligation to teach in pupils’ mother tongues. To bolster Danishness it introduced “canons” of culture, history and democracy into the school curriculum. Without such steps “it would have been really catastrophic”, says Peter Skaarup, the DF’s parliamentary leader.In Sweden, such sentiments are spreading; in Denmark they are now conventional wisdom. “The social democratic welfare state can only survive if we have migration under control,” says Mr Tesfaye, whose father was a refugee from Ethiopia. Denmark may be the world’s second-happiest country, according to a recent survey, but its happiness feels fragile.Denmark’s defence of its welfare state is ruthless and, say critics, racist. In October the finance ministry, in its annual report on the issue, estimated that in 2018 immigrants from non-Western countries and their descendants drained from public finances a net 31bn kroner ($4.9bn), some 1.4% of GDP. Immigrants from Western countries, by contrast, contributed a net 7bn kroner (see chart). Data on immigration’s fiscal effects were what “changed the Social Democrats’ point of view”, says Torben Tranaes of the Danish Centre for Social Science Research.Muslims are at the core of the issue. This year was the first time the ministry reported separately on the contributions by people from 24 Muslim countries. They account for 50% of the non-Westerners, but 77% of the drain. Alongside that worry are fears that Muslims bring notions about democracy and the role of women that Danes find threatening. Muslims are welcome, says Mr Tesfaye, but, “We can’t meet in the middle. It’s not half sharia and half the Danish constitution.”To Muslim ears that sounds like bias. A law passed in 2018, aimed at conservative Muslims, obliges new citizens to shake hands with a municipal official in naturalisation ceremonies. Politicians “make you feel like you have to not celebrate Ramadan or Eid or anything”, says Agob Yacoub, a Syrian refugee. Other groups are not subject to such pressure. Chinese immigrants have not become culturally Danish but are nonetheless “extremely welcome”, notes Mr Hedetoft. The Muslims’ drain on the treasury probably has little to do with religion. More than half came as asylum-seekers or through family reunification, compared with 30% of other non-Westerners.Like its Scandinavian neighbours, Denmark enrols new migrants in programmes that include language and civics classes. But its benefits system is, characteristically, a bit tougher. Payments are lower for people who have not lived in the country for seven out of eight years. This serves both to deter immigrants and to encourage those who do settle to work. Denmark can boast that the gap in unemployment between natives and non-European immigrants is smaller than Sweden’s. But that may be in part because Sweden has higher effective minimum wages in relation to its average wage, which prices many new immigrants out of jobs, especially if they do not speak Swedish well.The justification for breaking up neighbourhoods like Mjolnerparken seems flimsy. Its parallel-society status is based in part on the fact that 2.69% of its residents had a criminal conviction a couple of years ago. The allowable limit is 2.35%. The number of young men involved in crime is “less and less every year”, believes Majken Felle, a primary-school teacher who lives in one of the blocks slated for sale. Far from forming a parallel society, Mjolnerparken’s Muslims come from many countries and speak to each other in Danish; it is the younger generation’s mother tongue.The example of Malak Tumeh, a medical student, is a rebuke to Danes who think Muslims do not belong, but should also give pause to those who think Denmark’s monoculturalism will inevitably alienate them. The daughter of an Iraqi mother and Palestinian father, she arrived in Denmark in 2001 at four months old. Without residence permits her parents could not work in their professions (her mother trained as a microbiologist, her father was a biochemist). He sold pizza and worked in construction to make ends meet. When Ms Tumeh was six, police searched her home for fake passports; they “yanked” her by her bag, she says. Religious studies at school centred on Christianity.Yet Denmark and the Tumehs have adapted to each other. Religion teachers “asked my parents to share their experiences with Islam”, says Ms Tumeh. They brought a Koran to class. Ms Tumeh and her father finally became permanent residents in 2020; her father got citizenship last year. Not yet a citizen herself, Ms Tumeh considers herself to be Danish. “The past could have been easier, but it’s still a good life, better than many people could imagine,” she says. It is not easy to become a new Dane. But for the few that do, the struggle is worthwhile. 
5  IN 2021 BULGARIANS voted in three general elections and a presidential one. They ended 12 years of domination by Boyko Borisov, a bull-necked former bodyguard whose period in power saw incomes rise, the population fall and lurid tales of corruption proliferate. But it was only this week that a new coalition government finally took the reins of power. Make way for “the Harvards”, the political pairing now performing a double act.Listen to this story. Kiril Petkov, aged 41, and Assen Vassilev, aged 44, are the new prime minister and finance minister respectively, having earlier this year served in the country’s interim government. Both studied at Harvard Business School. Both became successful entrepreneurs after returning home. But that is not the only reason they are dubbed “the Harvards”. In 2008 they together opened a centre in Sofia affiliated to the school, offering courses on economic strategy and competitiveness. Many of their graduates are either already MPs for the new government or will fan out to run bits of the administration.In September the pair created a party called We Continue the Change, echoing what they had started as interim ministers. In the most recent election, on November 14th, it came first, winning almost 26% of the vote; it has taken them a good month to put a coalition together.Bulgaria is the poorest country in the EU, but the Harvard duo say it shouldn’t be. “Bulgaria is not a poor country,” says Mr Vassilev. It has simply been “brutally plundered”. Mr Petkov says they became frustrated because, according to the economic models they were teaching, all of Bulgaria’s advantages (location, EU membership, a decent education system) should have made it “an amazing growth success story”. Instead, it has stagnated thanks to corruption and bad management. Mr Petkov says they hoped that a new leader would emerge whom they could advise as experts. When that did not happen, they decided, “ OK, let’s do it!”—on their own.When he was 13, Mr Petkov’s parents emigrated to Canada. He earned a degree in finance and landed a job working for a Canadian food giant, McCain. But his sights were set on bigger things than oven chips. In 2005 he wrote in his application to Harvard that he wanted to be finance minister of Bulgaria. On graduating he raised money for a retail park outside Sofia, then invested first in equipment for clearing birds off runways and next in probiotics.Mr Petkov and Mr Vassilev were not widely known in Bulgaria until recently, but they are not political novices. Mr Vassilev was briefly minister for the economy in 2013. Mr Petkov has long been a champion of green causes and hit the news in 2018 when he flew to Nepal on a mission to find a missing Bulgarian mountaineer.Ognyan Georgiev, editor of “Kapital Insights”, an online business publication, says the duo remind him of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown’s partnership in Britain during the 1990s. He says Mr Petkov is “energetic, outspoken, optimistic and wildly charismatic and wants to be the face of the whole thing”, whereas Mr Vassilev is the reserved, cerebral half of the duo.Vessela Tcherneva of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank, warns that the pair must act fast to achieve results, especially with their anti-corruption agenda, because the popularity that has come with being new and upbeat can quickly evaporate. The pair need to secure a prompt and impressive corruption conviction, she says, and that is easier said than done. The chief prosecutor, whom the incoming government cannot legally remove, is a man of the ancien régime. Indeed, all Bulgaria’s institutions and much of its media are run by people loyal to Mr Borisov and his allies. The Borisov team may be out, but they are far from gone.Other EU members, meanwhile, want Bulgaria to lift its veto on the initiation of talks on membership with North Macedonia—part of a row over language and historical identity. Mr Petkov says he has a plan for that, but that it will take time. His first concern, he says, is to put an end to a shabby understanding whereby the EU turned a blind eye to Bulgaria’s corruption so long as Bulgaria did not become a troublemaker like Hungary. 
6  WHEN EMMANUEL MACRON peers under his Christmas tree this year, he will find that le Père Noël has left him an unusually big, tantalisingly shiny, but awkwardly shaped gift. Call it a year in a present. For 2022 brings a double challenge. From January for six months, France will run the European Union’s rotating jamboree, the presidency of the Council of the EU. Yet Mr Macron is also expected to be campaigning for re-election as French president in April. To run Europe, as the job will doubtless be portrayed at home, as well as France, sounds like a Macron fantasy come true. For other Europeans, the president’s gift, like a toy trumpet, could turn out to be noisy, unpredictable and exhausting.This is not the first time the rotating presidency coincides with a French election. In 1995 a frail François Mitterrand did a four-month stint, before handing over to his successor, Jacques Chirac, for two. Squads of bureaucrats ensure continuity. These days the rotating EU inter-ministerial presidency is largely procedural. Much of the stuff to be discussed in 2022—the regulation of big tech and hate speech online, an external-border carbon tax, a minimum wage—has been in the works in Brussels for months.But Mr Macron is not one to let process hobble his ambition. There he was beneath the chandeliers at the Elysée Palace on December 9th, setting off an avalanche of ideas under the cryptic heading “recovery, power, belonging”. Europe, he declared, will finalise a common security-threat assessment, discuss new rules on deficits and debt, agree to green clauses for future trade deals, rework the border-free Schengen zone, and more. There will be summits on the ocean, Africa, a new European growth model and the Western Balkans. The overarching aim, he declared, was to fashion a Europe “powerful in the world, fully sovereign, free in its choices and master of its destiny”. Nothing less.Those who had thought Mr Macron might scale back his grand vision were bamboozled. Days earlier an official report, led by Thierry Chopin at the Institut Jacques Delors, had advised “more humility” and less grandstanding: in its words, “more Robert Schuman, less Victor Hugo”. Fellow Europeans do not like to feel bossed about by France. Many suspect it of wrapping national interest in an EU flag. But his lofty European ambition helped to propel Mr Macron into the French presidency in 2017, and in office it shaped a landmark speech at the Sorbonne. A return to that zeal also marks, unofficially, the start of his re-election campaign.To see how these two political moments might interact, consider a project in the northern industrial town of Douai, which sits amid flat agricultural plains on the edge of a mining basin. Mounds of harvested sugar beet lie on the dark earth in surrounding fields. Terraced two-storey homes are of the distinctive red brick of the French north. On the town’s fringe, next to a vast boxy Renault car plant, work will soon begin on a “gigafactory” to build electric-vehicle batteries. With €200m ($225m) in public subsidy, under the EU’s green-deal rules, and a private-sector investment of €2bn, the plant could employ over 2,000 workers by 2030.For Mr Macron, who toured the site six months ago, the gigafactory exemplifies his Sorbonne vision of “European sovereignty” or “strategic autonomy”: the reinforcement of the EU’s ability to build, decide and defend itself more. Back then Mr Macron was judged a dreamer, protectionist, or worse. But the European conversation has shifted. Even Germany’s new coalition government, under Chancellor Olaf Scholz, embraces “strategic sovereignty”, a term that conveniently merges two of Mr Macron’s own. Douai, so to speak, is where the tyres of the Macron Euro-vision hit the road.Locally, the factory is welcomed as a means of “anchoring” Douai and showcasing its industrial culture, says Frédéric Chéreau, the Socialist mayor. Jobs are much needed. There is talk of an “electric valley”. Yet the plant also exposes two problems for Mr Macron. First, the investor, Envision AESC, is Sino-Japanese. Although batteries will be French-built, this hints at the limits to European self-sufficiency. Second, voters may not thank the centrist Mr Macron for it. In 2017 Douai backed him in the second round, but in the first preferred the populist-nationalist Marine Le Pen and the hard-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon. The rust belt is not Mr Macron’s natural territory, however many new factories have emerged on his watch. The EU, says Douai’s mayor, is seen as a “necessary evil”, not a force that stirs the mind or warms the heart.O come, o come, EmmanuelIndeed, Europe as a campaign theme has just got trickier for Mr Macron. Polls had suggested that his chief opponent would be Ms Le Pen. He champions the EU; she derides it; nobody is confused. Yet the election of Valérie Pécresse, a pro-European ex-budget minister, as the centre-right Republicans’ nominee blurs that line. Polls give her a good chance of facing Mr Macron in the run-off; one says she could beat him. Europe does not divide the pair. Mr Macron will try, instead, to use the EU to expose the Republicans’ internal divisions over it, which helped him in 2017 to steal so many of them, and which Mrs Pécresse may struggle to disguise. But it will be harder.The president’s present carries other risks. As Mr Macron criss-crosses France, and home news channels label him “le président de l’Europe”, rival candidates will denounce unfair electioneering. As he pushes pet projects, such as the reform of EU fiscal rules, other countries will struggle to consider France an honest broker, not least because of its own rule-busting budgets. Smaller countries are anyway wary. They recall that the last big country in charge, Germany, pushed through a controversial investment pact with China in the closing days of 2020, to others’ irritation.Mr Macron’s Christmas present may yet turn out to be just what he asked for. Success in Europe could help him secure victory in France. But neither is by any means guaranteed. The president could end up wishing that he had simply asked for socks. 
7  KARL LAUTERBACH has his work cut out. The newly appointed German health minister, an epidemiologist trained at Harvard, took over last week at a time when infection rates from covid-19 are hitting record highs. Some overwhelmed hospitals have had to dispatch critically ill patients to other states. And the probably much more infectious Omicron variant, which has only just begun to spread, threatens to make all this much worse.Throughout the pandemic Mr Lauterbach has been one of the most prominent voices sounding the alarm, and in some ways reality is now even gloomier than his dire predictions. Around 1m Germans are currently infected with covid-19. On December 10th 510 Germans died with or of the disease. Around a quarter of those deaths were in Saxony, the state with the lowest rate of vaccination.Managing the pandemic this winter is the most pressing of several big challenges facing the incoming government of Olaf Scholz, who was sworn in as Germany’s new chancellor on December 8th. In Mr Lauterbach he has chosen an advocate of strict restrictions on the unvaccinated; the closure of entertainment venues, clubs and bars until the fourth wave of the pandemic abates; and mandatory vaccination. A prolific user of Twitter (there was even a hashtag, #WewantKarl, backing his selection as health minister) and frequent guest on TV talk shows, he has become one of Germany’s best-known covid Cassandras. His strict prescriptions and sombre admonitions have earned him death threats from those who see such ideas as an assault on liberty.Both the current near-lockdown for the unvaccinated and the discussion about mandatory vaccination are highly controversial. On December 11th thousands of people took to the streets in Hamburg to protest against vaccinations for children and federal and local rules excluding the unvaccinated from restaurants, bars, entertainment venues and most shops. In several smaller German cities opponents of the federal and state governments’ covid policies marched in the streets at the weekend. At least three of the marches resulted in injuries to police officers and journalists. Far bigger demonstrations can be expected if a vaccine mandate for all is introduced, in particular because political leaders have insisted for months that they would not impose such a measure.Last week the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, voted for a vaccine mandate for health-care workers that will start on March 16th. Mr Scholz has already come out in favour of mandatory vaccination though he said he would allow the government’s MPs to vote their conscience. Representatives of the federal government and the states, who meet regularly, have already announced they will discuss “in the near future” a bill making vaccination mandatory, probably from late February or March. More than 70% of those polled in a recent survey backed mandatory vaccination.The mandate, if it arrives, will come too late to help suppress the current wave. This means that Germans are again facing subdued holiday celebrations at best. Most Christmas parties and many of the country’s pretty outdoor Christmas markets have been cancelled. Volker Wissing, the new transport minister, has already advised against travelling during the holidays. America’s State Department and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention have moved Germany to their highest-risk category for travel, which means that even vaccinated Americans are advised not to go there. Stephan Weil, the premier of Lower Saxony, has announced a “quiet period” from December 24th to January 2nd that includes the closure of all Christmas markets, discos and clubs. Gatherings of more than ten are allowed only if everyone is either vaccinated or immune through recovery as well as tested. Other states are likely to follow Lower Saxony, which has lower rates of infection and death than many other states.Mr Lauterbach is now trying both to stress how serious the current outbreak is and to tone down the debate on how to fight it. He re-tweeted a chart on December 11th that shows how the Omicron variant, even if much milder, could lead to many more deaths because of its higher transmission rates. In an interview with Spiegel, a weekly, he said: “From what we know so far, the new Omicron variant is affecting children much more strongly than the previous variants.” They also fall ill more severely, he added, urging parents to vaccinate children older than five. At the same time he said that “nobody is going to be sent to jail” for resisting mandatory vaccination, though refuseniks will have to pay a fine. At what level a fine will be effective, if there is to be one, will be determined by consulting economists and psychologists.Mr Lauterbach’s strategy for breaking the fourth wave is a rapid ramp-up of booster shots as well as introducing mandatory vaccination. On a popular talk show on December 12th he argued that, had it not been for the Delta variant, Germany could have managed without mandatory vaccination. The Delta and especially the Omicron variants have made it unavoidable, he said. “Even a vaccination rate of 90% among adults is not enough against Omicron,” he argued, since the vaccine does not offer watertight protection against infection. Most new government ministers get a short honeymoon when they take over so they can get to know their portfolio. Mr Lauterbach did not get a single day. His handling of the pandemic will determine the verdict on Mr Scholz’s first year in office—and maybe even his entire term.
8  THE DUTCH are not used to being ranked among the worst in Europe. But that is where they stand in covid booster vaccinations: 4.1% of the population have had an extra jab, just behind Romania at 5%. They started on November 18th, months after other countries. “It is impossible to explain,” says Roel Coutinho, a former head of the national outbreak-management team. He blames the Dutch culture of governing via exhaustive negotiations and consensus—a system known as the “polder model”.Listen to this story.Indeed, almost nine months after elections last March, the country has no new government. For months the ruling centre-right Liberal party locked horns with one of its junior partners, the centre-left D66 party, which wanted more leftist outfits in the coalition. D66 backed down, but an agreement is only now nearing completion.The Dutch call such lengthy consultations polderen on the theory that they stem from the country’s history of land and water management. Maintaining polders in a sea-level landscape requires agreements to fix dykes and canals, even between opposing parties. In Dutch government, the polder model means that policy is set in years-long discussions with trade unions, industry associations, housing societies, cyclists—every stakeholder imaginable. In Dutch society, it means a fondness for lengthy meetings where everyone gets a turn.This consensual system is excellent for long-term planning. Dutch infrastructure and pensions are among the best in the world. But it can be disastrous in a crisis such as a pandemic. Decisions over curfews and vaccine passports are interminably delayed by debates between interest groups and government bodies. Meanwhile, the Dutch political scene has fragmented, and giving everyone a say is getting harder. There are 17 parties in parliament and four in the likely coalition—if they can bring the poldering to an end and strike a deal.Dig deeperAll our stories relating to the pandemic can be found on our coronavirus hub.

9  EXCEPTIONS PROVE who rules. In the summer of 2015 Angela Merkel suspended the EU’s asylum rules and allowed 1m people into Germany, in the most controversial decision of her tenure. Rather than being returned to their first port of entry in southern Europe, Syrians arriving in Germany were given a new life in Europe’s most prosperous country. Skip forward to December 2021 and asylum rules are being suspended again. This time the aim is to keep people out. Those crossing from Belarus into the EU now face up to four months in a detention centre while their application is processed. Others will not make it even that far. Polish border guards are pushing them back into Belarus, sometimes roughly. Willkommenskultur has been shown the door.Listen to this story. When it comes to asylum policy in the EU, it is as if Mrs Merkel’s “Wir schaffen das” (“We can manage this”) had never been spoken. Fences are springing up. Proposals to share the burden of asylum-seekers more evenly have been stuck for five years. It is far from an isolated case: the most significant policies Mrs Merkel pursued at a European level are being undone. The German chancellor left the European stage only on December 8th, when Olaf Scholz’s coalition of Social Democrats, liberals and Greens officially took power. Yet the mark left by this century’s foremost EU politician is already fading.Part of this is natural. Even in Germany, a land where consensus is king, a change of government leads to a change of policy. Take its position on central Europe. As chancellor, Mrs Merkel coddled Poland and Hungary as they trampled democratic norms. Mrs Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (and the Christian Social Union, its Bavarian sibling) hindered measures to curb Hungary and Poland’s governments, such as cutting EU funds or even just isolating them politically. In Mrs Merkel’s mind, the risk of division trumped fears about democracy.Under the new coalition, a stricter line will emerge. The coalition agreement contained tough provisions on respecting the rule of law. No German government can be seen to throw its weight around on Polish affairs, for fairly obvious reasons. Yet it can stop standing in the way of others, as Mrs Merkel did.It was a similar story when it came to reforming the EU. Whenever Emmanuel Macron pushed the accelerator of the Franco-German engine, Mrs Merkel would hit the clutch; the car would make a lot of noise, but not go anywhere. In a club of 27, staying still is usually the easiest compromise. It means no one is run over. But it was a particularly enticing option for Germany. After all, from a German perspective, the EU works rather well. It provides Germany with a currency that keeps exports cheap and a large market in which to sell them. Why change the status quo if it works?When Mrs Merkel lifted her foot from the clutch, things did happen. A €750bn ($845bn) fund to help EU countries recover from covid-19, paid for with common debt, was agreed on her watch. The former chancellor painted it as a pragmatic step in the extreme circumstances of the pandemic. Mr Scholz was comfortable labelling it as something more ambitious, calling potential EU-level taxes to pay for it a “Hamiltonian moment” in the vein of the American Founding Father. Making the fund a permanent fixture induces nausea both in the CDU/CSU and in parts of the coalition. Until recently, Germany could rely on a host of allies who agreed. Now those who would be keen on a repeat, or even making it permanent, are ascendant. If a tool has been used once, it can be used again.Continental political tides are moving against Mrs Merkel’s worldview. Nuclear power, which Mrs Merkel scrapped in Germany, is enjoying a renaissance. Eastern Europe and France are falling back in love with reliable, low-carbon electricity from nuclear plants. (Germany is fighting a rearguard action to stop the commission acknowledging that nuclear power is green.) Mrs Merkel once sat atop a cabal of centre-right leaders who set the direction of the club. At the start of the previous decade, the leader of practically every big EU country hailed from the centre-right. Now not one does. Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the prime minister of Greece (population: 11m), is the most prominent centre-right leader.A looser line on fiscal rules is emerging across the EU. Under Mrs Merkel, the German view on spending (bad) and saving (good) was foisted on a continent. As finance minister, the centre-left Mr Scholz took pains to play up the similarities between himself and Wolfgang Schäuble, his hardline CDU predecessor. Usually, passports matter more than politics when it comes to EU finance ministers. This time Christian Lindner, the new liberal finance minister, has done his best to avoid being painted as a hardliner. Under Chancellor Scholz, fiscal policy seems to be shuffling from one amenable to Germany to one more forgiving of southern Europe.Gone, but…also forgottenMrs Merkel was the strongest leader on the European stage because others were weak. Whereas Helmut Kohl had François Mitterrand and Charles de Gaulle had Konrad Adenauer, Mrs Merkel generally stood alone. Moments when political clout combined with competence, such as the rise of Mr Macron in France and Mario Draghi’s elevation to prime minister in Italy, are brief. Both could be gone next year. If Germany appears to dominate EU politics, it is as much down to the disorganisation of other governments as Teutonic strength.In a sense, Mrs Merkel’s erasure is cruel. Alongside Mr Draghi, she has the best claim of any leader to have kept the EU going. A less patient one might easily have ended up pushing Greece out of the eurozone; a more dogmatic one could have overseen the currency’s collapse. She helped the club survive some difficult times, yet she did not shape it. The memory of Mrs Merkel’s career will vanish like footprints in the snow. She kept the club together, yet barely left a mark. 
10  COULD THE French for the first time elect une présidente when they go to the polls next April? Ségolène Royal nearly got there as the Socialists’ candidate, in 2007, but was defeated by Nicolas Sarkozy. Ten years later Marine Le Pen, a populist-nationalist, was soundly beaten by the centrist Emmanuel Macron. Now the Gaullist political party is taking its turn. On December 4th the Republicans picked Valérie Pécresse, head of the Ile-de-France region around Paris, as their presidential candidate.Listen to this story.In a run-off primary vote among party members, Ms Pécresse trounced Eric Ciotti, a deputy from Nice and an anti-immigration hardliner from the party’s right wing, securing 61% of the vote to his 39%. Days later Elabe, a polling group, recorded a leap for Ms Pécresse from fourth to second place, suggesting she could beat Mr Macron in a run-off. Nomination bumps are common, and other polls recorded a smaller one. But the former budget minister and fellow graduate of the elite École Nationale d’Administration suddenly looks like a credible challenger.Before the primary campaign, Ms Pécresse was seen in some quarters as an outsider. Polls suggested that if selected by the Republicans she would do worse in a presidential vote than Xavier Bertrand, a rival primary candidate and head of the Hauts-de-France region. Like him, she had quit the party, for her part in exasperation at its fecklessness. But Ms Pécresse performed well in the four televised primary debates, coming across as serious, well-briefed and trenchant. She was also careful to remind viewers that she can be a vote-winner. Earlier this year she was re-elected head of the Ile-de-France region, crushing the hard right, the Greens and the centre. In the end, at the primary, party members preferred her to both Mr Bertrand and Michel Barnier, the European Union’s former Brexit negotiator, both of whom were eliminated in a tight vote in the first round.A long-time party hack, Ms Pécresse is a familiar figure in France. First elected deputy 19 years ago, she is a protégée of Jacques Chirac, a Gaullist former president, and became a minister under Mr Sarkozy. She describes herself as “two-thirds Merkel, one-third Thatcher”: a blend of consensus-seeking politics and reformist steel. As higher-education minister Ms Pécresse took on the unions to give universities more autonomy. As a primary candidate she pilloried Mr Macron for not cutting civil-service jobs and for “burning through cash” with his high public spending.It is a mistake, though, to cast Ms Pécresse uncritically as a party centrist. The product of a Catholic private-school education, she is culturally as well as fiscally conservative. Ms Pécresse voted in 2013 against the legalisation of gay marriage (though she later accepted it), and espouses a tough immigration policy, including an end to the automatic right to French citizenship of those born in France.Ms Pécresse may have triumphed in the primary, but she now needs to keep a divided party together. Eric Zemmour, a reactionary polemicist, has declared that he too is running. This has dragged the debate onto toxic ground. As it is, in 2017 Mr Ciotti refused to vote for Mr Macron to keep out Ms Le Pen. Now he vows he would prefer Mr Zemmour to Mr Macron were that the choice in 2022. He has already complained that since her nomination Ms Pécresse has not embraced his views properly, before the pair hastily arranged a truce for the cameras at a restaurant in Nice.If she can tread this line deftly, though, Ms Pécresse will make a tricky contender for Mr Macron, who remains most polls’ favourite for 2022. On the centre-right, she could win over some Macron supporters who are alarmed by high levels of public debt. On the hard right, she could lure some former Fillon voters who have been tempted by Mr Zemmour. The polemicist’s candidacy will split the hard-right vote and lower the hurdle for getting through to the second round. With the left enfeebled, this means that a run-off between Mr Macron and a centre-right candidate, which looked unlikely a couple of months ago as the Republicans squabbled, is now entirely plausible. So far only one poll has suggested that Ms Pécresse could then beat Mr Macron. But that is not a bad start. 
11  TEN YEARS ago Christoph Holstein received a summons to the office of Olaf Scholz. Mr Scholz had just led the Social Democrats (SPD) to a stunning election win in the city-state of Hamburg, and Mr Holstein was to be his government spokesman. Mr Scholz offered two pieces of guidance: “We are never offended, and we are never hysterical.” Mr Holstein, now on Hamburg’s state council, found the advice so useful that it remains pinned up in his office under the words: “Scholz’s first law”. Germans and others who learned to appreciate the calm demeanour of Angela Merkel during her 16 years in office will find reassurance in Mr Scholz, who replaced her as German chancellor on December 8th.Listen to this story.Talk to those who have got to know the 63-year-old Mr Scholz throughout his career, and several leitmotifs emerge. Reliability is one. “He only ever promises things he can achieve,” says Dorothee Martin, an SPD MP from Hamburg. Campaigning for election this summer, he boiled down his offer to a handful of modest proposals, all of which are in the coalition deal agreed by the SPD with two smaller parties: lifting Germany’s hourly minimum wage to €12 ($13.50), maintaining the state pension and building 400,000 housing units a year. Other colleagues praise Mr Scholz’s Hanseatic work ethic and his pragmatism.Another thread is impatience. Mr Scholz shares Mrs Merkel’s air of serenity and competence. Unlike her, he struggles to mask his disdain for those he considers ill-briefed, a trait that can infuriate antagonists. In Hamburg, his aides would shut down dissenters by exclaiming “ OWD”, short for Olaf will das! (“Olaf wants that”). Colleagues swear that Mr Scholz can be hilarious company. But his circuitous, convoluted style of public speaking will hardly satisfy those craving a more direct mode of communication from their chancellor. When challenged on his robotic persona earlier this year, Mr Scholz said he hoped to become chancellor, not a circus ring master. His press conferences are deathly.Mr Scholz was raised in Hamburg, and trained as an employment lawyer. Like many of today’s ageing social democrats he dabbled in radical leftism before, in his words, “detoxifying” himself into moderate social democracy in his 20s. He bounced between party, city and federal politics for decades, suffering reverses (being booted from a senior SPD role in 2004, the G20 riots in Hamburg in 2017, losing a party leadership bid in 2019) as well as victories (two huge election wins in Hamburg, this year’s triumphant national campaign). In 2018 he pushed his reluctant party to support Mrs Merkel’s Christian Democrats in yet another “grand coalition”. He became her vice-chancellor and finance minister, a role that served as a finishing school for the office he has now achieved.A prolific reader, Mr Scholz turned his finance ministry into a brains trust of sorts. His emphasis on “respect”, by which he means a society with equal regard for binmen and CEOs, is inspired by Michael Sandel, an American theorist sceptical of meritocracy. Too little of the stuff, Mr Scholz argues, breeds populism and illiberalism. “He is often portrayed as a social democrat in conservative clothes, but that’s wrong,” says a colleague.Mr Scholz also imbibed a lesson offered by previous SPD election-winners: that Germans are a centrist bunch wary of visionaries. Unloved by SPD members who wanted more red meat in their politics, Mr Scholz nonetheless almost single-handedly led his comrades to an unexpected, if narrow, election win in September. If this hardly represented a great renaissance of the European left, it did wonders for a party that had long been in the doldrums.The pandemic had a hand in Mr Scholz’s own recovery. He spent his first two years as finance minister dismaying those who hoped a Social Democrat might end Germany’s excessive fiscal prudence. But when covid-19 struck Mr Scholz cast aside Germany’s fiscal rules to splash hundreds of billions on furlough and corporate-support schemes. He helped design the EU’s €750bn ($845bn) recovery fund, and earlier this year helped push through an international corporate-tax deal.Foreign and European policy will command much of Mr Scholz’s time. His domestic ambitions will focus on climate. He calls the transition to a carbon-free future Germany’s biggest industrial test in a century. It will be a political challenge, too. The coalition deal commits the new government to exacting targets, including an 80% share of renewables in electricity generation by 2030, but is vague on how to finance the required investments. That riddle could trigger rows between Mr Scholz’s governing partners, the tax-cutting Free Democrats and the left-leaning Greens.Managing clashes inside his coalition will test Mr Scholz’s celebrated mediation skills. So could soothing the inevitable frustration of the Greens, some of whom emerged disappointed from the coalition negotiations, as well as potential restiveness in the SPD’s own ranks. To manage disputes Mr Scholz will rely on a handful of trusted aides, chief among them Wolfgang Schmidt, an ebullient figure whose reward for decades of service to Mr Scholz will be the job of running his chancellery.Mr Scholz’s quiet bearing may belie serious ambitions for Germany. “He thinks that under Merkel Germany failed to live up to its potential, and now needs a progressive renewal,” says Dominic Schwickert of Das Progressive Zentrum, a left-leaning think-tank in Berlin. Yet despite her original reform plans Mrs Merkel will be remembered mainly as Europe’s crisis-manager-in-chief. Unexpected events will prove at least as testing for Mr Scholz. He takes office amid a brutal fourth wave of covid-19 and the prospect of renewed conflagration in Ukraine. For now, a surprisingly heady air of optimism surrounds his new, untested coalition government. Olaf will das. But the new chancellor may not always get what he wants. 
12  WHEN JOE BIDEN met Vladimir Putin in Geneva last June, he spoke of his desire for “stable and predictable” relations with Russia and pointed to several areas in which the two could co-operate, not least on limiting nuclear weapons and fighting terrorism. This time, in a two-hour video call, the tone was confrontational. Mr Biden warned his counterpart of harsh retribution if the Russian troops currently massing on Ukraine’s borders launched an invasion.Listen to this story.“He told President Putin...that, if Russia further invades Ukraine, the United States and our European allies would respond with strong economic measures,” said Jake Sullivan, Mr Biden’s national security adviser. “We would provide additional defensive material to the Ukrainians …and we would fortify our NATO allies on the eastern flank with additional capabilities in response to such an escalation.”America is also offering Russia a diplomatic off-ramp, in the form of a broad discussion on European security (eg, cold-war-style accords that limit forces). But this could take place only “in the context of de-escalation”, Mr Sullivan said. It was unclear whether this will be enough to induce Mr Putin to call back his troops.American and European officials are working on co-ordinated sanctions in case of an invasion. America is pressing the newly installed German coalition led by Olaf Scholz to be ready to halt the opening of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will deliver more gas from Russia to Europe. It is not yet clear whether sanctions would include cutting Russia off from the SWIFT system of financial transfers, which would be hugely damaging.Some assume that Mr Putin’s military manoeuvres are designed to get America’s attention. A similar build-up in the spring yielded the summit in Geneva in June. This one got him a video conference. But few can claim to know how far he will go. Mr Putin says he wants a guarantee that Ukraine will never join NATO, and that it will not be a base for Western weapons that can threaten Russia, even though neither prospect seems remotely likely given the fragility of Ukraine’s government, widespread corruption and unresolved conflicts. Yet NATO feels it cannot formally close the door on Ukraine. In Mr Sullivan’s view, “Countries should be able to freely choose who they associate with.”The real problem for Mr Putin may be less Ukraine joining NATO than NATO helping Ukraine. He is worried about NATO’s and Western countries’ growing role in arming and training Ukraine’s forces, to the point where they present a more capable opponent—though not strong enough to stop a full-scale invasion. Ukraine is one of the largest recipients of American civilian and military aid.More broadly, Mr Putin wants America to recognise that Ukraine should be within his sphere of influence. In 2014 Mr Putin took over and annexed Crimea, and backed Russian-speaking separatists in the east of the country, creating the breakaway “republics” of Donetsk and Luhansk. The Minsk agreements, intended to end the conflict, would have created a weak and loose federation in Ukraine, possibly in effect giving Russia a veto over its actions. But disputes over their precise meaning and the sequence of steps to be taken have stalled implementation. “Putin does not necessarily have an end state in mind,” says Kurt Volker, a special envoy to Ukraine when Donald Trump was president. “He wants to create positions of power, create opportunities and exploit them.”For all Mr Biden’s sternness, he appears to have set limits to what America will do. Mr Sullivan said America’s purpose is “to deter a Russian military invasion of further territory of Ukraine”. That would appear to leave open the prospect of Russia annexing the breakaway regions where it already pulls the strings. And although America is prepared to send more forces to reassure NATO allies, Mr Biden will not commit American forces to Ukraine itself. If an invasion is averted, the next question will be what Mr Biden and Mr Putin might agree to in any subsequent talks. In a tweet before the summit, Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, thanked the Americans for their “joint & concerted action”. But he added an implied warning: “Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.” For more coverage of Joe Biden’s presidency, visit our dedicated  hub and follow along as we track shifts in his  approval rating.

13  “WITH THE stroke of a pen” is a phrase usually used metaphorically. But just a single stroke differentiates the two forms of the name of a Spanish city: “Valencia” (in Spanish) and “València” (in the regional language). A left-wing regionalist party recently kicked off a debate in Spain’s Senate by insisting on “València” as the only spelling—even in Spanish (which does not have the letter è).Listen to this story.Spain’s regional squabbles are often this tiny. Some Catalans detect an insult in the use of the letter ñ, which is used only in Castilian (Spanish), but not in Catalan. Barcelona’s second-biggest football club was named “Español” on its founding in 1900, to distinguish it from FC Barcelona, whose founder was Swiss. The club renamed itself Espanyol to appease local sensitivities in 1995.In recent weeks language wars have reached high politics. The same Valencian party that insisted on València also pushed to be allowed to use “Países Catalanes” (Catalan countries) in the Senate—a loaded phrase beloved of separatists, which includes the Valencia region, Catalonia and the Balearic Islands, all of which speak Catalan.Meanwhile, the Socialist-led minority government needed the support of regionalist parties to pass its budget last week. It did so in part by promising more children’s television in Basque, and by agreeing to require streaming platforms based in Spain to offer 6% of their content in Spain’s main minority languages, Basque, Catalan and Galician. (Details remain murky. Content dubbed into those languages will count; subtitles apparently won’t.)Rather more seriously, a row over schooling now threatens a constitutional conflict. Catalonia’s immersion model has generally required all subjects to be taught in Catalan, except Spanish itself. This annoys families from elsewhere in Spain. But on November 23rd Spain’s supreme court ruled that 25% of courses must be in Spanish—and the Catalan government’s education boss immediately told schools that there should be “no change” in practice. The national government stayed calm, saying the Catalans should respect the courts. The leader of the main opposition party, Pablo Casado, said that if they did not, the Senate should revoke Catalonia’s right to set its own education policy.Many ordinary people in Spain are happily bilingual in Spanish and a regional language. But when dealing with Spain’s identitarian politicians, whether in Madrid, Valencia or Barcelona, you must choose your accents carefully.
14  IT IS THE season of calm seas off the Sahara, and each week several hundred African migrants turn up on the shores of the Canary Islands, packed tightly into open fishing boats. Some of them, especially those from Mali, are fleeing violence. Many more are economic migrants, lured by the prospect of much higher wages in Europe, if they can somehow get there.Listen to this story.It is a hazardous trip: at least 900 migrants have died on this route so far this year. But most who make it to the Canaries eventually find their way to the Spanish mainland. There they find a country whose traditional welcome for immigrants is showing signs of strain.Modern Spain acquired an immigrant population later and more suddenly than other western European countries. In 1998 there were just 1.2m foreign-born residents; by 2010 there were 6.6m (out of a total population of 47m). Many went home during the economic slump of 2008-12. Now their number is rising again, to 7.2m last year. The first wave easily fitted in: the economy was growing, and the largest contingents were from Spanish-speaking Latin America and from Romania, which has cultural and religious similarities to Spain. There were many, too, from Morocco, where Spain was the colonial power in the north of the country.In recent years most new arrivals have come not by sea but through the airports, as visa overstayers, many from Latin America. Growing numbers are from Africa. After a previous surge in arrivals in the Canaries in 2006 Spain signed agreements with Morocco, Mauritania and Senegal under which those countries would take their migrants back in return for aid and help with patrolling the seas. But the deportations have been halted during the pandemic. Anyway, the three African governments are reluctant, especially Morocco’s, which has a long-standing dispute with Spain over Western Sahara and which in May allowed some 8,000 migrants to cross into Ceuta, a Spanish enclave.For the past two years, arrivals in the Canaries have at times overwhelmed reception facilities. Algerians are landing on Spain’s Mediterranean coast and the Balearics. This year, for the first time, three of the top five nationalities seeking asylum are African. Many Africans move on to the rest of Europe. But they are increasingly visible in Spanish cities. It normally takes three years to get a work permit. Meanwhile, some work as manteros, street vendors who display their wares on blankets on the pavement. They face racism and police harassment, complains Malick Gueye of an association of manteros in Madrid.All this grabs headlines, especially in a changed political climate. Vox, a hard-right party which now has 52 of the 350 seats in parliament, burst onto the scene in 2017 in response to the separatist threat in Catalonia. But as that has waned it has increasingly campaigned against irregular immigration. For a regional election in Madrid in May, it put up posters contrasting the cost of looking after migrants who are unaccompanied minors with pensions for older Spaniards. It is a paradox that Vox does particularly well in areas along the Mediterranean coast where farmers depend on Moroccan and other African labourers for the harvest.“Racism isn’t a monopoly of Vox,” but racists feel empowered by its stance, says Mr Gueye. There has been an increase in reports of racist attacks, though they remain rare. “There’s a breeding ground in favour of hatred in Europe from which Spain is not exempt,” says Jesús Perea, the deputy minister for migration.One of the first acts of Pedro Sánchez, the Socialist prime minister, when he took office in 2018 was to welcome a shipload of 630 immigrants stranded off Italy. As migration routes have moved westwards again, the government is now more cautious. “We have to strike a balance between security and solidarity,” says Mr Perea. He remains optimistic. “The general day-to-day attitude in Spain is better than in other countries in Europe,” he claims. Spaniards recall that many of them emigrated in the 1950s and 1960s in search of a better life. It helps, too, that immigrants are spread out across the country, rather than concentrated in ghettos. In a recent poll 56% of Spaniards saw immigration positively.Spain faces a test and a choice. The test is to ensure that the second generation, only now growing up in numbers, integrates successfully. A warning came in 2017 with terrorist attacks in Catalonia perpetrated by a group of young men who had arrived from Morocco as small children. They were apparently well integrated. They spoke Catalan, had jobs and played in a local football team, but were recruited by a jihadist preacher. However, such cases are rare. A survey in 2014 found “no indicators of cultural rejection…among immigrants or their children”. More recent studies have found a higher risk that children of immigrants drop out of school. Few senior jobs are held by African immigrants or their children, so role models are scarce.The choice is whether to admit more immigrants. Some say Spain needs them. Even more than in most rich countries, Spain’s fertility rate has tumbled, from three children per woman in 1964 to 1.2 today. So in the future fewer workers will have to support a lot more pensioners, unless Spain raises the retirement age or lets in more young immigrants, or both. The government estimates that, even if it succeeds in bringing the effective retirement age into line with the legal one, which is gradually being raised to 67, Spain will need an extra 6m-7m workers by 2040 to meet its pension bill. Some 250,000 a year will need to come from abroad.Many Spaniards remain welcoming. After a campaign by NGOs the government in October made it easier for young migrants to get work permits when they turn 18 and leave reception centres. “These youths shouldn’t have to be wandering the streets for three years until they get papers,” says Emilia Lozano, a retired shop-worker who has organised beds and training for some. Small towns across the depopulating interior want immigrants to keep their schools, shops and bars open. Even as Spanish society has changed radically in a generation, the country has remained generally easygoing. That can continue, but it will take more work. 
15  OPENING THEIR parliamentary mailboxes last month, Italian lawmakers were surprised to find an anthology of speeches by Silvio Berlusconi. On the cover was a photograph of the former prime minister, his arms raised high to acknowledge the adulation of an unseen crowd. The booklet, modestly entitled “I am Forza Italia” (“Come on, Italy”, the party that Mr Berlusconi founded and leads), was the opening gambit in the 85-year-old media mogul’s undeclared campaign to crown his turbulent career with election, by a college of parliamentarians, to Italy’s highest office. The term of the incumbent president, Sergio Mattarella, expires on February 3rd, and he has repeatedly ruled out an extension. The race to succeed him is now dominating Italian public life.Listen to this story.Why? A president spends much of his time making speeches, conferring honours and receiving dignitaries. He (there has never been a female president) has some weighty powers, including responsibility for dissolving parliament and appointing the prime minister. But those powers are few. What makes the choice of a president so important just now is that those who are thought to covet the job include the current prime minister, Mario Draghi, the guarantor to Brussels and the markets that Italy will spend productively the €200bn ($225bn) it stands to get from the EU’s pandemic recovery fund.Whichever way the presidency goes could create a problem. If Mr Draghi is seen to fail in a bid to be chosen as the next occupant of the Quirinale palace, his standing will be diminished and thus his capacity to hold together the broad coalition of parties that support him but whose only common denominator is awe-struck respect for him. If, however, he succeeds, a replacement will need to be found who can stop the heterogeneous coalition from falling apart. And that will not be at all easy.Either way, the odds on a snap election will shorten, and if an early vote is held, the polls currently suggest that the outcome would be a coalition government dominated by two parties with a track record of confrontation with the European Commission: the Brothers of Italy party, whose roots lie in neo-fascism, and the populist Northern League. Within Italy, the risks of that tend to be downplayed. Not so elsewhere. Teneo, a consultancy, warned recently that Mr Draghi’s elevation could “plunge the country back into political turmoil, undermining efforts to enact reforms needed to secure regular instalments of recovery fund cash”.Giorgia Meloni of the Brothers and Matteo Salvini of the League are both nominally supportive of their ally, Mr Berlusconi. But it is clear their interests actually lie in ushering Mr Draghi upstairs. Whether he, and they, will get their way is another matter: a solution that allows Mr Draghi to stay on as prime minister with minimal loss of face may yet be found. Enrico Letta, the leader of the centre-left Democratic Party, which has risen to the top of the polls in recent weeks, wants Mr Draghi to stick around. And recent utterances by leading figures in the Five Star Movement, still the biggest group in parliament despite its collapse in the polls since the previous election, suggest that they do, too.Perhaps most important of all is the instinct for self-preservation, both political and financial, of Italy’s lawmakers. Because of a reform in 2019, the next parliament will have around two-thirds the number of seats of the current one. And if the next election is held before September 24th 2022, the first-time parliamentarians among them will lose their rights to a pension. Not for nothing is Mr Berlusconi implying that, were he made president, he would ensure the legislature ran to the end of its term in 2023. 
16  OLAF SCHOLZ and Joe Biden seem to be destined to have as cordial a relationship as Angela Merkel and Barack Obama did. The incoming German chancellor and the American president are both Atlanticists on the centre-left of their respective political spectrums who are committed to fighting climate change. Mr Scholz has called America “Europe’s closest and most important partner”. As finance minister he got on well with the Biden administration.Listen to this story.Even so, one geopolitical conundrum is casting a big shadow over the relationship. Nord Stream 2, a recently completed 1,230km (764-mile) undersea pipeline for natural gas from Russia to Germany, is fiercely opposed by America’s Congress. Mr Biden opposes it too, but waived sanctions in May to avoid a row with a close ally. If Republican senators have their way, he may be compelled to impose them after all.Led by Ted Cruz, a senator from Texas, Republicans in the Senate are pushing for new sanctions via an amendment to the annual National Defence Authorisation Act (NDAA). On December 1st the Senate was due to vote on 21 amendments to the NDAA, including the one involving the NS2 sanctions. But voting had been held up as The Economist went to press, as the Republicans tried to add yet more amendments. Mr Cruz and his allies are also blocking the appointment of several dozen foreign-policy officials, including the American ambassadors to Germany, Israel and Egypt, to increase the pressure on Mr Biden.Many American lawmakers have opposed NS2 since Gazprom, Russia’s state-controlled gas giant, joined forces with five European energy firms in 2015 to build it alongside an existing pipeline under the Baltic Sea, at a cost of €9.5bn ($11bn). They fret that the new pipeline, which doubles Russia’s capacity to export gas to Germany, will increase Europe’s dependence on Russian energy. They worry that it will deprive Ukraine (and Poland) of transit fees of about $2bn a year from the existing pipelines that pass through their territory, and make it easier for Russia to cut supplies of winter gas to eastern Ukraine. And they argue that the current infrastructure already provides sufficient capacity for Europe’s energy needs. American opposition to NS2 is further fuelled by Russia’s military build-up on its border with Ukraine.Germans argue that the pipeline is no threat to Ukraine so long as what is known as the “joint statement” is implemented. This is an agreement Angela Merkel, the outgoing chancellor, and Mr Biden struck in July, in which Germany vowed to take action, including imposing EU sanctions, if Russia were to use energy as a weapon against Ukraine. The statement also stipulates that Russia must honour its gas-transit agreement with Ukraine and extend it beyond 2024 by up to ten years. Germany has appointed a special envoy to help the renegotiation of the transit agreement.Yet the pipeline has been hitting new problems. As well as the growing pressure from Congress, in mid-November Germany’s energy regulator suspended the certification process of the pipeline. It said that to secure an operating licence the NS2 consortium needed first to form a German subsidiary under German company law, which will introduce a delay.Germany’s extensive coalition agreement does not directly mention NS2. It says only that European energy law “applies to energy projects in Germany”. Annalena Baerbock, the co-head of the Green Party who will soon be foreign minister, is a vocal critic of the pipeline. Last month she accused Russia of trying to blackmail the German government into allowing NS2 to start pumping gas by keeping gas prices high. Yet ultimately it will probably be Mr Scholz who decides his government’s stance on the pipeline. Leaders of his Social Democratic Party back the pipeline, which they say enhances Europe’s energy security. The pipeline still seems likely to go ahead, but a return to the harmony of the Merkel-Obama era is a long way off. 
17  BULLSHIT IS A surprisingly rich seam of philosophical inquiry. “On Bullshit”, a short essay by Harry Frankfurt, an American philosopher, became a bestselling book. Since its publication in 1986, the essence of the stuff has been chewed over, with thinkers ranging from Wittgenstein to St Augustine invoked to help understand it. The field of inquiry was even given its own name: taurascatics. Examining the theory of bullshit—“indifference to how things really are” in Mr Frankfurt’s formulation—is now a well-trodden path. To see bullshit in practice, head to Brussels.Listen to this story.Consider the EU’s Global Gateway initiative, launched on December 1st. It is a sprawling scheme that will supposedly result in €300bn ($340bn) of investment in infrastructure across the developing world by 2027. Diplomats compare it to the “Belt and Road Initiative”, which China uses to expand its influence. Beneath the spin lurks bullshit. It is not just the language (the scheme is based on “a Team Europe approach”) but the content. The €300bn is mainly a mixture of existing commitments, loan guarantees and heroic assumptions about the ability of the club to “crowd in” private investment, rather than actual new spending. Even the threat it is designed to counter is overdone: Japan quietly invests far more than China on infrastructure in Asia, for example. It is a perfectly good idea; but it is simply caked in bullshit.Anywhere politicians, journalists, wonks and lobbyists gather tends to produce a surplus of bullshit. But the EU’s de facto capital is especially prone to it. It is a city of great power but little scrutiny. Media attention is still focused on national capitals. Mr Frankfurt wrote that bullshit is “unavoidable whenever circumstances require someone to talk without knowing what he is talking about”. In Brussels this happens every day. Those inside the bubble are expected to keep on top of judicial reform in Poland and coalition formation in Sweden, as well as the grand sweep of geopolitics. A deep knowledge of the domestic politics of 27 countries and an encyclopedic understanding of how the EU’s institutions work (in theory and in practice) is both necessary and impossible. Some bullshitting is inevitable.Inhabitants of the bubble are reluctant to call it out. Brussels is a cosy place. The same people attend the same events, making the same points about topics that would be unintelligible to a passer-by who sneaked in for the free sandwiches. Disagreements on panels are rare. A soporific consensus is the norm. Admitting that the EU’s policy in the Indo-Pacific barely matters would send its authors, and the assembled wonks who pored over it, into an existential tailspin. Ignoring how things really are, as Mr Frankfurt explains, is the essence of bullshit.Much as all models are wrong but some are useful, there is good bullshit and bad bullshit. All bullshitters are winging it, but some get it right. At one end of the spectrum are total chancers. One EU talking head conned TV channels into putting him on air, even though the “think-tank” he ran had a spelling error in its title, stock images for staff and existed mainly in his head. At the other end are the usual array of well-funded wonks (and columnists) opining on whatever dominates the day, with a degree of intelligence if not always insight. But sometimes all that separates the two is the cash for a glossy website and proofreaders.Bullshit lurks at the heart of the EU’s legitimacy. In other political systems, a government wields an electoral mandate. In Brussels, laws stem from the European Commission, which is not directly elected and yet must still act in the European interest. Determining this interest is often done by surveys, which can yield misleading results. (An EU-funded survey in March 2017, taken nine months after the Brexit vote, revealed that only a quarter of Britons believed that membership of the EU was a bad thing.) Strange as it may seem, when politics is absent, bullshit has free rein.Boredom can breed bullshit. For all the late-night suspense of conclaves of the European Council, in essence they are just long meetings to argue about revisions to a document. Diplomats who offer the juiciest bits of gossip know that their views will be reflected best. The upshot is that even the blandest summit is jazzed up for the sake of hungry hacks. Likewise, crunch points rarely crunch in the EU. Deadlines are an invention of diplomats attempting to create pressure and journalists trying to create peril. In either case, they are nearly always bullshit.Called to ordureIt is possible to build a career on bullshit in Brussels. A young Boris Johnson made his name in the city as a Euro-bashing journalist from the Daily Telegraph. What is striking is that the outrageous stories—whether on condom regulation or the bendiness of bananas—were never outright fabrications. Instead, they were, often, bullshit. That made them harder to counter. A takedown of the bendy-banana myth focused on the fact that it was not “Brussels bureaucrats” who decided to regulate them, but national governments which pushed for changes to existing EU regulations. A pedantic clarification missed the wider truth: the curvature of bananas in Europe is a supranational matter. A bullshit attack was countered with a defence that was also bullshit.If bullshit can be an opportunity in Brussels, it is also a prison. “Bullshit jobs”, as the anthropologist David Graeber called them in another addition to taurascatics, are rife within the EU. Most officials dealing with big topics in Brussels are intelligent and diligent. Stay in Brussels long enough, however, and sad souls who are overpaid and underworked reveal themselves. The perks, which range from fat pensions to an expat allowance that cancels out any tax due, are simply too good to give up. Outside the institutions, youngsters with dreams of building Europe instead find themselves lobbying for the aluminium industry or Kazakhstan. Each day is a scramble to justify a sorry existence. The result? More bullshit shovelled into a system already overflowing with it. 
18  WHAT TO MAKE of the military analysts who calmly list the reasons why the most serious war in Europe since 1945 might begin in January? The flat, muddy terrain of south-eastern Ukraine will be frozen solid by then, allowing Russian tanks to roll in. It is in the middle of the deployment cycle for the conscripts who make up much of Russia’s ground forces. And Russia may find itself with a pretext for invasion, since the new year has in the past brought front-line flare-ups in Ukraine’s war against Russian-backed separatists. Besides, the 100,000 Russian troops massed near the border are more than mere theatre; Russia is setting up field hospitals and calling up its reserves.Listen to this story.Dima is unimpressed. A colonel in the Ukrainian army, he has watched the rapid transformation of his country’s armed forces from a bad joke to something approaching a modern army. And he thinks Russia has been watching, too. “They are afraid of us, because since 2014 we have shown what we can do,” says Dima, who prefers not to use his real name. “It would be a third world war, at a minimum,” he says, perhaps with a touch of hyperbole. In the corner of a café in Kyiv, fidgeting with cigarettes and coffee, he remembers how far Ukraine has travelled.In 2014 Dima was commanding a battalion near Luhansk, a city in the south-east near the Russian border. Of his 700 soldiers, only 40 were ready for active duty. His men did not bother to wear their clumsy Soviet-army vests or helmets, which offered little protection against bullets. Soldiers instead, when possible, dressed in German gear scrounged abroad from second-hand stores by volunteers. His tanks had the wrong engines installed. Few men had the training they needed to fight well. But had Ukraine enjoyed today’s armed forces back in 2014 “Donetsk and Luhansk would be free today,” claims Dima, with a snap of his fingers.But they are not. Ukraine failed to stop Russia’s annexation of Crimea, and the self-declared “republics” of Donetsk and Luhansk remain outside Ukraine’s control (see map). That Ukraine had just 6,000 combat-ready troops at the time was a result of decades of neglect. Well-intentioned Ukrainian politicians were complacent after the signing in 1994 of the Budapest memorandum, under which Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees from America, Britain and Russia. Ill-intentioned officials sold off equipment and took their cut.Now Ukraine is getting its act together. Military spending as a share of GDP has more than doubled, to 4%, funded in part by a “military levy” on incomes. America has given $2.5bn-worth of equipment to Ukraine. That includes Harris radios to ensure troops can communicate, and counter-battery radars to detect the source of enemy fire. Ukraine now has 250,000 troops and a further 900,000 reserves; some 300,000 of them have experience on the front line. Ukraine has bought Bayraktar TB-2 combat-capable drones from Turkey, a NATO member. America has sent Javelin missiles, though on the condition that they are stored far from the front line.Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, wants more than new weapons. He covets accession to NATO. That would commit America and 29 other countries to leap to Ukraine’s defence if it were attacked by Russia. But such an invitation looks highly unlikely; NATO does not want an unambiguous commitment to defend a country Russia has already attacked. However, Ukraine is preparing its forces to work with NATO’s anyway. Joint exercises are increasingly common, and getting bigger. A new policy requires all Ukrainian troops to have a command of English by 2025.Much of Ukraine’s improvement has been based on the premise that Russia wants to challenge Ukraine, but does not want the cost of waging a war in its own name. This has produced the kind of disorganised ground war that Ukraine has been getting better at fighting since 2014.But the Kremlin’s thinking may now be changing in response to a version of the future it claims to find intolerable. It fears that a West-veering Ukraine will abandon its historical role as a buffer between Russia and the West, and instead play host to American firepower only a short distance from Moscow. On December 1st Mr Putin used a speech to demand that NATO commit not to station troops or missiles in Ukraine, pledges that NATO will not be prepared to give.Russian impatience with what it claims is threatening behaviour does not mean it wishes to gobble up swathes of Ukrainian territory for good. Fyodor Lukyanov, a foreign-policy analyst close to the Kremlin, suggests that a quick, hard incursion akin to Russia’s war with Georgia in 2008 could occur, followed by merciless talks. A pretext would be easy to manufacture.If Russian force were unleashed fully upon Ukraine’s troops, it would pulverise them. Nothing in Ukraine’s arsenal would be able to stop Russia’s air force of modern jets, which recently proved their power in a bombing campaign over Syria. Most of Ukraine’s navy vanished along with Crimea in 2014, and it has not been rebuilt since then. Russian troops are better armed, greater in number and backed by a smoother logistics set-up. No Western power looks willing to wage war against Russia for Ukraine’s sake. Mr Putin is probably bluffing. If he is not, Dima’s confidence will face a fearsome test. 
19  THREE-AND-A-HALF years ago German politics looked exhausted. Angela Merkel had just assembled her third “grand coalition”, a tired centrist alliance that left no one satisfied. Today, two months after an election that saw Mrs Merkel’s Christian Democrats booted from office, the mood is markedly brighter. On November 24th the leaders of Germany’s Social Democrats (SPD), Greens and Free Democrats (FDP), a pro-business party, exuded optimism as they gathered in a converted Berlin warehouse to hail their new “traffic-light” coalition (named after the parties’ red, green and yellow colours). In 177 pages and 52,000 words—a shade more than “The Great Gatsby”—their three-party deal lays out a policy agenda for the next four years.Listen to this story.Seeking to conjure coherence from an unwieldy project, the parties are pushing a narrative of “modernising” Germany after 16 years of Mrs Merkel’s conservative rule. The notion that three disparate parties might so quickly sand away their differences looked dubious. But their leaders insisted that the two-month coalition negotiations—which proceeded relatively smoothly, on time and mostly without leaks—built a bedrock of trust. Olaf Scholz, the SPD’s taciturn chancellor-to-be, says he hopes the parties will campaign jointly at the next election. People were sceptical of traffic lights when they were introduced in Berlin in the 1920s, he noted, but they are are indispensable today.The parties’ modernising promise finds expression in a raft of legislative proposals. These include a liberalisation of Germany’s archaic citizenship laws, streamlining of bureaucracy, electoral reform to shrink the bloated Bundestag, improvements to gay and trans rights, and the legalisation of pot. Negotiators say they struck agreement on these issues quickly. The deal’s language on other themes bears the hallmarks of trickier talks.A commitment to keep Germany on the “path to 1.5 degrees” (ie, to limit global warming) is threaded throughout. A pledge to bring the coal phase-out forward to 2030 from 2038 is welcome though symbolic, as carbon-pricing is already killing the stuff. More significant is a planned increase in the share of renewables in Germany’s electricity mix to 80% by 2030, up from the current 65% target (and 45% today). The agreement is thinner on transportation, says Alexander Reitzenstein, a climate expert at Das Progressive Zentrum, a think-tank, and, to his surprise, offers nothing on raising the domestic carbon price.The parties bickered over fiscal policy and public investment. A constitutional “debt brake”, strongly backed by the FDP, limits deficit spending. A raft of complex tools will be used to get around it, including beefing up the state development bank, extending debt repayments and tweaking the calculation of Germany’s structural budget deficit. Details on all this are thin, but the coalition will probably struggle to meet the Greens’ target of €50bn ($56bn) a year in fresh money. Next year this national discussion will bleed into a European one on fiscal rules, a touchy subject in Germany. Here, the deal’s vague commitment to use the rules to secure growth and foster investment in the EU offers more than some had dared hope.“The foreign-policy chapter is stronger than I’d expected,” says Jana Puglierin of the European Council on Foreign Relations. A vow to attend the first meeting next year of signatories to a new anti-nuclear weapons treaty will worry NATO allies. But it is balanced by a strong commitment to NATO’s nuclear-sharing arrangements, under which Germany consents to host American nukes and maintain aircraft that can deliver them. The Russia talks were especially contentious, and the coalition agreement ducks explicit mention of Nord Stream 2, a Russian gas pipeline detested in America and much of Europe. But Germany’s China hawks are delighted with the deal’s robust language, including support for Taiwan’s involvement in international organisations. Mrs Merkel’s engagement-first approach to China looks set to expire with her chancellorship.The agreement is weaker on reforms to Germany’s pension system, which faces chronic pressure from an ageing population. Easing restrictions on labour immigration from outside the EU is welcome but cannot plug the demographic gap. On asylum the new government offers carrot (easier family-reunification rules) and stick (quicker deportations). Yet for a country squat in Europe’s middle, national policies can only do so much in the absence of a deal to bolster the EU’s common asylum rules. A fresh migrant crisis on Europe’s borders could strain the traffic-light government as it did Mrs Merkel’s.Many of the 17 ministerial posts still need to be divvied up, but the most important are already known. One crucial relationship will be between Christian Lindner, the FDP leader and Mr Scholz’s presumed finance minister, and Robert Habeck, the Green co-chair, who will run a beefed-up climate and economy ministry (Annalena Baerbock, the Greens’ other leader, will be Germany’s first female foreign minister). The tax-cutting liberal and the statist Green claim to be united in the mission of managing Germany’s energy transition. Reality will test that promise.Yet unforeseen events will prove the biggest challenge. In that sense, the pandemic once again raging inside Germany offers the traffic-light coalition a grimly fitting welcome. Mr Scholz’s government will be sworn in during the week of December 6th. By then, with thousands of Germans dying from covid-19 every week, many hospitals will be under severe strain. The new chancellor is already contending with demands for another national lockdown and an Austria-style vaccination mandate. The wedding went as well as can be expected. But the honeymoon will be brief. 
20  THE SIGHT of 40,000 unvaccinated Austrians marching through their capital, Vienna, in recent days was troubling twice over. The tightly packed opponents of lockdown measures were at risk of spreading the coronavirus. They also threatened to stir up an already tense political situation. Karl Nehammer, Austria’s interior minister, warned that anti-vaxxers in the Alpine republic are growing more radicalised. He called the demonstration’s mood “incensed” and “aggressive”. Some protesters were extremely provocative, carrying placards likening Alexander Schallenberg, Austria’s new chancellor, to Josef Mengele, the sadistic physician at the Nazi concentration camp in Auschwitz.Listen to this story.The protesters were marching against Austria’s increasingly tough measures against anti-vaxxers. On November 22nd the government imposed a full lockdown once again, to last for at least ten days. That compels Austria’s 9m people to hunker down at home, leaving only for work, essential shopping and exercise. Austria is also the first Western democracy to make covid-19 vaccinations mandatory for all, starting on February 1st 2022. “For a long time—maybe too long—I and others assumed that it must be possible to convince people in Austria to get vaccinated voluntarily,” said Mr Schallenberg when he announced his “very difficult” decision.Europe, once again, is at the centre of the pandemic. Cases are surging as the highly contagious Delta variant makes its way, belatedly, through Europe’s population. The World Health Organisation said on November 23rd that deaths from covid-19 across the continent could exceed 2m people by March. (The Economist’s own tracker suggests this number was long ago surpassed.) Last week reported deaths increased to close to 4,200 a day from 2,100 at the end of September. The disease has become the leading cause of death in Europe.Will more countries respond with the sort of strict measures seen in Austria? As hospitals in central Europe fill up, anxiety grows. Around 66% of the total population in the European Union is fully vaccinated, but vaccination rates vary greatly between countries. Farther west, they are remarkably high. Among the over-12s in Portugal, more than 88% of the population is fully vaccinated. By contrast, in Bulgaria the share is below 25%. Within Germany there are also large east-west variations.Other governments have imposed compulsory covid vaccinations for specific groups. Italy made them obligatory for all workers in public or private companies, unless they can prove they are immune or have tested negative in the past 48 hours. Similarly, France made vaccination compulsory for health staff as well as police and firefighters. This week Germany made vaccinations compulsory for its army.Support for a nationwide vaccine mandate, previously a taboo, is now rising in Germany. Prominent politicians had repeatedly promised that such a mandate would not be considered. But several state premiers, including Daniel Günther of Schleswig-Holstein, Markus Söder of Bavaria and Volker Bouffier of Hesse, now back such a measure for the entire country. Many Germans agree. A survey of 7,500 respondents, conducted in the past few days by Civey, a pollster, suggests that 72% would favour an Austrian-style vaccine mandate, and only 20% would oppose it.As such mandates become likelier in many places, the polarisation between rival camps is growing. Anti-vaxxers consist mainly of supporters of populist and far-right parties, but also acolytes of alternative medicine, hippies and libertarians. Over the weekend thousands of opponents of anti-covid measures marched in the Benelux countries, Italy, Switzerland and Northern Ireland. In Belgium and the Netherlands rioters clashed with the police over three days. The mayor of Rotterdam lamented “an orgy of violence”.Andrea Ammon, the head of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, has warned that vaccine mandates could provoke more resistance from anti-vaxxers, which seems plausible. But officials made their full-throated promises to keep vaccinations voluntary when taming the pandemic looked easier. Now, however, as winter forces more people together indoors and the Delta variant runs rampant, the pressure to return to lockdowns and impose tougher vaccine mandates may grow harder to resist.

21  EVEN TRAGEDY, it seems, cannot bring Britain and France together. For a brief moment on November 24th, after 27 refugees died in the icy English Channel trying to cross in an inflatable boat from the northern French coast to Britain, it looked as if tensions between the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, might ease. But this was not to be. For behind the row about migrants lies a fundamental problem: the two neighbours are separated by a narrow channel of water and a gulf of mutual distrust.Neither side is blameless in this latest spat. The day after the drownings, and without warning the French, Mr Johnson tweeted a letter he had sent to Mr Macron. In it he proposed ideas about better cross-border cooperation, such as the dispatch of British soldiers and policemen to patrol French beaches, which had already been rejected by France as an infringement of sovereignty. The letter also proposed a “returns agreement” to take back migrants who arrive in Britain, which the French have repeatedly made clear is a matter for EU, not bilateral, discussion.Mr Macron, who was in Rome signing a Franco-Italian friendship treaty, retorted angrily that the letter was “not serious” and that he did not conduct diplomacy by Twitter. Yet days earlier the French diplomatic service had tweeted a clip of Jean-Yves Le Drian, the foreign minister, calling Mr Johnson a “populist who uses all elements at his disposal to blame others for problems he faces internally”. Serious was hardly the word that best characterised the decision by Gérald Darmanin, the French interior minister, to cancel an invitation to Priti Patel, the British home secretary, to a meeting on the migrant crisis. This is due to take place on November 28th in the port of Calais, with his Dutch, Belgian and German counterparts, as well as the European Commission.Behind this trading of cross-Channel insults, the view in Paris of the underlying problem is twofold. The first is that the French have concluded that Mr Johnson’s government cannot be fully trusted. Although Mr Macron has never liked Brexit, as it weakens the EU, this is not now his real gripe. Two years after the British voted to leave the EU, he went enthusiastically to a Franco-British summit at Sandhurst in 2018, in the hope of building a stronger defence and security relationship with Britain. Yet the French have been dismayed by British efforts not to implement parts of the deal to leave the EU that they had signed. Ahead of the G7 meeting in Cornwall this summer, Mr Macron declared that “this means nothing can be respected.” As if to make his point, details of the two leaders’ private conversation at the G7, concerning sausages and borders, were then leaked, making Mr Macron look foolish.In September the French were further bruised by AUKUS, a strategic pact between Britain, America and Australia, which was negotiated behind their backs and tore up their own deal to sell submarines and make Australia the centrepiece of France’s Indo-Pacific strategy. Since then, say the French, the Americans have gone out of their way to repair the lost trust; but not the British. The only language that Britain understands right now, conclude the French, is one that involves a show of strength.The second problem is that the old British reflex of blaming the French, especially when it helps to distract attention from domestic troubles, is becoming politically problematic. Mr Macron faces a presidential election next April, and needs both to be seen to be defending French interests and not letting an affront go unchallenged. As it is, under the Le Touquet agreement signed in 2003, France allows British immigration officers to control entry to Britain at channel ports on French soil (and vice versa). Several aspirant presidential candidates to his right, including Michel Barnier, the EU’s former Brexit negotiator, vow simply to let migrants go on to Britain if they wish. By over-reacting, Mr Macron’s government undermines its own claim to be ready for serious dialogue. But, as one French official says, “as long as the first instinct of the British is to blame us, it’s difficult to have a meaningful conversation.”In particular the French resent the charge that they are not doing their bit to patrol the coastline or to welcome refugees. In recent years, with the help of British finance, they have built up high fencing and tighter checks on freight leaving France through the Channel tunnel, in order to keep migrants from crossing to Britain via that route. This has encouraged people to try their chances in small boats from the beaches instead. So far this year, the French coastguards say that they have rescued 7,800 migrants from the Channel. French authorities have also arrested 1,552 people-smugglers, and dismantled 44 trafficking networks.Moreover, last year France received 93,475 applications for asylum, the highest number in the EU after Germany, compared with 36,041 in Britain, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Many refugees have family in Britain, however, and do not want to stay in France; some spend only hours on French soil. The French want closer co-operation with EU neighbours, such as Belgium and Germany, in order to try to break up the people-smuggling rings that bring refugees to the French coast in the first place.“The problem today is that both France and the UK see what the other is doing through their own prism,” wrote Michel Duclos and Georgina Wright in a note for the Institut Montaigne, a think-tank: “ Neither thinks the other side is serious about strengthening co-operation.” In the long run, the two neighbours and allies will need to rebuild confidence and work more closely together. In the short run, the prospect of restoring cross-Channel trust looks lamentably slim.
22  RUSSIA’S LARGEST component republic is Yakutia. It extends well into the Arctic Circle and is as big as Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Finland and Romania combined, but with a population of just 1m people. Over the past decade retreating sea ice has opened up a new shipping lane along its coast, the Northern Sea Route (NSR). This is the shortest passage between the ports of east Asia and western Europe, but its icy waters also offer something even more precious: geological bounty, in the form of cobalt, tin and rare-earth metals, deep below the surface.Listen to this story.Hostile weather and other obstacles to extraction make prospecting along the NSR a daunting venture. Nonetheless, numerous arms of the Russian state as well as private investors have already set their sights on these underwater minerals, in addition to the area’s oil and gas. Discoveries of deposits on land give hope of further bounty offshore. Nodules—tiny balls of oxides scattered across the ocean floor, and first identified off the coast of Siberia—hold special promise. They contain minerals that can be used in everything from electronics to rechargeable batteries.But there is a problem. The nodules are formed when seawater penetrates magma chambers deep below the sea floor. This water is heated to extreme temperatures before it ascends back towards the surface through chimney-like vents—in effect, submarine volcanoes. The process leaches metals out of the earth’s crust and deposits them on the sea floor. But the vents also warm the water in their vicinity, which sustains remarkable ecosystems on the seabed. These habitats are little understood and would take decades to study fully. In the absence of proper environmental controls, biologists and oceanographers fear that mineral extraction around the vents could destroy irreplaceable habitats.“Impact assessment is easier to do on land,” says Javier Escartin of the Laboratoire de Géologie, an academic institution in Paris. “We don’t have data on the ocean, where ecosystems are often so fragile they don’t recover in human timescales.” An evaluation along the NSR would require sophisticated robots to collect samples and map the sea floor—endeavours that some argue would be so expensive that they would make exploitation of undersea resources unviable.For now, Russian mining companies are guarded. Alrosa, Russia’s largest diamond producer, describes Yakutia as “a northern frontier for short-term exploration”, though the company provided no specifics. Nornickel, a big producer of nickel off the Taimyr peninsula, stresses the need for green construction standards but “does not conduct deep-sea mining and currently has no plans to do so”. Yet in 2001 Russia submitted a claim to expand its exclusive economic zone from 200 nautical miles from the coast to as far, in some places, as the North Pole.Completely icebound just 20 years ago, Yakutia’s waters are now navigable by ordinary ships for four months a year, and global warming will probably widen that window. As the passage becomes busier, many see alarming risks: in addition to environmental impact studies, there are calls for greater protections for indigenous people, restrictions on dredging and pollution, and transparency regarding mining operations. “Regulation is insufficient, especially now that the Arctic is open for business,” says Malte Humpert, founder of The Arctic Institute, an American think-tank. The NSR, it seems, is an emerging economic and environmental flashpoint, both above water and below. 
23  YOU WAIT, rifle in hand. An enemy appears. You kill him, and whoop for joy. Welcome to VALORANT, a popular video game that some people play professionally. This year the VALORANT Champions Tour, a series of contests that ends next month, will offer $1m in total prize money. Eighty players are competing; all are men.Listen to this story.Some 42% of gamers who watch e-sports (at least occasionally) are female, and women often commentate on tournaments. But of the 300 highest-earning e-sports players, not one is a woman. Why so few women make it to the top is poorly understood. E-sports do not require physical strength. But they do require dedication, and the pool of avid female gamers is smaller than the pool of males.It may be that girls are on average less keen than boys on video games, or have better things to do. Certainly, young males tend to play such games for longer hours than their sisters, which irks their parents but is essential if one wishes to turn pro. Some women may find the culture uncongenial: amateur shoot-em-up gamers linked via headsets often shout obscenities at each other and the screen. Some female gamers face hazing.All-female e-sports tournaments do exist, but are less competitive, less popular and less well rewarded. An all-female VALORANT tournament in September offered €20,000 ($23,000) in prize money.This is not much, but more than the players could have earned elsewhere.Some in the industry are trying to promote more female participation. G2 Esports, based in Berlin, recently announced its first-ever all-female team. David Beckham’s Guild franchise now includes Guild X, a team of five women. They will enjoy the same tournament preparation as male players, to help them compete at a higher level. Klaudia “Cinnamon” Beczkiewicz, the captain, says: “It’s like we have a family...that believes in us.” Whether that is enough to transform e-sports remains to be seen.
