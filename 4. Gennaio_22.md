0   UK foreign secretary Liz Truss on Monday faced calls to do more to tackle “dirty money” flooding into the UK as she announced plans to toughen the sanctions regime against Russian oligarchs with links to the Kremlin.The legislation, which will come into force next week, would “significantly strengthen” the UK’s ability to deal with Russia’s “aggressive action towards Ukraine”, Truss said. The move was part of “an unprecedented package of co-ordinated sanctions” that the UK was preparing with its allies, she added.Officials said the new powers would allow Britain to act in “lockstep with the US and other allies to freeze assets and ban travel” in the event Russia’s forces invaded Ukraine.Truss said the expansion of the sanctions regime would allow the UK to target “any individual and business of economic or strategic significance to the Kremlin”.Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative MP and chair of the foreign affairs select committee, welcomed the announcement but pointed out his committee had first called for a tightening of the sanctions regime against Russia four years ago. “The strongest thing we can do to defend Ukraine is to defend ourselves against filth and corruption in our city.”In 2018, the government estimated £100bn of “dirty money” had flooded into the UK, from countries including Russia. Two years later the parliamentary intelligence and security committee said the City of London provided “ideal mechanisms” for the recycling of illicit finance, adding it had become a “laundromat” for offshore wealth.David Lammy, Labour’s shadow foreign secretary, supported the move to tighten sanctions but accused successive Conservative-led governments of not acting sooner. “For too long our defences have been let down at home while the government looks abroad.London is the destination of choice for the world’s kleptocrats.”Dmitry Peskov, spokesperson for Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, said the UK’s move amounted to a “blatant attack on business”.Truss also said the government would revive a long-delayed economic crime bill — designed to crack down on the flow of dirty money to the UK — by the end of the year. Tory MPs, including the government’s anti-corruption champion John Penrose, had criticised Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, last week for delays in bringing forward the legislation.The bill is expected to include crucial reform of Companies House to crack down on the abuse of shell companies as well as powers to unmask the real owners of offshore companies who own UK property and tougher powers to challenge unexplained wealth.Truss said the government would publish a long-delayed review by April 5 into how more than 700 wealthy Russians, who secured so-called Tier 1 visas allowing them to live in the UK, had acquired their wealth. The probe was ordered in 2018 in the wake of the Salisbury nerve agent attack that targeted a former Russian intelligence officer, which the UK has blamed on Moscow.British officials said the new sanction powers were needed as under previous legislation ministers had only been able to target those linked to the destabilisation of Ukraine.But analysts and lawyers rejected that claim. Tom Keatinge, an expert in finance and security at the Royal United Services Institute think-tank, pointed to the global anti-corruption sanctions regulations adopted last year.“It has taken the brink of war in Europe for the government to think about sweeping out the Augean stable of dirty Russian money in London, when it could have done this previously via sanctions, unexplained wealth orders [UWO] or other measures,” he said.Under a UWO, National Crime Agency investigators can freeze assets and seize property in the UK unless subjects can explain how they can legitimately have afforded the purchases.Neill Blundell, the head of the corporate crime and investigations team at Macfarlanes, said the UK’s pre-existing sanctions legislation relating to Russia was not as “narrow as it is being depicted”.
1   Boris Johnson’s government is being accused of a “straightforward breach” of its election manifesto promise to match billions of pounds worth of EU development funding for UK nations and regions after Brexit.The government pledged in its 2019 election manifesto that a new Shared Prosperity Fund would “at a minimum” match the £1.5bn a year in EU regional funds that was returned to the UK from its EU membership contributions, and “reaffirmed” that commitment in last October’s Budget.These “EU structural funds” were designed to support economic development and reduce regional inequalities, particularly through investment in small businesses, skills and innovation, the green economy and other infrastructure projects.However, the devolved administrations and some English regional authorities say they face being left hundreds of millions of pounds out of pocket after the government unveiled a fund worth an average of £870mn a year over the next three years.The Welsh government said that its calculations found that Wales would be “close to £1bn” worse off over the next three years, comprising £750mn in “lost” structural funds and £242mn in support for farmers.“It’s a straightforward breach of the manifesto pledge,” said Vaughan Gething, the Welsh economy minister in an interview with the Financial Times, adding that sports and apprenticeship programmes were facing real-terms cuts as a result.Scotland’s governing Scottish National party said a reduction to the EU structural funds would hit “key projects and communities”.Scotland should not receive “one penny less” than under EU membership, said Alison Thewliss, an SNP MP and Treasury spokesperson.In Northern Ireland, the loss of EU funding could amount to £65mn a year, according to official presentations to a Stormont budget committee hearing this month, which also estimated losses of up to 6,000 jobs and more than £500mn in investment.English regions are also facing cuts, according to analysis commissioned for the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, a regional economic lobby group, which found that funding in areas such as Teesside and Leeds could fall by up to 50 per cent.Henri Murison, director of the partnership, said the figures exposed “the gap between rhetoric and reality”, accusing the government of “broken promises” on retaining regional investment post-Brexit.“Many of the places that stand to lose out the most under the current funding formula are the ones most in need of serious investment.”The Shared Prosperity Fund is set to launch in April, with the government committing £400mn this year, rising to £700mn in 2023-24 and finally to £1.5bn in the final year of the spending review in 2024-25.These funds will replace EU structural funds, which were agreed on a seven-year cycle and totalled £10.5bn for 2014-2020, the last period for which the UK was a member of the EU.Typically, funds agreed for development projects falling in the latter parts of a seven-year cycle would continue to be disbursed for up to three years after the funding cycle ends, meaning EU regional funds are still being paid out in the UK up until at least 2023.Gething raised concerns last October with Michael Gove, the UK minister for levelling up, that the government in Westminster was double counting, or “netting off”, payments from the past EU settlement in order to make good on its promise not to see a diminution in regional funds since 2020.“Instead of having fresh or new money to commit each and every year, the UK government is including spending committed under previous years in its calculation for this year’s funding,” he said.The levelling up department confirmed that the UK government spending would not match the £1.5bn average EU payments until 2024-2025. It added that devolved administrations could also access regional finance funds via the British Business Bank.“We have been clear throughout that UK-wide funding for the UK Shared Prosperity Fund — worth over £2.6bn [over three years] — will ramp up to at least match receipts from EU structural funds, which on average reached around £1.5bn per year,” it said.However, October’s Budget documents said that the Shared Prosperity Fund “will at a minimum match the size of EU Funds in each nation and in Cornwall, each year”.
2   The US has drawn up sanctions targeting Vladimir Putin’s inner circle and its ties to the west as Washington broadens the list of financial penalties it and European allies will impose if Russia invades Ukraine.The move comes as the UK vowed on Monday to introduce new legislation strengthening London’s ability to target Kremlin-linked businesses and their owners in the country in case of Russian aggression on Ukraine.Senior US administration officials told the Financial Times that a list of individuals and family members that would be hit with sanctions had been developed in co-ordination with US allies as part of the effort to punish the Russian president in the event of an attack.“The individuals we have identified are in or near the inner circles of the Kremlin and play a role in government decision making or are at a minimum complicit in the Kremlin’s destabilising behaviour,” the US officials said.The administration officials did not name the Russian oligarchs and family members in question but said that many were “particularly vulnerable targets because of their deepened financial ties with the west”.“Sanctions would cut them off from the international financial system and ensure that they and their family members will no longer be able to enjoy the perks of parking their money in the west and attending elite western universities,” the senior Biden administration officials said.The measures to target Russian oligarchs would come in addition to broader sanctions against sectors of Russia’s economy, including banking and energy, that the US and its allies have been discussing for weeks.On Monday, British government officials said that, under new legislation, the UK would be able to act in “lockstep with the US and other allies to freeze assets and ban travel”.Speaking in parliament on Monday, Liz Truss, UK foreign minister, said: “We will be able to target any company that is linked to the Russian state, engages in business of economic significance to the Russian state or operates in a sector of strategic significance to the Russian state.”In Washington, senior Biden administration officials said the targets had been chosen among Russian leaders, officials, senior executive officers or members of the boards of directors of state-owned companies. They could be operating in “any sector of the Russian economy as identified by the Secretary of the Treasury”, and extended to spouses and children.The US officials said some of the individuals were selected from a classified list of senior political figures and Russian oligarchs sent to Congress by the Treasury department in 2018, known as Section 241 of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, a law enacted in 2017.“Putin’s cronies will no longer be able to use their spouses or other family members as proxies to evade sanctions,” the senior administration officials said.The UK’s parallel effort focusing on oligarchs will be particularly important to the US given that many members of the Russian elite have assets and other financial ties in Britain.“The US and UK are in lockstep and we are prepared — in co-ordination with other allies and partners — to impose massive costs if Russia further invades Ukraine. Russia knows that. We welcome the UK’s strong partnership on enforcing existing sanctions for malicious activity and in preparing packages of strong economic measures to deter further Russian aggression,” a spokesperson for the White House’s National Security Council told the Financial Times.The penalties against Russia’s elite do not preclude Washington from imposing sanctions that directly target Putin, which Biden said was a possibility last week.“This is not the exhaustive list of costs we will impose. All options remain on the table,” the senior administration officials said.
3   The botched attempt by Italy’s political parties to appoint a new president is a blessing in disguise. Sergio Mattarella’s decision to accept a second seven-year term as head of state was the best outcome for a country that badly needs political stability and a degree of consensus to take advantage of EU funds and engineer a long overdue economic revamp. Nobody thought it was possible because Mattarella had made plain his scepticism about two-term presidencies. It took eight rounds of voting and an unedifying display of ineptitude and duplicity by Italy’s politicians to convince him otherwise.Fortunately, it means that Mario Draghi can stay on as prime minister until the next parliamentary elections, due in 2023, brokering deals among the parties for economic and administrative reforms and overcoming resistance from the country’s cumbersome bureaucracy. Draghi’s national unity government last year made a decent start to implementing the reform promises agreed under Italy’s EU recovery plan, even if some measures were watered down. But 2022 is likely to be more demanding. Italy has to meet 100 milestones to receive its next slices of EU money. Reforms to the tax system, public procurement and civil service will strain government unity.Putting himself forward for the presidency and then failing to win sufficient backing from the political parties, could have badly undermined Draghi’s authority, especially if someone else had been installed in the president’s Palazzo Quirinale. But a second term for Mattarella, who has proved a deft guiding force as president, was what Draghi and most others originally wanted. The political parties backing his government emerge from this painful process looking weak and divided, which may give Draghi a stronger hand to drive through difficult choices. With the presidency settled, he can be less accommodating to party leaders.It is a mistake to expect miracles from the former European Central Bank president. Italy’s problems are too entrenched. Political discipline will inevitably break down as the elections approach. But it is hard to imagine anybody better placed to try to make the most of what is still a once-in-a-generation opportunity for Italy to raise its growth potential, albeit by just a bit.If the outcome of the presidential election is positive in the short term, the longer-term prospects for Italian democracy look bleak. It is hard see how either the rightwing parties or those notionally on the left could form a governing bloc such is the animosity unleashed by this process within the political families.The Five Star leader Giuseppe Conte went behind the backs of the centre-left to cut a deal with Matteo Salvini’s nationalist League. Salvini in the end backed Mattarella without consulting the far-right Brothers of Italy. The governing parties are also bitterly divided, with factional and personal interests holding sway. With his erratic manoeuvring, Salvini damaged his credibility within the League. The Brothers of Italy, which opposes the national unity government and wants early elections instead, was the only party to show consistency in this process. Alas, it may emerge from it strengthened. But it would still need the support of the centre-right to take power.Italy’s governing parties are so dysfunctional it is hard to imagine how they can see through the five-year contract they signed with the EU to pass reforms in exchange for €191bn of investment. Another national unity government may be necessary. But outsourcing political leadership to unelected technocrats is not a good long-term solution for a modern democracy.
4   What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object? Wintershall Dea, Europe’s largest private energy company, is about to find out.Climate change lobbyists want BASF to spin off Wintershall Dea, which is 73 per cent owned by the German chemicals group, in a separate listing. But Mikhail Fridman, whose LetterOne fund holds a 27 per cent stake, is not playing ball. The fund on Monday said it will block any near-term IPO effort. LetterOne has the right to do so until the end of 2023.BASF wants to rejig its portfolio, moving away from bulk commodities such as fertilisers and oil and gas to focus on growth areas such as battery power and crop protection. Europe’s energy crisis suggests a continuing need for fossil fuels. But the former businesses run counter to BASF’s plans to reduce its carbon footprint by a quarter by 2030 and hit net zero by 2050.Fridman and LetterOne think selling these businesses too soon would override any later benefits. Wintershall has significant Russian exposure, accounting for half of its upstream production in 2020. Wintershall is also one of the European partners of Gazprom in the Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2 pipelines. Both carry heightened political risk because of the threat of sanctions should Russia invade Ukraine.Despite oil prices hitting seven-year highs and near-record natural gas costs, shares in Gazprom and local rival Rosneft have fallen since December. Both trade at roughly half the eight times forward earnings of their counterparts in the Stoxx Europe oil and gas index. A Wintershall IPO, which might raise €4bn for BASF, could receive a discount of 60 per cent to its peers, said Jefferies.Fridman will know something about timing given his lucrative sale to Rosneft of Russian oil explorer TNK-BP in 2011. Meanwhile, despite the best efforts of BASF’s management, its shares have gone sideways for a decade. A listing at such a low valuation should deter even the staunchest of BASF’s environmentalist shareholders. Understandably, Fridman would prefer to wait.
5   Inflation in Germany and Spain stayed higher than expected in January, increasing the pressure on the European Central Bank to explain whether it still thinks eurozone price growth will fall below its target later this year.Sharp increases in energy and food prices led to annual German inflation of 5.1 per cent in January, down from 5.7 per cent in December, according to the country’s harmonised index of consumer prices published on Monday.“A number of service providers — restaurants, hotels, hairdressers, craftsmen, etc — have raised their prices since the summer of 2021 to make up for lost turnover,” said Marco Wagner, senior economist at Commerzbank. “This category also includes package holidays.”This meant German inflation did not fall as much as expected by economists polled by Reuters, who had forecast a bigger drop to 4.7 per cent. Compared with the previous month, inflation was up 0.9 per cent, indicating underlying price pressures remain strong.Annual inflation in Spain also remained higher than expected at 6.1 per cent in January, down from 6.5 per cent in December.The ECB has a target of 2 per cent inflation for the eurozone and last month forecast price growth would fall back below this level by the fourth quarter of this year, justifying its decision to maintain a supportive monetary policy stance.Economists expect eurozone inflation to fall from a record high of 5 per cent in December to 4.4 per cent in January, when those figures are released on Wednesday. Some analysts have been raising their forecasts to reflect pressure on energy prices as a result of tensions between Russia and Ukraine and further disruption to supply chains caused by the pandemic.“In the short term risks to the inflation outlook are clearly tilted to the upside,” said Katharina Utermöhl, senior economist at Allianz. “Next to growing geopolitical tensions putting further upward pressure on energy prices, China’s zero-Covid policy may call for more severe lockdowns which in turn could fuel inflation by further postponing any easing in global supply chain stress.”The persistence of inflation is likely to dominate the next ECB governing council meeting on Thursday, even if most economists expect it to stick to its timetable for reducing asset purchases to a lower level this year, while keeping interest rates at negative levels.“For the ECB, today’s German headline inflation data will most likely lead to yet another upward revision of its inflation projections,” said Carsten Brzeski, head of macro research at ING. “Still, we see the ECB in no position to consider hiking interest rates any time soon.”Spiralling prices are a sensitive subject for Germans, whose approach to money is still haunted by the hyperinflation of the 1920s that wiped out most people’s savings.German energy prices were boosted by the impact of higher gas prices on annual utility bills and the increase in a carbon tax by €5 to €30 a tonne at the start of this year, which more than offset a cut in a green energy tax on electricity. Core inflation in Germany, stripping out more volatile energy and food prices, fell from 3.7 per cent to 3 per cent.Part of the fall in prices was mechanical, because last year’s 1 percentage point boost to inflation from the reversal of a cut in sales tax has now dropped out of the year-on-year comparison.Spanish inflation of 6.1 per cent in January was down from 6.5 per cent in December, its highest year-on-year rise since 1992. Compared with the previous month, prices fell 0.9 per cent. But annual core inflation in the country rose from 2.1 to 2.4 per cent.
6   Mali has expelled France’s ambassador to Bamako as relations between the military junta ruling the west African country and the former colonial power continue to deteriorate.The interim government told ambassador Joel Meyer to leave Mali in 72 hours after summoning him on Monday over remarks made by France’s foreign minister. France is leading the counter-terrorism fight in Mali, which is at the heart of a jihadist insurgency that has killed thousands and displaced millions across the Sahel.“This measure follows the hostile and outrageous remarks recently made by the French minister.and the recurrence of such remarks by the French authorities towards the Malian authorities, despite repeatedly raised protests. The government of Mali strongly condemns and rejects these remarks,” Mali’s interim government said in a statement read on Malian state TV.France said it had taken note of the Malian decision and would recall Meyer. Paris also expressed solidarity with other west African governments that have called for the return of democracy in Mali. “France reiterates its commitment to the stabilisation and development of the Sahel,” a senior diplomat in Paris said.France’s foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Friday that the junta was “out of control” and illegitimate, while defence minister Florence Parly said on Saturday that French troops could pull out of Mali completely amid an escalating row over the junta’s decision to hire the Wagner Group, the Kremlin-connected Russian mercenary outfit.Mali’s government is headed by Col Assimi Goita, the soldier who led a coup that overthrew the democratically elected government in August 2020 and then seized complete control in a second coup in May 2021, ousting interim civilian leaders who were seen as close to France.Goita promised a swift transition to democracy but this month proposed holding elections in December 2025, prompting severe sanctions from regional bloc Ecowas that have in effect placed the country under an economic embargo.Isis and al-Qaeda-linked groups control large parts of central and northern Mali, which jihadis briefly captured in late 2012, prompting a French military intervention that has become increasingly unpopular as violence has spread across the country and into neighbouring Niger and Burkina Faso.Monday’s expulsion was the result of a “collision course on both sides”, said a western diplomat in Bamako. The junta and Paris have traded increasingly hostile barbs since French president Emmanuel Macron announced last June that France would halve its 5,000 troops presence in the region.Soon after, reports emerged that the junta was in talks to hire the Wagner Group, amid increasingly warm relations with the Russian government, and hundreds of its mercenaries are now in the country. Wagner mercenaries have been accused by the UN of gross human rights abuses and possible war crimes in Libya and the Central African Republic.Last week, Mali ordered the withdrawal of roughly 100 Danish troops who had arrived to join a French-led European special forces mission, prompting criticism from the 15 countries contributing to the effort.Mali’s August coup was the first in a string of putsches across west and central Africa as soldiers seized power in Chad, Guinea and, last week, Burkina Faso. On Monday, the African Union voted to suspend Burkina Faso’s involvement in “all AU activities until the effective restoration of constitutional order in the country”.
7   Portugal’s socialist prime minister will press ahead with stalled plans to increase spending on pensions and health and lift the minimum wage, after securing a resounding election victory.António Costa’s Socialist party (PS) polled almost 42 per cent of the vote to win an outright majority of 117 seats in the 230-seat parliament in Sunday’s snap parliamentary election.“Our mission now is to turn the page on the pandemic and ensure the recovery of the sectors most affected,” Costa said in a victory speech in the early hours of Monday.The unexpected result confounded pollsters who had forecast a narrow PS victory. It also ended Costa’s dependence on the far-left parties that triggered the election two years ahead of schedule by rejecting his 2022 budget.Victory gives the prime minister a stable majority to push through the defeated budget and to invest €16.6bn in EU recovery funds that Portugal is scheduled to receive over the next three years.Budget measures that are likely to move forward include a €700m increase in investment in the national health service and a €40 increase in the national minimum wage to €705 a month, as well as higher pensions and public sector wages. The minimum wage increase would cost employers about €600m this year, consultancy firms have estimated.João Leão, finance minister in the outgoing government, said on Monday that economic growth could exceed his previous target of 5.5 per cent this year, after growth of 4.9 per cent in 2021.Carla Subirana, Europe analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said fiscal prudence would remain a PS priority. The prime minister earned admiration from centre-left parties in Europe for holding down the budget deficit at the same time as overturning austerity measures.“Costa will continue to seek to hold down the budget deficit and cut public debt, which at 130 per cent of GDP is among the highest in the EU,” she said.The radical leftwing parties that triggered the election by rejecting Costa’s budget lost 20 of their combined total of 31 seats, as voters penalised the anti-capitalist Left Bloc (BE) and hardline Communist party (PCP) by transferring their votes to the PS.The two had pushed for labour law changes and even higher social spending in a budget that the PS described as already the most leftwing in Portugal’s recent history.Rui Rio, leader of the Social Democrats (PSD), the main opposition, said he was considering his position after his centre-right party polled less than 28 per cent of the vote and lost three of its 79 seats as part of a shake-up of party politics on the right. “The PSD will decide,” he said.Commentators criticised polling companies for serious failures after they projected a tight race two days ahead of the election, with the PS leading the PSD by just two or three points.Chega, a far-right populist party, polled slightly more than 7 per cent of the vote to win 12 seats, up from one seat previously, making it Portugal’s third-largest political force. The Liberal Initiative (IL), another newer party, also overtook the BE and PCP, gaining eight seats, up from one seat previously.The conservative Popular party (CDS-PP), one of the founding parties of Portugal’s democracy and a regular participant in government coalitions, lost its remaining two seats in parliament, causing Francisco Rodrigues dos Santos, its leader, to resign.Both new rightwing parties emerged in the wake of the tough austerity measures introduced by a PSD and CDS-PP alliance during Portugal’s 2011-14 bailout by the EU and IMF.That right-of-centre coalition narrowly won a general election in 2015, but Costa secured a larger majority in parliament by forging an unprecedented alliance with the Left Bloc and the Communists. Six year later, he no longer needs their support.Costa was almost apologetic about his absolute majority, given the tendency among many Portuguese voters to see such victories as delivering too much unchecked power into one party’s hands.“An absolute majority does not mean absolute power,” a visibly moved Costa told cheering supporters. “I will govern in dialogue with all the political forces elected to parliament.”Pedro Sánchez, Spain’s prime minister and a fellow socialist, congratulated Costa on his victory, saying it would help the Iberian neighbours promote “a socialist response” to Europe’s challenges.
8   The eurozone economy grew 0.3 per cent in the final three months of last year, returning the bloc to its pre-pandemic level of output despite a sharp slowdown from the previous quarter as coronavirus infections hit record levels.Fourth-quarter growth in the 19-country bloc was in line with the expectations of economists polled by Reuters, as it decelerated from 2.2 per cent growth in the previous three-month period. Household spending continued to grow in many countries, albeit at a slower pace, while output was also boosted by businesses restocking inventories.Contractions of output in Germany and Austria were offset by quarter-on-quarter growth in countries including Spain, France and Italy, as the bloc showed increased resilience to the impact of the pandemic, which had plunged it into a record post-war recession in 2020.Eurostat said on Monday that its first estimate of full-year gross domestic product showed growth of 5.2 per cent in both the eurozone and the wider EU for 2021 — the region’s fastest expansion since 1971, but slower than the US economy’s 5.7 per cent growth last year.Economists calculated that the single currency area had rebounded to pre-pandemic levels of GDP.Eurozone growth is expected to remain sluggish in the first few months of this year before economic activity picks up again as coronavirus restrictions are loosened and supply chain bottlenecks ease.“Restrictions in many countries to counter the Omicron wave are set to be lifted soon, allowing the recovery to resume in the coming months,” said Jessica Hinds, senior Europe economist at Capital Economics.Italy’s economy continued to beat expectations with growth of 0.6 per cent in the fourth quarter, leading to full-year growth of 6.4 per cent, according to figures published on Monday. It was the fastest annual expansion since at least 1995, according to Reuters. The growth was attributed to higher domestic demand driving increased output in industry and services.The eurozone’s third-largest economy has rebounded more sharply than many economists initially expected from its decline of almost 9 per cent in 2020 and is now close to returning to pre-pandemic levels of GDP.“This confirms the country’s improved ability to recover from crisis compared to previous episodes,” said Loredana Maria Federico, chief Italian economist at UniCredit.While the latest wave of Covid-19 cases has led to tighter restrictions that dented consumer spending and prolonged supply chain bottlenecks that have squeezed manufacturing, overall economic activity in Europe has been less disrupted than in previous waves.The exception has been Germany, where the economy shrank 0.7 per cent in the fourth quarter, as a drop in consumer spending and supply constraints on manufacturing weighed on overall output.The lacklustre performance of Europe’s largest economy left it 1.5 per cent below pre-pandemic levels of GDP. In contrast, the US economy was 3.1 per cent above its pre-pandemic level in the fourth quarter, while France was 0.9 per cent above pre-crisis GDP levels.Spain achieved the fastest growth in the fourth quarter, expanding 2 per cent. But the country’s greater reliance on pandemic-hit tourism has weighed on its recovery and its GDP was still 4 per cent below pre-pandemic levels.“There are a lot of country-specific drivers, not only more pandemic-related effects such as the timing of restrictions and supply chain problems but probably also how direct the hit was from high electricity prices,” said Daniel Bergvall, an economist at SEB.Austria was one of the weakest eurozone economies in the fourth quarter, when its economy shrank 2.2 per cent after it imposed a lockdown to tackle soaring coronavirus infections. In contrast, Portugal had lighter curbs and its economy grew 1.6 per cent.
9   Ukrainian police have detained a group of suspects for allegedly planning mass riots in multiple cities including the capital Kyiv, with the aim of destabilising the country as fears of a full-blown Russian invasion linger.Denys Monastyrsky, Ukraine’s interior minister, said during a televised briefing on Monday that the organisers planned to involve up to 5,000 paid-for protesters to stoke violent clashes with police. The arrests were made on Sunday. Monastyrsky did not reveal how many individuals had been arrested.“The action was organised to destabilise the situation in Ukraine,” he said. “Such rallies were planned to be held, in particular, in Sumy, Chernihiv, Poltava and Cherkasy regions.”Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, on Friday downplayed the risk of a full-scale Russian invasion, while urging the US to tone down its warnings of such a scenario, saying that “panic” threatened to undermine the country’s economy.But Ukrainian officials have also warned that any deeper Russian invasion — which the US and other countries have warned could be imminent, with Moscow amassing more than 100,000 troops near the nation’s border — could be preceded by attempts to destabilise the country internally.Monastyrsky did not explicitly suggest that the riots were orchestrated by Russia but he did express concern that two of the regions where the activities were planned were “on our northern borders with the Russian Federation”.“As is well known, one of the scenarios of aggression against Ukraine is paid-for violent massive protests. This is used and can be used as an element of [Russia’s] hybrid war,” he added.Monastyrsky also drew a parallel between the foiled riots and pro-Russian protests staged in 2014 that took place in the run-up to Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and its stoking of a proxy war in eastern regions that has claimed more than 14,000 lives.The arrests follow a Friday announcement by Ukraine’s SBU state security service on the arrest of a “Russian military intelligence agent” who was caught “red handed” plotting terrorist attacks in Odesa, the country’s strategic Black Sea port city.In a separate statement on Monday, the SBU said it had over the past year “neutralised dozens of criminal groups, whose activities were co-ordinated with Russia” and “threaten Ukraine’s national security”.The US warned this month that Moscow could use covert operations, including sabotage, in eastern Ukraine to create a “pretext for invasion”.
10  The western world may be divided about how to deal with Vladimir Putin. But we can surely all agree on one thing? Russia’s president is the bad guy in this particular drama.Actually, no. One of the more revealing and depressing features of international politics is the existence of a Putin cult. There is a significant group of world leaders and influential political figures who greatly admire Putin. His fan club is global, spanning Asia, the Middle East, the Americas and Europe.Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesman, was on to something when he remarked in 2018: “There’s a demand in the world for special, sovereign leaders, for decisive ones.Putin’s Russia was the starting point.”When Putin first emerged as leader of Russia in 1999-2000, he looked like an anomaly — a strongman nationalist in an era of technocratic globalists. Angela Merkel, Germany’s former chancellor, once suggested that Putin was trying to apply the techniques of the 19th century to a different era.But, with democratic values under challenge across the world, Putin looks increasingly like a man who foresaw the future of global politics rather than a relic from the past. The Russian leader has attracted fans and emulators who admire his ruthlessness, his willingness to use violence, his macho defiance of “political correctness” and his autocratic style of leadership. As the Russian commentator Dmitri Trenin put it last week: “Putin is a pre-communist leader.He is a tsar.”One great danger of the current Ukraine crisis is that if Putin emerges looking victorious, his style of leadership will gain even more prestige and imitators across the world. Land grabs, military threats, lies and assassinations will look like the techniques of a winner.Putin has already served as a model for a new generation of autocratic leaders and populists, including in Europe and the US. Donald Trump had to be a little coy about his admiration for Putin. But some of the former US president’s close aides were more open. After the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Rudy Giuliani praised Putin: “He makes a decision and he executes quickly.That’s what you call a leader.” During the current crisis over Ukraine, Tucker Carlson, the most influential commentator on Fox News, has been openly supportive of Putin.Viktor Orban, Hungary’s prime minister and the self-styled champion of “illiberal democracy” in the EU, is visiting Putin this week. In the past, Orban has argued that the EU needs to recognise that “Putin has made his country great again”. Like Putin, Orban has positioned himself as the champion of a minority in Ukraine — in his case, ethnic Hungarians.Putin’s other prominent fans in western Europe include Nigel Farage, the pro-Brexit campaigner, and Matteo Salvini, leader of Italy’s hard-right League and former deputy prime minister. Commenting on Putin’s dispatch of troops to the Middle East, Farage gushed: “The way he played the whole Syria thing. Brilliant.” Salvini once posed for photos in Red Square wearing a Putin T-shirt.The Putin fan club extends into Asia and the Middle East. Rodrigo Duterte, leader of the Philippines, has been widely accused of sponsoring death squads during his time as president. When Duterte was asked which world leader he most admired, he replied “my favourite hero is Putin”.Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s former prime minister, another self-styled tough guy, relished trips to Russia to discuss geopolitics with Putin. His 2019 re-election campaign featured a poster of the Israeli leader shaking hands with Putin, under the slogan “Netanyahu: In a league of his own”.Putin has bonded with strongman leaders elsewhere in the Middle East. He presented Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Egypt’s president, with a gift of a Kalashnikov rifle. Sisi, whose security forces have killed hundreds of demonstrators on the streets of Egypt, appeared enraptured by the gift.Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince and de facto leader, is another Putin fan. As he rose to power, some British advisers to MBS noted his awestruck admiration for Putin, commenting: “He was fascinated by him.He liked what he did.”The fellow feeling between the Saudi and Russian strongmen took on a new dimension, after MBS was accused of ordering the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist. For a while, it seemed as if MBS risked becoming an international pariah. It was Putin who made a point of welcoming him back into the club of world leaders. At MBS’s first G20 summit after the Khashoggi killing, the Saudi leader was high-fived by a grinning Putin. Putin himself was later accused of authorising the attempted murder of Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader.That exuberant handshake between Putin and MBS goes to the heart of the international cult of Putin. The Russian leader’s biggest admirers are often those, like Duterte and MBS, who share his taste for violence and his contempt for human rights.That is why the current confrontation between Russia and the west is about more than Ukraine’s independence, important though that is. The outcome of the crisis may also determine the tone of world politics. If Putin faces down the western democracies, his thuggish strongman style of leadership will look like the wave of the future.
11  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.Italy’s political crisis has been averted for now, as the incumbent president agreed over the weekend to stay on for another term, keeping Mario Draghi in place as prime minister. We’ll explore what this means for the European debate on fiscal rules and when the clash with more frugal-minded capitals is likely to intensify.Meanwhile, in Portugal, the ruling Socialists have been projected to win the country’s snap parliamentary election by a chunky margin.On Brexit, a new EU-UK parliamentary assembly has elected its leaderships on both sides last week. We’ll unpack what to expect from this body, at a time when trade talks are making little headway and the “partygate” scandal rumbles on in London.And in merger news, a report shows that despite increased activity last year, the European Commission has launched fewer inquiries — and has taken longer than usual to complete open ones.The chaotic recent days in Italian politics have been wounding for Mario Draghi, who signalled an appetite to become the country’s president only to turn around on Saturday and ask Sergio Mattarella to stay in the post, writes Sam Fleming in Brussels.They have been even worse for the country’s political parties, which have been riven by squabbling and infighting during six days of voting. The country’s politicians proved themselves incapable of unifying behind anything other than the status quo — fearful as they were about the prospect of early elections.Financial markets will nevertheless welcome the prospect of Draghi remaining Italy’s prime minister — inauspicious though the dysfunctional political backdrop appears in the longer term. The parties look enfeebled and internal battles are worsening. But this may leave them less willing and capable of throwing up serious opposition to Draghi’s domestic programme.One of the few things they have in common will be a desire to keep the current government alive and avoid elections before the deadline in the first half of 2023. This could accentuate Italy’s chances of staying on track with its deficit-reduction pledges, and its reform commitments under Rome’s €191bn recovery and resilience plan.The outcome is being welcomed in particular by France, which has been working closely with Rome on proposals to overhaul the EU’s fiscal governance.Draghi and French president Emmanuel Macron will find it difficult to win the fiscally conservative north over to all their reform ideas — even after the ejection of the Christian Democrats from power in Berlin and the arrival of a more reform-friendly coalition in the Netherlands.But the proposals — among them the idea of granting favourable treatment to investments in green and digital projects — will carry more weight elsewhere if they enjoy the active support of Draghi, a former president of the European Central Bank.That particularly applies in Berlin. As Erik Nielsen, chief economist at UniCredit said, “You cannot persuade the German government to do anything if they get bad vibes from Italy. So it is very good from that point of view.”Among the key moments to watch in the next two months are an informal meeting of finance ministers in Paris in late February, and a planned informal summit on growth and investment in early March.While much of the EU’s fiscal discussion thus far has focused on reforms to the Stability and Growth Pact to make it more investment-friendly, the debate will not stop there. A paper from the Jacques Delors Centre is set to argue that the EU’s Semester process, under which the commission makes yearly reform proposals to capitals on areas such as the labour markets and fiscal policy needs a significant rethink.  The new €800bn NextGenerationEU programme requires member states to adopt a subset of those Semester reform recommendations into their recovery programme. This gives those particular recommendations real teeth, given the reforms will need to be delivered to unlock payments of money by the commission. The paper by Nils Redeker and Thu Nguyen says Brussels should trim back Semester recommendations that are not linked to recovery fund payments, to avoid making proposals that are “bound to be ignored”. (More here)EU-UK relations continue to be strained after British prime minister Boris Johnson last week told the House of Commons that EU checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland were “insane”, writes Andy Bounds in Brussels.So what hopes are there for the new UK-EU Parliamentary Partnership Assembly? Nathalie Loiseau, a French MEP who will serve on the body, tells Europe Express she’s an optimist.The forum for the European parliament and the UK parliament is meant to exchange views on the relationship and scrutinise the functioning of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement. As part of its role it can request information from the Partnership Council, the joint UK-EU body overseeing the relationship.Last week the UK parliament elected its 35-strong delegation. Sir Oliver Heald, the chair, is a longstanding moderate Conservative MP who voted against Brexit. As did Hilary Benn, the senior Labour MP who is his deputy.There are other prominent Remainers, such as former MEPs Timothy Kirkhope and Emma Nicholson. But Brexiters were elected too, including Andrea Leadsom, the Conservative former minister, and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, leader of the Democratic Unionist party in Northern Ireland.On the other side of the Channel, the European parliament elected Loiseau, a former Europe minister, as its chair.Loiseau told EE she believes it can start rebuilding political co-operation across the Channel, in areas such as foreign affairs, student and academic exchanges and financial services.She particularly wants to recreate something like the Erasmus scheme that allows EU students to spend a year at university in another EU country. “Do we want to build a generation where people do not know each other? It is only the very richest families in the EU who can still afford to send their children to the UK.”However, she said there would be no new agreements such as allowing the UK to remain in the Horizon science research partnership until the UK had agreed to stick to those it had already signed, including the Northern Ireland Protocol.Does she believe relations can improve? “I am an optimist,” she said. “That is why I am a politician. Otherwise I would do something else. I would write a novel.”For decades regulators in Brussels have perfected the art of examining mergers of some of the largest multinationals, but the pandemic and new powers have led to fewer and lengthier probes, writes Javier Espinoza in Brussels.Even as 2021 saw one of the highest numbers of transactions in decades, what is striking is that the European Commission only led 14 “significant” merger investigations, the fewest seen over the past decade, according to a new report by law firm Dechert set to be published today.The average duration of an in-depth probe soared 29 per cent, reaching a new 19.2-month record since the tracker began. Researchers say the increased length is a result of companies talking to officials for longer during an informal period known as pre-filing to iron out any potential difficulties during the formal process.Separately, the average formal review period of a lengthy probe reached 9.5 months for the first time, which highlights how regulators are also willing to use their powers to pause the process more frequently. The pandemic also likely played a role in the extended duration of the review period, the report said.In the US, more than 37 per cent of significant investigations led to a complaint or an abandoned deal, the highest recorded by this tracker. This points to increased scepticism among regulators about concessions offered by companies seeking to appease competition concernsand later this week
12  Brussels has stuck by a decision to classify nuclear power and some forms of natural gas as green energy, defying criticism from scientists and climate change experts over its landmark sustainable finance rules.The European Commission on Wednesday published a largely unrevised final text of its “taxonomy for sustainable finance” which has come under fire from EU governments, environmental campaigners and the European Investment Bank for its acceptance of nuclear power and forms of carbon-emitting gas.The EU’s taxonomy is a sweeping classification system for industries that produce about 80 per cent of the bloc’s emissions to guide private capital into environmentally sustainable activities.But Brussels has come under fire for bowing to pressure from pro-nuclear and pro-gas member states to include the two technologies under the green label in an initial draft first reported by the Financial Times.Mairead McGuinness, EU commissioner for financial services, on Wednesday told reporters the text “may be imperfect but it’s a real solution that moves us forward towards our ultimate goal of climate neutrality”.“The taxonomy does not mandate investment in certain sectors. It does not prohibit investment in the sectors covered. It is a signpost towards the private investment market,” she said.Brussels’ final version of the text keeps the classification of nuclear power — which produces little CO2 but has toxic byproducts that pose radiation risks — largely unchanged. New nuclear power stations will qualify for the green label for permits issued before 2045 if countries can provide plans for safe waste management and decommissioning. The inclusion has been supported by nuclear-reliant EU countries led by France.Natural gas will also be given the green label if it is used to replace more polluting energy sources, such as coal, and if direct emissions from its use fall below 270g of CO2 per kilowatt/hour, or an average of less than 550kg a year over 20 years.This decision has been criticised by governments in Spain, Austria, Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden and Luxembourg, which called for a threshold of 100g, in line with scientific advice provided by experts to the commission.EU officials told the FT that EU commissioners from Portugal, Spain and Austria voted against the rules in an internal meeting of the college of commissioners — a rare show of dissent in meetings that are usually run on consensus.The governments of Spain, Austria and Luxembourg have said they will reject the taxonomy outright, but their opposition will not be enough to create a majority of countries needed to block it. Members of the European parliament can also veto the text with a majority vote within the next six months.Markus Ferber, a German conservative MEP, said the exercise “has failed” and warned the vote in the parliament was “by no means a sure-fire exercise”.The commission’s taxonomy comes as the EU’s reliance on natural gas — with Russia Europe’s largest single provider — has come under fire as Moscow raised military tensions over Ukraine, helping to drive up European electricity prices.Luca Bonaccorsi from Transport & Environment, a clean transport campaign group, said the labelling of gas would lead to a “wave of investments in gas, sabotaging the continent’s entire decarbonisation efforts. It is a gift to Putin at the very time we should be ditching gas.”The EU carbon price closed at a record high of €95 on Wednesday, or three times what it was a year ago, on expectations of stricter climate policies, as well as a result of the gas crisis. The price of allowances traded under the bloc’s emissions trading system gives the buyer permission to emit one tonne of carbon.Even with the elevated cost of polluting, it has continued to be more economical for power generators to switch from gas to coal, the most polluting fossil fuel. The carbon price would need to rise to around €200 to make the use of gas more profitable than coal, according to estimates by data provider Refinitiv.  
13  The former boss of scandal-hit French nursing home operator Orpea has come under fire after it emerged he sold shares in the group ahead of the publication of a book alleging residents were mistreated.Orpea, one of Europe’s biggest listed care home groups, is under investigation by authorities after The Gravediggers, a book by journalist Victor Castanet published in January, alleged the company systematically cut corners, including rationing adult nappies, to save money at the 370 or so nursing homes it operates in France.Orpea’s former chief executive Yves Le Masne — who was fired on Sunday — sold almost €590,000 of shares in the company at the end of July, filings from French regulator the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) show.That was just weeks after Orpea received detailed questions about allegations contained in Castanet’s book when he contacted it for comment, France’s weekly Le Canard Enchaîné newspaper reported on Wednesday.Le Masne did not respond to requests for comment. Orpea’s new chief executive Philippe Charrier told BFM TV it was a matter for his predecessor and that “authorities would examine the case”.“He may have had good reasons but I will not judge this in the place of authorities,” Charrier added.Le Masne had sold blocks of shares in the past. The July sale was at €107.85 a share. The stock price has collapsed to about €40 per share since the allegations came to light.Brigitte Bourguignon, a French government minister, said she was “even more disgusted” by the situation surrounding Orpea after Le Masne’s share sale came to light.“There will be detailed investigations (of all the allegations),” Bourguignon told LCI television on Wednesday, adding they would focus on the finances of Orpea and conditions in its homes.The AMF declined to comment on whether it would open its own investigation. Orpea has also denied another of Castanet’s allegations: that he was offered a bribe by the company to stop his investigation.The Orpea scandal has erupted as France is in the throes of a presidential election campaign.Rightwing candidate Valérie Pécresse of Les Républicains said she would seek to overhaul the sector with stricter rules on how for-profit care homes were run. Communist party candidate Fabien Roussel on Wednesday called on the government to “expropriate” Orpea’s care homes. 
14  Dear reader,There was a hint of parody about the Benefits of Brexit. The official document published here in London on Monday — the second anniversary of the UK leaving the EU — enthused about blue passports and crown stamps on pint glasses.It was published on the same day as a heavily redacted report on lockdown parties in Downing Street. In both cases, critics said, it looked as though anything of significance had been removed.That is harsh. But it is fair to say that the Brexit project is not delivering what some cheerleaders had hoped. In December, the government’s chief EU negotiator Lord David Frost resigned in frustration over the direction of travel.Meanwhile, the drawbacks of Brexit are materialising as predicted. As of October, UK imports and exports of goods were 16 per cent below the expected trend if the UK had stayed in the EU, according to the pro-EU Centre for European Reform.High time, then, for the government to take advantage of its newfound ability to forge its own rules. There should be scope to improve on the EU’s “one size fits all” approach that does not always accommodate national differences. Reforming agricultural subsidies, for example, will allow the UK to steer away from food production and towards biodiversity and carbon reduction.Well-designed rules could, in some cases, give the UK a competitive edge. In fintech, the government wants regulators to experiment and collaborate with business. It wants to encourage the use of “sandboxes”, which allow businesses to experiment under a regulator’s supervision, for example in testing new products.The UK has a chance of securing a “first mover” advantage by regulating emerging industries before the EU does. The government cites digital markets, artificial intelligence, gene editing, artificial meats and autonomous vehicles as examples of “new and exciting areas”.But it will be far from straightforward. The National Farmers’ Union says new precision breeding techniques, such as gene editing, could offer huge benefits. But many environmental campaigners want to stick with EU restrictions. Getting the public onside could be a struggle.In the case of autonomous vehicles, the UK could attract manufacturers and developers by relaxing restrictions on companies accessing personal data. But that could prompt the EU to withdraw the adequacy ruling that allows data exchange with the UK when it comes up for review in 2025.The cost to UK companies of transferring data from the EU in that scenario has been estimated at as much as £1.6bn. Moreover, safety standards for autonomous cars are governed by international agreements, rendering regulatory autonomy something of a token advantage, according to a study by UK In a Changing Europe, a think-tank.The UK’s freedom of manoeuvre is limited by the increasing division of the world into three regulatory spheres of interest: the US, EU and China. An innovative UK regime might not prove sustainable after the larger blocs have made their moves, says the Institute for Government. That said, the UK might be able to form alliances with other regulators, or exert influence on them.Escaping the EU’s orbit is tricky because many businesses do not want to operate under multiple different regimes. Chemicals producers have warned that replacing EU regulation could cost the industry £1bn.No wonder some of the punchier numbers about scrapping EU rules have been scaled back. The government says its reforms will cut £1bn of red tape for UK businesses. That compares with the Leave Campaign’s claim, ahead of the referendum, that Brexit could remove £33bn of Brussels red tape.There are some real opportunities as the UK diverges from EU rules. But they are unlikely to match up to the hopes of those, like Frost, who wanted Brexit to create a lightly regulated economy. Replacing existing rules can lead to additional burdens, while new technology and the move to net zero will require an entirely new set of edicts. The promised bonfire of red tape is failing to catch alight.Enjoy the rest of the week,Vanessa Houlder Lex writer
15  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.The EU’s long-awaited final text on the so-called taxonomy for what is considered a green investment (nuclear and gas included) is set to be published today. We’ll look at why all the opposition to the text hasn’t made much of a difference, and what are the next steps.Meanwhile, on the eastern front, Russia’s president Vladimir Putin dug his heels in yesterday, accusing western powers of ignoring his demands and dragging his country into war with Ukraine. Next door in Kyiv, the procession of western officials continued, with the prime ministers of the Netherlands, Poland and the UK all meeting with Ukraine’s president yesterday to show support.Switching gears, remember the idea — floated last year — of having an EU-wide digital wallet for personal, medical or official records? We’ll explore why it’s off to a rather bad start.It’s D-Day for the EU’s fraught publication of its green finance rules, writes Mehreen Khan in Brussels.The European Commission will this afternoon publish the final version of its taxonomy on sustainable finance, which has been heavily criticised for classifying nuclear power and some forms of natural gas as green energy sources.Ramming home the dissent, environmental campaigners will be greeting today’s text with a protest featuring commission president Ursula von der Leyen’s head on a mock tombstone reading “RIP EU Green Deal” outside the executive’s headquarters in Brussels.Today’s publication is the penultimate step in a taxonomy process that has been littered with complaints from environmental groups, some EU governments and even the European Investment Bank. Green experts, MEPs and governments, including those of Austria, the Netherlands, Spain, Luxembourg and Denmark, as well as Germany’s Greens, have all called for the commission to exclude natural gas from the green label.Their calls are likely to fall on deaf ears. Mairead McGuinness, EU commissioner for financial services, has said there will be no major changes from an initial draft that the Financial Times first reported on New Year’s Eve.The classification of fossil gas and nuclear power will be largely unchanged, but officials have told Europe Express there will still be some tweaks to watch out for. One of them includes removing targets for the blending of gas with renewables for 2026 and 2030 to qualify for the green label. In theory, that will make it easier for gas to be considered a sustainable investment.One key demands from anti-gas campaigners will not make it into the final text. This is a call for the inclusion of gas only if it emits less than 100g of CO2 per kilowatt hour of power and is used to replace more polluting sources such as coal. An initial designation of 270g will remain.Amid the outcry, expect the commission to put up a staunch defence of the rules at a press conference this afternoon. Brussels is also well aware that despite the complaints and even threats of legal action, there is no super majority of member states to reject the taxonomy outright.That leaves the European parliament as the only institution that can still stop the taxonomy in its tracks. MEPs would need to find a majority — 353 votes — to veto the rules and force the commission to go back to the drawing board. Anti-taxonomy MEPs are already rallying their troops.A rejection would be an embarrassing blow for the commission that has flaunted the taxonomy as a trailblazing green financial regulation that will create a “green gold standard” for the rest of the world to follow.Even if MEPs can’t veto the rules, investors may still shun the standard if they think it offers the greenwashing it was designed to eliminate. Should markets choose to comply with more rigorous alternatives — such as those being devised in the UK or the US — the EU’s green taxonomy will have failed on its own terms.Unemployment in the eurozone fell to a record low of 7 per cent at the end of last year, underlining how the region’s labour market has bounced back much faster than expected from the impact of the pandemic. (More here)Last summer, the EU unveiled plans for a digital wallet so that citizens could have access to services online, but some member states are starting to think it might not be a good idea after all, writes Javier Espinoza in Brussels.The project was supposed to allow EU citizens to securely store payment details and passwords and log into local government sites to pay bills with a single sign-on, recognised across the bloc. The proposals are non-binding and allow member states to implement them as they see fit.But some countries, including Ireland and Denmark, are starting to have reservations about the plans.A letter signed by 14 member states outlines their fears. These are twofold:
16  Descending a long ramp into the concrete basement of a former crematorium in north-west Berlin, the first thing that strikes you is the sound: hornlike organs fill this wide, dim hall, causing the metal rafters on the ceiling to rattle and leaving your ears a little numb from the low vibrations. A deep, swirling hum comes out of old church organ pipes, fibreglass tubes and bells that lie scattered on the floor, part of German musicians Phillip Sollmann and Konrad Sprenger’s sound installation, “Modular Organ System”, in the 23rd edition of Berlin’s CTM festival.Since the late 1990s, the festival — whose first part is on now, the second in May — has been at the forefront of the German avant-garde, venturing through the challenging, the esoteric, the ecstatic and the downright weird matrices of art and music.“Modular Organ System” fits in neatly. It feels like stepping into a vast dissection room and at the heart of the operation sit Sprenger and Sollmann at a laptop, controlling the flow of air currents through funnels and tubes to produce sound. These currents function as breath, of particular poignance in a post-Covid world where the act of breathing is both profound (it tethers us to existence and one another) and potentially perilous.Against a deep, billowing keynote, pipes can be layered, taking the soundscape from minimalist electronica to Buddhist temple ritual to hypnotic drone music. Over a 10-day run, different musicians join the duo to collaborate, such as American guitarist Stephen O’Malley, who runs his electric guitar through distortion pedals and amplifiers for an improvised duet with the system. But even without collaborators, the performance is living and meditative, breathtaking and breath-giving.Across town in Kreuzberg is Connected Alienation, an immersive group exhibition as part of CTM that invites artists to present work responding to the lack of human contact during the pandemic. (Contact is the overarching theme at the festival.)Highlights here include Jump-Cut, a six-part art-film series curated by Dana Gingras (the choreographer behind dance company Animals of Distinction). Gingras saw an opportunity for collaboration as international touring ground to halt, bringing dancers, video artists and musicians into contact with each other to make a short film.Running at 21 minutes, “Jump Cut #3” (directed by Austin Young) is bursting to the brim with colour, lewdness and monstrous camp. In a work that is less about contact and more about transformation, stars of the TV show RuPaul’s Drag Race rob a wig store to the sound of pithy, grinding electro by Canadian-born provocateur Peaches. In the throbbing, anti-establishment song “Flip This”, she spits: “Kick a column watch it tumble/Now is not the time to mumble/Scream it out and feel the rumble/Fuck the system make it crumble.” The film skirts scholarly piety with much-needed silliness. But if Peaches and co truly want a rumble, there is a former crematorium offering just that.CTM Festival part one runs until February 6; part two is May 24-29, ctm-festival.de
17  Compared with the limited and lightning-fast operation in Kazakhstan, today the international community is warning that Russia appears to be preparing for a very different operation: a comprehensive invasion of Ukraine.Moscow has repeatedly denied that it plans to invade, despite open-source intelligence showing that it continues to mass troops on the border between the countries. But should President Vladimir Putin order an attack, 62-year-old Serdyukov, the head of Russia’s VDV paratroopers — the world’s largest airborne force — is likely to play a leading role.“The VDV is typically the tip of the spear,” said Michael Kofman, a Russian military expert at the US research organisation CNA and author of a widely cited article on Putin’s military strategy. “It has already fought extensively in Ukraine in 2014 and 2015. You would see quite a few VDV formations in any new invasion.”Serdyukov’s career, which has encompassed deployments in Chechnya and Crimea, is illustrative of how Russia’s army has evolved under Putin, with the military, alongside the country’s nuclear arsenal, becoming a central instrument of the president’s foreign policy, say analysts.Two decades ago, the military was a lumbering and poorly equipped Soviet-era force of badly paid conscripts, padded with officers — almost one for each soldier — that took heavy casualties during the brutal suppression of the Islamist insurgency in Chechnya.Today, analysts say, it is a streamlined force capable of peacekeeping operations in Kazakhstan, out-of-theatre interventions such as in Syria in 2015, and stealthier missions, such as the annexation of Crimea in 2014. “The Ukrainian army may be better than it was in 2014, but Russian forces are still far stronger and have also modernised,” said Bettina Renz, author of Russia’s Military Revival and professor of international security at Nottingham university. “[Russia] has more capabilities, and with that comes more options.”The turning point came in 2008 when Russian forces bungled a war with Georgia. The intervention lasted only five days, yet several planes were lost to friendly fire, and field communications were so poor that commanders reportedly had to use their own mobile phones. Reconnaissance drones could only transmit pictures after landing, instead of in real time.A massive revamp ensued. Pay was increased, equipment modernised, combat strategies refined and a demoralised officer class increasingly deployed into action. Poorly trained conscripts began to be replaced with career soldiers. “Now the [army] is able to choose and recruit.maybe not the absolute best, but not the worst either,” said Ruslan Pukhov, director of the Moscow-based Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies.The Pentagon last week warned that Russia had deployed enough troops and equipment to invade Ukraine at any moment and had a “range of options”, including an attack aimed at occupying the country.Analysts estimate that 52 Iskander ballistic missile launchers have been placed near the border, plus 76 battle-ready Battalion Tactical Groups, which average 800 troops, more than twice the usual number. Overall, Russia has an army of about 900,000 personnel, including 280,000 ground troops. Over the past decade, it has added new aircraft, modernised its tanks and cut the ratio of conscripts to enlisted soldiers from nearly half to 30 per cent. Ukraine has an active force of 261,000 personnel, of which 145,000 are in the army, plus a further 900,000 reservists. Although hardened by eight years of conflict in the Donbas, where separatists are fighting to break away from Kyiv, the Ukrainians lack comprehensive air defence systems, most of which remain in Crimea and are in Russian hands.The fruits of Russia’s reforms became clear during the annexation of Crimea and were confirmed the following year in Syria, say analysts. “To many people’s surprise here, including mine, Russian actions [in Syria] were successful, efficient and cost effective,” Fyodor Lukyanov, editor-in-chief of Russia in Global Affairs magazine, said in a recent interview at Pittsburgh university’s centre for international studies.Syria also served as a test bed for precision missile strikes and unmanned vehicles and as a training ground for more than 60,000 personnel, including officers.“Serdyukov’s experience is the rule rather than the exception,” said Henry Boyd, a military expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. “Russia has a deep front bench of senior commanders.”The reforms have not always matched the ambitions, say analysts. Shortages of skilled personnel and high-tech components, especially advanced chips, have delayed deliveries of next-generation equipment. “Have you heard of many cases where our people went to study at, say, MIT and then returned to Russia? I haven’t,” Pukhov said.Even so, military experts say, Russia’s modernised forces are capable of delivering a massive dose of blunt force. “Russian missiles may not be precise enough to target the top right-hand window of a building, as the US and it allies can. But they are still accurate enough to blow up the whole building,” said Samuel Cranny-Evans, a military sciences analyst at the Royal United Services Institute.With Ukraine, Russia has also retained an element of surprise. By parking equipment against the border, which can then be manned by troops brought quickly forward, Kofman said, the scope and timing of any final operation would not be revealed until late into preparations.“If the VDV starts surging forces to take position near Ukraine’s borders, that’s a good indicator that they’re planning for an offensive,” Kofman added.
18  The EU will on Wednesday outline a more aggressive approach to setting global standards for cutting-edge and green technologies in a concerted effort to counter the influence of China.Margrethe Vestager, the bloc’s competition chief, told the Financial Times the new strategy was designed to ensure Europe continued to set international benchmarks that guided the development of everything from facial recognition systems, advances in battery power and the next generation of environmental innovations.“This is strategic,” said Vestager. “It’s really, really important who sets the standards because they should enable a market to work, but not to make innovation difficult.” She added the EU wanted to implement the plan “as fast as possible”.The emerging strategy is important as companies seeking to enter the EU’s internal market have had to satisfy the region’s tough rules, often forcing countries around the world to adopt Europe’s approach to regulating products and services.But China has shown an increasing appetite to set international standards on important technologies, such as the rollout of 5G mobile networks, following advances made by tech giants such as Huawei.EU and US officials have grown concerned that China has become successful at lobbying key technology standards-setting bodies, such as the International Telecommunication Union and the International Electrotechnical Commission, in ways that could provide an edge to its local champions.As part of the EU’s plans, European officials will work alongside US authorities on a new monitoring system on emerging standards, a method to have a unified position on tech rulemaking. They also plan to use joint resources to ensure start-ups are aware of coming standards, while relying on experts to foresee coming technological developments.The US and EU will meet regularly through the Trade and Technology Council, an existing grouping of top transatlantic officials, to iron out details on how the co-operation will work.To illustrate the challenge, Vestager pointed to China’s earlier efforts to redefine the basic standards for the internet, which would give state-run internet service providers more control over the way people surf the web.She cited that move as an example of how Beijing could take a lead on crucial technology standards that run counter to the approach of western governments and its tech companies.“When you work from a standard that is your benchmark and if that standard is set in a vibrant, democratic market economy, you get one [global] standard that will work,” Vestager said.Beijing has also been drafting a fresh strategy entitled “China Standards 2035” as it seeks to become a setter of international rules in fields such as 5G and artificial intelligence.As part of plans to counter these moves, Brussels will “urgently” develop standards for important technologies and environmental challenges, according to draft proposals seen by the FT.“Europe’s competitiveness, technological sovereignty and promotion of EU values, highest social and environmental ambitions will depend on how successful European actors are at international level,” the document stated.
19  Russian scientists once considered detonating a nuclear explosion as the best way to start mining at Udokan, one of the world’s largest untapped copper resources.That was in 1965, and technology has moved on, but the deposit — 400km north of the Chinese border in the permafrost of eastern Siberia — still represents a formidable challenge to geologists and engineers. An entire mountaintop has to be removed, and a way found to extract and refine complex copper ore.Now, though, rising prices and expectations of growing demand are pushing miners to place huge bets on Udokan and another remote Siberian copper reserve, as Russia eyes a chance to develop hard-to-reach resources and become one of the biggest producers of the industrial metal.The plans show how Russia, highly dependent on its vast fossil fuel resources, is trying to develop more resources associated with renewable energy and the revolution in electric vehicles.“On a 10-20-year horizon, I believe the share of green energy metals in Russian exports will have to grow at a higher rate compared with the share of oil and gas,” said Yulia Buchneva, a Moscow-based metals analyst at Fitch Ratings.Alisher Usmanov, one of Russia’s richest men, acquired Udokan via his USM Holdings company in 2008 and backed the development of new technology to extract its copper. Developing the mine will require about $7bn of investment. It is set to go into production in 2022 and raise annual production to 400,000 tonnes by 2026.“At the moment, there are no projects coming up as large as this one,” Valery Kazikayev, chair of Udokan Copper’s board, said on a recent visit to the mine. “By output, we will be among the top 10 copper producers globally.”Udokan, said Kazikayev was the last known global opportunity for a mine with significant copper content, above 1 per cent of the rock on average. “There are some [mines] being developed today with 0.3 per cent content,” he added.At Baimskaya, an even more remote project in the Chukotka region of the Arctic tundra, Kaz Minerals is working on another ambitious investment.Baimskaya is 3,000km away from the nearest railroad and 700km away from the nearest port. It needs not only roads and a new port; its power will have to come from floating nuclear power plants in the Arctic Ocean. The port might also need its own icebreaker to keep a sea route open.Despite state help and tax breaks, Kaz Minerals has already raised its estimated investment for Baimskaya by half to $8.5bn.“We have simple ore, but we have other problems, such as logistics,” Oleg Novachuk, the company’s chief executive, told the Financial Times. “I did not realise there would be this many infrastructure issues when buying the project, but we wouldn’t sell it anyway as our company has experience in managing challenges.”The mine is expected to open in 2027 and produce 300,000 tonnes of copper and nearly 500,000 ounces of gold annually over a decade.Russia has more copper reserves than any country bar Chile and Peru, the number one and two producers globally, according to its natural resources ministry. But it has only been able to mine its biggest assets when the price of a tonne of copper has risen significantly above its long-term average, as is the case now.The new projects, as well as continued growth at Norilsk Nickel, will allow Russia to more than double its annual output to above 2mn tonnes by 2030 and become the world’s fourth-largest producer, surpassing the US and China, according to the ministry.It would mean Russia playing a much bigger role in copper markets. Alexander Chernykh, head of the ministry’s research institute for base and precious metals, reckons Russia will export around 700,000 tonnes more of the metal each year.Not everyone believes copper is headed for a prolonged period of high prices that would make investments such as Udokan and Baimskaya easier to justify.Rather, some investors and analysts believe the recent boom — prices hit a record high above $10,500 a tonne in May — is cyclical and can be explained by the post-pandemic economic recovery. They believe prices will soften because of slowing growth in China, the world’s biggest consumer of industrial metals.And while few doubt the copper market will face long-term problems — analysts at BMO Capital Markets forecast a supply shortfall of several million tonnes — substitution with cheaper aluminium and increased use of scrap in some products can help fill the gap.“Over the next couple of years there is, on paper at least, enough copper supply to meet the world’s needs,” said BMO analyst Colin Hamilton. “However, delivering on this supply is a perennial problem.”Executives at both Udokan and Baimskaya say that, at current copper prices, the investments are expected to pay off in about a decade. Udokan expects to break even at half the current price — which the company says gives it a buffer against market shocks.“If we look five years ahead, we are big optimists given the trend for a low-carbon economy. Electrification increases the share of copper in power-producing technologies — wind, solar, EVs,” said Kazikayev. “We foresee some price decrease, but the sustainable trend will only be upward.”Kirill Chuyko, chief analyst at BCS Global Markets in Moscow, said Russia would become one of the main global suppliers of copper.“The current copper price reflects the inefficiencies of copper projects in the world, primarily geological problems,” Chuyko said. “Russian producers are doing their best to squeeze out the maximum of the current situation.”
20  Her Royal Highness Crown Princess Mary of Denmark enters the study from her next-door office. She is dressed in black trousers and an emerald-green bishop-sleeve blouse with rigorous cuffs, her mahogany hair polished and pristine. She is warm but poised, ethereal but commanding, much like her surroundings. As the residence of the heirs to the Danish throne, the palace is a place of representation, and the princess well understands how her choices – of hairstyle, outfit or decorative scheme – will project. “A monarchy exists in the time and the society that it is a part of, and Danes are progressive and innovative and free-thinking,” she says. “How progress happens is dependent on the personalities of the people within the royal family, and, of course, the people they are among.”As crown princess, Mary is the future queen of Denmark. Australian by birth, she married Queen Margrethe II’s eldest son in 2004, and has been a consistent figure on the world stage ever since. If an appetite for public service was instilled in the Crown Princess from an early age, it came from academic circles rather than a childhood filled with high-profile fundraisers and galas. Mary Elizabeth Donaldson was raised worlds away from the elite schools, sports or society mixers that have shaped many of her princess peers in other countries. She was born in Hobart, Tasmania, 10,000 miles from Copenhagen, in 1972. Her father is John Dalgleish Donaldson, an applied mathematics professor and Scottish fisherman’s son, who emigrated to Australia in 1963 with her late mother Henrietta, who was an executive assistant at the University of Tasmania. (Today, he is married to the English suspense novelist Susan Moody.)Mary grew up immersed in outdoor sports. She got a BA in commerce and law and worked in advertising in Melbourne and Sydney but, after the sudden death of her mother, she quit and went backpacking around the world. She met Crown Prince Frederik, now 53, in a bar during the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Today, they live in the palace with their four children, Prince Christian, 16, Princess Isabella, 14, and the twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine, 11. In the vestibule next to the study, artist Jesper Christiansen’s Matrix-like world-map mural serves as testimony to the couple’s geographically diverse backgrounds.If Australia is the new world, the Crown Princess couldn’t have found a greater contrast than Denmark, one of the oldest monarchies whose bloodline can be traced back to the 10th-century Viking, Gorm the Old. Since 1513, the kings of Denmark have alternated between the names Christian and Frederik. When her husband ascends to the throne, he will be the 10th Frederik to do so. Vestiges of formal tradition surround. A footman in white livery serves us coffee in white-fluted cups with bespoke gold rims from Royal Copenhagen. A neat stack of paper napkins carry the couple’s cypher, an interlocked F and M. Outside, bearskin-wearing royal guards have put their red overcoats on for the January rain. They’re marching along one of four identical buildings that form the octagonal Amalienborg Palace on the harbour of Copenhagen. Across the square is the winter residence of the 81-year-old Queen Margrethe II, the world’s third-longest reigning monarch after Queen Elizabeth II (her third cousin) and the Sultan of Brunei.Growing up, the young Mary wasn’t what you’d call a royal-watcher. “I was very aware that Queen Elizabeth was our head of state and that we were part of the Commonwealth, but day to day I wouldn’t say there was a great deal of presence unless there was an official visit or a wedding or a jubilee,” she says, two big books on Queen Elizabeth now firmly placed on the sideboard in her study. “Today. wow. I can only admire Queen Elizabeth and my own mother-in-law, the Queen of Denmark, for their lifelong commitment and dedication to serving their country and their people.” Her accent has taken on the flat intonation of Danish. She has mastered her adopted language and occasionally uses Danish words to express herself. When conversation switches to Danish, she uses the formal “you” – “De” rather than “du” – an elevated form of address sadly almost only observed by the royal family in present-day Denmark.The Danish royal family holds no jurisdictional authority, but remains symbolically important for the country: a “samlingspunkt”, as the Crown Princess puts it, using a Danish term she translates as meaning “unifying body”. Her husband is a dedicated sportsman who leads an annual public “Royal Run” around Denmark, and looks dashing in a naval uniform. His mother, the Queen, is a larger-than-life personality: a multi-talented artist with a good sense of sarcasm, generous with herself but preserving an almost baroque understanding of duty, ceremony and protocol within her hyper-creative life. She’s incredibly popular. According to a 2020 survey by Kantar Gallup, 84 per cent of the country – population 5.8 million – support the monarchy. “The monarchy is a unifying institution for the Kingdom of Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands, which also comes with a bit of glamour, pomp and circumstance,” explains Helle Thorning-Schmidt, who served as prime minister of Denmark for the Social Democrats between 2011 and 2015 and is married to the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock. “Even in a welfare state devoted to equality, we appreciate a touch of grandeur.” Maybe it’s the Hans Christian Andersen effect – the Little Mermaid statue is just down the marina from Amalienborg – but for all its social-democratic normality, Denmark doesn’t expect its heads of state to be just like you and me. The Queen presides over four palace residences, a hunting lodge, a château in France and a royal yacht, which is used for visits to the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Off-duty, the Crown Prince Couple guard their privacy. In 2009, when Oprah Winfrey was in Denmark filming a show, the media mogul confirmed to the Danish press that an interview request had been politely declined. The glamour that surrounds the Crown Princess has hardly diminished the media’s interest. During the week of black-tie events that preceded her wedding, and which formally introduced her to the Danes, she had them floored: one resplendent ballgown after another, paired with the exquisite ruby parure originally worn by Désirée Clary (later Queen of Sweden and Norway) for Napoleon’s coronation in 1804. “Very early on, it was clear that there were expectations about what you wore and how you dressed appropriately to an event,” says the Crown Princess who, for official duties, is now used to being bedecked in powder-blue moiré sashes, silver stars, white crosses and the diamond-encrusted Order of the Elephant badge. “That was pretty daunting for me. I was a T-shirt-and-shorts girl, known to go barefoot.” In subsequent years, she has demonstrated a decidedly modern approach to royal daywear, largely forgoing the territory’s skirt suits and dainty frocks for executive separates and streamlined silhouettes. “As the future queen, Her Royal Highness’s ability to dress both appropriate to her standing but modern at the same time has always struck me as particularly impressive,” says Sir Paul Smith, a long-time friend of Crown Prince Frederik. “She has the confidence to dress with the authority her role requires but in a way that feels relevant today. She’s always dressed like a princess but never dressed up like one. She could make ripped jeans look regal!” The Crown Princess isn’t afraid of wearing designers like Smith, either. Mary will casually mix Danish brands with Chanel, Prada and Hermès, and often wears young international designers such as Erdem too. “Her evening approach is not dissimilar to her approach during the day,” Erdem Moralioglu says. “There is something both regal and formal to her. She is absolutely appropriate for the event she is attending, and yet she always looks modern and beautifully relaxed.”In 2010, when asked his thoughts on the Duchess of Cambridge, Karl Lagerfeld replied that Catherine, 10 years Mary’s junior and similarly lithe and polished, could be her “younger sister”. The comparison is inevitable: especially now when, like the Crown Princess, the Duchess is using her public platform to steer the press attention away from her wardrobe to focus on her other causes. “At times it can feel frustrating that what you’re wearing can overshadow the cause at hand,” says the Crown Princess. “But I’m sensing and hoping that there’s a shifting focus, that there’s less focus on the outer than there has been.” Thirteen years ago, she participated in the first-ever Global Fashion Agenda, the Danish-led international sustainability summit, which has since become a frontrunner in the environmental conversation around fashion and boasted an extraordinary list of influential speakers. “Sustainability at that time was a relatively new focus,” she says of its success. “There’s been some progress, but an enormous transformation still has to occur. I look forward to the day that, when I buy a piece of clothing, sustainability is simply a gift with purchase.”If it was fashion that first got her projected onto the world stage, recent years have seen her turning to more humanitarian work. The Crown Princess has become a powerful advocate for women’s reproductive rights, maternal health, sexual and reproductive rights in developing countries and international LGBTI+ rights. Some of her causes are obvious, others more controversial as far as the geopolitical landscape goes. “I exist in a time when, yes, these areas are still debatable and conflict-full, but it’s a human right,” she says of her decision to front the LGBTI+ organisation WorldPride. “I fundamentally believe that we all have the right to be who we are regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation. Denmark is a strong voice on this issue, and I wanted to lend my voice to the cause.” Similarly, she has taken the lead in her work for women’s rights in developing countries. “I’ve always had a strong sense of justice: that everyone should have the same opportunities, no matter where you come from,” she says. The Crown Princess has been a diligent student of her calling. In the two years before the pandemic, she undertook more than 20 working trips: she went to Kenya with the gender-equality organisation Women Deliver, to Indonesia with the United Nations Populations Fund and to Ethiopia with the Danish minister for development cooperation. A talented speaker, she delivered passionate speeches at human rights summits, and served as patron for the World Health Organisation. Last year, she went to Burkina Faso to raise awareness around the plight of women affected by issues like genital mutilation, forced marriage, underage pregnancy and education barriers. “Understanding that inequality and lack of respect for human rights were root causes for maternal mortality – that still today, a woman can risk losing life by giving birth – was where my journey started.”On home turf, the Crown Princess has completed a military education for the Danish Home Guard in which she now holds the rank of captain, and she shares her husband’s affinity for sports. A keen equestrian, she has recently taken up dressage and has two horses, including a Danish warmblood, which she rides competitively. “It’s always been a happy place for me in the stables. It’s a place where I’m just Mary. It’s very meditative.” Her favourite spots in Denmark are in nature. “I find the forests very exotic, especially in the spring when the beech trees come into leaf. The North Sea coast reminds me of Tasmania, both when it’s wild and when it’s calm.” In Copenhagen, it was always “Rosenborg Castle, with its fairytale renaissance architecture”, she says of the 1606 masterpiece that first captured her heart.The Crown Princess has found affinities between Australia and Denmark, but does say that when she first arrived in Copenhagen, she sometimes felt she was too “direct”. “I searched forever to find the word ‘please’ in the Danish language,” she recalls, but the word doesn’t exist. Instead, her Australian candour has found an outlet in her causes.“She has emerged as a very progressive representative for Denmark, which is something welcomed by many of us,” Thorning-Schmidt says. “We have always had an internationally minded royal family, but the Crown Princess has brought to the Danish monarchy a very resolute internationalism by immersing herself in work of a big-scale and global nature.” Thorning-Schmidt experienced “The Mary Effect” first-hand when she became CEO of Save the Children International. “She represents a small kingdom, and in that sense, she has to work harder to get noticed internationally. I’ve seen the international response to her on numerous occasions, and people really listen to what she has to say.” Parallels to the People’s Princess are a given, but if Mary is the Danish Diana, it’s without the sombre subtext. The royal couple have an uncomplicated public image, and are happy to demonstrate their mutual love. Perhaps it’s also a little bit easier to be a royal in Denmark compared to other countries? “I can’t answer that because I don’t know what it would be like to be a royal in another country,” the Crown Princess replies.“We do protect them a little bit,” says Thorning-Schmidt of the public’s relationship with the royal family. “If they make the odd mistake, we make allowances. And that’s fair enough. A monarchy should be surrounded by a sense of ceremony and formality, and in Denmark we’re all quite good at preserving that.” The Crown Princess paints a pleasant image of her day-to-day life in Copenhagen: “The Danes are proud of the fact that their royal family can go around freely in society. Because of that, there is a natural respect of your space. If I go into Copenhagen, or out to eat, or to the cinema with my children, I feel like we are given the space to do so.” She became a princess at the dawn of camera phones and social media scrutiny. “The positive side is that it means we can communicate more directly. On the negative side, everyone, everywhere, anytime can take a photo or a video. But what can you do? I make eye contact with people and smile. If you go for a walk and your dog wants to talk to another dog,” she says, referring to the family’s border collie, Grace, “well, you talk to the person who’s got the other dog.” How to live with social media is an area at the forefront of the royal conscience. “It is now both a tool and a problem,” she says. “Social media can reinforce problems like bullying and loneliness, but we can’t always see it as the problem because it gives some unique channels to be able to reach out.”Through the Mary Foundation, the platform and research institute she established in 2007, the Crown Princess deals with societal issues like isolation, harassment and domestic violence. “Since I can remember, I’ve found it difficult seeing what I interpret as people being alone, looking in, not understanding why they can’t be a part of something bigger than themselves. I’ve always had a curiosity to truly understand a situation and its consequences. That’s my drive for doing what I do, and the platform from where I lead.” One day, her son Prince Christian will become Crown Prince and eventually King of Denmark. The royal family has announced they don’t expect “apanage” – the Danish equivalent of Civil List privileges – for their three younger children. Reflecting on the next generation, the Crown Princess says her concerns are related to the times in which we live. “You know, we have two teenagers in the house and teenage years are very transformative and vulnerable. It’s the years when you make mistakes, and mistakes are important. Hopefully you learn from them and get on the right path. So I hope that they continue to be given the freedom and space to make those mistakes and to come through those explorative years.” From the window of her study, a trampoline is vaguely visible in the palace garden. A family photo graces a chiffonier. “We hope that they grow up to be strong and independent individuals, who will have the courage to follow their aspirations,” she says of her ambitions for her children. “It’s important that they know who they are, are proud of who they are and the family they belong to, and what that family represents to the Danes.” Is that the secret to contemporary royal life? “I don’t think there’s a secret,” Crown Princess Mary says. “It’s being in touch and being close to the people: knowing what’s happening in society; which way are we heading; what are the new trends and challenges. It’s a natural, organic process that happens as generations come and go.” When it comes to creating a modern monarchy, it seems a Tasmanian candour can often speak a Danish truth.
21   Vladimir Putin has accused the US of seeking to hold Russia back by dragging it into a conflict over Ukraine while insisting he wanted talks with Washington and Nato to continue to avoid a “negative outcome”, such as war.In his first public comments in several weeks since the US warned that Moscow was massing more than 100,000 troops on the border, the Russian president said Ukraine was being used as a “tool” by Washington.“The US is not so much concerned about the security of Ukraine — although maybe they are thinking about it somewhere in the background — but their most important objective is to contain the development of Russia. This is what it is all about,” Putin said during a press conference with Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orban in Moscow.“It can be achieved in different ways. [They can] drag us into some kind of armed conflict and with the help of their allies in Europe impose against us the very tough sanctions that the US is talking about today.”Putin again accused western powers of ignoring Russia’s security concerns and said the US and Nato had disregarded his demand for a guarantee that Kyiv would not join the transatlantic alliance.“Let’s imagine Ukraine [becomes] a Nato member and starts these military operations. Are we supposed to go to war with the Nato bloc? Has anyone given that any thought? Apparently not,” Putin said.When asked about Putin’s comments on Tuesday, Jen Psaki, White House press secretary, said that the US did not know what “decision” Putin would make but added that the “door to diplomacy remains open”.“De-escalation will of course make that diplomatic path easier,” Psaki said.The statements came amid a flurry of diplomatic activity in recent weeks aimed at de-escalating the crisis. Visiting Kyiv on Tuesday, Mateusz Morawiecki, Poland’s prime minister, said he would send arms to Ukraine to help it fend off a potential full-scale Russian invasion. His visit was followed by that of UK prime minister Boris Johnson, who renewed the UK’s support for Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky.“As we stand here, Volodymyr, more than 100,000 Russian troops are gathering on your border in perhaps the biggest demonstration of hostility towards Ukraine in our lifetimes,” said Johnson, who also accused Putin of “holding a gun” to Ukraine’s head and attempting to “redraw the security map of Europe”.Poland’s prime minister said: “Our part of Europe does not suffer from earthquakes and volcano explosions, but despite this, living close to a neighbour like Russia, we have the feeling that we live near a volcano.”Putin also said he hoped dialogue would continue. Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, and Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, spoke by phone, their first conversation since Washington sent a written response to Moscow’s security demands last week. Russia sent its own follow-up to the US submission on Tuesday, though US officials said they were awaiting a formal written response.Blinken “emphasised the US willingness, bilaterally and together with allies and partners, to continue a substantive exchange with Russia on mutual security concerns, which we intend to do in full co-ordination with our partners and allies,” the state department said.“I considered my visit a peace mission,” Orban said in Moscow. “I was able to tell the president that the European Union is unified and there is not a single EU leader who wants conflict with Russia. That is especially true to us Central Europeans.”In a Facebook post, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, suggested that a new trilateral security “format” between Ukraine, the UK and Poland would help bolster Kyiv’s defences and security. “We cannot expect security and prosperity somewhere in the future when we become members of the EU and Nato. We need them today,” Kuleba said.The Polish arms shipment came after the UK provided Ukraine with thousands of NLAW anti-tank busters and other equipment last month. The US last year provided a record $650mn in military assistance to Ukraine, on top of $2.7bn it has supplied since the war in the country’s east erupted in 2014.Earlier on Tuesday Zelensky said Ukraine would add 100,000 professional troops to its 261,000-strong armed forces, and boost army salaries over the next three years.The US and Ukraine’s other western backers fear Russia’s troop build-up could be preparation for an invasion or deeper incursions on top of Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and the fomenting of a proxy separatist war in eastern regions of the country.The US state department also ordered family members of US diplomats to leave Belarus amid growing concerns over an “unusual and concerning Russian military build-up” on Belarus’s border with Ukraine.
22  Investors are betting that persistently high inflation will force the European Central Bank to raise interest rates more than once this year, in a challenge to the central bank’s insistence that it expects to freeze rates at historical lows at least until next year.Markets have this week pulled forward expectations of tighter policy, with an increase in the ECB’s deposit rate to minus 0.25 per cent — from its current rate of minus 0.5 per cent — now priced in by December, according to trading in short term funding markets.This implies that traders expect at least two 0.1 percentage point rate rises, with the shift in pricing coming before members of the bank’s governing council are due to meet on Thursday to discuss monetary policy.Markets had priced in a much smaller rise to minus 0.4 per cent by the end of the year before last week’s hawkish US Federal Reserve meeting, which triggered a fresh round of speculation that the ECB would be forced to follow the Fed this year by increasing borrowing costs.The growing conviction in markets that eurozone rates are set to rise for the first time since 2011 comes despite Christine Lagarde’s repeated rejection of calls for earlier tightening. The ECB president said last month that the central bank had “every reason not to act as quickly or as ruthlessly” as the Fed.“The ECB has stuck to the mantra of no rate hikes this year, but the market is clearly challenging that view,” said Richard McGuire, a rates strategist at Rabobank. “Investors think the ECB might get spooked by this shift in inflation.”Inflation has been exceeding the ECB’s expectations for several months and hit a record high in the eurozone of 5 per cent in December. A report due on Wednesday is expected to show that the pace of inflation eased to 4.4 per cent last month. But after readings on German, Spanish and French inflation exceeded expectations in January, economists have said price pressures seemed likely to continue overshooting ECB forecasts this year.Nadia Gharbi, senior economist at Pictet Wealth Management, predicted wage growth would increase this year after the bloc’s unemployment rate hit an all-time low of 7 per cent in December and a quarter of EU companies reported labour shortages — a new high. “It will be quite a tough period for the doves at the ECB right now,” she said.Rate-rise expectations rekindled a sell-off in eurozone bonds this week, pushing Germany’s 10-year borrowing cost — a key benchmark for assets across the currency bloc — above zero. German two-year yields, which are highly sensitive to rate expectations, have climbed sharply since last week to a six-year high of minus 0.48 per cent on Tuesday, rising above the ECB’s deposit rate for the first time since 2015.On Thursday, Lagarde is expected to be pressed on whether she still thinks eurozone inflation will fall below the ECB’s 2 per cent target in the fourth quarter and if the central bank remains “very unlikely” to raise interest rates this year.Spyros Andreopoulos, a senior European economist at BNP Paribas who used to work for the ECB, has detected recent hints that the central bank’s policymakers were worried inflation might stay higher for longer.“They are slowly changing their mind and for good reason because what we are seeing is broad-based price pressure increasing,” he said, adding that if Russia invaded Ukraine it could cause a further surge in energy prices and push eurozone inflation above 6 per cent.Longer-lasting price pressures could spur the ECB to act sooner than it currently expects, according to some investors. “If inflation stays high, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to expect [the central bank’s bond-buying programme] to stop before the end of the year and then they could potentially hike in December,” said Gareth Colesmith, head of global rates at Insight Investment.
23  Unemployment in the eurozone fell to a record low of 7 per cent at the end of last year, underlining how the region’s labour market has bounced back faster than expected from the impact of the pandemic.The number of jobless people in the bloc dropped by 185,000 in the final month of 2021, taking the total number of unemployed people to 11.5mn, Eurostat announced on Tuesday.The 7 per cent unemployment rate in December fell from a downwardly revised 7.1 per cent in November — which itself matched the previous low of March 2020, just as the pandemic hit Europe. Growing numbers of businesses in countries such as Germany and France are reporting a shortage of workers as demand for goods and services increases.The improvement in the labour market was particularly strong among young people, as the jobless rate for those aged under 25 fell to a new all-time low of 14.9 per cent, down from 15.4 per cent the previous month.Youth unemployment has long been the scourge of the European labour market and peaked at 25 per cent during the region’s debt crisis in 2013.The biggest fall in youth unemployment over the past year was in Spain, where it dropped from 41 per cent in December 2020 to 30.6 per cent, although that only took it back to pre-pandemic levels. Among the bloc’s main economies, youth unemployment has fallen the furthest below pre-crisis levels in France, declining from 21 per cent in December 2019 to 17.6 per cent last month.“Some of the decline in unemployment appears to be down to people temporarily leaving the labour force as Covid restrictions were tightened to counter the Omicron variant,” said Jessica Hinds, senior Europe economist at Capital Economics, who estimated the bloc’s labour force shrank 0.2 per cent in December.“However, that is much less than in previous periods of tighter restrictions and should not detract too much from what has been a very full recovery that contrasts with developments in the US,” she added.The drop in Europe’s jobless rate came despite the end of most short-time work schemes introduced to mitigate the economic impact of coronavirus: the European Central Bank estimated only 1.8 per cent of workers were furloughed in October, versus 20 per cent in April 2020.Eurozone businesses are confronting unprecedented and widespread shortages of workers, according to the latest quarterly survey by the European Commission.About one-quarter of manufacturing and services businesses reported lack of workers as a factor limiting production in January, the highest proportion since data was first available in 1982.Eurozone wage growth remains subdued: two-year annualised growth in pay per employee was 1.8 per cent in the third quarter.However, the EU survey indicated that “the labour market is already tight and the remaining slack will diminish further by end-2022”, said Paul Hollingsworth, chief European economist at BNP Paribas, raising the chances of more substantial pay rises.“We expect wage growth to accelerate in the second half of 2022 and in 2023 due to the current spike in inflation, the increasingly tight labour market and more labour-oriented policies,” he added.Worker shortages are most acute in Germany, where they were reported by more than a third of businesses in the services and manufacturing sectors. In France, a record high 22 per cent of businesses lacked the staff they needed. In Italy’s and Spain’s services sectors, the proportion has risen to double-digits for the first time in history, the survey showed.Labour shortages were more common for businesses producing machinery, equipment and furniture, at about 30 per cent. But a quarter of companies in most industries, including cars, food production and textiles, struggled to find enough workers.
24  Mary Sarotte was studying in Berlin when the wall came down and shared our exhilaration as one east European country after another broke free of Moscow’s control, the Soviet Union collapsed and the cold war came to an end.Sarotte is now a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington; her latest book, Not One Inch, is the third of a trilogy which covers the story from that day to this. She writes with the advantage of 30 years of hindsight and access to many new documents. So does Vladislav Zubok, whose recently published Collapse is a deeply informed account of how the Soviet Union fell apart. Both can help us understand how we have once again come to the brink of a major armed stand-off between Russia and the west.Not One Inch is a riveting account of Nato enlargement and its contribution to the present confrontation. Sarotte tells the story with great narrative and analytical flair, admirable objectivity, and an attention to detail that many of us who thought we knew the history have forgotten or never knew: the essential contribution of the Hungarians towards the fall of the wall in November 1989, for example; or Russian President Boris Yeltsin’s advance warning to President Bill Clinton that he intended to make Vladimir Putin his successor. She ends with a bleak assessment of the damage inflicted on politics today. (Sarotte draws on my reports now in British archives; Zubok on my unpublished diary.)Sarotte’s central contention is that “animosity between Moscow and Washington over Nato’s future became central to the making of a post-cold war political order that looked much like its cold war predecessor”. Three months after the wall fell James Baker, US secretary of state, suggested a hypothetical bargain to the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. Nato would “not shift one inch eastward from its present position” once it had safely taken in a reunited Germany. Those words were never recorded in a mutually agreed formula. Gorbachev’s negotiating position was far too weak for him to insist on legal language. The Americans would never have agreed so to bind their hands anyway.But the Russians, not at all surprisingly, heard what they wanted to hear. They convinced themselves that Baker’s assurance, and others like it, amounted to a moral and political commitment. But under relentless US pressure, Nato’s borders nevertheless advanced until by 2004 they were within spitting distance of Russia and Ukraine. Very many Russians firmly believed that they had been grossly double-crossed.The origins for this grievance lie a lot further back. In 1985, painfully aware that their country was failing in the competition with the US, the Soviet leaders chose Gorbachev to put it back on track. He co-operated with President Ronald Reagan to end the cold war, opened up the country and gave it a limited form of democracy. But he was unable to manage the problems of empire and the collapsing economy.Russia’s weakness was America’s opportunity. Helped by the locals, the US reunited Germany inside Nato, freed the east Europeans, and encouraged the break-up of the Soviet Union. At the end of 1991 Gorbachev handed power to Yeltsin as president of a revived Russia. It was a moment of triumph for the west. For the Russians it brought national humiliation, domestic chaos and in places actual famine.Nato had justified the Americans’ dominant position in Europe. They had no intention of giving it up. Publicly they argued that Europe’s future security depended on Nato’s continued existence. In private they dismissed suggestions that Russia might become a full member. They set up the “Partnership for Peace” to associate Russia with Nato’s work: but they made it clear that Moscow would not have an equal voice in them.American bureaucrats who believed that Nato should expand to include the whole of eastern Europe drove their ideas with ruthless effectiveness. American soldiers rightly worried that the realities were being ignored: how could Nato offer a convincing military guarantee to so many new members on Europe’s periphery? Critics warned that enlargement could destroy Russia’s attempts at reform.Clinton made genuine efforts to square the circle by offering the Russians a combination of argument, charm and bribery, but his efforts were undermined by his own domestic weakness. Sarotte says that “it is hard to avoid the reality that alliance expansion added to the burdens on Russia’s fragile young democracy when it was most in need of friends”.Eastern Europeans, bullied for centuries by their large neighbour, did not believe that Russia would long remain flat on its back. For them it was painfully obvious that only Nato membership could guarantee their future. Many in the west, fuelled by guilt for previous betrayals — Munich, Yalta, Hungary, Prague — supported their desire to join the alliance as soon as possible. So did the descendants of Poles, Balts and others who lived in places crucial to the outcome of American elections.To Russians it looked very different. They too had welcomed the end of the nuclear confrontation. Many hoped that Gorbachev’s reforms would result in a “normal country”, where the state listened to their wishes but otherwise let them get on with their lives. They believed that the west would actively support their aspirations. Now they felt they had been deliberately misled, that the Americans had conspired to break up their country. Some in Washington did indeed think that way: Sarotte and Zubok both provide evidence.Nato’s claims that it existed only to defend its members struck Russians as incredible, after America and its allies attacked first Serbia, then Afghanistan and Iraq. Many feared that Russia might be next, including my liberal Russian friends who had suffered under the Soviet regime and were glad to see it go. Western commentators still argue that most Russians had other things to worry about, such as surviving from day to day as their country fell apart. They oversimplify. The emotions were real. When Putin arrived on the scene he had little need to stoke them, though he has certainly exploited them for his own purposes.Ukraine could never have avoided getting caught in the crossfire. Sarotte records that western policymakers always understood that bringing it into Nato would eliminate the distance between the world’s most powerful military alliance and Russia itself, thus crossing the reddest of all Russia’s red lines. American hardliners nevertheless successfully inserted references to Ukraine’s membership into one Nato communique after another. Even they hardly believed that Ukraine would join in the foreseeable future.Sarotte wonders if it could have ended differently: perhaps the Partnership for Peace could have provided a path to a durable system of European security that could have also satisfied Russia. Zubok believes a more determined leader than Gorbachev could have managed the political, social and imperial problems in a way that would have left the Soviet Union intact.But as Russians say, history has no subjunctive case. We are where we are. The players could perhaps have made different choices. But they were constrained by their own characters, and by the combination of hard facts, high emotions, conflicting interests and the unyielding pressures of domestic politics. In the end the contradictions were fundamental. There was never a real hope of an alternative outcome.Now we have to deal with Putin’s Ukrainian gamble. In 1962 Nikita Khrushchev made a reckless attempt in Cuba to force the Americans to concede nuclear parity. He brought the world close to catastrophe and was compelled by US power into a humiliating retreat. Putin is now demanding a written guarantee that Nato will pull back, even though he must know that it would never pass the US Senate. Sensible commentators in Moscow point out that a military adventure in Ukraine would seriously damage Russia’s own interests. In the west many believe that we should not risk war over a country for which we have no responsibility. They dismiss the argument that abandoning yet another east European country could undermine our own security arrangements more widely.There is perhaps a chink. As he wriggled out of his Cuban escapade, Khrushchev managed to secure a verbal guarantee that America would respect Cuba’s sovereignty. America is still by far the most powerful country in the world, even though this time geography is against it. It is not beyond imagination that a determined America could secure through diplomacy rather than violence a guarantee for Ukraine at least as strong as the one Khrushchev got for Cuba.Not One Inch: America, Russia, and the Making of the Post-Cold War Stalemate by Mary Sarotte, Yale University Press, $35/£25, 568 pagesCollapse: The Fall of the Soviet Union by Vladislav Zubok, Yale University Press, £25, 560 pagesRodric Braithwaite was British ambassador in Moscow from 1988 to 1992.

25  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.The EU’s notorious troublemaker, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, is in Moscow to meet Russia’s President Vladimir Putin today, after a flurry of diplomatic contacts by EU and Nato allies seeking to keep him in line. We’ll look at the stakes and the sinuous history of Budapest seeking to stay friends with Moscow while not completely alienating Brussels.Meanwhile, in Kyiv, EU commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis went to Ukraine yesterday to show support (and remind everyone that €1.2bn are coming soon, or at least, half of that sum) — while the prime minister of the Netherlands is also headed to Ukraine after a stop in neighbouring Moldova.In Portugal, the centre-left held up surprisingly well in Sunday’s election, allowing Prime Minister António Costa to rule alone, without the disruptive far-left coalition partner that triggered the election in the first place. However, the far-right Chega party also scored better than expected, coming in third.And in Swiss-EU news, I’ll take you through the latest twist — why the German Bundesländer are throwing a spanner in the EU’s decision last year to no longer recognise Swiss market authorisation for medical devices.Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orban is set to meet Vladimir Putin, Russian president, in Moscow today, amid concerns about his ambivalent stance in the Ukraine crisis, writes Marton Dunai in Budapest.Budapest has stressed business development and stayed clear of raising any human rights issues in Russia — at the same time as Orban has received an increasing amount of heat from western partners.“Obviously, we cannot avoid talking about the security situation in Europe,” Orban said over the weekend. “We are interested in peace. Of course, Hungary is a member of Nato.as I am going to Moscow I will consult with both Nato and the (EU), as well as the key politicians who have the presidency of the Union.”Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg tweeted yesterday that he had a “good call” with Orban ahead of his trip to Moscow, urging Russia to de-escalate the situation and “choose a peaceful path”.“In times of peace [and] crisis, we are united in Nato,” Stoltenberg tweeted.Ben Wallace, the UK’s defence minister, who visited Budapest yesterday, also expressed support for Orban’s trip and said he welcomed any efforts aimed at de-escalating the conflict and standing up for the sovereignty of Ukraine.But the constructive tone masks deeper disagreements with Hungary over how to react to Russia’s aggressive stance, given that Orban’s record on standing up for Ukraine is patchy, at best.After the 2014 invasion of Crimea, Orban argued the west was shooting itself in the foot by imposing economic sanctions on Russia — although he voted in favour of the EU sanctions later on.Orban had signed a finance-and-build agreement with Russia’s nuclear monopoly Rosatom for the expansion of Hungary’s main electricity producer, the Paks nuclear power plant, weeks before the invasion.In 2017, when Ukraine passed a law restricting the use of minority languages in its schools and later further passages such as restrictions on holding public office for holders of foreign passports — such as thousands of ethnic Hungarians in western Ukraine — Budapest blocked Ukraine’s European Union and Nato membership talks.Those moves come under a stark new light as Nato sends reinforcements to Ukraine and beefs up its presence along its eastern flanks, increasing troops and equipment levels.Hungary’s foreign minister said Budapest would not send help to Ukraine under the circumstances. And despite early news of Nato deploying troops in Hungary as part of the build-up, the government signalled at the weekend that it would not take in further troops.Speaking alongside Wallace yesterday, Hungary’s defence minister Tibor Benko repeated his government’s stance that right now, there was no need for a Nato deployment. Budapest was not against Nato deploying troops in allied countries near Ukraine, Benko said, but he stressed that Hungary was able to “perform this task on its own”.Hungary’s opposition, meanwhile, decried the timing of Orban’s visit and said it was “simply treasonous to go to Moscow” in the current circumstances.Fossil fuels still accounted for 37 per cent of the bloc’s electricity production in 2021 and new renewable power plants in the EU mainly replaced expensive gas power rather than more polluting coal, according to analysis by Ember, a London-based energy think-tank. (More here)To the dismay of mainstream politicians, Chega, a far-right populist party founded less than three years ago, emerged as the third-largest political force in Portugal’s parliamentary election on Sunday, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon.If the contest between the two biggest parties — the victorious Socialists (PS) of Prime Minister António Costa and the centre-right Social Democrats (PSD) — had turned out differently, André Ventura, Chega’s vociferous leader, would now be demanding a role in government.However, Costa’s unexpected success in winning an absolute majority has ruled out the possibility of a right-of-centre majority supporting a coalition government in which Ventura had implausibly said he would seek a ministerial post.The rapid rise of Chega, whose name translates as “enough” and initially came with an exclamation mark, has unsettled Portugal’s traditional parties. Many had hoped the country would be immune to nationalist populism after enduring almost half a century of a rightwing dictatorship lasting into the 1970s.But Ventura, 39, a former TV football pundit and lawyer who began his political career as a local councillor for the PSD has tapped into public grievances over corruption, low pensions and similar issues. In an emotional victory speech in the early hours of Monday, he made clear the parliamentary style his new group of 12 MPs plans to adopt.“What a punch we’ve delivered tonight,” he said. “There’ll be no more floppy opposition to Costa and the PS from now on.” Ventura, elected in 2019, had previously been Chega’s only MP and remains its only public face.The party is affiliated with Identity and Democracy, a far-right group in the European parliament, and is supported by Santiago Abascal, leader of Spain’s hard-right Vox party, and Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s Rassemblement National, among other rightwing populist figures,Ventura, who has been fined for stigmatising Portugal’s small Roma community, upholds policies including life imprisonment for violent crimes, chemical castration for paedophiles, a single income tax rate and cutting the number of political posts by half.His party is unlikely to have much success in parliament with these issues, but is expected to make a lot of noise about them.When weighing up EU solidarity against the needs of local hospitals, Germany’s devolved health authorities are tilting towards the latter.Last month, health authorities in Germany’s 16 states replied favourably to a request from the country’s medical technology suppliers to continue to import devices authorised on the Swiss market.These include high-tech surgical devices and oxygen supply, storage and distribution systems for hospitals — particularly sought after in the pandemic. Germany is the largest market for Switzerland’s medtech sector, according to trade group MedTech Europe, which said Germany’s hospitals had been complaining about difficulties not just in purchasing new devices, but also in servicing existing machines and getting new supplies for them.“The [European Commission’s] conscious decision to leverage the medtech sector in the midst of pandemic was unfortunate,” said Jesús Rueda Rodríguez, director for international affairs with MedTech Europe.Back in May 2021, the commission pulled the plug on automatic recognition of medical devices that were authorised on the Swiss market, as a consequence of the complete breakdown in EU-Swiss talks.The commission recently said it has asked Berlin for more information and continues to stand by its decision. “That interpretation is not in line with the commission’s position,” said commission spokesperson Stefan De Keersmaecker.The federal health ministry in Berlin meanwhile is pointing to state authorities having the power to implement EU legislation in this case and says that if all dialogue fails, affected stakeholders and the commission can take legal action.
26  The US and European allies are preparing what is being described on both sides of the Atlantic as the most aggressive package of economic and financial sanctions ever assembled to punish Russian president Vladimir Putin if he approves an invasion of Ukraine.The hope in western capitals is that the mere threat of these measures will be enough to deter Putin from attacking Ukraine in the first place — and if that fails, to pound Moscow with so many economic weapons that it will weaken the Kremlin’s resolve.So what measures specifically are the US and the EU prepared to impose?In recent days, the US and the UK have escalated plans to punish Putin’s inner circle by taking aim at Russia’s economic elite and the money it has parked in the west.Senior Biden administration officials said they have now drawn up “specific sanctions packages” focused on Russian oligarchs and their family members. They would not say who would be on the list, because of concerns about “flight risk”, but the scope could be broad. US officials said some names would be drawn from a classified list of potential targets sent by Treasury to Congress in 2018.Given how many Russian oligarchs have assets and other financial interests in the UK, support from Britain has been crucial to US efforts, and senior Biden administration officials have touted their co-ordination with London on the individual sanctions packages.On Monday, the UK vowed to introduce new legislation strengthening London’s ability to target Kremlin-linked businesses and their owners in the country.The EU is also drawing up a list of individuals to be hit with personal sanctions such as asset freezes and travel bans, but has in the past demanded a higher burden of proof for inclusion in such lists than the US, given the ability for those affected to mount legal challenges in European courts.The US and the EU also want to strike at the heart of the Russian banking system and cut Moscow significantly out of the international financial system, having failed to do so following the 2014 annexation of Crimea.Russia’s largest financial institutions, including Sberbank, VTB, Gazprombank, The Russian Direct Investment Fund and Alfa Bank, are all in the line of fire.Meanwhile, the US and its allies have also been debating excluding Russia from Swift, the international payments network, which would further complicate the ability of Russian banks to interact with the west.But the EU is less supportive of this step, given the potential fallout on the service’s reputation, and how any disconnection might be perceived by third countries. One EU official said disconnecting Russia was seen “as a last resort”, and that it may be more effective to use targeted financial sanctions that, for instance, prevent lenders from converting roubles into dollars.US officials said last week there was growing “convergence” with EU allies on both the severity and the immediacy of the financial sanctions, noting that they would aim to hit both existing and new financing.Some EU states have also called for Russia’s access to the IMF’s Special Drawing Rights — which act as reserve currency — to be frozen, according to documents seen by the FT.The US and the EU have discussed imposing very stringent export controls on western technology in order to inflict as much damage as possible to Russia’s industrial base and its capacity to innovate.Traditionally, export controls have been used as a means to prevent sophisticated weaponry from getting into the hands of geopolitical adversaries. However, the US and many European countries have expanded the measures to include emerging technologies such as quantum computing and artificial intelligence.According to people familiar with the Biden admin’s thinking, one of the most potent tools the US could deploy in this realm is the so-called “foreign direct product rule”, which was used to rein in Chinese technology company Huawei. The rule would prevent third countries from exporting certain sensitive technologies containing US components to Russia.“Export controls deny something to Russia that it needs and can’t easily replace from anywhere else,” a senior Biden administration official said last week, adding: “What we’re talking about are sophisticated technologies that we design and produce that are essential inputs to Russia’s strategic ambitions.”Arguably the most politically and economically sensitive arena in which the US and the EU are preparing sanctions is the energy sector. Moscow is heavily reliant on energy exports as a source of foreign reserves, and the EU relies on Russian gas for 40 per cent of its consumption. Meanwhile, America is concerned about high energy costs stoking inflation ahead of the midterm elections.Yet the US and its allies have been debating using unprecedented measures to impose sanctions on oil and gas producers as well as Russian companies in the mining sector.Despite some uncertainty over the position of the new German government, the US and the EU have determined that if Russia decides to invade Ukraine, they would stop the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline linking Russia and Germany from becoming fully active. This would be a major blow to Moscow and could also lead to significant economic pain in Germany.However, the EU’s reliance on Moscow means there is also significant scope for potential countermeasures. Brussels is particularly concerned about a possible collapse in gas supplies in the event of a war, either because of damage to Ukrainian pipelines supplying Europe or Russia moving to restrict gas supplies.
27  “Spring is coming,” said Irish prime minister Micheál Martin last month as he scrapped almost all Covid-19 restrictions and announced that Ireland had “weathered the Omicron storm”.Away from the easing of the coronavirus pandemic, though, his fractious government has far less reason for optimism — and Martin has entered a political autumn.Having agreed that he would step down this December, he has entered his last year as Taoiseach at the helm of a coalition that has lost popularity after scandals and is struggling to show progress on intractable pre-pandemic problems such as housing and healthcare.The government’s unpopularity has prompted questions about whether the pact involving Ireland’s two traditional ruling parties — Martin’s Fianna Fáil and Leo Varadkar’s Fine Gael — as well as the Greens can last until the next elections, which are not due until February 2025.“The government is stable to the extent that none of the three parties can afford to face an election,” said Lucinda Creighton, a former Fine Gael minister and now a consultant. “But the longer they stay in government, history suggests the less popular they are going to be.They are in a rut.”Martin’s plan to depart this year is the consequence of an unprecedented arrangement hammered out after the 2020 election as a way to keep nationalist party Sinn Féin out of power. Under the deal, Martin will hand over to Varadkar, the Tánaiste or deputy prime minister. Varadkar was premier from 2017 until his party stumbled to third place at the 2020 election.But Fine Gael has been plummeting in opinion polls and has struggled to shake off a series of scandals. The most recent is “Flutegate” — a champagne celebration in the foreign ministry to toast Ireland’s winning of a UN Security Council seat in June 2020. The celebration contravened Ireland’s Covid-19 guidelines at the time.“Flutegate” comes on top of other controversies, including “Golfgate” — a parliamentary golf society gathering in 2020 that was also against Covid-19 rules. It prompted resignations from attendees in both main parties, including Phil Hogan, then an EU commissioner. Two politicians are on trial over the event, charged with organising or allowing an event that breached Covid rules. They deny the charges.Varadkar is still being investigated by police over a leaked confidential government document relating to a new agreement for doctors — a matter over which he has apologised but denied having broken the law.“The optics [of the scandals] are terrible,” said Gary Murphy, a politics professor at Dublin City University. “I don’t think the public is obsessing about these issues but they do give a narrative that will be played on by Sinn Féin.”Fine Gael’s support peaked at 37 per cent in June 2020 and has plummeted to 20 per cent while Fianna Fáil has been flatlining on 20 per cent since June, according to an Ipsos/MRBI poll for the Irish Times published in December.By contrast, support for Sinn Féin, which has positioned itself with young and increasingly middle class voters as the party of change because of its promises to resolve Ireland’s crisis of unaffordable or unavailable housing, has rocketed to 35 per cent. Access to affordable healthcare is another voter concern, polls show.An Ireland Thinks poll for the Irish Independent this month found that respondents strongly favoured unspecified repercussions for the Flutegate affair and prosecutions related to the golf society event.For the parties of the coalition, their best way of connecting with voters may be to highlight Ireland’s economic resilience during Covid-19. Tax revenues hit an all-time high last year and headline gross domestic product is expected to have grown in 2021 by at least 14 per cent, or by at least 5 per cent according to a modified measure that strips out the impact of globalised companies on Ireland’s highly open economy.The government also wants to make good on ambitious housing and infrastructure plans. According to official data last week, home completions last year were just 0.5 per cent below their level in 2020, despite the closure of some building work in the spring because of Covid, and the number of apartments built increased by nearly one-third.Ed Brophy, a former adviser to Fine Gael finance minister Paschal Donohoe, said the coalition’s strategy was to “keep out Sinn Féin as long as possible and deal with the issues that are making Sinn Féin popular”.But energy price rises, feeding into broader inflation, will also further test the government’s ability to show that better times are on the way — even without any renewed Covid-19 surge.

29  It has been snowing in the Cyclades, a group of islands usually thought of in the context of sun-drenched summer holidays. In late January the entire archipelago got covered.Snow on Syros, the most populous island and my home since 2017, means one thing for the locals: packing their excited families into cars and driving up to the nature reserve in the north of the island, preferably before the police can get there and close off the only road. The Apano Meria region has comparatively high altitudes, and being the northernmost point, also gets the most snow.Happy children build snowmen and have snowball fights, dogs roll ecstatic around them. The parents can sit back and enjoy the spectacle from the warmth of their cars with flasks of hot chocolate or krasomelo (a type of mulled wine with honey and spices). The scenery is beautiful: hills, valleys and snow-covered terraces as far as the eye can see. Here and there, grape vines and olive trees stick out from the white expanse in regular patterns. Tinos, our neighbouring island with mountains twice the size of ours, glows in the distance like some marine mirage of the Alps.The Cycladic islands are not known for white winters but it is not unheard of that Mykonos, Santorini et al spend a few days under the cover of snow. Syros locals say it happens every five to 10 years; the last time was in 2015. Still, this is rare enough though for social media to fill with photos of snow-covered streets and church domes, of rulers showing the exact depth of the snow, of pawprints and footprints and people venturing outside wearing their entire wardrobes.Rare enough also for these islands to be unprepared in terms of snow-clearing equipment and general infrastructure: Cycladic authorities have announced “mandatory holidays” for almost everyone except pharmacies and supermarkets; public transport has been intermittent these days. There are only a few inches of snow, but the advice to stay at home makes sense on Syros. Most locals get around on scooters, and the island’s slippery marble roads are a hazard even in rain.Road-clearing efforts are concentrated around vital spots (the hospital, the port) but have also tried to cover the countryside, where farmers often need help reaching their hungry, frozen livestock. The fire department is on standby and spends a few days mostly as a hospital auxiliary, making sure that emergency cases or people in need of dialysis can safely get medical attention.One problem we don’t have is electricity: until a few years ago the island relied on a local power station, and blackouts were common in extreme weather conditions, but nowadays electricity is supplied via an underwater cable from the mainland. The only potential challenge is if some part of the infrastructure on a snow-covered hill needs maintenance; indeed, electricians braving the snowstorm and climbing up poles to attend to power lines is another frequently shared image.There has also been an outpouring of solidarity, of people thinking of those less fortunate. Local pharmacies are collecting blankets, warm clothes and electric heaters for anyone in need, and they are doing so sensitively, ensuring that these supplies can be delivered or picked up anonymously (reputation is everything in small communities, in particular for the older generations).People are encouraged to try and remember if they know anyone who might be living alone and be in need of help. Yet others are advising their neighbours about how to care for the island’s many stray cats, instructing them to improvise small snow shelters or to allow the animals to take refuge in basements and sheds, and to put out more food than usual. Every winter is a tough winter for the strays, since most of the beach restaurants that they rely on for food are closed. It’s a lean few months; they really could do without the snow.On Syros we don’t have winter tyres and most of us have very limited experience of driving in icy conditions. In snow years, people can panic on the way down from their frolicking in Apano Meria. The road has a sheer drop of a few hundred metres on one side, and any sign of the car sliding can be quite scary. So they park their cars in the middle of the road, leaving the fire brigade to step in and drive everyone home. For Syros kids, it’s a once in a childhood day out: the snowman, the snowball fight and the happy ride down a mountain in a fire truck.
30  The US stock market has suffered its worst start to the year since the global financial crisis, US and European allies are preparing what is being described as the most aggressive package of economic and financial sanctions ever assembled to punish Russian president Vladimir Putin, and Italian government bonds rallied as investors welcomed the re-election of Sergio Mattarella as president.US stock markets endure worst January since global financial crisisUS and European allies ready aggressive sanctions against RussiaDraghi gains vital time for policy revamp after Italy re-elects Mattarella as presidentSony buys video game maker Bungie for $3.6bn as dealmaking accelerates
31  Russia sent a new written response to the US on the Ukraine crisis on the eve of a planned call between the two countries’ top diplomats as the diplomatic process to defuse the prospect of armed conflict in Europe yielded some signs of life.The move followed a day of high tensions at the UN Security Council, with Moscow launching a blistering attack on the US for “whipping up hysteria” over a potential invasion of Ukraine amid repeated warnings from Washington that Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, is preparing to attack.“We can confirm we received a written follow-up from Russia. It would be unproductive to negotiate in public, so we’ll leave it up to Russia if they want to discuss their response,” a US state department spokesperson told the Financial Times.“We remain fully committed to dialogue to address these issues and will continue to consult closely with our allies and partners, including Ukraine,” the official added.Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, and Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, will speak by phone on Tuesday morning, their first conversation since the US sent its own written response to Russia’s security demands last week.“There is only one individual who from the Russian side can determine what Moscow does or does not do,” Ned Price, state department spokesperson, said ahead of the call, referring to Putin. “His response is the response that matters most to us.”The US has rebuffed Russia’s demands that Nato drop its open-door policy on countries that can join the alliance, but the exchanges have also focused on other issues such as troop deployments in eastern Europe, arms control and missile placements.During Monday’s UN security council meeting, Vasily Nebenzya, Russia’s ambassador to the UN, cast doubt on US intelligence assessments that Putin has amassed 100,000 troops on Ukraine’s border.“We have never cited that figure, we have never confirmed that figure.”Nebenzya also said there was “no proof” that a Russian invasion of Ukraine was imminent.He compared the US warnings to Colin Powell’s fateful appearance at the UN in 2003, when the late secretary of state laid out evidence that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. “They didn’t find any weapons,” Nebenzya said.“They are making heroes out of those people who fought on the side of Hitler who destroyed Jews, Poles, Ukrainians and Russians,” Nebenzya said of US support for Ukraine, without elaborating.The meeting in New York came amid a ratcheting up of tensions between Moscow and the west over a possible invasion of Ukraine, with Washington threatening to impose sanctions against Putin and his inner circle in the event of a military incursion. Russia and China had voted to block the meeting from taking place.Linda Thomas-Greenfield, US ambassador to the UN, accused Russia of “attempting, without any factual basis, to paint Ukraine and western countries as the aggressors to fabricate a pretext for an attack”.“In addition to military activity, we’ve also seen a dramatic spike in cyber attacks on Ukraine in recent weeks,” she said. “Russian military and intelligence services are spreading disinformation through a state on media and proxy sites.”Thomas-Greenfield defended the push to discuss the tensions at the UN, arguing that while diplomatic exchanges between Moscow and western capitals had taken place in private it was “now time to have a meeting in public”.However, she said that while the situation was “urgent” and “dangerous”, the US remained committed to solving the crisis through peaceful diplomacy.“We seek the path of peace. We seek the path of dialogue. We do not want confrontation. But we will be decisive and swift.should Russia further invade Ukraine,” Thomas-Greenfield said.She added: “We’re offering them an opportunity to address these concerns at the negotiating table. The test of Russia’s good faith in the coming days and weeks is whether they will come to that table and stay at that table until we reach an understanding.”On the military front, US officials warned that Russia’s preparations for a possible invasion continued.John Kirby, spokesperson for the Pentagon, said the US had seen additional Russian ground forces moving into Belarus and along the Ukrainian border, even over the weekend.Kirby added the US was also closely watching increased Russian naval activity in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean.US president Joe Biden has said he is prepared to send troops to Nato members on the eastern flank of the alliance to bolster their defences. Kirby said there were “active discussions” inside the administration and within Nato about those potential moves, noting troops would only be deployed if they were requested by allied countries.
32  Newly-installed renewable power in the EU mainly replaced expensive gas power rather than more polluting coal last year, according to analysis by an energy think-tank, and still fell short of what is required to limit global warming.Coal power in Europe was down just 3 per cent in 2021 compared with 2019 pre-pandemic levels, far less than the 29 per cent fall recorded in 2019 when compared with 2017 levels, according to Ember, the London-based non-profit organisation.The polluting fuel accounted for 15 per cent of EU electricity generation last year, compared with 22 per cent in 2017.In the first half of 2021 — before the supply crunch pushed up the price of gas — newly-installed renewables predominantly replaced coal and nuclear power. But from July, the new clean power almost exclusively replaced gas.EU power sector emissions that cause climate change would need to fall 6 per cent per year to reach the net zero level needed by 2035 but were reducing at about half that rate, Ember estimated.“The current gas crisis should be a huge wake-up call,” said Charles Moore, the report’s author. “Both coal and gas need to go; and fast.”Weaning the world off coal was a key promise made at November’s UN COP26 climate summit, and is seen as a key step in reaching global net zero emissions.“Action is needed to ensure Europe’s coal phaseout stays on track,” said Moore. “Legislation is the only way to guarantee that coal plants are closed by 2030. Volatile gas prices have made it clear that you cannot rely on market forces alone.”Fossil fuels accounted for 37 per cent of the EU’s electricity production in 2021, compared with 39 per cent in 2019. Renewables generated another 37 per cent, and nuclear made up the remainder.As gas prices climbed, power generators sought to replace the fossil fuel with renewables as well as with coal. Prices rose so high that it was more profitable for power generators to switch to coal even though that meant they had to buy more allowances at higher prices under the EU’s emissions trading scheme.The price of credits traded under the scheme, which allows the holder to emit a tonne of carbon for each credit, has almost tripled over the past year to around €90 per tonne of carbon.The slowdown in the coal phaseout meant EU power sector emissions were not on track to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, according to Ember’s analysis.The International Energy Agency has estimated that being on track for that goal would require power sector emissions to reach net zero by 2035 in advanced economies.Although EU countries including Spain and Greece have closed coal power stations since 2019, that has been mostly offset by increases in the use of coal in Poland.However, the bloc’s wind and solar power generated more electricity in 2021 than gas for the first time ever.The spike in energy prices has prompted some politicians and energy industry analysts to question the shift to renewable energy. But climate change experts have rejected the connection.“I think that is completely wrong,” said Lord Adair Turner, senior fellow at the Institute for New Economic Thinking. “What we are facing is a failure to go fast enough.What’s happened tells us just how vulnerable we are to the [fossil fuel system].”
33  UK foreign secretary Liz Truss on Monday faced calls to do more to tackle “dirty money” flooding into the UK as she announced plans to toughen the sanctions regime against Russian oligarchs with links to the Kremlin.The legislation, which will come into force next week, would “significantly strengthen” the UK’s ability to deal with Russia’s “aggressive action towards Ukraine”, Truss said. The move was part of “an unprecedented package of co-ordinated sanctions” that the UK was preparing with its allies, she added.Officials said the new powers would allow Britain to act in “lockstep with the US and other allies to freeze assets and ban travel” in the event Russia’s forces invaded Ukraine.Truss said the expansion of the sanctions regime would allow the UK to target “any individual and business of economic or strategic significance to the Kremlin”.Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative MP and chair of the foreign affairs select committee, welcomed the announcement but pointed out his committee had first called for a tightening of the sanctions regime against Russia four years ago. “The strongest thing we can do to defend Ukraine is to defend ourselves against filth and corruption in our city.”In 2018, the government estimated £100bn of “dirty money” had flooded into the UK, from countries including Russia. Two years later the parliamentary intelligence and security committee said the City of London provided “ideal mechanisms” for the recycling of illicit finance, adding it had become a “laundromat” for offshore wealth.David Lammy, Labour’s shadow foreign secretary, supported the move to tighten sanctions but accused successive Conservative-led governments of not acting sooner. “For too long our defences have been let down at home while the government looks abroad.London is the destination of choice for the world’s kleptocrats.”Dmitry Peskov, spokesperson for Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, said the UK’s move amounted to a “blatant attack on business”.Truss also said the government would revive a long-delayed economic crime bill — designed to crack down on the flow of dirty money to the UK — by the end of the year. Tory MPs, including the government’s anti-corruption champion John Penrose, had criticised Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, last week for delays in bringing forward the legislation.The bill is expected to include crucial reform of Companies House to crack down on the abuse of shell companies as well as powers to unmask the real owners of offshore companies who own UK property and tougher powers to challenge unexplained wealth.Truss said the government would publish a long-delayed review by April 5 into how more than 700 wealthy Russians, who secured so-called Tier 1 visas allowing them to live in the UK, had acquired their wealth. The probe was ordered in 2018 in the wake of the Salisbury nerve agent attack that targeted a former Russian intelligence officer, which the UK has blamed on Moscow.British officials said the new sanction powers were needed as under previous legislation ministers had only been able to target those linked to the destabilisation of Ukraine.But analysts and lawyers rejected that claim. Tom Keatinge, an expert in finance and security at the Royal United Services Institute think-tank, pointed to the global anti-corruption sanctions regulations adopted last year.“It has taken the brink of war in Europe for the government to think about sweeping out the Augean stable of dirty Russian money in London, when it could have done this previously via sanctions, unexplained wealth orders [UWO] or other measures,” he said.Under a UWO, National Crime Agency investigators can freeze assets and seize property in the UK unless subjects can explain how they can legitimately have afforded the purchases.Neill Blundell, the head of the corporate crime and investigations team at Macfarlanes, said the UK’s pre-existing sanctions legislation relating to Russia was not as “narrow as it is being depicted”.
34  Boris Johnson’s government is being accused of a “straightforward breach” of its election manifesto promise to match billions of pounds worth of EU development funding for UK nations and regions after Brexit.The government pledged in its 2019 election manifesto that a new Shared Prosperity Fund would “at a minimum” match the £1.5bn a year in EU regional funds that was returned to the UK from its EU membership contributions, and “reaffirmed” that commitment in last October’s Budget.These “EU structural funds” were designed to support economic development and reduce regional inequalities, particularly through investment in small businesses, skills and innovation, the green economy and other infrastructure projects.However, the devolved administrations and some English regional authorities say they face being left hundreds of millions of pounds out of pocket after the government unveiled a fund worth an average of £870mn a year over the next three years.The Welsh government said that its calculations found that Wales would be “close to £1bn” worse off over the next three years, comprising £750mn in “lost” structural funds and £242mn in support for farmers.“It’s a straightforward breach of the manifesto pledge,” said Vaughan Gething, the Welsh economy minister in an interview with the Financial Times, adding that sports and apprenticeship programmes were facing real-terms cuts as a result.Scotland’s governing Scottish National party said a reduction to the EU structural funds would hit “key projects and communities”.Scotland should not receive “one penny less” than under EU membership, said Alison Thewliss, an SNP MP and Treasury spokesperson.In Northern Ireland, the loss of EU funding could amount to £65mn a year, according to official presentations to a Stormont budget committee hearing this month, which also estimated losses of up to 6,000 jobs and more than £500mn in investment.English regions are also facing cuts, according to analysis commissioned for the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, a regional economic lobby group, which found that funding in areas such as Teesside and Leeds could fall by up to 50 per cent.Henri Murison, director of the partnership, said the figures exposed “the gap between rhetoric and reality”, accusing the government of “broken promises” on retaining regional investment post-Brexit.“Many of the places that stand to lose out the most under the current funding formula are the ones most in need of serious investment.”The Shared Prosperity Fund is set to launch in April, with the government committing £400mn this year, rising to £700mn in 2023-24 and finally to £1.5bn in the final year of the spending review in 2024-25.These funds will replace EU structural funds, which were agreed on a seven-year cycle and totalled £10.5bn for 2014-2020, the last period for which the UK was a member of the EU.Typically, funds agreed for development projects falling in the latter parts of a seven-year cycle would continue to be disbursed for up to three years after the funding cycle ends, meaning EU regional funds are still being paid out in the UK up until at least 2023.Gething raised concerns last October with Michael Gove, the UK minister for levelling up, that the government in Westminster was double counting, or “netting off”, payments from the past EU settlement in order to make good on its promise not to see a diminution in regional funds since 2020.“Instead of having fresh or new money to commit each and every year, the UK government is including spending committed under previous years in its calculation for this year’s funding,” he said.The levelling up department confirmed that the UK government spending would not match the £1.5bn average EU payments until 2024-2025. It added that devolved administrations could also access regional finance funds via the British Business Bank.“We have been clear throughout that UK-wide funding for the UK Shared Prosperity Fund — worth over £2.6bn [over three years] — will ramp up to at least match receipts from EU structural funds, which on average reached around £1.5bn per year,” it said.However, October’s Budget documents said that the Shared Prosperity Fund “will at a minimum match the size of EU Funds in each nation and in Cornwall, each year”.
35  The US has drawn up sanctions targeting Vladimir Putin’s inner circle and its ties to the west as Washington broadens the list of financial penalties it and European allies will impose if Russia invades Ukraine.The move comes as the UK vowed on Monday to introduce new legislation strengthening London’s ability to target Kremlin-linked businesses and their owners in the country in case of Russian aggression on Ukraine.Senior US administration officials told the Financial Times that a list of individuals and family members that would be hit with sanctions had been developed in co-ordination with US allies as part of the effort to punish the Russian president in the event of an attack.“The individuals we have identified are in or near the inner circles of the Kremlin and play a role in government decision making or are at a minimum complicit in the Kremlin’s destabilising behaviour,” the US officials said.The administration officials did not name the Russian oligarchs and family members in question but said that many were “particularly vulnerable targets because of their deepened financial ties with the west”.“Sanctions would cut them off from the international financial system and ensure that they and their family members will no longer be able to enjoy the perks of parking their money in the west and attending elite western universities,” the senior Biden administration officials said.The measures to target Russian oligarchs would come in addition to broader sanctions against sectors of Russia’s economy, including banking and energy, that the US and its allies have been discussing for weeks.On Monday, British government officials said that, under new legislation, the UK would be able to act in “lockstep with the US and other allies to freeze assets and ban travel”.Speaking in parliament on Monday, Liz Truss, UK foreign minister, said: “We will be able to target any company that is linked to the Russian state, engages in business of economic significance to the Russian state or operates in a sector of strategic significance to the Russian state.”In Washington, senior Biden administration officials said the targets had been chosen among Russian leaders, officials, senior executive officers or members of the boards of directors of state-owned companies. They could be operating in “any sector of the Russian economy as identified by the Secretary of the Treasury”, and extended to spouses and children.The US officials said some of the individuals were selected from a classified list of senior political figures and Russian oligarchs sent to Congress by the Treasury department in 2018, known as Section 241 of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, a law enacted in 2017.“Putin’s cronies will no longer be able to use their spouses or other family members as proxies to evade sanctions,” the senior administration officials said.The UK’s parallel effort focusing on oligarchs will be particularly important to the US given that many members of the Russian elite have assets and other financial ties in Britain.“The US and UK are in lockstep and we are prepared — in co-ordination with other allies and partners — to impose massive costs if Russia further invades Ukraine. Russia knows that. We welcome the UK’s strong partnership on enforcing existing sanctions for malicious activity and in preparing packages of strong economic measures to deter further Russian aggression,” a spokesperson for the White House’s National Security Council told the Financial Times.The penalties against Russia’s elite do not preclude Washington from imposing sanctions that directly target Putin, which Biden said was a possibility last week.“This is not the exhaustive list of costs we will impose. All options remain on the table,” the senior administration officials said.
36  The botched attempt by Italy’s political parties to appoint a new president is a blessing in disguise. Sergio Mattarella’s decision to accept a second seven-year term as head of state was the best outcome for a country that badly needs political stability and a degree of consensus to take advantage of EU funds and engineer a long overdue economic revamp. Nobody thought it was possible because Mattarella had made plain his scepticism about two-term presidencies. It took eight rounds of voting and an unedifying display of ineptitude and duplicity by Italy’s politicians to convince him otherwise.Fortunately, it means that Mario Draghi can stay on as prime minister until the next parliamentary elections, due in 2023, brokering deals among the parties for economic and administrative reforms and overcoming resistance from the country’s cumbersome bureaucracy. Draghi’s national unity government last year made a decent start to implementing the reform promises agreed under Italy’s EU recovery plan, even if some measures were watered down. But 2022 is likely to be more demanding. Italy has to meet 100 milestones to receive its next slices of EU money. Reforms to the tax system, public procurement and civil service will strain government unity.Putting himself forward for the presidency and then failing to win sufficient backing from the political parties, could have badly undermined Draghi’s authority, especially if someone else had been installed in the president’s Palazzo Quirinale. But a second term for Mattarella, who has proved a deft guiding force as president, was what Draghi and most others originally wanted. The political parties backing his government emerge from this painful process looking weak and divided, which may give Draghi a stronger hand to drive through difficult choices. With the presidency settled, he can be less accommodating to party leaders.It is a mistake to expect miracles from the former European Central Bank president. Italy’s problems are too entrenched. Political discipline will inevitably break down as the elections approach. But it is hard to imagine anybody better placed to try to make the most of what is still a once-in-a-generation opportunity for Italy to raise its growth potential, albeit by just a bit.If the outcome of the presidential election is positive in the short term, the longer-term prospects for Italian democracy look bleak. It is hard see how either the rightwing parties or those notionally on the left could form a governing bloc such is the animosity unleashed by this process within the political families.The Five Star leader Giuseppe Conte went behind the backs of the centre-left to cut a deal with Matteo Salvini’s nationalist League. Salvini in the end backed Mattarella without consulting the far-right Brothers of Italy. The governing parties are also bitterly divided, with factional and personal interests holding sway. With his erratic manoeuvring, Salvini damaged his credibility within the League. The Brothers of Italy, which opposes the national unity government and wants early elections instead, was the only party to show consistency in this process. Alas, it may emerge from it strengthened. But it would still need the support of the centre-right to take power.Italy’s governing parties are so dysfunctional it is hard to imagine how they can see through the five-year contract they signed with the EU to pass reforms in exchange for €191bn of investment. Another national unity government may be necessary. But outsourcing political leadership to unelected technocrats is not a good long-term solution for a modern democracy.
37  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
38  What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object? Wintershall Dea, Europe’s largest private energy company, is about to find out.Climate change lobbyists want BASF to spin off Wintershall Dea, which is 73 per cent owned by the German chemicals group, in a separate listing. But Mikhail Fridman, whose LetterOne fund holds a 27 per cent stake, is not playing ball. The fund on Monday said it will block any near-term IPO effort. LetterOne has the right to do so until the end of 2023.BASF wants to rejig its portfolio, moving away from bulk commodities such as fertilisers and oil and gas to focus on growth areas such as battery power and crop protection. Europe’s energy crisis suggests a continuing need for fossil fuels. But the former businesses run counter to BASF’s plans to reduce its carbon footprint by a quarter by 2030 and hit net zero by 2050.Fridman and LetterOne think selling these businesses too soon would override any later benefits. Wintershall has significant Russian exposure, accounting for half of its upstream production in 2020. Wintershall is also one of the European partners of Gazprom in the Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2 pipelines. Both carry heightened political risk because of the threat of sanctions should Russia invade Ukraine.Despite oil prices hitting seven-year highs and near-record natural gas costs, shares in Gazprom and local rival Rosneft have fallen since December. Both trade at roughly half the eight times forward earnings of their counterparts in the Stoxx Europe oil and gas index. A Wintershall IPO, which might raise €4bn for BASF, could receive a discount of 60 per cent to its peers, said Jefferies.Fridman will know something about timing given his lucrative sale to Rosneft of Russian oil explorer TNK-BP in 2011. Meanwhile, despite the best efforts of BASF’s management, its shares have gone sideways for a decade. A listing at such a low valuation should deter even the staunchest of BASF’s environmentalist shareholders. Understandably, Fridman would prefer to wait.
39  Inflation in Germany and Spain stayed higher than expected in January, increasing the pressure on the European Central Bank to explain whether it still thinks eurozone price growth will fall below its target later this year.Sharp increases in energy and food prices led to annual German inflation of 5.1 per cent in January, down from 5.7 per cent in December, according to the country’s harmonised index of consumer prices published on Monday.“A number of service providers — restaurants, hotels, hairdressers, craftsmen, etc — have raised their prices since the summer of 2021 to make up for lost turnover,” said Marco Wagner, senior economist at Commerzbank. “This category also includes package holidays.”This meant German inflation did not fall as much as expected by economists polled by Reuters, who had forecast a bigger drop to 4.7 per cent. Compared with the previous month, inflation was up 0.9 per cent, indicating underlying price pressures remain strong.Annual inflation in Spain also remained higher than expected at 6.1 per cent in January, down from 6.5 per cent in December.The ECB has a target of 2 per cent inflation for the eurozone and last month forecast price growth would fall back below this level by the fourth quarter of this year, justifying its decision to maintain a supportive monetary policy stance.Economists expect eurozone inflation to fall from a record high of 5 per cent in December to 4.4 per cent in January, when those figures are released on Wednesday. Some analysts have been raising their forecasts to reflect pressure on energy prices as a result of tensions between Russia and Ukraine and further disruption to supply chains caused by the pandemic.“In the short term risks to the inflation outlook are clearly tilted to the upside,” said Katharina Utermöhl, senior economist at Allianz. “Next to growing geopolitical tensions putting further upward pressure on energy prices, China’s zero-Covid policy may call for more severe lockdowns which in turn could fuel inflation by further postponing any easing in global supply chain stress.”The persistence of inflation is likely to dominate the next ECB governing council meeting on Thursday, even if most economists expect it to stick to its timetable for reducing asset purchases to a lower level this year, while keeping interest rates at negative levels.“For the ECB, today’s German headline inflation data will most likely lead to yet another upward revision of its inflation projections,” said Carsten Brzeski, head of macro research at ING. “Still, we see the ECB in no position to consider hiking interest rates any time soon.”Spiralling prices are a sensitive subject for Germans, whose approach to money is still haunted by the hyperinflation of the 1920s that wiped out most people’s savings.German energy prices were boosted by the impact of higher gas prices on annual utility bills and the increase in a carbon tax by €5 to €30 a tonne at the start of this year, which more than offset a cut in a green energy tax on electricity. Core inflation in Germany, stripping out more volatile energy and food prices, fell from 3.7 per cent to 3 per cent.Part of the fall in prices was mechanical, because last year’s 1 percentage point boost to inflation from the reversal of a cut in sales tax has now dropped out of the year-on-year comparison.Spanish inflation of 6.1 per cent in January was down from 6.5 per cent in December, its highest year-on-year rise since 1992. Compared with the previous month, prices fell 0.9 per cent. But annual core inflation in the country rose from 2.1 to 2.4 per cent.
40  Mali has expelled France’s ambassador to Bamako as relations between the military junta ruling the west African country and the former colonial power continue to deteriorate.The interim government told ambassador Joel Meyer to leave Mali in 72 hours after summoning him on Monday over remarks made by France’s foreign minister. France is leading the counter-terrorism fight in Mali, which is at the heart of a jihadist insurgency that has killed thousands and displaced millions across the Sahel.“This measure follows the hostile and outrageous remarks recently made by the French minister.and the recurrence of such remarks by the French authorities towards the Malian authorities, despite repeatedly raised protests. The government of Mali strongly condemns and rejects these remarks,” Mali’s interim government said in a statement read on Malian state TV.France said it had taken note of the Malian decision and would recall Meyer. Paris also expressed solidarity with other west African governments that have called for the return of democracy in Mali. “France reiterates its commitment to the stabilisation and development of the Sahel,” a senior diplomat in Paris said.France’s foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Friday that the junta was “out of control” and illegitimate, while defence minister Florence Parly said on Saturday that French troops could pull out of Mali completely amid an escalating row over the junta’s decision to hire the Wagner Group, the Kremlin-connected Russian mercenary outfit.Mali’s government is headed by Col Assimi Goita, the soldier who led a coup that overthrew the democratically elected government in August 2020 and then seized complete control in a second coup in May 2021, ousting interim civilian leaders who were seen as close to France.Goita promised a swift transition to democracy but this month proposed holding elections in December 2025, prompting severe sanctions from regional bloc Ecowas that have in effect placed the country under an economic embargo.Isis and al-Qaeda-linked groups control large parts of central and northern Mali, which jihadis briefly captured in late 2012, prompting a French military intervention that has become increasingly unpopular as violence has spread across the country and into neighbouring Niger and Burkina Faso.Monday’s expulsion was the result of a “collision course on both sides”, said a western diplomat in Bamako. The junta and Paris have traded increasingly hostile barbs since French president Emmanuel Macron announced last June that France would halve its 5,000 troops presence in the region.Soon after, reports emerged that the junta was in talks to hire the Wagner Group, amid increasingly warm relations with the Russian government, and hundreds of its mercenaries are now in the country. Wagner mercenaries have been accused by the UN of gross human rights abuses and possible war crimes in Libya and the Central African Republic.Last week, Mali ordered the withdrawal of roughly 100 Danish troops who had arrived to join a French-led European special forces mission, prompting criticism from the 15 countries contributing to the effort.Mali’s August coup was the first in a string of putsches across west and central Africa as soldiers seized power in Chad, Guinea and, last week, Burkina Faso. On Monday, the African Union voted to suspend Burkina Faso’s involvement in “all AU activities until the effective restoration of constitutional order in the country”.
41  Portugal’s socialist prime minister will press ahead with stalled plans to increase spending on pensions and health and lift the minimum wage, after securing a resounding election victory.António Costa’s Socialist party (PS) polled almost 42 per cent of the vote to win an outright majority of 117 seats in the 230-seat parliament in Sunday’s snap parliamentary election.“Our mission now is to turn the page on the pandemic and ensure the recovery of the sectors most affected,” Costa said in a victory speech in the early hours of Monday.The unexpected result confounded pollsters who had forecast a narrow PS victory. It also ended Costa’s dependence on the far-left parties that triggered the election two years ahead of schedule by rejecting his 2022 budget.Victory gives the prime minister a stable majority to push through the defeated budget and to invest €16.6bn in EU recovery funds that Portugal is scheduled to receive over the next three years.Budget measures that are likely to move forward include a €700m increase in investment in the national health service and a €40 increase in the national minimum wage to €705 a month, as well as higher pensions and public sector wages. The minimum wage increase would cost employers about €600m this year, consultancy firms have estimated.João Leão, finance minister in the outgoing government, said on Monday that economic growth could exceed his previous target of 5.5 per cent this year, after growth of 4.9 per cent in 2021.Carla Subirana, Europe analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said fiscal prudence would remain a PS priority. The prime minister earned admiration from centre-left parties in Europe for holding down the budget deficit at the same time as overturning austerity measures.“Costa will continue to seek to hold down the budget deficit and cut public debt, which at 130 per cent of GDP is among the highest in the EU,” she said.The radical leftwing parties that triggered the election by rejecting Costa’s budget lost 20 of their combined total of 31 seats, as voters penalised the anti-capitalist Left Bloc (BE) and hardline Communist party (PCP) by transferring their votes to the PS.The two had pushed for labour law changes and even higher social spending in a budget that the PS described as already the most leftwing in Portugal’s recent history.Rui Rio, leader of the Social Democrats (PSD), the main opposition, said he was considering his position after his centre-right party polled less than 28 per cent of the vote and lost three of its 79 seats as part of a shake-up of party politics on the right. “The PSD will decide,” he said.Commentators criticised polling companies for serious failures after they projected a tight race two days ahead of the election, with the PS leading the PSD by just two or three points.Chega, a far-right populist party, polled slightly more than 7 per cent of the vote to win 12 seats, up from one seat previously, making it Portugal’s third-largest political force. The Liberal Initiative (IL), another newer party, also overtook the BE and PCP, gaining eight seats, up from one seat previously.The conservative Popular party (CDS-PP), one of the founding parties of Portugal’s democracy and a regular participant in government coalitions, lost its remaining two seats in parliament, causing Francisco Rodrigues dos Santos, its leader, to resign.Both new rightwing parties emerged in the wake of the tough austerity measures introduced by a PSD and CDS-PP alliance during Portugal’s 2011-14 bailout by the EU and IMF.That right-of-centre coalition narrowly won a general election in 2015, but Costa secured a larger majority in parliament by forging an unprecedented alliance with the Left Bloc and the Communists. Six year later, he no longer needs their support.Costa was almost apologetic about his absolute majority, given the tendency among many Portuguese voters to see such victories as delivering too much unchecked power into one party’s hands.“An absolute majority does not mean absolute power,” a visibly moved Costa told cheering supporters. “I will govern in dialogue with all the political forces elected to parliament.”Pedro Sánchez, Spain’s prime minister and a fellow socialist, congratulated Costa on his victory, saying it would help the Iberian neighbours promote “a socialist response” to Europe’s challenges.
42  The eurozone economy grew 0.3 per cent in the final three months of last year, returning the bloc to its pre-pandemic level of output despite a sharp slowdown from the previous quarter as coronavirus infections hit record levels.Fourth-quarter growth in the 19-country bloc was in line with the expectations of economists polled by Reuters, as it decelerated from 2.2 per cent growth in the previous three-month period. Household spending continued to grow in many countries, albeit at a slower pace, while output was also boosted by businesses restocking inventories.Contractions of output in Germany and Austria were offset by quarter-on-quarter growth in countries including Spain, France and Italy, as the bloc showed increased resilience to the impact of the pandemic, which had plunged it into a record post-war recession in 2020.Eurostat said on Monday that its first estimate of full-year gross domestic product showed growth of 5.2 per cent in both the eurozone and the wider EU for 2021 — the region’s fastest expansion since 1971, but slower than the US economy’s 5.7 per cent growth last year.Economists calculated that the single currency area had rebounded to pre-pandemic levels of GDP.Eurozone growth is expected to remain sluggish in the first few months of this year before economic activity picks up again as coronavirus restrictions are loosened and supply chain bottlenecks ease.“Restrictions in many countries to counter the Omicron wave are set to be lifted soon, allowing the recovery to resume in the coming months,” said Jessica Hinds, senior Europe economist at Capital Economics.Italy’s economy continued to beat expectations with growth of 0.6 per cent in the fourth quarter, leading to full-year growth of 6.4 per cent, according to figures published on Monday. It was the fastest annual expansion since at least 1995, according to Reuters. The growth was attributed to higher domestic demand driving increased output in industry and services.The eurozone’s third-largest economy has rebounded more sharply than many economists initially expected from its decline of almost 9 per cent in 2020 and is now close to returning to pre-pandemic levels of GDP.“This confirms the country’s improved ability to recover from crisis compared to previous episodes,” said Loredana Maria Federico, chief Italian economist at UniCredit.While the latest wave of Covid-19 cases has led to tighter restrictions that dented consumer spending and prolonged supply chain bottlenecks that have squeezed manufacturing, overall economic activity in Europe has been less disrupted than in previous waves.The exception has been Germany, where the economy shrank 0.7 per cent in the fourth quarter, as a drop in consumer spending and supply constraints on manufacturing weighed on overall output.The lacklustre performance of Europe’s largest economy left it 1.5 per cent below pre-pandemic levels of GDP. In contrast, the US economy was 3.1 per cent above its pre-pandemic level in the fourth quarter, while France was 0.9 per cent above pre-crisis GDP levels.Spain achieved the fastest growth in the fourth quarter, expanding 2 per cent. But the country’s greater reliance on pandemic-hit tourism has weighed on its recovery and its GDP was still 4 per cent below pre-pandemic levels.“There are a lot of country-specific drivers, not only more pandemic-related effects such as the timing of restrictions and supply chain problems but probably also how direct the hit was from high electricity prices,” said Daniel Bergvall, an economist at SEB.Austria was one of the weakest eurozone economies in the fourth quarter, when its economy shrank 2.2 per cent after it imposed a lockdown to tackle soaring coronavirus infections. In contrast, Portugal had lighter curbs and its economy grew 1.6 per cent.
43  Ukrainian police have detained a group of suspects for allegedly planning mass riots in multiple cities including the capital Kyiv, with the aim of destabilising the country as fears of a full-blown Russian invasion linger.Denys Monastyrsky, Ukraine’s interior minister, said during a televised briefing on Monday that the organisers planned to involve up to 5,000 paid-for protesters to stoke violent clashes with police. The arrests were made on Sunday. Monastyrsky did not reveal how many individuals had been arrested.“The action was organised to destabilise the situation in Ukraine,” he said. “Such rallies were planned to be held, in particular, in Sumy, Chernihiv, Poltava and Cherkasy regions.”Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, on Friday downplayed the risk of a full-scale Russian invasion, while urging the US to tone down its warnings of such a scenario, saying that “panic” threatened to undermine the country’s economy.But Ukrainian officials have also warned that any deeper Russian invasion — which the US and other countries have warned could be imminent, with Moscow amassing more than 100,000 troops near the nation’s border — could be preceded by attempts to destabilise the country internally.Monastyrsky did not explicitly suggest that the riots were orchestrated by Russia but he did express concern that two of the regions where the activities were planned were “on our northern borders with the Russian Federation”.“As is well known, one of the scenarios of aggression against Ukraine is paid-for violent massive protests. This is used and can be used as an element of [Russia’s] hybrid war,” he added.Monastyrsky also drew a parallel between the foiled riots and pro-Russian protests staged in 2014 that took place in the run-up to Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and its stoking of a proxy war in eastern regions that has claimed more than 14,000 lives.The arrests follow a Friday announcement by Ukraine’s SBU state security service on the arrest of a “Russian military intelligence agent” who was caught “red handed” plotting terrorist attacks in Odesa, the country’s strategic Black Sea port city.In a separate statement on Monday, the SBU said it had over the past year “neutralised dozens of criminal groups, whose activities were co-ordinated with Russia” and “threaten Ukraine’s national security”.The US warned this month that Moscow could use covert operations, including sabotage, in eastern Ukraine to create a “pretext for invasion”.
44  The western world may be divided about how to deal with Vladimir Putin. But we can surely all agree on one thing? Russia’s president is the bad guy in this particular drama.Actually, no. One of the more revealing and depressing features of international politics is the existence of a Putin cult. There is a significant group of world leaders and influential political figures who greatly admire Putin. His fan club is global, spanning Asia, the Middle East, the Americas and Europe.Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesman, was on to something when he remarked in 2018: “There’s a demand in the world for special, sovereign leaders, for decisive ones.Putin’s Russia was the starting point.”When Putin first emerged as leader of Russia in 1999-2000, he looked like an anomaly — a strongman nationalist in an era of technocratic globalists. Angela Merkel, Germany’s former chancellor, once suggested that Putin was trying to apply the techniques of the 19th century to a different era.But, with democratic values under challenge across the world, Putin looks increasingly like a man who foresaw the future of global politics rather than a relic from the past. The Russian leader has attracted fans and emulators who admire his ruthlessness, his willingness to use violence, his macho defiance of “political correctness” and his autocratic style of leadership. As the Russian commentator Dmitri Trenin put it last week: “Putin is a pre-communist leader.He is a tsar.”One great danger of the current Ukraine crisis is that if Putin emerges looking victorious, his style of leadership will gain even more prestige and imitators across the world. Land grabs, military threats, lies and assassinations will look like the techniques of a winner.Putin has already served as a model for a new generation of autocratic leaders and populists, including in Europe and the US. Donald Trump had to be a little coy about his admiration for Putin. But some of the former US president’s close aides were more open. After the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Rudy Giuliani praised Putin: “He makes a decision and he executes quickly.That’s what you call a leader.” During the current crisis over Ukraine, Tucker Carlson, the most influential commentator on Fox News, has been openly supportive of Putin.Viktor Orban, Hungary’s prime minister and the self-styled champion of “illiberal democracy” in the EU, is visiting Putin this week. In the past, Orban has argued that the EU needs to recognise that “Putin has made his country great again”. Like Putin, Orban has positioned himself as the champion of a minority in Ukraine — in his case, ethnic Hungarians.Putin’s other prominent fans in western Europe include Nigel Farage, the pro-Brexit campaigner, and Matteo Salvini, leader of Italy’s hard-right League and former deputy prime minister. Commenting on Putin’s dispatch of troops to the Middle East, Farage gushed: “The way he played the whole Syria thing. Brilliant.” Salvini once posed for photos in Red Square wearing a Putin T-shirt.The Putin fan club extends into Asia and the Middle East. Rodrigo Duterte, leader of the Philippines, has been widely accused of sponsoring death squads during his time as president. When Duterte was asked which world leader he most admired, he replied “my favourite hero is Putin”.Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s former prime minister, another self-styled tough guy, relished trips to Russia to discuss geopolitics with Putin. His 2019 re-election campaign featured a poster of the Israeli leader shaking hands with Putin, under the slogan “Netanyahu: In a league of his own”.Putin has bonded with strongman leaders elsewhere in the Middle East. He presented Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Egypt’s president, with a gift of a Kalashnikov rifle. Sisi, whose security forces have killed hundreds of demonstrators on the streets of Egypt, appeared enraptured by the gift.Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince and de facto leader, is another Putin fan. As he rose to power, some British advisers to MBS noted his awestruck admiration for Putin, commenting: “He was fascinated by him.He liked what he did.”The fellow feeling between the Saudi and Russian strongmen took on a new dimension, after MBS was accused of ordering the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist. For a while, it seemed as if MBS risked becoming an international pariah. It was Putin who made a point of welcoming him back into the club of world leaders. At MBS’s first G20 summit after the Khashoggi killing, the Saudi leader was high-fived by a grinning Putin. Putin himself was later accused of authorising the attempted murder of Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader.That exuberant handshake between Putin and MBS goes to the heart of the international cult of Putin. The Russian leader’s biggest admirers are often those, like Duterte and MBS, who share his taste for violence and his contempt for human rights.That is why the current confrontation between Russia and the west is about more than Ukraine’s independence, important though that is. The outcome of the crisis may also determine the tone of world politics. If Putin faces down the western democracies, his thuggish strongman style of leadership will look like the wave of the future.
45  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.Italy’s political crisis has been averted for now, as the incumbent president agreed over the weekend to stay on for another term, keeping Mario Draghi in place as prime minister. We’ll explore what this means for the European debate on fiscal rules and when the clash with more frugal-minded capitals is likely to intensify.Meanwhile, in Portugal, the ruling Socialists have been projected to win the country’s snap parliamentary election by a chunky margin.On Brexit, a new EU-UK parliamentary assembly has elected its leaderships on both sides last week. We’ll unpack what to expect from this body, at a time when trade talks are making little headway and the “partygate” scandal rumbles on in London.And in merger news, a report shows that despite increased activity last year, the European Commission has launched fewer inquiries — and has taken longer than usual to complete open ones.The chaotic recent days in Italian politics have been wounding for Mario Draghi, who signalled an appetite to become the country’s president only to turn around on Saturday and ask Sergio Mattarella to stay in the post, writes Sam Fleming in Brussels.They have been even worse for the country’s political parties, which have been riven by squabbling and infighting during six days of voting. The country’s politicians proved themselves incapable of unifying behind anything other than the status quo — fearful as they were about the prospect of early elections.Financial markets will nevertheless welcome the prospect of Draghi remaining Italy’s prime minister — inauspicious though the dysfunctional political backdrop appears in the longer term. The parties look enfeebled and internal battles are worsening. But this may leave them less willing and capable of throwing up serious opposition to Draghi’s domestic programme.One of the few things they have in common will be a desire to keep the current government alive and avoid elections before the deadline in the first half of 2023. This could accentuate Italy’s chances of staying on track with its deficit-reduction pledges, and its reform commitments under Rome’s €191bn recovery and resilience plan.The outcome is being welcomed in particular by France, which has been working closely with Rome on proposals to overhaul the EU’s fiscal governance.Draghi and French president Emmanuel Macron will find it difficult to win the fiscally conservative north over to all their reform ideas — even after the ejection of the Christian Democrats from power in Berlin and the arrival of a more reform-friendly coalition in the Netherlands.But the proposals — among them the idea of granting favourable treatment to investments in green and digital projects — will carry more weight elsewhere if they enjoy the active support of Draghi, a former president of the European Central Bank.That particularly applies in Berlin. As Erik Nielsen, chief economist at UniCredit said, “You cannot persuade the German government to do anything if they get bad vibes from Italy. So it is very good from that point of view.”Among the key moments to watch in the next two months are an informal meeting of finance ministers in Paris in late February, and a planned informal summit on growth and investment in early March.While much of the EU’s fiscal discussion thus far has focused on reforms to the Stability and Growth Pact to make it more investment-friendly, the debate will not stop there. A paper from the Jacques Delors Centre is set to argue that the EU’s Semester process, under which the commission makes yearly reform proposals to capitals on areas such as the labour markets and fiscal policy needs a significant rethink.  The new €800bn NextGenerationEU programme requires member states to adopt a subset of those Semester reform recommendations into their recovery programme. This gives those particular recommendations real teeth, given the reforms will need to be delivered to unlock payments of money by the commission. The paper by Nils Redeker and Thu Nguyen says Brussels should trim back Semester recommendations that are not linked to recovery fund payments, to avoid making proposals that are “bound to be ignored”. (More here)EU-UK relations continue to be strained after British prime minister Boris Johnson last week told the House of Commons that EU checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland were “insane”, writes Andy Bounds in Brussels.So what hopes are there for the new UK-EU Parliamentary Partnership Assembly? Nathalie Loiseau, a French MEP who will serve on the body, tells Europe Express she’s an optimist.The forum for the European parliament and the UK parliament is meant to exchange views on the relationship and scrutinise the functioning of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement. As part of its role it can request information from the Partnership Council, the joint UK-EU body overseeing the relationship.Last week the UK parliament elected its 35-strong delegation. Sir Oliver Heald, the chair, is a longstanding moderate Conservative MP who voted against Brexit. As did Hilary Benn, the senior Labour MP who is his deputy.There are other prominent Remainers, such as former MEPs Timothy Kirkhope and Emma Nicholson. But Brexiters were elected too, including Andrea Leadsom, the Conservative former minister, and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, leader of the Democratic Unionist party in Northern Ireland.On the other side of the Channel, the European parliament elected Loiseau, a former Europe minister, as its chair.Loiseau told EE she believes it can start rebuilding political co-operation across the Channel, in areas such as foreign affairs, student and academic exchanges and financial services.She particularly wants to recreate something like the Erasmus scheme that allows EU students to spend a year at university in another EU country. “Do we want to build a generation where people do not know each other? It is only the very richest families in the EU who can still afford to send their children to the UK.”However, she said there would be no new agreements such as allowing the UK to remain in the Horizon science research partnership until the UK had agreed to stick to those it had already signed, including the Northern Ireland Protocol.Does she believe relations can improve? “I am an optimist,” she said. “That is why I am a politician. Otherwise I would do something else. I would write a novel.”For decades regulators in Brussels have perfected the art of examining mergers of some of the largest multinationals, but the pandemic and new powers have led to fewer and lengthier probes, writes Javier Espinoza in Brussels.Even as 2021 saw one of the highest numbers of transactions in decades, what is striking is that the European Commission only led 14 “significant” merger investigations, the fewest seen over the past decade, according to a new report by law firm Dechert set to be published today.The average duration of an in-depth probe soared 29 per cent, reaching a new 19.2-month record since the tracker began. Researchers say the increased length is a result of companies talking to officials for longer during an informal period known as pre-filing to iron out any potential difficulties during the formal process.Separately, the average formal review period of a lengthy probe reached 9.5 months for the first time, which highlights how regulators are also willing to use their powers to pause the process more frequently. The pandemic also likely played a role in the extended duration of the review period, the report said.In the US, more than 37 per cent of significant investigations led to a complaint or an abandoned deal, the highest recorded by this tracker. This points to increased scepticism among regulators about concessions offered by companies seeking to appease competition concernsand later this week
46  Spain has urged Nato not to neglect its southern flank even as the military alliance responds to the Ukraine crisis by deploying forces in central Europe and the Black Sea.Speaking ahead of a Madrid summit intended to modernise the alliance’s strategy in June, José Manuel Albares, foreign minister, argued that Nato should look south as well as east at potential threats to security.The issue is particularly acute for Spain, which depends on Algeria for gas supplies and on Morocco to help control undocumented migration while remaining deeply concerned about lawlessness and violent Islamist movements in the Sahel region to the south of those countries.“The Mediterranean, the Maghreb, the Sahel and sub-Saharan Africa are vital for Nato and for Europe,” Albares said in an interview with the Financial Times. “We talk about a Nato 360-degree approach [to respond to threats] but, without content, this will be just a slogan.Nato needs to think about what its role is going to be.”The Nato summit Spain is hosting in June is intended to update the alliance’s strategic concept, which sets out its fundamental security tasks and challenges but has not been revised since 2010.Albares highlighted problems in the Sahel, where France decided last year to halve the number of its troops fighting Islamist militants. “Jihadism is still there, as well as all kinds of illicit trafficking: arms, humans, drugs,” he said. “It is hugely fragile. We see more and more military regimes in the Sahel,” in an apparent reference to recent coups in Burkina Faso and Mali.He called for Nato to look at greater engagement with the region — through political dialogue, police and army training and help with coastal patrols — while emphasising that Spain was contributing to the alliance’s response to the Ukraine crisis. Madrid has dispatched a frigate to the Black Sea, despite dissent within the ruling coalition from the radical left Podemos party.The Spanish minister also argued that the tensions over Ukraine would not endanger his country’s energy supplies, since Algeria, not Russia, is its dominant provider of gas.But the dependence on Algerian gas has become a source of concern in Madrid, largely because of the North African country’s deteriorating ties with its neighbour Morocco, with which it broke off diplomatic relations in August. Algiers subsequently shut off a gas pipeline that supplied Spain via Morocco.Albares reiterated commitments he said he secured during a trip to Algeria last year to keep Spain supplied through a smaller pipeline that directly connects the two countries — and, if necessary, through more expensive liquefied natural gas transported by ships. “The Algerian supply of gas to Spain is totally guaranteed,” he said, while declining to give similar assurances on price.High energy costs have been one of the most sensitive political issues in Spain over the past 12 months, leading the government to take emergency measures such as tax breaks and a windfall levy in a bid to keep prices affordable.The foreign minister also expressed his hope of improved relations with Morocco after a crisis last April in which Rabat allowed thousands of migrants to enter the Spanish North African enclave of Ceuta.On taking office last July, Albares said one of his goals was to strengthen ties with “our great neighbour and friend”. But, despite a warm speech soon after by King Mohammed VI, Rabat has signalled it wants greater “clarity” from Spain concerning the disputed area of Western Sahara, a desert region over which Morocco claims sovereignty. Karima Benyaich, Morocco’s ambassador to Spain, has not returned to Madrid since being recalled in May.“The peaks of tension that we had in April and May have gone,” said Albares. “So I see that positively. But of course I have more ambitions for our relationship.”
47  Atomic weaponry is the only genuine — but unthinkable — nuclear option in a war. Some politicians and pundits nevertheless regard expelling Russia from the Swift payments alliance for banks as one in the west’s arsenal. It would fall short for more than definitional reasons.Some 100,000 Russian troops are massed on the border with Ukraine. They may soon extend the creeping invasion Russia started in 2014 when it annexed Crimea. The US and EU have little stomach for opposing that militarily. Economic sanctions would be a safer punishment.Kicking the bear out of Swift is a popular threat. Last week, Boris Johnson, the UK’s beleaguered prime minister, commended that form of unfriending as “a potent weapon”. The European Central Bank warned EU lenders to prepare a day later. US legislators have drafted a law aimed at making it happen.Swift’s full title is The Society for Worldwide Interbank Telecommunication. That highlights the satisfying ostracism involved in expelling Russia. But it also hints at flaws in the tactic. Firstly, Swift is not a full-blooded payments network. Nor is Swift, as sometimes claimed, a mere messaging system. True, its core utility resides in around 42m encrypted instructions that 11,500 users in 200 countries exchange daily to co-ordinate payments. But these messages embody something grander: mutual trust based on common standards.Expelling Russia from Swift would not isolate Russia financially, as proponents imply. Nor would it be as futile as opponents imagine.The sanction would have “a chilling effect”, in the words of Harley Balzer, emeritus professor at Georgetown University in the US, discouraging some western banks from Russian dealings. Others would continue to send and receive payments with Russian counterparties.Russia’s own payments messaging system remains largely domestic. Cross-border dealings would probably involve emails, or anachronistic telexes or faxes. Russian business people say this would be fiddly, slow and insecure, but would work much of the time.The second issue underscored by Swift’s full name is that it is a co-operative based in Belgium, not a US bank or state entity. It is obedient to EU law and its own members, not to Joe Biden or Congress. The US would need to lever Russia out of Swift through pressure on the EU and Swift’s non-Russian members.That, broadly, was how Iran was expelled in 2012. Other sanctions had already isolated the Middle Eastern state financially by then, making the move appear more damaging than it really was. Russia is far more connected.European enthusiasm for expelling Russia from Swift would depend on how ambitious and bloody a further Russian invasion was. Germany has little interest in disrupting payments for the Russian gas it imports. Russian energy giant Gazprom pumped gas with an estimated worth of some €18bn to Europe in 2020.If the US wanted to curb that trade, it could do so unilaterally and directly through sanctions on banks. Five large state-owned banks are already subject to “low intensity sanctions”, as Maria Shagina, visiting fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, describes them. These include Sberbank and VTB, which have aggregate assets of over $800bn. People and businesses with US links are prohibited from investments in the quintet that extend beyond 14-day lending.The US could include privately owned banks in sanctions and widen their ambit. It could prohibit global banks from swapping dollars for other currencies, including roubles, with selected Russian institutions.Though Russia has deliberately reduced its foreign exchange dealings in dollars, they still represented over half the total in 2020, Shagina says. Dollars are best traded in New York. Banks that seek to break US sanctions there should beware.“Because so many cross-border transactions have a dollar leg, unilateral US sanctions would achieve 75 per cent of combined US-European sanctions,” reckons Brian O’Toole, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a Washington think-tank.If any sanction is analogous with a nuclear option, it would be cutting off Russian transactions in the almighty dollar via institutions with US links. That would cause serious economic damage, despite Russia’s gold and foreign exchange reserves of $630bn. Ordinary Russians would suffer more than Vladimir Putin. Unfortunately, there can be no surgical financial strike against him and his associates. In the sanctions war, the only financial bombs are dirty ones.
48  Under mounting pressure to provide more help to Ukraine as it braces for a possible Russian invasion, the German government proposed last week what it thought was a bold new initiative: it would supply Kyiv with 5,000 helmets.The announcement was met with a wall of derision. “What kind of support will Germany send next?” asked Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. “Pillows?”In the first crisis of the post-Merkel era, Germany is floundering. The complex legacy of the second world war is weighing on its efforts to craft a coherent policy on Russia. A new government in office for only seven weeks is being pulled in one direction by its powerful pacifist lobby and in the other by Washington.German officials say that the government is playing an important role in keeping diplomatic channels open with Russia. But critics say Berlin has failed to grasp the enormity of the threat Russia poses to Ukraine. They worry that Germany, which draws 55 per cent of its imported gas from Russia, cares more about the impact sanctions will have on its economy than about forming a united front against Moscow. Some Nato countries have even begun to doubt that Berlin is a reliable partner.“How many people in Berlin are actually aware of the massive damage our confused Ukraine policy is doing, not only to Germany but the whole of the EU?” says Wolfgang Ischinger, a former top German diplomat and head of the Munich Security Conference.On key issues in the crisis, Germany’s position remains fuzzy, at least in public. It has dithered on whether to sanction Nord Stream 2, the newly completed Baltic Sea gas pipeline, in the event of a Russian invasion. It has questioned the wisdom of suspending Moscow from the Swift international payment system. And it has flatly refused to send Ukraine defensive weapons.“The Biden administration has been bending over backwards to work with Germany and it is dismayed at the hot mess coming out of Berlin,” says Constanze Stelzenmüller, Fritz Stern Chair at the Brookings Institution in Washington.Russia’s massive build-up of troops on the Ukrainian border comes at a difficult moment for Germany. Angela Merkel stepped down in December after 16 years as chancellor and her successor, Olaf Scholz, presides over a fragile coalition of three parties with big differences over foreign policy. For the Greens, human rights often take precedence over economic interests, while many in Scholz’s centre-left Social Democratic party think Nato is the aggressor and Russia the victim.“The government has had no time to orient itself and get a firm footing,” says Sabine Fischer of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP). “Just weeks in office and it’s confronted with this massive security crisis.”But the row over Ukraine policy has crystallised the central question about German foreign policy in the post-Merkel era. Will Scholz, who won last September’s election on a largely domestic agenda, succeed in offering the same quietly assertive leadership in western security policy as Merkel did? Or will Germany slip back into playing a more passive, reactive role that belies the country’s economic and political importance?Friedrich Merz, the leader of the opposition, fears the latter. In a Bundestag debate on Thursday the new head of the Christian Democratic Union said the “hopelessly divided US Congress” was now “united in its view of Germany as woolly and unreliable”.“And that is your responsibility, Herr chancellor, that’s your policy,” he said to Scholz. “You do not lead, either in Germany or in Europe.”Berlin counters that it has played a key role in western efforts to deter Moscow from an invasion, promising economic and political support for Ukraine and warning Russia of the “high price” it will pay if it attacks its western neighbour. Scholz will meet US President Joe Biden in Washington on February 7 to discuss the crisis.“We have been consistent in emphasising the formula of deterrence and dialogue,” says Nils Schmid, the Social Democrats’ foreign policy spokesperson. “The sanctions the allies have discussed must stand, but dialogue must now play an even greater role.”He points to how Berlin led the revival of the “Normandy format” talks between Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany on resolving the conflict in Ukraine’s eastern border region of Donbas, which restarted last week in Paris. “It was Germany’s involvement that reopened this little door for diplomacy,” he says.Berlin continues to believe it exerts unique influence over Moscow which its allies lack. “Germany has persuaded itself, with Russian encouragement, that it has a special relationship with Moscow and a special responsibility for preserving peace in Europe,” says Ian Bond, director of foreign policy at the Centre for European Reform, a think-tank. “And [it] sees Ukraine’s freely-expressed interest in getting closer to the west as a secondary issue.”But already unflattering comparisons are being drawn between Scholz and Merkel, who led the western response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea and military intervention in Donbas in 2014, maintaining a dialogue with Vladimir Putin while also spearheading tough sanctions against Moscow that are still in force.Under Merkel, “Berlin was the key focal point of the west’s Russia and Ukraine policy,” wrote commentator Christoph von Marschall in the Berlin newspaper Tagesspiegel on Thursday. “Compared to that, Scholz looks like a failure.”Doubts about Germany’s stance on Ukraine have been fuelled by the government’s lack of a coherent line on Nord Stream 2, the €9.5bn pipeline under the Baltic Sea which is completed but still awaiting regulatory approval.Critics of the pipeline, which will bring Russian gas directly to Germany, bypassing Ukraine, say it will give Moscow more leverage over Kyiv and make Europe even more dependent on Russian energy exports than it already is. The US state department has said that the pipeline “will not move forward” if Russia invades Ukraine.However, Scholz initially insisted Nord Stream 2 was a “purely commercial project” which had nothing to do with the Ukraine crisis. Earlier this month he shifted position, saying that a Russian invasion would put the future of the pipeline in doubt. It is now widely expected that the pipeline will form part of a western sanctions package in the event of war. Nord Stream 2 epitomises the dilemma Germany faces. Its industry is hugely reliant on Russian gas, and will become even more so as the country phases out nuclear power and coal. “For years we have had a close mutual dependence,” says Markus Krebber, chief executive of German energy firm RWE. “We need Russian natural gas, and Russia needs foreign currency. We had tensions in the past, but the gas always came.”This explains Germany’s sensitivities over the issue of sanctions. “Today, Germany is the biggest western power with real, substantial interest in economic ties with Russia,” says Dmitri Trenin, head of the Carnegie Moscow Centre. “Thus it will lose the most through sanctions on Russia, unlike the US and the UK, who will lose next to nothing.”Germany has also been strongly criticised over its stance on arms sales to Kyiv. Berlin has a strict ban on the export of lethal weapons to conflict zones and says it will make no exception for Ukraine. But it is also preventing other countries from supplying Kyiv with arms.Earlier this month, as the US and UK rushed tonnes of “lethal security assistance” to Ukraine, it emerged that Germany had blocked Estonia from sending over some decades-old howitzers to Kyiv that previously belonged to the East German army.Ministers have not yet decided whether they should approve or stop the arms delivery. But the mere fact of a delay has triggered howls of protest in eastern Europe. Latvian defence minister Artis Pabriks described Germany’s unwillingness to green light the shipment as “immoral”.“If a person is walking in a dark alley and somebody is being beaten up and I’m saying ‘once you’re beaten up I’ll call an ambulance’, it’s not proper,” Pabriks said.But Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, defended the country’s ban on arms exports to Ukraine, saying that allowing them would represent “a 180-degree change in our foreign policy” and would run the risk of “closing the door for de-escalation which has just opened up again in such a tentative way”.Russia welcomes the German approach to the crisis. “Germany’s restrained position is a very serious factor for the process of conciliation and establishing trust and stability,” says Sergei Gavrilov, a Russian lawmaker. “They want no part in Ukraine’s provocative actions, don’t want to supply weapons for the conflict in Donbas and they’re not using this hostile, provocative rhetoric like the Americans and the English.”But German officials are in private aware of the damage the arms issue is causing. “It’s a classic case where German principle collides with alliance politics,” says one. “It raises the question — what kind of ally are you?”The arms issue also goes right to the heart of German guilt about the second world war. The prospect that Russian soldiers might again be killed by weapons from Germany is one many in Berlin view with horror.But the argument about Germany’s war guilt enrages Ukrainians. They counter that it was Ukraine that bore the brunt of Wehrmacht and SS atrocities between 1941-44, suffering far more civilian casualties than Russia, and so has a much greater claim on German sympathy.“We can’t understand this argument of history,” says Andrij Melnyk, the Ukrainian ambassador to Berlin. “If we’re talking about history, then you could say Germany has a historical responsibility to Ukraine.”Baerbock has sought to address Ukraine’s sensibilities over the issue. “We have a duty to all countries of the former Soviet Union because of the terrible suffering we inflicted on millions of people there in the past,” she recently said.But her comments were overshadowed by a scandal in the German navy that revealed with what scant regard Ukraine is viewed by some senior German officers. Naval chief Kay-Achim Schönbach was forced to resign on January 22 after being filmed saying that Putin deserved to be treated as an equal by the west, and claiming that the Crimean peninsula would never be returned to Kyiv’s control.“What [Putin] really wants is respect,” he told an Indian think-tank. “And by God, giving someone respect is low-cost, even no-cost.it is easy to give him the respect he really demands — and probably also deserves.”Russians were delighted by his remarks. “The absolute majority of Germans share his position, they just don’t want to say it out loud,” says Gavrilov, the Duma MP.But Ukrainian officials were furious. “This condescending attitude reminds Ukrainians of the terrors of the Nazi occupation when [they] were treated as subhuman,” said Melnyk, the ambassador.Some Germans, though, leapt to Schönbach’s defence. Harald Kujat, the former inspector general of the Bundeswehr, said the admiral was only stating the obvious — that any suggestion Crimea could be returned to Ukrainian control was “completely fatuous”. And there was nothing wrong with suggesting that the west should negotiate with Russia on an equal footing — “that’s exactly what the Americans are doing”, he said.Kujat went even further, though, revealing a striking willingness to see the world through Putin’s eyes. “Ukraine must not become the west’s outpost against Russia, and that’s exactly what’s happening right now,” he told RBB radio.The remark typified the stance taken by Germany’s army of “Putin-Versteher” or Putin-empathisers in the Ukraine crisis, many of them Social Democrats. The pro-Russian tendency in the SPD is personified by Gerhard Schröder, the former chancellor who became head of the shareholders’ committee of Nord Stream shortly after leaving office in 2005 and was made chair of the Kremlin-controlled Russian oil group Rosneft in 2017.But Schröder, who once referred to Putin as an “impeccable democrat” and last week condemned Ukraine’s “sabre-rattling” in the crisis with Russia, is not alone. His views on Russia are shared by other prominent Social Democrats, such as Matthias Platzeck, a former SPD chair who now heads the German-Russian Forum.“If you want diplomacy to succeed, you have to say [to Russia], yes, we recognise your security needs, your security concerns, and we will deal with them,” he told German TV earlier this month. “We haven’t done that for 30 years.”Such views are widespread in the SPD, and make it difficult for Scholz — who famously lost a contest for the party leadership in 2019 and is still distrusted by the SPD’s leftwing — to adopt a more confrontational approach to Russia.His task is also complicated by Social Democrats’ lingering nostalgia for Ostpolitik, the policy of rapprochement and engagement with the Soviet bloc pursued by chancellor Willy Brandt in the late 1960s and 70s. Some still firmly believe that it hastened the end of the cold war, rather than, say, Ronald Reagan’s arms race in the 1980s.The result is that Russia continues to play an outsize role in the German worldview. “Russia is more present as a factor in Germany than elsewhere — because of our history and culture, because of the role Mikhail Gorbachev played in German reunification, because of the deep economic ties between the two countries,” says Schmid.Yet even in Schmid’s SPD, sympathy for Russia has dwindled in recent years, amid growing dismay at its drift towards authoritarianism and its menacing stance towards its neighbours. “There is no longer a special relationship between Russia and Germany — the Russians destroyed it in 2014,” says the German official. “Russians have underestimated the shock the annexation of Crimea caused in Germany.”The shift in sentiment is obvious in the coalition agreement Scholz drafted with the Greens and liberals, which contains much tougher rhetoric on Russia than any negotiated by Merkel in her 16 years as chancellor, with sharp criticism of its record on Ukraine and on democratic rights.“The German discourse on Russia has changed a lot over the past 10-12 years — it’s become much more critical,” says Sabine Fischer of the SWP. She cites Germany’s 2020 decision to treat Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader, after he was poisoned by nerve agent — in what he claimed was an assassination attempt ordered by the Kremlin.“The poisoning of Navalny had huge resonance in German society”, says Fischer, “as has the whole crackdown on civil society in Russia.”Yet on the official level, the tone is still respectful, even deferential. It was epitomised by the short speech Baerbock made on her first trip to Moscow earlier this month, when she spoke of the “shame and awe” she felt while laying a wreath at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier close to the Kremlin. “Nothing can make up for the suffering and destruction that we Germans visited upon the peoples of the Soviet Union,” she said.Baerbock’s performance in Moscow was widely praised as sure-footed and confident, and she was given a cordial reception by her counterpart Sergei Lavrov. But observers say Russia’s respect for German sensitivities also seems to have dwindled since Merkel left power. One European diplomat in Moscow noted that Russia published its draft security proposals, which included ending Nato’s eastward expansion and denying Ukraine future membership of the alliance, just nine days after Merkel left office.“They’d never have dared do this when Merkel was in power,” the diplomat says. “She would never have stood for it. Now they don’t care any more.”

50  The UK’s devolved administrations have warned that Boris Johnson’s plans to cut £1bn-worth of red tape for business by removing legacy EU laws risk driving a “coach and horses” through the country’s constitutional settlement.Representatives of the Scottish and Welsh administrations expressed their concerns over the weekend in a telephone call with UK attorney-general Suella Braverman and other ministers, according to two people briefed on the exchanges.The prime minister is to unveil a Brexit freedoms bill on Monday that will make it easier to amend or remove EU laws that remained on the UK statute book after Brexit as a bridging measure to provide legal certainty to business and society.The government wants to repeal and replace outdated EU laws so that it can cut £1bn of red tape for UK businesses.Ministers will also on Monday publish a 100-page “Benefits of Brexit” policy document that will set out areas where the government believes deregulation after leaving the EU can help the country gain a competitive edge in areas such as gene editing and artificial intelligence.Johnson said the Brexit freedoms bill would “further unleash the benefits of Brexit”, helping to drive investment and job creation.Braverman said it was “vital” to create a mechanism to do away with EU laws that she claimed were created as a result of “unsatisfactory compromises” by the bloc’s member states and now had “no democratic legitimacy” in the UK.“Setting up a mechanism to deal with these legacy EU rules is essential,” she added. “It underpins our ability to grasp important opportunities provided by Brexit.” However, the Scottish and Welsh administrations fear the new legislation will hand powers to Westminster in areas such as fisheries as well as environmental, food and water standards, which have long been devolved to Edinburgh and Cardiff.Two people from the devolved administrations present on the call with Braverman said the attorney-general received a “bleaching” for failing to consult more fully over the plans.“Braverman was just reading from her screen, going on about ‘Brexit opportunities’ but when there were questions she only responded with platitudes,” said one of these people. “The whole meeting was called at the last minute, as if to say ‘This is what we’re going to do’.”Mick Antoniw, the Welsh minister for the constitution, said the UK government’s approach was driving a “coach and horses through the concept of mutual consent” on which the devolution settlement was designed to operate.“The government has been unable to provide assurances that its plans for future changes in dealing with ‘retained’ EU law would not affect the devolution settlement,” he added.Angus Robertson, the Scottish minister for the constitution, echoed those concerns, describing the Brexit freedoms bill as another move to erode the powers of the devolved administrations.“What this Brexit document is about is the next phase of a post-Brexit power grab,” he added. “They will argue it’s about the efficiency of the market and creating an effective level playing field, but it’s not really about that.”The UK government said details of the Brexit freedoms bill would be outlined “in due course”.“We continue to work closely with the devolved administrations to ensure that a common approach can be taken where powers and law have returned from the EU which intersect with policy areas that fall within devolved competence,” it added.
51  Almost 400,000 French leftwing supporters chose former minister Christiane Taubira as their candidate for the presidential election in April in an online “people’s primary” on Sunday, but the process was rejected by rival candidates and left the movement in disarray as it seeks to prevent Emmanuel Macron from winning a second term.The vote, in which participants graded the seven named candidates from “not good enough” to “very good”, gave Taubira a clear win, with 67 per cent of voters rating her at least “good”.Yannick Jadot of the Greens and Jean-Luc Mélenchon of the far-left La France Insoumise (France Unbowed) party came second and third, respectively, while Anne Hidalgo, the Paris mayor who is the Socialist party candidate, came fifth. However, all three have rejected the primary and vowed to continue their own campaigns.Taubira, a former justice minister in the Socialist government of François Hollande and an elected member of the National Assembly from the French territory of Guiana in South America for almost two decades, called for unity.“We want a united left, a strong left,” she told supporters in Paris. “We have a good road ahead of us.We don’t have the right to give up.”The French leftwing has fallen on hard times since Macron, previously Hollande’s economy minister, shook up the country’s politics with his “neither right nor left” campaign that won him the presidency in 2017.Recent opinion polls show Macron, who is expected to seek re-election but has yet to declare, in the lead with about 25 per cent of first-round voting intentions, followed by three candidates of the extreme-right and right: Marine Le Pen, Eric Zemmour and Valérie Pécresse.Several rivals on the left are also seeking the presidency, leading organisers of the primary to seek to consolidate support for a single candidate. In the polls, Mélenchon is the most popular on the left, with about 10 per cent of voting intentions, followed by Jadot and Hidalgo.Communist party leader Fabien Roussel is also standing, as are Nathalie Arthaud of the Workers’ Struggle party and Philippe Poutou of the New Anticapitalist party.Taubira, who won 2.3 per cent of the vote in the first round when she stood for president in 2002, said on Sunday she would call on her rivals on the left to rally round her even though she understood their reluctance.But Mélenchon has already called the primary a “farce” and others have said they will ignore it.The conservative Les Républicains party was also shaken by Macron’s 2017 victory, but a primary in December chose Pécresse as the sole candidate. Her defeated rivals, including Michel Barnier, the EU’s former Brexit negotiator, have given her their support and joined her campaign.*This article was amended after publication to reflect that Emmanuel Macron was economy minister in François Hollande’s government
52  Russian oligarchs with links to Vladimir Putin and UK investments will be hit by tough sanctions if Moscow invades Ukraine, British foreign secretary Liz Truss will tell the House of Commons on Monday.Truss on Sunday said she would set out legislation that would give Moscow notice of a “severe economic cost” for any incursion into Ukraine by strengthening Britain’s ability to target Russian assets in the UK.The announcement comes as UK prime minister Boris Johnson has responded to the Ukraine crisis by offering Nato a further 900 troops for deployment in Estonia, which would double the size of the British force in the Baltic state that borders Russia.Johnson, who is due to hold talks with the Russian president and visit eastern Europe this week, has also offered to dispatch fighter jets to Romania and Bulgaria and warships to the Black Sea.Under existing UK rules, which reflect EU arrangements when Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014, Britain is only able to impose sanctions on Russians linked to the destabilisation of Ukraine.Under Truss’s new legislation, the government would be able to sanction “any individual and business of economic or strategic significance to the Kremlin”, according to UK officials.“Currently, the economic sanctions are fairly narrowly drawn, so we could only target companies with a direct involvement in destabilising Ukraine,” Truss told Sky News.“What we are looking to do is widen that, so any company of interest to the Kremlin and the regime in Russia would be able to be targeted, so there will be nowhere to hide for Putin’s oligarchs, for Russian companies involved in propping up the Russian state.”Asked if the law would allow the seizure of UK property owned by Russian oligarchs, Truss replied: “Nothing is off the table.What the legislation enables us to do is hit a much wider variety of targets.”Pressed as to whether the proposed sanctions would carry an economic cost to the UK, Truss said that “defending freedom and democracy” was more important than “short-term economic interests”.Parliament’s intelligence and security committee said in 2020 that the City of London provided “ideal mechanisms” for the recycling of illicit finance, adding it had become a “laundromat” for offshore wealth.A 2018 report by the House of Commons foreign affairs committee entitled Moscow’s Gold concluded: “The use of London as a base for the corrupt assets of Kremlin-connected individuals is now clearly linked to a wider Russian strategy and has implications for our national security.”The National Crime Agency has estimated that money laundering costs the UK more than £100bn each year.But last week, it transpired that the government was not planning to include in the Queen’s Speech — which is due in May and sets out the programme of legislation — an economic crime bill designed to curtail abuse of shell companies and reveal the owners of offshore businesses that hold property in the UK.Steve Goodrich, head of research at campaign group Transparency International, said there was an estimated £1.5bn of UK property bought with suspect funds from Russia.He added: “If the UK government wants to show it’s serious about pursuing suspect Russian money entering the British economy they should include the economic crime bill in the Queen’s Speech. Failure to do so would give the impression that ministerial rhetoric is just hot air.”Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson, said Truss needed to go further and target hidden Russian-owned UK property assets.“It’s nearly six years since the UK government first backed the idea of a register exposing foreign property owners, which would help put an end to Kremlin-linked oligarchs laundering their dirty money in our country,” she added. “Over 2,000 days on, the Conservative government has failed to introduce a register.”Lord Francis Dannatt, the former chief of the general staff, told Times Radio that Johnson’s domestic crisis over government parties held during coronavirus lockdown had weakened his ability to deal with the Ukraine issue.“He will travel to wherever he’s going in eastern Europe this week, but everyone will know that he’s a man with a time bomb sitting under him,” he said.
53  The US Senate is nearing a deal on sanctions against Russia as the Pentagon warns that President Vladimir Putin is continuing to build up Russian forces at the border with Ukraine.A bill including economic measures to punish Russia in the event of a full-blown invasion was being finalised with a plan to move it forward this week, according to Bob Menendez, the Democratic chair of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and James Risch, his top Republican counterpart.“I believe that we will get there,” Menendez told CNN on Sunday. “We’ve been accommodating different views and we are committed, jointly, in a bipartisan way to defend Ukraine and to send Putin the message: it’ll be bloody and consequential.”Menendez said some sanctions could be ready to be implemented immediately in response to Russia’s efforts to undermine the Ukraine government and launch cyber attacks. Others would be imposed only if Russia were to conduct deeper incursions into Ukraine on top of its 2014 annexation of Crimea and its actions to foment a proxy war in far eastern regions, which continues to smoulder.Under discussion are economic countermeasures against the largest Russian banks and the country’s sovereign debt, among other penalties.The White House has publicly backed efforts in Congress to impose sanctions on Russian financial institutions including Sberbank, VTB, Gazprombank and the Russian Direct Investment Fund. As well as financial sanctions, export-control measures to deprive Russia of sensitive technologies are also under consideration, as are curbs on the country’s energy sector.Risch said some disagreements remained over sanctions against Russia’s gas pipeline across the Baltic Sea, the Nord Stream 2. “That’s going to be the last T crossed, I dotted, before we put the ball across the finish line.”The discussions come as the British foreign secretary Liz Truss is expected to say on Monday that Russian oligarchs with links to Vladimir Putin and UK investments will be hit by tough sanctions if Moscow invades Ukraine.Russia is estimated to have moved more than 100,000 troops to its borders with Ukraine, giving it “multiple options” including an attack aimed at occupying the entire country, according to the US.The Pentagon on Sunday warned that Putin was boosting troop levels at the border this weekend.“He can execute some of those options imminently,” John Kirby, press secretary, told Fox News Sunday. “Imminent means it could happen really, honestly, at any time. It depends on what Vladimir Putin might want to do.”Putin “could do something on a small scale, he could do something on a fairly large scale”, Kirby said. “And he continues to add troops to that border with Ukraine. We’re watching that even over the course of this weekend.”Leaders in Kyiv have criticised the hardening rhetoric, which one said played into Russia’s “psychological warfare”. In an interview on CBS on Sunday, Oksana Markarova, Ukraine’s ambassador to the US, cautioned against “panic”.Hanna Maliar, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, on Saturday refuted claims by US defence officials that Russia had shipped blood supplies close to its border with Ukraine, suggesting that an invasion was imminent.“Information is now being spread on the internet, citing anonymous sources, that Russia has allegedly sent blood supplies and other medical supplies for the wounded to the Ukrainian border,” Maliar said in a Facebook post.“This information is not true. Such ‘news’ is an element of information and psychological warfare. The purpose of such information is to spread panic and fear in our society,” she added.Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, on Friday warned that the escalating brinkmanship carried an economic cost.“We don’t need this panic,” he said at a press conference, where he disputed some of the Pentagon’s previous assessments. “How much does it cost to our country?”Zelensky urged western backers to help Kyiv plug financial gaps as war fears have cut it off from international debt markets.“We can’t handle this alone. We have to take money out [of our reserves] and stabilise our currency. It’s a very expensive price to pay,” Zelensky said, noting the country needed $4bn-$5bn.Despite these pleas, the US and its allies have prepared for conflict. The UK on Saturday said it was considering offering Nato a deployment of another 900 troops to Estonia — doubling the size of the British force in the Baltic state.US military planners are also readying a force of 8,500 to deploy to Nato countries in eastern Europe in order to protect the alliance’s flank. Other allies, including three Baltic countries, have been hurriedly arming the US-backed Ukrainian military.The chair of Russia’s security council, Nikolai Patrushev, on Sunday dismissed the idea that Russia was a threat to Ukraine.“We do not want war. We don’t need it at all. Those who are pushing towards it, especially those from the west, they are pursuing some self-serving false goals of their own,” the Interfax news agency cited Patrushev as saying.
54  But what are companies worldwide doing to fill labour gaps? Common responses include raising wages and increased investment in technology that allows staff to spend more time on fulfilling work. Japan was grappling with an ageing population and low birth rates before the pandemic. Its population is the oldest in the world, with 29 per cent aged 65 or older. There are shortages across sectors, with a particular pressure on nursing as the national workforce shrinks and more people need care. The health ministry said in July that nearly 690,000 additional nurses would be required by 2040 to meet rising demand. But nearly 60 per cent of nursing homes say there is already a shortage, according to a survey conducted by an industry advisory group.Sompo Holdings, an insurance group that entered Japan’s care sector in 2015, hopes digitisation will help. In 2020, it invested $500m in Palantir, a Colorado-based data analytics group, with the idea of maximising its technology to build a platform with data collected from Sompo’s more than 280 nursing homes across Japan. Ken Endo, president of Sompo Care, the nursing unit, believes the tech will reduce paperwork, allowing staff to spend more time caring for residents. In Japanese society, caring responsibility has traditionally fallen to families. This has led to low wages and a lack of a training system in the care sector, according to Endo, who is “surprised to see an industry so reluctant to train people”. Sompo has responded by establishing training centres and programmes. Combined with pay increases, this has helped attract and retain talent. Employee turnover, once more than 20 per cent, is now 11 per cent, with more university graduates joining the company every year. US sanitation group Waste Management has also turned to technology amid the country’s Great Resignation. About 4.5m US workers quit their jobs in November alone, the labour department reported earlier this month. That was the highest “quit rate” since it began tracking it in 2001. Data indicate the majority left their jobs after receiving better offers.Waste Management said it had begun deploying partially automated refuse lorries that do not require drivers to empty bins themselves. “We are no longer competing in just the waste industry for [truck] drivers,” says Tamla Oates-Forney, its chief people officer, noting that the company was having to compete for staff with the likes of Amazon and Walmart.US business leaders say they do not see labour pressures letting up in the near term, as the existing workforce ages, immigration stays low, and the millions of Americans who left the labour force during the pandemic show no signs of returning. Many workers’ newfound willingness to leave their jobs has been a hindrance for employers, who say high turnover makes it impossible to maintain consistent staffing levels. The effectiveness of the hiring bonuses and gimmicks such as offers of cars and cash that US employers relied on earlier in the pandemic have worn off, forcing companies to re-evaluate who could do their jobs. Communications consultancy Hotwire began recruiting account executives without tech experience for its US offices, despite that sector being the company’s core market. “We can’t take the same approach we used to,” says Heather Kernahan, its chief executive. Food processor JBS is trying to attract employees who are no longer interested in long-term warehouse work by offering educational and housing benefits while they work towards other careers. The company launched a programme that funds college educations for employees or their dependants, even if their studies lead them to a career outside JBS in as little as two years.“I think for a number of our hourly production workers, despite our best efforts, a job is just a job to them,” says Chris Gaddis, who leads human resources at JBS USA.The UK had a record 1.2m job vacancies in the three months to November 2021, and more than half of businesses who reported a worker shortage stated they were unable to meet demands. According to the Institute for Employment Studies, a think-tank, the UK labour market is at its tightest in at least 50 years. The pandemic has converged with the UK’s departure from the EU, intensifying shortages further. However, Russell Beck at Imagine Think Do, a people strategy consultancy, says the pandemic has “amplified a trend that was already playing out”.An analysis by the London School of Economics of how UK businesses are responding to shortages says about a third have raised wages, and about 20 per cent are investing in new technologies. Simon Roberts, chief executive of UK supermarket group J Sainsbury, says that as a result of “challenging operational moments over the past 18 months, we’ve had to be really agile and adaptable”.In addressing a shortage of HGV drivers, for example, he said the retailer had “made radical moves to make sure we had the capacity on the road to move products”. These efforts included higher salaries and offering retention payments. Sainsbury’s has also increased pay for employees across all Sainsbury’s and Argos stores. Other companies, such as Aldi, the supermarket, and Pret-a-Manger, the sandwich chain, have also raised wages. Shortages are also being met with pay rises in professional sectors such as banking and law. The law industry is also turning to temporary staff, following an M&A boom that has increased workload — deals worth more than $5.8tn were agreed worldwide in 2021, a 64 per cent year-on-year rise — and higher attrition rates because of factors such as exhaustion. However, Beck, who is also a speaker for Vistage, a leadership network, adds that raising pay is only a short-term fix as its effect swiftly wears off. “Money is a bit like lip-balm,” he says. “Our lips are chapped, they feel a bit sore, I need a bit of lip balm. But it wears off and so I need a bit more.” He adds that if someone resigns and an employer counter offers with a pay rise, “the stats all show something like 80 per cent of people still leave within six months”. Edward James, who owns three hair salons in south-west London, employs 75 people and is keen to focus on retaining staff. He is spending more on training and development. “It’s all very well paying people a higher salary,” he says, “but we need to upskill people.”After Brexit, he has seen a drop off in European applicants, adding that the industry is notoriously bad for “burning through staff” and that the number of hairdressing trainees has plummeted. He is also unable to sponsor staff from other countries because hairdressing in the UK is not considered “skilled” work, which contrasts with countries such as New Zealand and Australia, where hairstyling qualifications are a legal requirement.For now his salons are well staffed, and James says he makes sure he spends time at all three sites: “I know everyone who works for me,” he says. Salon trainees attend courses at local colleges, topped up with more in-house training due to the “huge difference” in the standards between colleges.Beck says that meeting the challenges of skills shortages “is going to be really tough” for small and medium-sized businesses.Eric Chevée, vice-president for France’s Confédération des Petites et Moyennes Entreprises (Confederation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises) agrees, saying that in France, two-thirds of SMEs are struggling to hire. The pandemic has worsened existing labour shortages in sectors across Europe such as IT, construction and healthcare. Hotels and restaurants in France lost about 237,000 employees between February 2020 and 2021, according the French labour ministry’s Directorate for Research, Studies and Statistics. Pay rises and other benefits are on offer to attract and keep hospitality workers. “It’s necessary to adapt the working hours, increase salaries and to make students want to join hotel schools,” says Julia Rousseau, founder of recruitment consultancy Ethique RH.Spending time away from work during lockdowns made many workers with unsociable hours start questioning their routines, Rousseau believes. She has helped many chefs and kitchen assistants to change their lives and among those who stay in the industry, many are drawn to “dark kitchens” where food is cooked for delivery only, with a predictable number of orders.In Paris, increasing numbers of high-end restaurants are closing on Saturdays and Sundays. Others are operating reduced hours or are using different teams for lunch and evening shifts.Michelin-starred chef Guy Savoy was already closing his eponymous restaurant for two and a half days a week before the pandemic, in order to allow his staff to rest, and believes this practice, plus the wages he offers and the strength of his brand, have helped him hold on to them. “It makes more sense to close an extra day and to keep the same team,” he says. But he acknowledges that not all businesses can afford this. A longer-term solution? “The education system needs to emphasise that manual occupations are as important as academic professions.” 
55  In the final weeks of his seven-year term as president, Sergio Mattarella made it clear he did not think it was appropriate to serve a second term as Italy’s head of state. Nor did he wish to do so.But as attempts by lawmakers to agree a successor turned toxic — threatening Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s fragile national unity government — parliamentarians compelled the reluctant 80-year-old Mattarella to stay on. He was propelled to a landslide victory on Saturday night — the eighth round of voting in a presidential selection process that began last Monday.“Duty to the nation must prevail over my own personal choices,” the president, visibly emotional, said afterwards.Italian social media is now buzzing with memes of the president, including one in which he is bound to his chair with a thick rope. Yet for all Mattarella’s personal ambivalence, his re-election has delighted Italians, especially the business community, as well as politicians and policymakers across Europe.His extension now offers Rome the prospect of continuity and stability, leaving Draghi — who was considered one of Mattarella’s most credible potential successors — free to push ahead with the policy overhauls required by Italy’s €200bn EU-funded reform and investment plan.“The parliament has taken the best possible decision — certainly, the one that was most wished by so many Italian citizens and businesses,” said Corrado Passera, chief executive of Illimity bank, and a former infrastructure minister. “The current government will be able to carry out all the reforms and measures that Italy has committed to.”Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group, the political risk consultancy, said: “Compared to all conceivable alternatives, it’s the best outcome that Europe and the markets could have hoped for.it does create a window of six or seven months where you can get a lot done.”The outcome will also allow Draghi to participate in critical Europe-wide conversations on EU reforms, including changes to the single market’s growth and stability pact, which sets fiscal rules for the eurozone. Draghi, a former European Central Bank chief appointed by Mattarella last year amid a deep economic and health crisis, “will be a very influential voice at the table in that discussion,” Rahman said.Italy’s presidential election came at a sensitive time, with Rome in the early stages of an ambitious reform plan to reboot its chronically underperforming economy. In the next six months, Italy must tackle contentious issues — including an overhaul of its public procurement policy and competition law — to receive the next tranche of EU funds.Draghi’s potential ascent to the presidency had raised anxiety in Italy’s business community, European capitals and in financial markets, with widespread concern that a less formidable successor as prime minister would struggle to push reforms through a fractious coalition government. Italian lawmakers themselves feared being propelled into early elections if they could not agree a replacement as premier.But while Mattarella’s re-election has prevented the government’s immediate implosion, analysts warn Draghi faces significant challenges trying to implement the next round of reforms.The presidential election laid bare the tensions within the national unity government between the right and left blocs, notably after League leader Matteo Salvini broke ranks to urge rightwing parties to back his preferred candidate.But it also revealed deep fissures within parties, as leaders, including Salvini, struggled to hold their factions together.“The road ahead is going to be uphill, not downhill,” said Daniele Albertazzi, a professor of politics at the UK’s University of Surrey. “I’ve never believed that just because you are Draghi you can do whatever you like. He is in the hands of political parties. They have political power, and they are themselves divided — the right against the left, factions against factions. All of this is going to create chaos.”But others said the internecine conflicts within political parties could strengthen Draghi’s hand, enhancing his capacity to push through compromise deals.His ultimate weapon, analysts say, would be a threat to resign and pull the plug on the national unity government, triggering early elections, if parties refuse to co-operate.“There is an opportunity for Draghi to further extend his control over the government and the ruling coalition and accelerate reforms,” said Wolfango Piccoli, the co-president of Teneo, the political risk consultancy. “He can try to exploit the total disarray that seems to prevail in the.coalition.”Former Italian treasury official Lorenzo Codogno, founder of London-based LC Macro Advisors, a consultancy, said: “A week of intense fighting, and the final result, will undoubtedly produce a showdown within parties and coalitions over the coming days and weeks.” “Parties appear weaker and divided,.which may facilitate Draghi’s job in finding compromise solutions on reforms,” Codogno added. “All in all, it was a narrow escape from a possible political disaster.” But analysts say Draghi’s hand will weaken as general elections, now scheduled for 2023, draw closer and parties enter full-time campaign mode, making the coming months critical.“The outlooks will be challenging from the summer,” said Rahman. “As we get closer to the election, the coalition will be much more unwieldy and difficult to manage.The window to get stuff done is very narrow.” 
56  US and European warnings that Russia is about to invade Ukraine may spur fear in the west but in China the spectre of war has triggered a different reaction.The Ukraine crisis “will be a historic opportunity for us to solve the Taiwan problem”, said a Chinese nationalist blogger known as Huashan Qiong Jian last week. The events were a huge drain on the energy of the US and had diverted Washington’s attention away from China, the commentator wrote. “War in Ukraine will be a historical window for the unification of the motherland which we must not miss.”Diplomats and longtime observers of Chinese policy dismiss the idea. But both the US and some of China’s neighbours worry that a war in Ukraine would make an already assertive Beijing even stronger.“If war happens, it will be a huge distraction for the US. For China, that would be an opportunity of the same magnitude as 2014,” said Alexander Gabuev, a China expert at the Carnegie Moscow Center think-tank, referring to the last Ukraine crisis when Russia backed a separatist movement in the country and annexed Crimea. That dispute ruptured Russia’s relations with the west and drove Moscow into China’s arms. Between 2013 and 2021, China’s share of Russia’s external trade doubled from 10 to 20 per cent.Analysts believe that if the US and Europe follow through on threats to impose sanctions on Russia if it invades Ukraine again, Moscow would become even more dependent on Beijing.Chinese chipmakers, which lost some business after the US ramped up export controls on cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing technology, could still supply Russia with chips from mainstream but advanced production capacity, Gabuev said. If European companies, such as telecoms groups Ericsson and Nokia, had to stop working with Russia for political reasons, Chinese rival Huawei would be the biggest beneficiary, he added.But the most significant questions looming over China’s potential role in a Ukraine conflict relate to its political and military partnership with Russia.Although the two countries insist that they are not in an alliance, military collaboration in some areas has reached a level that rivals that between traditional allies.“There is no ceiling on the development of our relationship, no limit,” said Zhao Mingwen, a former Chinese diplomat and Russia expert now at the China Institute of International Studies, the think-tank of the foreign ministry. “This gives our western friends a lot of room for imagination. You could say we are even more allies than allies.”Zhao added that Russia and China would support each other in conflicts that they viewed as provoked by external powers. “If China were forced to unify Taiwan by force and the US intervened, I believe Russia would not sit by idly,” he said.Russia was being forced into moving against Ukraine by the US and Europe who had “squeezed its strategic space too strongly”, Zhao added.Beijing has backed Russia with a statement reflecting that position. Russia’s “reasonable security concerns should be taken seriously and resolved”, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi told US secretary of state Antony Blinken last Thursday. Wang added that security in Europe could not be guaranteed by “strengthening or even expanding military blocs”, an apparent reference to Moscow’s demand for a guarantee that Nato not accept more members in eastern Europe.If Russia sought Chinese support in a Ukraine war, Beijing might be in a position to help.Alexander Korolev, an expert in the Russian-Chinese security relationship at the University of New South Wales, said ever more frequent and substantive joint exercises, collaboration on weapons development, regular consultations on military and security issues and long-running military personnel exchanges are enabling the two militaries to jointly operate in real wars.“They have introduced a joint command system, there are codes and signals that both Chinese and Russian forces can read, and intelligence is frequently exchanged between the two,” he said.The two militaries would probably help each other with space infrastructure needed for tracking enemy missiles and guiding their own command, communications and targeting systems, analysts said.“China is able to have ground-based radar stations in Russia and Russia in China, and that massively expands their footprint,” said Mark Hilborne, a defence expert at King’s College London.Moreover, the two countries are seeking to link Glonass and Beidou, their global navigation satellite systems, which would give Moscow and Beijing a larger number of satellites than the US with GPS.“Russia does not have large commercial operations for Glonass that the military could turn to as a back-up. So if its systems were overwhelmed or its satellites compromised in a conflict, it could get help from China,” Hilborne said.Many observers doubt it would come to that. Although China and Russia have pushed back against the US’s superpower status, they have been more cautious navigating regional or domestic issues.“Neither China nor Russia would make outrageously bold moves in areas where the other side has priority interests, and they do not back each other’s more controversial territorial claims either,” Korolev said. “That is what happened in the previous Ukraine crisis and during the 2008 Georgia war. China did not say much but continued business as usual.”Moscow and Beijing support each other most strongly when they share the goal of countering the US, he added.If China views the Ukraine crisis as part of that global struggle, it could exploit it to erode US power, although observers said Beijing would not attack Taiwan.A Ukrainian diplomat in Asia said he expected Beijing to step up efforts to undermine Japanese interests, for example by increasing the number of ships its coast guard uses to patrol waters around the disputed Senkaku Islands or Diaoyu Islands.Japanese experts are also concerned that China could launch more cyber attacks on soft targets in Japan.
57  It takes a special effort to make the politicians of Italy’s First Republic appear in a good light, but over the past week the politicians of the Second Republic have managed it.The process by which they re-elected Sergio Mattarella as president of Italy exposed a political class deeply at odds with itself, yet with a common selfish interest in its own survival. Mattarella’s re-election averts a short-term disaster — the collapse of Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s reformist government. But it leaves grave doubts over whether Italy’s professional politicians, manoeuvring for advantage ahead of next year’s parliamentary elections, are capable of summoning a higher sense of responsibility for the country as it stands at a critical juncture in its development.The First Republic is the informal term used to describe the political system that governed Italy from the aftermath of the second world war until the early 1990s, when it collapsed in a storm of bribery and other scandals. The Second Republic, which has staggered from crisis to crisis over the past 30 years, was supposed to represent a fresh start for politics.The events of the past week demonstrate, on the contrary, the woeful shortcomings of the Second Republic’s political parties — whether relatively old, like the hard-right League, or relatively new, like the once anti-establishment Five Star Movement. Increasingly, Italian democracy has come to rely for leadership and stability on the talents and maturity of non-political figures, such as Draghi, who are brought in to steady the ship because the elected politicians cannot do it themselves.Italy’s EU partners and financial markets will be relieved that, for the next 12 months or so, Draghi will be in a position to consolidate the reforms he has pursued since becoming prime minister a year ago. These reforms, drawing on the roughly €200bn available to Italy from the EU’s €750bn pandemic recovery fund, are a once-in-a-generation opportunity to boost growth, jobs and innovation in an economy that has languished in stagnation and high public debt since the 1990s.It may even turn out that Mattarella will serve only part of his second seven-year term, allowing Draghi a chance to move to the presidency and continue overseeing the reforms. However, such an outcome is far from guaranteed and would still leave open the question of how far any government formed after next year’s elections will have a sincere commitment to reform.It was remarkable to see the politicians applauding themselves on Saturday as, in the eighth round of voting in a week, they finally united behind Mattarella. For the earlier deadlock underscored the essential disunity of Draghi’s “national unity” government. Not for nothing did Enrico Letta, leader of the centre-left Democratic party, lament that the presidential election revealed “a political system that is blocked” and that “isn’t working”.Like Giorgio Napolitano, who agreed in 2013 to serve a second term as president only with the deepest reluctance, Mattarella did not seek re-election. But the political parties could find nobody in their own ranks with either the national stature or the cross-party appeal to replace Mattarella.In the end, they settled on a second term for the 80-year-old president only because they feared any other step might trigger the fall of Draghi’s government and early elections. For many of them, this carried the risk of fewer parliamentary seats and the loss of power, privileges and pensions.Amid these self-interested calculations, one party is charting a distinctive path — the far-right Brothers of Italy, led by Giorgia Meloni. It is the only major party that refused to join Draghi’s government, and opinion polls show that it is at present the most popular party on the rightwing side of the political spectrum. Italy may be scarcely a year away from deciding whether to install its first radical right prime minister of the postwar era.
58  This should be a propitious time to redesign the EU’s maligned fiscal rules. Much has changed in just the last few years. Above all, the desire for public and private investment — to accelerate the decarbonisation of the economy as well as its digitalisation — is widespread, both in Brussels and in national capitals.The pandemic has also reshuffled the old politics. The Rubicon of joint borrowing for cross-border transfers has been crossed. The obvious success of massive deficit spending in 2020 has reinforced the lesson Europe’s policymakers grudgingly started to draw after previous crises: that a rigid approach to budget discipline hurts rather than helps fiscal sustainability, economic growth and political cohesion.A changing of the guard in important countries creates an opportunity to look at old dossiers with new eyes. The new government in Berlin seems committed to investment-intensive growth both at home and in Europe. Similar openness can be detected in the Netherlands and elsewhere. Mario Draghi’s premiership in Italy has reduced north-south distrust. So has the implementation of the jointly funded national recovery plans, widely seen (so far) as successful, with the exception of countries bent on undermining the EU’s legal order.But nobody would want to bet on reaching a political agreement to significantly reform the fiscal rules, which stand to be reintroduced next year, after being relaxed at the beginning of the pandemic.Thus we live with a double paradox. EU countries are collectively pursuing vastly better economic policies than they have done in a long time. That is true in the short run — the pandemic’s hit to jobs, incomes and productivity has been much more minor and shortlived than we had reason to fear — and in their ambitions for the long run. Yet on both fronts such progress would be curtailed by the current fiscal framework — in particular its drastic requirement to reduce public debt burdens.Finance ministers are keenly aware of the risk of undermining the recovery by withdrawing fiscal support too soon — indeed they have jointly recommended a “moderate supportive fiscal stance” for the eurozone as a whole this year. And the commitment to investing in the green and digital transition, while ensuring it does not leave people behind, is strong. Yet rules cannot just be ignored in a union that is a body of law more than anything else.There are three ways out of this dilemma. One is to subject economic policy to the old rules, on the basis that legal ties underpinning the European project must take priority. But the previous crisis showed that if you try that, you sacrifice both economic performance and political cohesion.The next is to stretch the rules enough to permit the desired policies. As German chancellor Olaf Scholz likes to point out, the fiscal framework has proven its flexibility. Its suspension could be extended. The European Commission has a lot of interpretive power and could issue more lenient guidance as to how Brussels will judge national policies’ compliance with the rules, rewarding growth-friendly investment with fewer demands for belt-tightening.This comes with its own risks. National governments find it convenient to renounce any responsibility for EU-wide policy co-ordination; opposition parties would accuse them of giving in to Brussels. The divisive finger-pointing at other member states, which the pandemic somewhat tamed, could easily intensify again. Something like this is, though, the most likely outcome if governments cannot agree on the third option: to change the rules outright.The reason this is so difficult is that there has been little clear thinking about what the rules are supposed to achieve. The traditional economic arguments seem outdated: inflationary spillovers from excess spending have proven less of a risk than beggar-thy-neighbour austerity; interest rate pressures from national borrowing are nowhere to be seen; and there are now rescue funds to address refinancing crises.Similarly, the current rules do little to address the greatest economic challenges today, which, like it or not, call for a more activist state policy and arguably more public borrowing than when the rules were first drawn up. The best prospect for reform is for leaders first to agree on what the rules are for, and derive new ones from an understanding of what economic policies would achieve the broader sense of sustainability they are now committed to.France and Italy’s proposal to favour some types of investment has the merit of doing just that. It is incumbent on those who oppose it to do the same.
59  Hiring in the US is expected to have slowed in January, with some economists cautioning that the economy shed jobs as the fallout from the Omicron coronavirus wave became more widespread.The US economy is projected to have added 175,000 jobs at the start of the year, compared with 199,000 in December, the labour department is expected to say on Friday. The unemployment rate is forecast to hold steady at 3.9 per cent, according to Bloomberg estimates. Average hourly earnings are expected to rise 5.2 per cent from a year ago, compared with 4.7 per cent in December.However, economists are continuing to revise their estimates and some caution that there is a risk payrolls contracted in January as the highly transmissible Omicron variant hit leisure and hospitality, healthcare and other service-related industries.Economists at Jefferies note a “high probability” of a negative print, while those at Pantheon Macroeconomics have predicted the US will shed 300,000 jobs.“The jobs report won’t do much to alter the Federal Reserve’s bullish view on the labour market,” Lydia Boussour, senior US economist at Oxford Economics, said.The Fed is squarely focused on tamping down on rampant inflation and Fed chair Jay Powell this week said, “I think there’s quite a bit of room to raise interest rates without threatening the labour market.”“Fed officials see a very tight labour market and they are likely to look through the temporary weakness in job creation,” Boussour said. Mamta BadkarThe Bank of England is widely expected to raise interest rates for a second consecutive month at its meeting this week. That means investors are looking beyond an increase in borrowing costs to 0.5 per cent — which is broadly priced in by markets — to see whether this triggers the start of the process of winding down the central bank’s £875bn holdings of government debt purchased under its quantitative easing programmes.Back in August, when it laid out its strategy for tightening monetary policy in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the BoE signalled it would begin to shrink its balance sheet when rates reached half a per cent. It would do so by not stopping the reinvestment of the proceeds of bonds that it holds as they mature, “if appropriate given the economic circumstances”.With a dramatic surge in inflation since last summer, that moment looks poised to arrive sooner than investors, or the BoE itself, expected.If BoE rate-setters decide a rate rise is appropriate, they are likely to judge that starting to unwind QE is appropriate too, according to Nomura economist George Buckley.“With governor Bailey’s previously expressed desire to reduce the balance sheet, a move sooner rather than later seems reasonable,” Buckley said. That would mean the process of so-called “quantitative tightening” would begin in March, when a £28bn gilt held by the central bank falls due.There is still a chance, however, that the BoE gets “cold feet”, said Ruth Gregory of Capital Economics. It could also water down its previous guidance that it will “consider” actively selling bonds in its portfolio once rates reach 1 per cent, according to Gregory.“This would feel like a dovish development,” she said. Tommy StubbingtonMany economists expect no policy change from the European Central Bank at its first 2022 policy meeting on Thursday, despite the eurozone facing surging inflation.The time for a possible rate hike at the ECB “has not come, yet,” said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING.He pointed out that the Federal Reserve has moved closer to its first pandemic-era rate rise, but the US economy had already expanded well above what it produced when the health emergency struck.In contrast, the eurozone economy is expected to have just recovered to about pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter, when data is released on Monday.This week’s ECB meeting is unlikely to bring any policy changes, Brzeski noted. “Instead, the central bank will have to master a new communication challenge regarding inflation: avoiding any apparent shift from patience to panic,” added Brzeski.George Buckley, economist at Nomura, similarly expects no major changes to policy or guidance, and thinks that the ECB will be in a position to begin a slow normalisation of policy rates from June 2023. But “the risks are on the upside to our rate view,” warned Buckley.Eurozone inflation rose at an annual rate of 5 per cent in December, its highest since the creation of the euro and over double the ECB’s target of 2 per cent. The ECB expects the inflation peak to have passed during the fourth quarter.Ellie Henderson, economist at Investec, said that the release on Wednesday of a flash estimate for January’s harmonised indices of consumer prices “will give a first clue” of whether that forecast “is playing out.” Valentina Romei
60  Labros Bisalas remembers what it was like running a business in Greece during the depths of the country’s financial crisis.“In 2011, the Greek banks would finance us with 10 per cent interest rates while our German competitors would borrow with less than 2 per cent,” said Bisalas, chief executive of Sunlight Group, a company that specialises in energy storage systems and exports to more than 100 countries. “It was impossible to be competitive.”Athens wants to fix the problem that Sunlight and thousands of other businesses faced during the crisis and often still face — high borrowing costs. It wants to use €11.7bn of EU loans, part of the €750bn coronavirus recovery fund, to lower the cost of lending to Greek businesses and increase investment to levels comparable with other EU countries.The EU’s recovery fund is a central pillar of Brussels’ plans to boost economies after the coronavirus pandemic. For Greece, which suffered three bailouts and a series of austerity measures in the previous decade, it is an opportunity to make its economy more competitive. And policymakers are aware of the importance of devising a different approach to boost the flow of money to companies.“If we do not reduce the cost of lending, our economy will never be able to recover,” said Theodoros Skylakakis, alternate minister for fiscal policy responsible for the plan, which was endorsed by the EU last June.But some executives and opposition politicians question whether the scheme, which should start making loans by spring, will go far enough to expand lending.“This scheme might end up not making any difference to the economy,” said Efi Achtsioglou, head of economic policy for the leftwing Syriza, the main opposition party, pointing out that most Greek companies were too small to meet the criteria for investment.Under the scheme, Greece will receive loans from the EU’s recovery and resilience (RRF) facility at near-zero interest rates and pass the funds on to the banks. They will lend up to 50 per cent of a loan at these low rates and another 30 per cent under their usual funding terms, while up to 20 per cent would come from the project sponsor or borrower. By structuring project finance in this way, businesses will be able to borrow much more cheaply, at rates similar to those in other eurozone countries.“We are finally becoming competitive with this method,” said Skylakakis.Although the country’s economy is in much better shape after eight years of strict reform programmes, it is not at investment grade and has the highest sovereign debt levels and the highest percentage of non-performing loans in the eurozone. Greek banks still offer the most expensive loans in the bloc, increasing the cost of capital for business.By early next month, six Greek banks, as well as the European Investment Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, will receive the first tranche of the fund, worth €1.57bn, and start approving loans. The selection process will be carried out by the banks without any government interference. Independent auditors will monitor lending procedures.Syriza, which led the Greek government from 2015-19, has criticised the lack of state oversight on disbursing loans. “You can’t let banks take control of the procedure,” said Achtsioglou. She fears the scheme will be used to lend to corporations that already had access to liquidity.Fokion Karavias, chief executive of Greek lender Eurobank, acknowledged that the scheme was aimed mainly at larger companies that are regarded as solvent and profitable. Only 2.5 per cent of Greece’s estimated 900,000 businesses are classed as medium sized or big. Some successful smaller companies will qualify, but the vast majority of smaller companies are ineligible because they have overdue debts and do not post any profits.“It’s true that the money will go to medium and large-size corporations while the smaller ones will [find it] harder to participate,” he said, adding that Hellenic Development Bank and other EU programmes were tailored to small businesses.But Karavias said the scheme, which will favour projects focused on the green economy and digital innovation, would give many Greek businesses the impetus they need to grow. “The RRF funds give a push to businessmen to think big,” he added. “There is an investment momentum that we have not seen for many decades.”Sunlight plans to apply for an RRF loan. Although the company can now borrow at more competitive interest rates than in the crisis years, the scheme’s lower rates and longevity of the loans, which will span up to 12 years, will reduce the cost of funding further.“The RRF is a useful tool that will accelerate our investment plans,” said Bisalas. By mid-2023 Sunlight aims to have expanded its lithium battery assembly lines, doubled production in lead-acid technologies and raised output of its battery recycling unit by 70 per cent, he added.The EU-backed loan scheme is only part of the solution to a bigger puzzle for Greece — how to attract more foreign investment. In 2019 FDI was only 2.4 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product, compared with 7.8 per cent for neighbouring Albania and 8.3 per cent for Serbia.“RRF loans are the lighter but not the main fuel that will keep the Greek economy going,” said Nikos Vettas, general director of IOBE, an Athens-based economic think-tank. “The most important thing is to create greater infrastructure.”Sunlight’s plan envisaged adding 450 jobs, including 350 in Thrace, one of Greece’s poorest regions, Bisalas said. “The investments the RRF will hopefully fund will not only help Sunlight,” he added, “but will have a positive impact on the Greek economy”.
61  The Ukrainian crisis has removed any doubts in Germany and France about Britain’s commitment to European security after Brexit. But London’s activism has also been a mixed blessing for Berlin and Paris at a time when the two continental powers’ leadership is wavering in the face of military threats from Vladimir Putin.The so-called E3 group of countries, which have a history of diplomatic co-operation, have sought to co-ordinate their positions as more than 100,000 Russian troops mass on Ukraine’s border. Officially, western unity is the keyword. Privately Germany and France are watching with unease as the UK reclaims its position as the US’s most enthusiastic ally.While Berlin and Paris have been circumspect about Putin’s endgame and would prefer more discreet diplomacy, London has embraced Washington’s assessment about an imminent threat of invasion, is sending anti-tank weapons to Ukraine and has leaked details of an alleged Russian-led coup plot in Kyiv.The UK’s desire to co-operate at EU level is seen as positive, says Jana Puglierin, head of the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. But the crisis in Ukraine might reopen splits that emerged during the Iraq war between a “Carolingian west” centred on Paris and Berlin and an “Anglo-American camp”, she notes. “They insist on co-ordination,” Puglierin says, “and it is true, there has been a lot of co-ordination efforts, and more or less unity holds, but underneath there are a lot of potential risks.”Paris remains bitter at the role London played in the sealing of the so-called Aukus deal with the US and Australia, which led to the cancellation of a $36bn French-led submarine contract in September. And according to Michel Duclos, a former diplomat and special adviser at the Institut Montaigne, it believes the current British approach might be “adding fuel to the fire”. Paris suspects that “in tune with their natural instincts, they are looking to form a club of hardliners with the Poles, the Baltics and the Dutch to hinder the Franco-German axis,” Duclos says.In Berlin, Olaf Scholz, Germany’s new Social Democrat chancellor, would rather buy more time and seize “every channel that exists” than confront his own party’s divisions over how to respond to a Russian invasion of Ukraine, says Joseph de Weck, fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. “The crisis has been a blow to German leadership in Europe,” he says.“All of a sudden Germany is looking at the conflict from the sidelines,” Puglierin adds.That is why it is so important for Paris and Berlin to revive talks with the Ukrainians and Russians over the fate of Ukraine’s war-ravaged eastern region of Donbas. After a meeting in Paris on Wednesday, a French official insisted they had “obtained the signal of re-engagement that we are looking for” and that more talks were planned. However, Russia may be testing French and German resolve, Puglierin warns.The problem for Paris and Berlin is that their credibility as leaders of those talks has dwindled. Germany’s standing is low in the Baltics and eastern Europe, where there is resentment at Berlin’s inability to facilitate the sale of arms to Kyiv and its reluctance to countenance sanctions on Nord Stream 2, the pipeline designed to supply more Russian gas to Germany via the Baltic Sea.Meanwhile, French president Emmanuel Macron is struggling to overcome “fundamental mistrust”, Puglierin says, after initiating an uncoordinated rapprochement with Putin and asserting that Nato was “brain-dead” in 2019.In this context, an active UK on the fringes of the EU is a threat to Macron’s ambition to form a coherent European defence policy. Beyond a “certain relief” at seeing the UK back playing a role in foreign and security policy in Europe, de Weck says, “the downside is that there is now another security player in Europe that is outside the EU”. He adds: “It’s decreasing France’s leverage to convince the eastern Europeans to adopt a common EU defence stance.”Consequently, the Ukraine crisis will be a significant test for the EU’s foreign policy ambitions. “It’s Global Britain in action, showing agility in contrast with what the EU can do,” says Alice Billon-Galland, Research Fellow at Chatham House in London. “It’s complicated to make the EU the go-to security forum for the current crisis when the most active European country sits outside the EU.”Letter in response to this article:Britain must act on Russian oligarch money / From Joaquin Monfort, Valencia, Spain
62  With its unassuming but crucial role in the global financial system, international payments network Swift has featured prominently in discussions over possible sanctions on Russia were it to invade Ukraine.The Belgian not-for-profit co-operative provides secure messaging services for trillions of dollars worth of payments between banks. It has repeatedly found itself in the spotlight during international crises — notably the tensions over Iran’s nuclear programme, when in 2012 and again in 2018 it was pushed to block Iranian banks targeted by sanctions from its services.Western allies are now discussing whether Swift — the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication — should be pressed to sever Russian banks’ access to its networks if Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, orders an attack on Ukraine. But many officials and experts argue that such a move would not be the most effective way to put pressure on Moscow.Swift operates a messaging system for banks around the world, transmitting payment requests and keeping a record of them on servers in Europe and the US. Owned by more than 2,000 banks and financial institutions, it handles 42m such messages a day.Although other cross-border payments services exist, Swift plays an outsize role. The cutting off from Swift of some Iranian banks in 2012 was one of the factors behind a sharp drop in Iran’s oil exports, which fell from more than 3m barrels a day in 2011 to about 1m b/d a few years later.US politicians called for Russia to be cut off from Swift after Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, although the idea never came to fruition. Alexei Kudrin, Russia’s former finance minister, warned at the time that such a move could cause its gross domestic product to contract by up to 5 per cent.Russia, which accounted for 1.5 per cent of total transactions on Swift in 2020, has itself developed an alternative messaging system called SPFS which handles about a fifth of domestic payments, but this remains less capable and more limited in scope than Swift.Swift has been part of the discussion between western allies over sanctions in response to the build-up of Russian troops on Ukraine’s border.The EU, Britain and US have agreed on the use of financial sanctions, as part of a baseline package that can be upgraded or downgraded depending on the scale of any Russian attack on Ukraine. European officials have stressed that “everything is on the table”, but exclusion from Swift is not seen as the most likely sanction in the baseline package.Swift said it was “neutral” and that “any decision to impose sanctions on countries or individual entities rests solely with the competent government bodies and applicable legislators”.Gottfried Leibbrandt, former Swift chief executive, told a Financial Times forum last year that although the system was technically independent, more than 40 per cent of its payment flows were in US dollars and so Washington had effective sanction power over it.A more likely route is targeted sanctions on Russian banks and their ability to convert roubles into hard currency. The EU is also co-ordinating with third countries such as Switzerland to ensure that sanctions do not just result in Russian financial transactions being diverted elsewhere.Some experts argue that Swift gets more attention than it deserves when it comes to sanctions. Cutting Russian banks from Swift would give them a “significant operational problem” but would not itself prevent them from dealing with US or European counterparts, said Nicolas Véron of the Bruegel think-tank.Directly targeting significant Russian lenders would potentially have a greater impact on Russia than cutting them off from Swift. If big banks such as Sberbank or VTB were blacklisted by the US, they would effectively be cut off from the global financial system. Banks elsewhere would be forced to shun them or risk falling foul of the US authorities.Edward Fishman, an adjunct fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a think-tank, said any banks targeted would experience “significant liquidity issues” and a “dramatic loss of confidence”, meaning that they might need to be bailed out by the Kremlin. By contrast, just cutting the banks from Swift would be a “headache” rather than an existential threat, he said.Sanctions aimed at Russian banks and at degrading exports by Russia’s oil sector would be the most effective tools, he said.Dmitry Dolgin, chief economist for Russia at Dutch bank ING, said “being cut off from Swift does not mean a ban on cross-border transactions”. Instead, he believed the potential for the US to impose heavy sanctions on any of the three biggest Russian state-owned banks — Sberbank, VTB and Gazprombank — would be “the most severe scenario” because of their key role in handling foreign exchange flows.He added that smaller banks could survive US sanctions, as Bank Rossiya did in 2014 because of support from Moscow, which made it the primary lender for the annexed Crimea and for Russia’s wholesale electricity market.It would be more difficult. Russian politicians have warned that without payment, the flow of gas — on which Europe depends for 40 per cent of supplies — and oil would quickly stop. This would come at a time when Europe is experiencing record gas prices and supply shortages, and with oil above $90 a barrel for the first time since 2014.“If Russia is disconnected from Swift, then we will not receive [foreign] currency, but buyers.will not receive our goods — oil, gas, metals,” said Nikolay Zhuravlev, vice-speaker of the upper house of the Russian parliament.A senior European banker said a possible alternative would be for Europe to pay for Russian gas by putting euros into an escrow account at a European bank on behalf of Russian suppliers, to be accessed once sanctions were lifted. This was unlikely, however, given the sums involved and the risks for suppliers.Daniel Tannebaum, a former official with the US Office of Foreign Assets Control, which administers sanctions, and head of sanctions at management consultant Oliver Wyman, said the fear of disrupting gas exports, in particular, would probably force the US and EU to proceed cautiously. Cutting Russian banks from Swift “would be like using a bazooka when perhaps a rifle could be almost as effective”, he said.“It’s arguably better to designate a handful of specific Russian financial institutions in a manner that essentially cuts them off from the global economy,” he added. “You leave a number of smaller institutions to allow financing for commerce that has not been banned, likely to include energy exports, thus limiting any potential collateral economic damage.”
63  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
64  Boris Johnson is considering offering Nato a deployment of another 900 troops to Estonia — doubling the size of the British force in the Baltic state — as tension continues to rise in the region.Downing Street announced that the UK prime minister was considering the “biggest possible offer” in order to protect Nato allies in eastern Europe.Estonia is a member of Nato — the West’s mutual defence pact — in contrast to Ukraine, which has been partially encircled by Russian tanks and about 100,000 soldiers in recent weeks, prompting speculation about an invasion by Moscow.Downing Street said that Britain could send jets, warships and military specialists to Nato allies in the region in the coming days to strengthen Europe’s borders “in the face of rising Russian aggression”.British officials will be sent to Brussels to discuss the potential offer with Nato next week, with ministers discussing military options on Monday.One European official described the idea of western countries increasing their forces in eastern Europe as a “purely defensive” mechanism to reassure Nato allies, rather than a direct threat to Putin’s Russia. “These are not substantial combat forces, they don’t compare with the current build up by Russia.”French president Emmanuel Macron has already offered to send hundreds of troops to Romania if Nato requests them, as part of the alliance’s “enhanced forward presence” programme to protect its eastern European members.“I know the security situation is worrying at present on Europe’s eastern flank,” French defence minister Florence Parly said in Bucharest on Thursday when she repeated Macron’s offer. A French military mission arrived in Romania on the same day to prepare for the possible deployment.France and other Nato members have also been increasing their presence in the Black Sea in recent months. “We see a policy of access denial by Russia,” said one French diplomat. “They are using Crimea as a kind of permanent aircraft carrier.” Johnson is also seeking talks with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, in the coming days. The prime minister, who is at the centre of a domestic political storm over “partygate”, is expected to make a visit to eastern Europe next week.A second trip is being planned for early February for Johnson to meet Nato member counterparts, although the location is not yet confirmed.On Monday, the UK’s Foreign Office is expected to announce a toughening of its sanctions regime — to enable the UK to target Russian interests — although officials have not yet disclosed the details.Johnson said the potential deployment of more troops to Estonia would send a “clear message” to the Kremlin.“We will not tolerate their destabilising activity and we will always stand with our Nato allies in the face of Russian hostility,” he said.“If President Putin chooses a path of bloodshed and destruction, it will be a tragedy for Europe. Ukraine must be free to choose its own future.”Downing Street said Johnson still believed in the importance of pursuing diplomatic efforts at the same time.The prime minister has asked foreign secretary Liz Truss and defence secretary Ben Wallace to prepare to visit Moscow for talks with their counterparts. “They will be asked to improve relationships with President Putin’s government and encourage de-escalation,” Downing Street said. Wallace will also hold meetings with allies in Hungary, Slovenia and Croatia in the coming week.Sir Tony Radakin, the chief of defence staff, will brief ministers at cabinet on Tuesday about the situation in Ukraine.The current British presence in eastern Europe includes 900 military personnel in Estonia, 100 in Ukraine and 150 in Poland.Downing Street said the aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales was on standby to move “within hours” if necessary.Talks on the Ukraine situation will take place at the UN Security Council in New York on Monday.
65  Italian lawmakers have re-elected incumbent president Sergio Mattarella as head of state, ending a week-long stalemate over the selection and ensuring the survival of Mario Draghi’s government.Mattarella’s re-election, in the eighth round of voting since Monday, came as Draghi’s fragile national unity government appeared in growing danger of collapse, amid tension over the increasingly bitter presidential election.After Mattarella’s re-election, Draghi called the result “splendid news for Italians.” He added that he was grateful to the president for “his decision to go along with the very strong will of the parliament to re-elect him for a second term”.A visibly emotional Mattarella declared that “duty to the nation must prevail over my own personal choices”.A lawyer and former judge, Mattarella, 80, had previously indicated that he was unwilling to serve a second term. But with Rome’s political climate turning poisonous, Draghi, appointed by Mattarella last year amid a deep economic and health crisis, met the president at an official function on Saturday morning and urged him to reconsider in the interests of political stability.Draghi later called political leaders to encourage them to support Mattarella, an Italian government official told the Financial Times. Politicians from across the spectrum visited the lavish presidential palace Saturday afternoon to formally appeal to Mattarella to serve a second seven year term.In the Saturday afternoon balloting, Mattarella won the vote of 759 of the 1009 presidential electors — who are members of parliament and regional representatives. When the count crossed the 505 vote threshold needed for victory, the electors rose to their feet and burst into a long round of applause.“The absolute priority is to secure the country, providing stability through the figure of Mattarella at the Quirinale and Draghi as prime minister, and avoiding at all costs plunging into a period of total chaos,” Daniela Sbrollini, a senator from centrist Italia Viva, told the FT shortly before the vote.“Asking Mattarella to remain at the Quirinale after he had expressly asked not to be elected shows a certain fragility and weakness of politics,” she said. “But with this stability perhaps the political system can be strengthened.”A lawmaker from the Five Star movement, who asked not to be named, said: “Everyone across the political spectrum knew very well that Mattarella’s re-election was the only solution that would not hurt anyone, not even Draghi. It is the only solution that crystallises the current equilibrium.”Mattarella’s re-election will please Italy’s business community and international markets, which had been keeping a close eye on events, fearing that a messy, divisive presidential election could derail the country’s reform momentum.Italy is set to be the largest recipient of funds from the EU’s €750bn recovery programme, but must meet an ambitious reform timetable to get each tranche of funds. The programme’s toughest reforms were front-loaded into the two years that it was assumed Draghi would be prime minister.Draghi himself was considered a suitable potential successor to Mattarella, but it was feared that his ascent to the presidency could trigger the collapse of the government and propel Italy to early elections.“This looks like a great outcome for businesses because it ensures stability and we can count on Draghi to see through the recovery plan,” said one Milan-based executive who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of the eighth round of voting.“Clearly it’s a very bad outcome for Italian political leaders who were not able to find an alternative to Draghi as prime minister, and Mattarella as president.”Former Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni, who now serves as the EU’s commissioner for the economy, tweeted that Mattarella’s re-election was “a very good stability and responsibility.” He added in Latin “per aspera ad astra,” or ‘through hardship to the stars.”Alessandro Zan, a member of the centre left Democratic Party, said that, “in a situation that risked spiralling out of control, the appeal to President Mattarella was the last card to pull Italy out of the chaos and get back to work.”Italian lawmakers agreed to file blank ballots in the initial voting rounds this week as they attempted to forge a consensus on a presidential candidate. But the political atmosphere soured on Friday, as Matteo Salvini, leader of the rightwing League, began pushing to elect favoured political nominees as president over the objections of leftist coalition partners.Enrico Letta, secretary-general of the Democratic Party, had warned that any unilateral nominations, over the objections of government allies, would “represent the most direct way of blowing everything up”.
66  Ukraine has played down Pentagon warnings that Russia has amassed sufficient military assets along the Ukrainian border to launch an invasion, with the deputy defence minister branding reports that blood supplies had been moved close to the border “psychological warfare.”A US defence official late on Friday told the Financial Times that Russia had moved blood close to its border with Ukraine, in a move that US military experts previously said would be a sign that Putin was moving closer to an invasion. Russia needs blood supplies to treat troops who suffer casualties. The move was first reported by Reuters.Hanna Maliar, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, rejected the US intelligence. “Information is now being spread on the internet, citing anonymous sources, that Russia has allegedly sent blood supplies and other medical supplies for the wounded to the Ukrainian border,” she wrote in a Facebook post.“This information is not true. Such ‘news’ is an element of information and psychological warfare. The purpose of such information is to spread panic and fear in our society.” The Pentagon on Friday warned Russia has amassed sufficient military assets along the Ukrainian border to launch an invasion at any moment, a build-up that has given the Kremlin “multiple options”, including an attack aimed at occupying the entire country.The assessment, made by US defence secretary Lloyd Austin came as Russian president Vladimir Putin said Washington’s response to the Kremlin’s security demands was inadequate, raising new questions over whether the diplomatic channel to resolving the stand-off had closed.Taken together, the warnings from Washington and Moscow appeared to put both Nato and the Russian military closer to a war footing. Although the US and the Atlantic alliance have said they will not commit troops to Ukrainian soil if Russia attacks, some allies have been hurriedly arming the US-backed Ukrainian military.The hardening rhetoric has alarmed leaders in Kyiv, who expressed concern that the escalating brinkmanship could tip Europe into an all-out conflict. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, on Friday urged the US and other western backers to tone down their sabre-rattling.“We do understand what the risks are,” Zelensky said at a press conference, where he disputed some of the Pentagon’s assessment, saying that “we do not see a bigger escalation” than last spring when Russia’s military build-up started. “We don’t need this panic,” he added.Despite Zelensky’s pleas, the US and the west continued to brace for war. American military planners are readying a force of 8,500 to deploy to Nato countries in eastern Europe in order to protect the alliance’s flank. General Mark Milley, the chair of the US joint chiefs of staff, noted that four Nato members bordered Ukraine and that treaty commitments meant Washington was obliged to defend them.“I’ll be moving troops to eastern Europe and the Nato countries in the near term,” President Joe Biden said later on Friday. “Not a lot.”Austin said that although Putin had amassed sufficient forces to mount an invasion, the US believed Russia’s president had not yet “made a final decision to use these forces against Ukraine”.Still, the build-up has reached a point where “there are multiple options available to him, including the seizure of cities and significant territories”, Austin added.At a Pentagon news conference, Milley agreed with the assessment. “With 100,000 troops — you’ve got combined arms formations, ground manoeuvre, artillery, rockets, you’ve got air and all the other piece parts that go with it. There’s a potential that they could launch with very, very little warning,” he said.The US officials said the path to a diplomatic resolution remained open and urged Putin to stand down. But in a call with French President Emmanuel Macron, Putin said the US’s written response to Russia’s security demands, transmitted to Moscow earlier this week, had not addressed his biggest concern: Nato’s expansion towards Russia’s frontier.“Attention was drawn to the fact that US and Nato answers did not take into account such fundamental Russian concerns as the prevention of Nato enlargement,” the Kremlin said in a statement, summarising Putin’s comments to Macron.In Paris, however, a senior French official said Putin told Macron “he was not looking for confrontation”.With diplomacy at a standstill, the US and its allies continued to steel themselves for the economic fallout of a Russian invasion. The US and the EU pledged to work together to safeguard European energy supplies should an attack result in a collapse in gas shipments to the continent.In addition, the Biden administration has been meeting US banks to warn them of possible financial blowback from the large-scale economic sanctions Washington has vowed to trigger in the event of an invasion.“As we’ve made clear, in addition to the significant economic and diplomatic costs Russia will incur, a move on Ukraine will accomplish the very thing Russia says it does not want — a Nato alliance strengthened and resolved,” Austin said.The UK’s Foreign Office is expected to announce a toughening of its sanctions on Monday in a bid to target Russian strategic and financial interests. Prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to visit eastern Europe and speak to Putin “in the coming days,” officials said.The US has been in talks with gas producers such as Qatar to help supplement any European shortfall, and in a joint statement Biden and Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said they were “collaborating with governments and market operators” to ensure emergency supplies.As part of that effort, the EU is preparing to send a delegation to Azerbaijan. Russia provides 40 per cent of the EU’s gas and officials worry Moscow could hit back against western sanctions by reducing pipeline flows.Brussels is also in talks with some Asian countries on possible LNG swap deals, a commission official said. “What we are doing is to reach out as much as possible to any of the suppliers,” they added.Kadri Simson, the EU’s energy commissioner, will fly to Azerbaijan early next month for talks with the country’s energy and natural resources ministers, in an attempt to drum up support for additional gas flows to Europe, an EU official said.Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency, this month said Moscow was already throttling gas supplies to Europe, pointing out Russian gas exports to Europe were down 25 per cent year on year in the last three months of 2021.The IEA believes Russia is holding back at least one-third of the gas it could send to Europe.
67  Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has sacked the head of the national statistical institute after reports of tension between them over the country’s inflation data.A decree published in the country’s official gazette early on Saturday morning announced the removal of Sait Erdal Dincer, after the official rate of inflation reached a 19-year high of 36 per cent in December. He had served just 10 months in the role.He was replaced by Erhan Cetinkaya, who was previously a vice-chair of the country’s banking regulator.Erdogan, a life-long opponent of high interest rates, rejects the economic orthodoxy that raising interest rates helps to curb inflation, arguing that low rates will usher in price stability.He ordered the central bank to cut interest rates four times in the final months of last year and the Turkish lira plummeted in value.The removal of Dincer comes after weeks of speculation in the Turkish media about friction between him and Erdogan over the rising official inflation rate.At the same time, TurkStat has come under heavy pressure from opposition parties, who have accused it of manipulating the data to show inflation at an artificially low rate.Dincer rejected that claim earlier this month. “With the inflation data, I have a responsibility to 84m people,” he told the Turkish business newspaper Dunya. “If I sign off on an error, I will do an injustice to 84m people. As you know, millions of workers get a pay rise on the basis of the inflation that we announce. To tamper with those people’s incomes, to deprive them of their rights.I would not do that.” The agency is due to announce January’s inflation rate on February 3.Nureddin Nebati, the country’s finance minister, reportedly told a meeting of economists in Istanbul last weekend that he expected inflation to peak at 40 per cent in the months ahead.Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, forecasts annual consumer price inflation will have reached 48 per cent in January.Erdogan also accepted the resignation of his justice minister, Abdulhamit Gul, according to the official gazette. He replaced him with Bekir Bozdag, who has served two previous stints in the role.
68  Western banks are accustomed to political turbulence in Russia. Société Générale, which first set up in the country 150 years ago, was forced to take a 56-year hiatus after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917.Since its return, the French lender has navigated the end of communism, Russia’s 1998 sovereign default and the annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014.Now, with Russian troops massing on the Ukrainian border, SocGen was one of the banks put on notice this month by the European Central Bank. The Financial Times revealed this week that the ECB had warned lenders with Russian exposure to prepare themselves for the imposition of international sanctions against the country in the event Ukraine is invaded.Along with SocGen, Austria’s Raiffeisen Bank and UniCredit of Italy are among the European banks with the most substantial operations. The trio together account for 3.7 per cent of assets in the Russian banking system, according to data compiled by JPMorgan.Their presence is in contrast to some of the biggest Wall Street banks, including JPMorgan and Bank of America, which substantially reduced their exposure to Russia following the invasion of Crimea.As a result, the Kremlin has pursued a “Fortress Russia” strategy to make it less reliant on foreign financing. Corporate loans from foreign lenders slumped from $150bn in March 2014 to $80bn last year, according to the Russian central bank.However, cross-border ties remain significant. Data from the Bank for International Settlements show that international banks, including their Russian subsidiaries, are owed $121bn by Russian entities. Lenders in Italy, France and Austria have the most claims respectively.For the lenders that have remained, including Hungary’s OTP Bank, the Russian market still has its attractions. Margins on retail banking are appealing, while lucrative trading, financing and advisory fees can be made, particular from the country’s energy and natural resources sector.Indeed, UniCredit chief executive Andrea Orcel said on Friday that the Italian lender had been examining an acquisition of government-owned Russian lender Otkritie before political tensions over Ukraine escalated.UniCredit, Italy’s second-largest bank, entered the Russian market in 2005 through a deal to buy Bank Austria, which already had a Moscow-headquartered subsidiary.Among the information requested by the ECB, was how banks were analysing their Russian exposure and the contingency plans they were readying in the event of sanctions.Several European banks with operations in Russia said they had been engaging in preparations before the warning from the ECB.“We don’t need regulators to ask us about how we go about managing risk for us to take action,” the chief executive of one European bank told the FT.“If you follow the news, clearly you will be looking at your exposures. Whenever there is geopolitical tension and economic uncertainty, you constantly review your portfolio.”One executive at a European bank with a large Russian subsidiary said it had stepped up its preparations in the past three weeks, significantly increasing its liquidity levels in expectation of anxious customers withdrawing money. It had also tripled the currency hedging on its Russian exposure, they said.After being badly hit in 2014 when Russia faced penalties over Crimea, the bank had inserted clauses in all its lending agreements in the country so that any clients hit by sanctions would no longer be able to draw additional credit and would have to repay existing loans, the executive said. The bank had also made provisions for potential losses from any sanctions and could hold back further reserves.Other banks contacted by the FT said they were in “wait-and-see mode” as efforts to resolve the tensions through diplomacy continue.One US bank that has persevered with Russia is Citigroup, which had $5.5bn in loans, investment securities and other assets tied to Russia at the end of the third quarter of 2021, according to the bank’s most recent 10-Q filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission. That accounted for 0.3 per cent of its total assets.Last April, Jane Fraser, Citigroup chief executive, said that the bank was putting its retail operations in Russia up for sale, along with those in a dozen other countries. Citi declined to comment.Although SocGen said it made its first investment in a Russian company in 1872, the bank’s €2.6bn exposure to the country is now mostly through its Rosbank subsidiary. It bought 20 per cent of Rosbank in 2006, taking majority control two years later during the financial crisis.The business accounts for 3 per cent of SocGen’s group revenues and 4 per cent of its pre-tax profit, according to JPMorgan estimates.“Given SocGen’s exposure to Russia, this has potential to cause higher volatility than the sector on geopolitical developments in the region,” said Azzurra Guelfi, an analyst at Citi.SocGen played down the risk of its Russian exposure, saying that “Rosbank is operating business in a normal mode within the existing oversight framework”, that “it has mainly local activities” and that the bank is “confident in our ability to ensure the activity for our clients”.In addition to investment banking services provided at SocGen’s group level, Rosbank operates domestic insurance, car rental, leasing, factoring and receivables arms.While Raiffeisen has a similar direct exposure to Russia as SocGen, the importance of the country to the Austrian bank’s overall profits is significantly higher. Its Russian operations accounted for 19 per cent of revenues and 35 per cent of the group’s pre-tax profits last year.Under a worst-case sanctions scenario modelled by analysts at JPMorgan, Raiffeisen would be hit hardest with a 99 basis point fall in its common equity tier one capital, a measure of its financial strength. SocGen would be the second-worst affected foreign bank at 33bp, according to the estimate.Vienna’s lenders have long had a leading role in banking in central and eastern Europe, acting as a conduit between Russia and the West.But Raiffeisen only directly entered the Russian market in 2006 with the takeover of Impexbank. The deal was part of Raiffeisen’s wide-ranging expansion in central and eastern Europe over the past three decades.Over the past year, it has been focusing its Russian and Ukrainian subsidiaries on the largest cities, closing branches in rural and less profitable areas.Raiffeisen declined to comment.
69  Brussels wants powers to intervene during future semiconductor supply crunches as part of a broad package of measures aimed at building up Europe’s domestic industrial capacity, the EU’s internal market commissioner said.Thierry Breton said that as part of the EU’s planned Chips Act the commission is discussing tools to respond to shortages and “shore up our security of supply” in the industry. He pointed to US emergency powers to prioritise domestic industrial needs contained in America’s Defense Production Act as a possible model.This would come alongside a public spending blitz on semiconductors by member states and the EU that will be “commensurate” with the US’s $52bn planned investment in its own semiconductor sector, Breton said in Brussels.Among the measures will be public investments in new semiconductor “pilot lines” in Europe, which will allow companies to turn new technologies into scale production.The plans are part of an EU goal to double its share of the global chip market to 20 per cent by 2030. The project is being championed by Brussels as part of its broader “strategic autonomy” agenda as the block seeks to reduce its vulnerability to supply chain disruptions.Breton, France’s commissioner, argued that the supply shortages plaguing the semiconductor industry, coupled with the growing needs for computing power as the EU plans its digital and green transitions, underscored the need for action.He described the upcoming Chips Act, which the commission is planning to unveil next month, as “a major initiative for our industry, our economy and our geostrategic interest”, warning that the leading-edge semiconductor sector was characterised by “huge overconcentration” in Asia.However, the scale of the public money that the EU plans to plough into semiconductors has triggered fears of a wasteful subsidy race.Some industry players argue the EU should be focusing on its key areas of competitive advantage within the complex global semiconductor supply chain, rather than seeking to build large-scale, high-end manufacturing capacity that exists elsewhere.Breton said that while the EU had an outstanding position in semiconductor research, it was less strong in design and packaging, and Europe did not manufacture the most advanced chips. The goal, he said, was for Europe to produce the most advanced semiconductors, including chips of less than five nanometres.State-aid rules will need to be adapted for massive investments in leading-edge semiconductor capacity, according to the commission. Among the companies that the EU is seeking to woo is Intel, which is planning to announce a new chipmaking factory in Europe.The EU is also discussing a mechanism to monitor the semiconductor supply chain and respond to disruptions.The US Defense Production Act was deployed by the White House during the Covid-19 crisis to crack down on hoarding, limit exports of certain goods, and prioritise production of critical supplies.
70  Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Washington’s response to Moscow’s security demands had been inadequate, signalling that a diplomatic resolution to tension between Russia and the west over Ukraine remained a long way off.In comments made on a phone call with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron and reported by the Kremlin press service, the Russian leader said Washington’s written responses, delivered last week, had ignored Moscow’s demands to roll back the expansion of the Nato security alliance, which Putin sees as a significant threat.“Attention was drawn to the fact that US and Nato answers did not take into account such fundamental Russian concerns as the prevention of Nato enlargement,” the Kremlin said in a statement, summarising Putin’s comments to Macron.In Paris, however, a senior French official said Putin told Macron “he was not looking for confrontation”.Putin had expressed no aggressive intentions and both sides refrained from threats while focusing on the need for further dialogue in the so-called Normandy format that also includes Germany, in order to resolve the crisis in eastern Ukraine where Russian-backed separatists have seized control, the official in Paris said.The two leaders spoke as Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukrainian president, urged the US and other western backers to tone down public warnings of an imminent full-blown Russian invasion on fears that it would destabilise his country’s economy.“We do understand what the risks are,” Zelensky said at a press conference where he added that “we do not see a bigger escalation” than last spring when Russia’s military build-up started. “We don’t need this panic,” he said.In the UK, a spokesperson for Downing Street on Friday night said that prime minister Boris Johnson “is determined to accelerate diplomatic efforts and ramp up deterrence to avoid bloodshed in Europe. He will reiterate the need for Russia to step back and engage diplomatically when he speaks to President Putin this week.”Zelensky urged western backers to help Kyiv plug financial gaps of up to $5bn as the risk of war has made it difficult to access markets. “We can’t handle this alone. We have to take money out [of our reserves] and stabilise our currency. It’s a very expensive price to pay,” Zelensky said.The US and Nato answers to Russia’s demands, criticised by Putin, were presented to the Russian foreign ministry in person last week by the US ambassador to Moscow.The US and Nato told Moscow they were committed to keeping the transatlantic alliance open to new members, rebuffing the central Russian demand. Russian officials said the responses left “little cause for optimism” but suggested a conversation would continue “on secondary issues”.Russia has more than 100,000 of its troops deployed around the border with Ukraine, raising fears that tensions could spill over into full-blown war in Europe.Russia presented its demands for security guarantees to the US and Nato in December last year, ahead of a string of diplomatic meetings between the two sides this month that revealed few areas of compromise.The draft proposals aim to redraw the security map of Europe, demanding guarantees from the west that Ukraine should never become a member of Nato and that the security alliance should roll back deployment in states that joined after 1997.These demands, Putin told Macron, were not taken into account.Another key question, also ignored, the Kremlin said, was “how the United States and its allies intend to follow the principle of the indivisibility of security, which is enshrined in the basic OSCE and Nato-Russia documents, stipulating that no one should strengthen their security at the expense of the security of other countries.”The two leaders agreed to keep talking. “It was agreed to continue the Russian-French dialogue on the whole range of European security issues,” the Kremlin said.Macron, who recently launched a plan for “a new security and stability order” in Europe, has been engaged in a “strategic dialogue” with Putin since 2019 despite criticism from some of France’s allies and European partners that it has been too accommodating towards the Russian leader.
71  Portugal’s prime minister has called on supporters to keep faith with his Socialist government following a late surge by the centre-right opposition ahead of Sunday’s parliamentary election.António Costa’s Socialists (PS) are only two to three points ahead of the Social Democrats (PSD), less than the statistical margin of error, according to final polling in the country’s closest-fought election in decades.Costa, whose record of balancing fiscal prudence with overturning austerity measures has encouraged Europe’s centre-left, has said he would quit as party leader if the PS was beaten into second place.“Only votes for the PS will break the tie in the polls,” Costa said in a campaign speech in Lisbon on Thursday evening. “Votes for other parties won’t resolve the issue.”Rui Rio, PSD leader, called on Costa to “lose with dignity” after narrowing the 14-point lead enjoyed by the PS in October, when the minority Socialist government was brought down midterm by its far-left partners.“The PS doesn’t deserve to win,” Rio told supporters at a rally in Porto late on Thursday. “Their campaign has focused on misleading voters.”Both main parties held their final election events on Friday evening.With polls showing the PS with 35-36 per cent of the vote, against 33 per cent for the PSD, protracted negotiations are likely to be required for a new government to be formed led by one or the other of the two parties.None of the country’s smaller parties is projected to win more than about 6 per cent but those votes could determine whether there is a parliamentary majority on the left or right.Costa, wearied by six years of negotiating with radical leftwing allies and the coronavirus pandemic, has made errors in a “zigzag” campaign that has veered between different positions, according to analysts.“The PS has failed in its strategy of trying to convince moderate voters that Rio, who is criticised in his own party for leaning too far to the left, would usher in a rightwing government that would take away social rights and privatise the national health service,” said António Costa Pinto, a politics professor at Lisbon’s Institute of Social Sciences.He added that Costa also erred by initially asking voters for an absolute majority so that he would not have to rely on the far-left partners whose rejection of his budget triggered the early election.“Left-of-centre voters like the alliance he created,” said Costa Pinto. The PS’s only absolute majority was won in 2005 by José Sócrates, the former prime minister at the centre of Portugal’s largest-ever political corruption scandal, making it an unattractive option to many voters.Faced with recent polls, Costa has dropped his bid for an overall majority, saying he would be willing to negotiate another pact with the anti-capitalist Left Bloc and the old-guard Communists, despite blaming them for precipitating an unnecessary election.“We need to put an end to this political crisis without acrimony or rancour,” Costa said at a Thursday’s campaign stop.Rio would face similar difficulties in reaching parliamentary agreements to support a minority government on the right. He has ruled out any co-operation with Chega, a far-right populist party, but the parliamentary arithmetic could make their support vital. Chega is vying with the Left Bloc, the Communists and Liberal Initiative to become the third-largest party.If neither the PS nor the PSD can secure stable support for a government, both parties have mooted a deal by which the smaller of the two would abstain in crucial votes to make an administration led by the other party viable.Such a government, however, would be unlikely to survive long, analysts said.
72  Kyiv, jokes one of its residents, is the eye of the hurricane, the calm spot at the centre of the storm. Life in Ukraine’s capital carries on as normal. But fears of impending chaos and destruction are closing in.For weeks the US has been warning of a massive Russian military build-up along Ukraine’s borders. Hardened by eight years of war since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and orchestration of a separatist war in the Donbas region, many Ukrainians have been either unfazed or incredulous that President Vladimir Putin would go so far as to launch a large-scale invasion. Many still are. But sentiment has shifted in recent days.“Something has changed,” says Andriy, a 24-year-old HR executive out shopping in a Kyiv mall. “All of my friends feel afraid of this situation with Russia.“I thought journalists and media were exaggerating the situation. I don’t see panic in the eyes of the people, but in the last few days people are getting more afraid due to the news, news, news.”There is little sign of panic buying. But Andriy says his friends have started to stock up on pasta and buckwheat. Other Ukrainians are making contingency plans. One western executive says he has packed a grab bag, fuelled up the car and agreed a rendezvous point with his family. They will flee to a safe venue outside the city away from important buildings or facilities and if necessary go there on foot. Others are considering sending family to Lviv, a city far to the west.This sense of anxiety was first felt among English-speaking Ukrainians exposed to intensive western media coverage and those with foreign friends and family. Two of Kyiv’s international schools are closing. Andriy says he was unnerved by a message sent to an Israeli friend in Ukraine from the Israeli government about a possible evacuation. But now the concerns, repeatedly relayed by senior US officials, are filtering through to the population more widely.“This is the first time since 2014 that news about a possible invasion is coming from the west and not Ukraine,” says Alyona Getmanchuk, director of the New Europe Center, a think-tank in Kyiv. Ukrainians are “exhausted” by warnings from their own government and might be more inclined to believe the US president, she suggests.A decision this week by the US and UK embassies to evacuate diplomatic families and allow non-essential personnel to leave rattled Ukrainians. It also angered the Ukrainian government, which continues to downplay the imminent threat.“Certainly there is a certain regrouping of Russian Federation military forces around Ukraine, which we are observing constantly,” Oleksiy Danilov, Ukraine’s national security adviser, tells the FT. “Is it critical for us [in terms of number]? No.“At issue is something else. The aim of the Russian Federation is to destabilise our country from within. They are doing this constantly and professionally.”Speaking on Friday, Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, played down the prospects of a full-blown invasion. “We do understand what the risks are,” he said at a press conference, adding that “we do not see a bigger escalation” than last spring when Russia’s military build-up started.A government tourism body has adopted the slogan: “Keep calm and visit Ukraine’.The official position being taken by Kyiv exposes a remarkable gulf of perceptions with Washington and raises the question: why is a country that for several years beseeched its western allies to take the Russian menace more seriously now playing it down?Zelensky’s messaging about the threat to his country has been erratic. After meeting US secretary of state Antony Blinken in Kyiv on January 19, the president released a video in which he seemed to make light of the invasion threat, saying Ukrainians could soon relax over a shashlik (barbecue). Yet the next day he told the Washington Post that Kharkiv, a city in the north-east, “could be occupied”.While Zelensky’s political critics concur with the prevailing view in Kyiv that Putin is unlikely to launch a full invasion, they have also denounced the president’s failure to prepare the public for war and to beef up defences, for example by mobilising the army reserve.“He should have said: ‘My fellow Ukrainians, Ukraine is under threat. Russia amassed 100,000 troops across the border. Putin wants to take over Ukraine. We have to stay united. I order Ukrainian military to mobilise. I order Ukrainian military to deploy additional troops,’” says Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who was prime minister from 2014-16.Zelensky is preoccupied above all with the economic fallout from the ever more dire invasion warnings, say western diplomats, Ukrainian officials and advisers.Solid economic growth of 3.2 per cent last year, buoyed by high prices for Ukraine’s commodity exports, was a bright spot for Zelensky, who appears an increasingly isolated and unpopular figure. Since his election in 2019, he has made modest progress in tackling graft, is struggling to reform a corrupt judiciary and is locked in a power struggle with some of the country’s powerful oligarchs.However, the economy has now taken a sharp turn for the worse. Inflation has shot above 10 per cent. The hryvnia has lost 6 per cent of its value against the US dollar in a month. Companies are struggling with surging energy costs. Ukraine filled up its gas storage facilities last year before prices spiralled, but it will need billions of dollars to meet next winter’s needs.Investors have taken fright. Ukraine is, in effect, locked out of capital markets, although the biggest bond redemptions of the year are not due until September.“Even if nothing happens, it is a macroeconomic shock,” says Tymofiy Mylovanov, a former economy minister and adviser to the presidential administration. “It will have an impact on mood, morale and allocation of resources.”Yevgenii Utkin, a Russian-born entrepreneur in Kyiv, says three international transactions involving investments in tech companies he founded or invested in have stalled in the past month. “Now there is no way to sell,” he says.The economic damage is part and parcel of Putin’s campaign to destabilise Ukraine, say Zelensky’s allies. Economic hardship could help Moscow turn Ukrainians against their government.“Those who are spreading panic are helping, intentionally or unintentionally, Mr Putin,” says Yuriy Vitrenko, the head of Naftogaz, Ukraine’s gas company, who has also been tipped as a future prime minister. “We have been living under a constant threat of invasion and I’m not sure this is very different.”Ukrainian officials and experts also take a different view from their US and UK counterparts on Russia’s military preparedness and they challenge western assumptions about Russia’s military superiority.Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former defence minister and director of the Centre for Defence Strategies, a think-tank, concedes that a large-scale Russian invasion is possible, including an attempt to take Kyiv.“They are not ready yet, but they will be in a month. They are ready for smaller-scale [conflict]. They could invade Donbas today,” he says.Zagorodnyuk, who advises the government, takes issue with the confident predictions of US analysts about Putin’s intentions to invade. “Many people are making a false logical construct,” he says. “They can invade, which is why they will, and that means a full occupation of the country.”“The Russians don’t have a single plan. They have strategic goals and then they have options to meet them. They try something and then they step back. They are very receptive to the response.”Many Ukrainians, in or out of government, assert that the Kremlin would not launch a large-scale invasion because they insist Putin must know he will meet stiff resistance.In 2014, Ukraine had 5,000 combat-ready troops. Now it says it has a fully professional army of 250,000, as well as an army reserve of hundreds of thousands. Between them there are 200,000 soldiers with combat experience, the government says.Oleksiy Arestovych, a former military intelligence officer and adviser to the presidential administration, argues that Russia’s vaunted air supremacy is also overstated. Ukraine has a sophisticated if ageing Soviet-era air defence system which will bring down some Russian jets, he says.Russia only has 200-300 Kalibr cruise missiles and 150 Iskander short-range missiles and their accuracy is “laughable”, Arestovych claims.“This illusion has been created that we will have nothing left.”Ukrainians know Russian aggression comes in many forms on a sliding scale — from cyber attacks and bomb threats to annexation — because they have been on the receiving end since their country became independent in 1991. Analysts and politicians concede that Russia might try to seize chunks of their country. But capturing, let alone occupying, large cities is unlikely because of the military cost, they believe. Kyiv might be the exception, says Zagorodnyuk, given the benefits to Putin of decapitating the government and economy. Taking the port city of Odesa, in the south-west, also has strategic and economic value.But analysts and government advisers believe Putin’s real intention is to gain influence rather than territory. Despite repeated US reassurances, they still suspect Ukraine will come under intense pressure to compromise with Russia and change the constitution to give permanent autonomy to separatist-held Donbas regions, giving them a veto over future agreements with the EU or Nato — a concession that could provoke a nationalist backlash in Ukraine and endanger the government.“From the outset they have seen this as a pressure campaign,” says a European diplomat.Stressing the need to “not panic”, Danilov says Russia’s top priority in threatening a full-blown invasion is to encourage Europe and the US to pressure Kyiv to capitulate on the Minsk peace agreements, which aimed to end the war in Donbas. Such a compromise would, in turn, “achieve domestic destabilisation of our country” followed by regime change.Asked if western countries would play along with such a proposal in order to prevent a full-blown war, he adds: “I would not want to even think about this, that they are in cahoots. It’s difficult for me to say.”Nearly every Ukrainian the Financial Times spoke to said they or people they know are ready to take up arms to defend their country. Many Ukrainian households have weapons — about 1m, according to government estimates. Whether their resolve melts away under a Russian offensive is another matter. But for the moment, thinking about defending the homeland is psychologically reassuring at a time when the country feels it is caught in a wider fight between great powers.Daniel Bilak, a Canadian-Ukrainian who used to run Ukraine’s inward investment agency, is forming a civil defence unit for three villages outside the capital. It is both a psychological prop for Ukrainians to counter “a sense of helplessness” and a tactic for deterring Russia, he says.“It has become very important. This is where we play psychological games with the Russians,” he says. “They are not all Spetsnaz [special forces] and battle-hardened. When every village becomes a centre of resistance, that plays into [Putin’s] calculations too.”
73  The leader of Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany has resigned and quit the party, in protest at what he called its drift towards rightwing radicalism.Jörg Meuthen, a 60-year-old former economics professor, had been a co-leader of the AfD since 2015 and was considered a relative moderate — one of the few in a party that has steadily tacked to the right since its creation in 2013.In a statement, Meuthen said large parts of the party “have chosen a course that is ever more radical, ever more uninhibited”. They had, he said, adopted “political positions and verbal aberrations that have left the party utterly isolated and driven it ever further towards the political margins”.Speaking later to ARD TV, he said he had lost a long power struggle over the AfD’s future direction. “The heart of the party beats very far to the right these days,” he said, adding that parts of the AfD rejected Germany’s constitutional order: “I see clear echoes there of totalitarianism.” The AfD will hold a leadership election in the next few months.Meuthen had clashed with fellow AfD leaders over the party’s position on the coronavirus pandemic, particularly the claim made by some that Germany was in the grip of a “corona dictatorship”.The AfD strongly protested against the lockdowns imposed in the first year of the pandemic and has helped to organise widespread demonstrations against measures to curb the spread of Covid-19. It is also fiercely opposed to government plans to introduce compulsory vaccinations.Formed in 2013 by Eurosceptics opposed to the bailout of Greece during the eurozone debt crisis, the AfD rode a wave of popular anger over the influx of more than a million refugees from north Africa and the Middle East into Germany in 2015-16 and gradually began to adopt a more nationalist, xenophobic tone.It won 12.6 per cent of the vote in 2017’s national elections and became the biggest opposition party in the Bundestag. But its gradual rightward drift damaged its popularity, and in last September’s election its share of the vote declined to 10.3 per cent.Meuthen, who was elected leader in 2015, found it increasingly difficult to assert his authority in a party that is now dominated by radicals such as the nationalist firebrand Björn Höcke, its leader in the eastern state of Thuringia.In a tweet, Höcke said he respected Meuthen’s decision to quit and said he wished him “the contentment that he couldn’t find in the party.”Meuthen said he will keep the seat in the European Parliament that he has held since 2017. The politician has come under pressure in recent months over a long-running donations scandal in the party, and this week a committee of the European Parliament voted to strip him of his parliamentary immunity, allowing prosecutors in Berlin to initiate legal proceedings. Meuthen denies any wrongdoing.Meuthen is the latest in a long line of AfD leaders who have gone down to defeat in power struggles with the party’s powerful rightwing.Its founder Bernd Lucke, a Eurosceptic economics professor from Hamburg, was ousted by hardliners in 2015 and soon afterwards left the party.Frauke Petry, who replaced him as a co-leader, followed suit after the Bundestag election in 2017. She had sought to steer the party away from a policy of “fundamental opposition” towards greater pragmatism, and to distance it more clearly from the far-right.
74  Italy’s fragile national unity government came under severe strain on Friday as its right-wing members tried to push for their own candidate as the country’s next president, over the objections of leftist parties who want the post to go to prime minister Mario Draghi.Matteo Salvini, leader of the rightwing League, called on right-wing parties to throw their support behind Senate president Elisabetta Casellati, a member of Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia.Salvini said Casellati, a lawyer known for her conservative Catholic views including firm opposition to abortion and IVF, was “the best possible” candidate for president after incumbent Sergio Mattarella, who has repeatedly stressed his unwillingness to serve a second term.Salvini’s endorsement of Casellati — who leftist parties have openly rejected — came as more than 1,000 lawmakers and other representatives cast secret ballots in a complex presidential election process.The Democratic party, the Five Star movement, and the small LEU — which together have 407 of the electors choosing the next president — issued a joint statement calling Salvini’s “unilateral nomination.a serious mistake”.Friday’s morning round of voting was the fifth since the election process began on Monday. Casellati won 382 votes, short of the 505 needed for victory. More than 406 electors abstained. A second round of voting is scheduled for Friday evening, with two more on Saturday if no winner emerges.Analysts said the result highlighted the deep internal divisions within the right and made it unlikely that Casellati could be propelled to victory.Wolfango Piccoli, of political risk advisory group Teneo, said Salvini’s push for Casellati in defiance of his coalition partners could have spelt the end of Draghi’s government.If Italy’s president was elected in “such a partisan way, at that point, the ruling coalition is over”, Piccoli told the Financial Times. “There is no way Draghi can pretend everything is fine and move on. It’s game over for the government.”Draghi, a former European Central Bank president, was tapped as prime minister a year ago to lead Italy through a serious economic and health crisis.Since then, his national unity government has endorsed an ambitious reform programme, backed by €200bn in funding, to reboot the chronically underperforming economy.Many Italians believe Draghi’s career in public service and strong international reputation makes him a strong candidate to serve as president, a position from which he could exercise some oversight of Italy’s notoriously fractious politics for the next seven years.But political parties have not swung behind his election, partly because they are wary of sparking early elections, if they cannot agree a candidate to succeed Draghi as prime minister.In the first rounds parties cast blank ballots while attempting to bridge their differences but tensions have mounted as they failed to reach an agreement.Enrico Letta, the Democratic party’s secretary-general, who wants Draghi as president, warned via Twitter this week that any push for a presidential candidate without the consensus of other government allies “would represent the most direct way to blow everything up”.Piccoli said Salvini’s open support for Casellati as president was a “risky bet” that had highlighted his own political weakness given how far short of victory she had fallen, with many rightwing lawmakers refusing to back her candidacy.
75  Who is more scary for global investors: Vladimir Putin or Jay Powell?The Russian president has judo skills, nuclear weapons and 100,000 troops stationed around Ukraine to back up Moscow’s threats of “the most unpredictable and grave consequences” if the west rejects its security demands over its neighbour.But judging from recent moves in global markets, investors are far more worried about the Fed chair, who lacks any of those attributes but does have the ability to raise interest rates.Investors are not ignoring the stand-off over Ukraine as such. The rouble has weakened; one dollar will now buy you Rb78, from Rb74 at the start of this year. The country’s local-currency government bonds have as well, sending 10-year yields to more than 9 per cent, the highest in six years.Russian stocks have also stumbled hard, reflecting the possibility that the EU and US could use a new volley of economic sanctions to try to convince Russia to back away from the border.Even those local market moves are relatively tame. This is no rerun of the 2014 annexation of Crimea, and resulting sanctions, which kicked off a brutal drop in the rouble. The mildness of the reaction suggests that a lot of foreign money left Russia back then, and did not return.Still, bursts of geopolitical stress tend to follow a certain script: haven currencies — particularly the yen and the Swiss franc — generally rise. US government bonds jump in price. Gold rallies. A classic flight to safety.If that rush is happening, it is well disguised. The yen is flat on the month so far. The franc is weaker against the dollar, and gold is a snooze fest. Treasuries, meanwhile, are sliding.Several possible explanations spring to mind. One is that investors simply do not believe that Russia will invade Ukraine. Let’s check back in on that sanguine view in a few weeks’ time. Another, brutally, is that even if it does, that will still not affect the global economy.“While a war in the Ukraine could be a great human tragedy and a source of significant political tension, it is nevertheless likely to be a localised affair, with limited political and military contagion beyond Russia and the Ukraine,” said Paul O’Connor, head of multi-asset at Janus Henderson Investors in a note this week.“The most important economic spillovers would probably be related to the squeeze on natural gas prices, coming at a time when energy markets are already very tight,” he added. That may be tough for residents of Kyiv to hear, but it is the way the markets work. It is also a reminder of the only issue investors truly care about at the moment: inflation and, by extension, the Fed. Hence the greater scaring power possessed by Powell.Right on cue, the Fed chair ripped in to stock markets this week, when the central bank left interest rates on hold, but he declined to rule out a sharply more aggressive pace of rate rises in future to tame exceptionally high inflation. This could involve a super-rare half-percentage-point rate rise, or even as many as seven rate rises this year. (The market had been expecting four.) It was, as JPMorgan put it, a “No more Mr Nice Guy” moment.Stocks dropped yet again. The benchmark S&P 500 index of US equities has lost around 9 per cent this month, making it the worst month since March 2020 — not a vintage period for global markets. The “buy the dip” era that has persisted ever since that low point in spring two years ago is dying.US 10-year Treasury yields have kicked markedly higher, again in anticipation of the Fed’s next moves, to reach 1.82 per cent — the opposite to the kind of shift one might expect for a market in the grip of a weighty dispute between nuclear powers. The dollar, another currency treated as a haven, has picked up, but it is hard to see that as anything other than a reaction to the Fed.But Russia could easily make an already tough start to the year even tougher. The energy price impact could prove strong enough to force the Fed in to an even speedier withdrawal of support. Higher energy prices may well depress corporate profit margins still further.“It would not be helpful to European assets or European equities,” said Nannette Hechler-Fayd’herbe, chief investment officer of international wealth management at Credit Suisse, with no small degree of understatement. “Russian assets are trading at very attractive levels. If the geopolitical situation ebbs away then this would clear the way for a much better outlook there,” she says.But of course, this assumption that Russia will pull back from the brink could prove overly optimistic. If it did, markets would react very badly, Hechler-Fayd’herbe adds. “We would see a significant reaction to the down side” in equities. The Swiss franc and yen would likely push higher. “But perhaps on the yield side not quite as big a push,” she says.Putin’s power to fire up bond prices in the face of a hawkish Fed appears to have its limits.
76  The Kremlin said on Friday that Vladimir Putin was set to meet German business leaders following a similar event with Italian executives, prompting a warning by the German government that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would put economic ties between Moscow and Berlin at risk.A person close to the German Committee on Eastern European Economic Relations, the organiser, confirmed it was keen to schedule a virtual meeting with Russia’s president soon but that it had no clarity on a date. Before the pandemic, such events were held on an annual basis.News of the meeting comes after a group of top Italian executives from groups including UniCredit, Pirelli and state-owned utility Enel met Putin this week, despite a plea by Mario Draghi’s government to postpone the encounter given the tensions between Russia and the west over Ukraine.Moscow has amassed more than 100,000 troops on the border with Ukraine, stoking fears of an invasion. The US has said there is a “distinct possibility” that Russia might attack its western neighbour next month and warned the Kremlin that the west would impose wide-ranging sanctions in response.The last meeting with Putin and the German Committee on Eastern European Economic Relations, a lobby group of companies with operations in Russia, took place in 2019 and was attended by top executives from groups including Siemens and Knorr-Bremse Group.But on Friday, Christofer Burger, spokesman for the German foreign ministry, said that Germany cared more about upholding the “European framework for peace” than about “improving economic relations with Russia”.Asked about Putin’s planned meeting with German business leaders, he said: “Conditions for closer economic co-operation depend on how Russia behaves when it comes to European peace.”Annalena Baerbock, German foreign minister, warned this week that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea would not go forward if Russia invaded Ukraine. Berlin had been receiving “mixed signals” from the Kremlin, which wanted a closer economic relationship with Germany while at the same time made “threats of force that evoke the cold war”, she told the Funke media group.“These two things don’t fit together,” she said. “The basis for any co-operation must be international law, in particular our joint agreements on security.”Russian stocks have had a rocky week, with the Moscow exchange’s main index down almost 6 per cent on Monday while the rouble hit a 15-month low. Both have strengthened since but remain volatile as concerns rise over potential conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the threat of sanctions.Russia was once one of Germany’s main trading partners but economic ties between the two were hit by the international sanctions imposed after Russia’s annexation of Crimea and military intervention in eastern Ukraine in 2014.Russia is now Germany’s 14th-biggest trading partner, way behind China, the US and UK. Trade between the two reached nearly €45bn in 2020, a big decline on the €58bn recorded in 2019.
77  Half a century has passed since Bloody Sunday — January 30 1972 — the day when the UK’s Parachute Regiment opened fire indiscriminately on a peaceful civil rights march in Northern Ireland’s second city. Thirteen men were killed, another never fully recovered from his injuries and died five months later and 17 people were wounded in the atrocity that fuelled three decades of conflict.The UK government — which now wants to introduce an amnesty for all Troubles-era prosecutions — took 38 years to apologise. Prosecution of the only soldier charged for the events of that day was dropped last year.In On Bloody Sunday, a new collage of eye-witness accounts, Julieann Campbell, a niece of one of the victims, does a remarkable job of taking the reader vividly back to a past that still haunts Northern Ireland. One wounded witness, Joe Mahon, then 16, recalls seeing a paratrooper shoot Jim Wray in the back when he was already on the ground. “I have a guilt — I never shouted to Jim Wray to lie still. and they murdered him.” A bullet lifted the body of another victim, Paddy Doherty, up into the air.The accounts are peppered with army logs and testimony to the official inquiry, including that of Lt Col Derek Wilford, the paratrooper commander, who insisted: “We fired at seen gunmen with pistols and rifles and Thompsons [submachine guns] and nail bombs.” One victim, 17-year-old Gerald Donaghey, was found to have nail bombs stuffed into the pockets of his tight jeans — something his family said had been planted. The inquiry concluded “he was not shot because of his possession of nail bombs. He was shot while trying to escape from the soldiers.”Five decades later, it is not just the past that is painful. London’s determination to push ahead with its amnesty plans is opposed by both unionists who want to protect Northern Ireland’s place in the UK and nationalists seeking a united Ireland. Too much unfinished business remains to simply draw a line under the past and consign it to history.That was highlighted last month when the UK’s Supreme Court ruled that a decision by Northern Ireland’s police in 2014 to drop an investigation into the extreme punishment meted out to 14 men detained without trial in 1971 was unlawful. It was opposition to internment — the rounding up and jailing of suspected nationalists in a bid to smash paramilitary violence by the Irish Republican Army — that brought thousands of mostly Catholic demonstrators on to the streets of a city known to nationalists as Derry and to most unionists as Londonderry on January 30 1972, even though marches had been banned.What happened next is known, thanks to interviews and an official inquiry that in 2010 overturned then UK prime minister Edward Heath’s whitewash attempt. What On Bloody Sunday supplies, in painstaking detail, is the how.A myriad of personal observations chronicle the day’s events: the pride 18-year-old Alana Burke, who is run over by an army personnel carrier, had felt wearing her new brown corduroy “maxi-coat”. Or the way Father Edward Daly heard the author’s uncle, Jackie Duddy, giggle “at the sight of a priest running” as the crowd tried to escape the gunfire, moments before the teenager was shot in the back. Daly, later bishop of Derry, was immortalised on a mural waving a white blood-soaked handkerchief as he sought to clear a path for the fatally wounded Duddy.The 1998 Good Friday Agreement brought peace to Northern Ireland and atrocities like Bloody Sunday gradually receded from the headlines. But now Northern Ireland is back in the news thanks to Brexit and political and demographic change. Elections this May are likely to be won by nationalists. The official census due to be released later this year is expected to show a shift to a Catholic majority for the first time in the region’s 100-year history.Against this backdrop, Susan McKay’s Northern Protestants: On Shifting Ground is a timely follow-up to her earlier book about Protestants, published in 2000. The new work offers compelling contemporary reportage chronicling what Northern Irish Protestants from an array of backgrounds think about religion, culture, their past and their future in candid interviews.Her nuanced portraits do much to update clichéd sectarian stereotypes. McKay, one of the most thoughtful and eloquent commentators on Northern Irish society, finds a West Indies-born former loyalist paramilitary who would accept a united Ireland and a 28-year-old woman who declares her generation is “bored of Green and Orange politics” of nationalism and unionism.There are Troubles victims, too — a woman who lost three of her four young sons when their house was firebombed by loyalist paramilitaries, and a nurse who treated a man who had received punishment shootings through both elbows and both knees.But what makes Northern Protestants special is its real-time insights into the changing dynamics of a society in flux, one where housing, jobs and healthcare are as important to some as traditional community identities. Understanding Northern Ireland’s anguished past is essential, but it cannot be the only lens through which to view the future.On Bloody Sunday: A New History of the Day and its Aftermath by Those Who Were There by Julieann Campbell, Monoray £21.99, 439 pagesNorthern Protestants: On Shifting Ground by Susan McKay, Blackstaff Press £13.29, 334 pages.Jude Webber is the FT’s Ireland correspondentJoin our online book group on Facebook at FT Books Café
78  High returns come with elevated risks. Take Russia. Some European banks have happily set up and maintained operations in the country. Italy’s UniCredit is one of them, and indeed sought to expand there. Partly due to tensions over Ukraine, discussions with Otkritie — Russia’s sixth-largest bank by assets — have ended, UniCredit said as it reported full-year results on Friday.Chief executive Andrea Orcel, recently arrived from UBS, has decided that risk outweighed any rewards from a combination with Otkritie.US sanctions could knock Russian banks for six. But ironically Otkritie is much less risky than it once was, if geopolitical risks are discounted. The state nationalised Otkritie in 2017 after its supercharged growth made it Russia’s top privately held lender, backed by overvalued assets. Five years on and the Russian central bank wants to list Otkritie to get its money back.To be fair, UniCredit’s Russia subsidiary has delivered good profitability since 2007, recently beating the unit’s mid-teens cost of capital. Even adjusting for the rouble’s depreciation against the euro over the past five years, those kinds of annual returns on capital look worthwhile against UniCredit's single-digit return on equity. But Russia contributed just 6 per cent of pre-tax profit to UniCredit group earnings. That is more than Société Générale’s 4 per cent, but far behind leader Austria’s Raiffeisen at 35 per cent, according to JPMorgan.UniCredit could have added scale with Otkritie and curried some favour with Russia’s central bank, were it not for tensions in Ukraine. But frankly Orcel has other priorities. He has promised to return €16bn of excess capital to shareholders by 2024, worth more than half the bank’s market value. Given the better than expected gross (pre-provisioning) operating profit in the fourth quarter, Orcel can feel satisfied so far. He confirmed a payout of €3.75bn payout against last year’s earnings, slightly better than expected.Orcel has wisely sidestepped Russian expansion. UniCredit’s strong share price run in the past year shows he must not lose the love of shareholders through risky takeovers in Russia — or closer to home.
79  Hello from New York, where the newsroom here has been busy with another earnings season. Despite the rough ride for renewable energy companies of late, earnings reports highlight big money being made in environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing. MSCI, the index provider, announced surging growth in ESG and climate sales stemming from investors’ demands for these disclosures.“MSCI’s ESG and climate segment continues to be a rocket ship with 53 per cent constant currency revenue growth, up from 47 per cent last quarter,” Morningstar said on Thursday. “ESG and climate continue to show no signs of slowing down.”For today, I have a report about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s recent climate risk stress test and what it means for banks facing similar scrutiny from the European Central Bank later this year.Kristen delves into why BlackRock launched a late-stage, climate-focused venture fund, and why traditional green funders are facing tough competition.One of the biggest banking stories to play out this year will be about the climate risk stress tests global lenders face in Europe. Both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England are running their first climate stress tests this year. The results will probably determine whether banks need to hold more cash to weather climate-related problems in the years to come.Some global banks, including Credit Suisse, Citibank and HSBC, have already endured a climate risk stress test. On December 30, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority published its first climate stress test based on physical and transitional risks that banks face from climate change. Though banks are not scored individually, the results are troubling for the sector as a whole. The stronger floods and typhoons that are expected to hit the banks’ mortgage lending would increase credit losses by 25 times — from HK$700m to HK$17.3bn — adding “a substantial increase in the risks” banks faced, the report said.With energy transition risks included, the problems only get worse. The costs of lending to high carbon-emitting businesses could triple, leading to “a notable deterioration in the banks’ capital positions”, HKMA said.Bank analysts have attempted to identify how the results will hit individual banks. HSBC, for example, would need to raise borrowing costs for mortgage lenders, and some homes “will become effectively un-mortgageable”, Bank of America said in a report this week. The report also highlighted the inflationary pressures from climate change. To compensate for the higher lending risks, banks will simply charge more. “We expect that banks respond to the [climate] impact by raising pricing on relevant loans and exiting those most exposed,” BofA added.Inflation, obviously, is top of mind for the Federal Reserve these days. Moral Money will be watching on February 3 the testimony of Sarah Bloom Raskin, the Biden administration’s pick to lead bank supervision at the Fed. Her remarks on climate risks could indicate how far the US is willing to go in joining world banking regulators in assessing climate risks in the financial sector.“The confirmation of Sarah Bloom Raskin to the Fed would likely add momentum to the moves towards climate stress testing,” David McNeil, head of climate risk at Fitch Ratings, told Moral Money. But Senate opposition to Raskin “is likely to focus on this topic” too, he said. Patrick Temple-WestVenture capital has boomed on the back of cheap money, in almost all business sectors in recent years. But green ventures are becoming ultra-hot right now (or, perhaps more appropriately, extra cool).This week, BlackRock and Temasek announced the formation of a sustainable investment team dubbed Decarbonization Partners that aims to target late-stage venture deals focused on the clean energy transition. It will have an initial $600m combined capital from Temasek and BlackRock, but will be open to other investors too.The move by these two giants comes amid institutional investors’ rising excitement about this space. In 2021, banks poured $120bn into funds focused on sustainability, environment, and governance. However, BlackRock’s Larry Fink recently predicted that this number would rapidly swell, arguing that “the next 1,000 billion-dollar start-ups will be in climate tech”.Others agree. “The market has radically changed in the past 18 months,” Mike Miller, partner at Liquid2, a clean tech-focused venture capital firm, told Moral Money. He added: “In previous years, we had to hide clean investments from limited partners or spin it in a ‘good’ way” — since it was hard to get other investors to join in.In recent years, investors strayed away from green deals for fear of a market crash like that of the 2000s, when many climate-focused deals went bust (think Solyndra’s downfall after misleading the department of energy for a loan).The move comes as the wider market for venture capital has almost doubled in the past year. Global venture investment in 2021 totalled $643bn, a 92 per cent growth year-over-year, according to Crunchbase. Late-stage funding garnered the majority of those dollars in 2021.This explosion of interest in ESG VC has one drawback for smaller sustainability investors: as mainstream money moves in, some climate-focused venture capitalists risk getting pushed aside by giants such as BlackRock. “It’s so competitive from cap and size approach, we are getting squeezed out of climate deals,” Miller said. “[But] 2022 will be exciting, especially as larger players enter, which means that founders are getting their choice.”Still, a new report from UN Principles for Responsible Investment viewed the glass half-full. As venture capital firms increasingly use ESG factors to rule potential investments in or out of contention, it could spur the growth of ESG values early on in companies’ development. Kristen TalmanClimate litigation risk has heightened in recent years across sectors, but it’s expected to peak in the next two years, according to research from the Carbon Disclosure Project.Momentum from recent suits such as the Dutch court ordering Shell to lower emissions and a surge in climate-focused court cases, is likely to drive the litigation risk to its highest heights, Amir Sokolowski, CDP’s associate director on climate change, told Moral Money.However, after the next two years, companies will be able to more accurately incorporate the risk into their compliance structure, largely shielding themselves from litigation risk, Sokolowski said.

80  France pulled away from its European neighbours with growth of 7 per cent in 2021, the country’s fastest expansion for 52 years, as it rebounded back above pre-pandemic levels of output thanks to higher consumer spending.The strength of France’s revival from the coronavirus pandemic, which dragged the country into a record postwar recession in 2020, is good news for President Emmanuel Macron, who is expected to seek a second term in April’s elections.The French economic rebound continued in the final three months of last year, with growth in gross domestic product of 0.7 per cent from the previous quarter. That outstripped most economists’ expectations and outshone its larger neighbour Germany where the economy contracted 0.7 per cent in the same period, leading to full-year growth of 2.8 per cent.“The French economy has rebounded spectacularly and that’s erased the economic crisis,” Bruno Le Maire, finance minister, told France 2 Television. “There are still some sectors that are having trouble, like tourism and hotels, but most are recovering very strongly and that’s creating jobs.”Combined with stronger than expected growth in Spain, France’s resilient performance suggested the eurozone was likely to grow at a healthier than expected rate in the fourth quarter.Martin Wolburg, senior economist at Generali Investments, said “we are going through a softer period but look like we will avoid recession in the euro area”. He predicted the bloc would grow 0.3 to 0.4 per cent in the fourth quarter, when those figures are released on Monday.Spain’s economy also did better than expected in the fourth quarter, growing by 2 per cent and boosted by a strong rebound in services exports that mainly stem from tourism. However, the Spanish economy remained 4 per cent below pre-pandemic levels of gross domestic product, despite growing 5 per cent last year — its fastest growth rate since 2000.Spanish 2021 growth was below the government’s 6.5 per cent forecast. Pablo Casado, leader of the opposition People’s party, said the numbers “confirm the worst recovery in Europe” and tweeted that the government should “stop lying to the Spaniards and review the forecasts now”.Germany’s fourth-quarter contraction left its output 1.5 per cent below pre-pandemic levels and underlined how Europe’s largest economy has been hit by its greater exposure to supply chain bottlenecks and a weaker recovery in household spending. In contrast, the US economy was 3.1 per cent above its pre-pandemic level in the fourth quarter.“The German economy went into hibernation at the turn of the year,” said Carsten Brzeski, head of macro research at ING. “Restrictions to tackle the fourth wave of the pandemic and the Omicron wave as well as higher energy prices dented private consumption.”France, by contrast, has been boosted by a sharp rebound in consumer spending after coronavirus restrictions were eased last year, while also benefiting from its lower exposure to the global supply bottlenecks that have hit German manufacturers.The French national statistics office said average growth in 2021 was its fastest rate since 1969, at the peak of the postwar period known as “les trente glorieuses”. The economy has bounced back sharply from its 8 per cent contraction in 2020.The eurozone’s second-largest economy returned to its pre-pandemic level of GDP in the third quarter, it said. Germany is unlikely to hit that milestone until the second quarter and Spain is expected to do so even later.In the fourth quarter, France’s economy was powered by a 0.4 per cent rise in household spending and a 0.5 per cent increase in investment, while changes in inventories also added 0.4 percentage points to growth. Trade, however, made a negative contribution of 0.2 per cent.However, economists expect a slowdown in the French economy at the start of this year after daily coronavirus cases hit a new high of 500,000 this week and tougher rules required people to be fully vaccinated to enter many public places.The number of Covid-19 patients in French hospitals has risen above 30,000 for the first time since November 2020, but a lower proportion of them are in intensive care than in previous waves of the pandemic.The French government, which plans to loosen coronavirus restrictions next month despite the high level of cases, previously forecast the economy would grow 4 per cent in 2022.
81  Good Morning. Choppy markets again yesterday, amid lots of talk about the great hawk Jay Powell. We still think that the market response to Powell’s words tells you more about the market (jittery as hell) than about Powell (mostly his usual self). There is more to this story than the Fed.Here are some stocks that look really, really, really cheap (data from S&P CapitalIQ):All of these multibillion-dollar companies have double-digit dividend yields, double-digit revenue growth, and price/earnings ratios below 10. Some of them look frankly absurd — Gazprom, say, with 40 per cent growth, a 17 per cent dividend in the year ahead, and a P/E of 3 (the dividend may turn out to be even higher than that, if oil prices stay high).Now, what has created these somewhat otherworldly valuations is, to generalise, the combination of a rising oil price (good for Russian economy and its corporate profits) and the crisis on its border with Ukraine (bad for Russian asset prices). Here is a chart of Russia’s Moex equity index against the crude oil price in roubles. Notice the unusual but not unique divergence at right:Those who have been hanging around stock markets for awhile will know Russian stocks have looked very cheap before. What is unusual is that they are as cheap now as they were a decade or so ago — before the country’s financial reconstruction, in which it slashed external debt, built foreign currency reserves, and accumulated current account and budget surpluses. An oil-driven economy is especially attractive now, given high global inflation, and Russia’s particularly so, given its very hawkish monetary policy.The question is whether Russian stocks can get cheaper still. The question can be broken into two parts. One: what is the chance the situation on the border turns into an even bigger mess? Two: how much of a mess is already priced into stocks?The corresponding argument from Russia bulls has two parts as well. One: Moscow is genuinely concerned with its own security, and has neither domestic support for nor geostrategic interests in an annexation of Ukrainian territory. If the US and Nato cool it, offering assurances about missiles and a pause in Nato’s expansionary aspirations, de-escalation would follow.Two: even if things do get worse, financial sanctions against Russia are likely to be too weak to threaten its economy, unless they stopped the country from selling its oil and gas abroad — which would hurt Europe as much or perhaps more than it would Russia.Jacob Grapengiesser, who runs about $4bn in eastern European equities for East Capital, summed up the first argument up in a call from Moscow yesterday:Whitney Baker, who runs the emerging markets research shop Totem Macro, summed up the second argument as follows:Even if secondary trading of Russian assets were banned for international investors, Baker said, they would likely be given a window to sell — and the price impact might not be terrible, given the low international ownership.Unhedged is not in the business of assessing geopolitical risk. But if the situation on the border cools, someone is going to make a lot of money in Russia.We are not crestfallen about this news:Facebook’s Diem project has shape-shifted so many times that we can hardly fault readers for losing the thread. Here is a postmortem.Many tactical missteps paved the path for Facebook’s flop — from a half-baked association of backers to the residual stink of Facebook’s privacy scandals. But there was only one big strategic error: threatening governments’ monetary sovereignty.Diem was launched in 2019 as Libra, with the ambition of disrupting the kludgy cross-border payments industry. Backed by fiat currency and Treasuries, Libra would run on a permissioned (partly centralised) blockchain and let users pay one another across borders and currencies. Scale would let Libra push down exchange fees.Regulators lashed out fast, warning the digital currency could run foul of laws against money laundering and terrorist financing. This criticism was fair, but ignored the deeper problem — the prospect of a private Central Bank of Facebook. As then-French finance minister Bruno Le Maire wrote in the FT:At the heart of such fears is the monetary trilemma: the economic principle that countries must pick two of monetary policy independence, free capital flows and a fixed exchange rate. All three cannot be maintained. Eurozone countries, for instance, have ceded monetary policy to the European Central Bank to adopt the euro alongside free-moving capital. Countries trying to buck the trilemma have failed.Libra, if successful, would’ve made this policy choice even harder. It would become near impossible to enforce capital controls, turning a trilemma into a dilemma. As the economists Pierpaolo Benigno, Linda Schilling and Harald Uhlig argued in 2019:To translate, either you accept Facebook’s implicit monetary policy or your currency starts going out of circulation. This is not just an academic question. One source relayed this anecdote to Unhedged:Once Facebook had thoroughly spooked regulators, none of its attempts to shed Libra’s baggage — changing the name to Diem, moving the HQ from Switzerland to America — could assuage them. Even a fundamental design change was not enough.The world is moving on from Diem. Governments across the world are working on central bank digital currencies that could soon meet the very real need Facebook saw. If there is any lesson to take from the Diem saga, it is that central banks better get CBDCs right. They cannot stave off the competition for ever without a digital offering of their own. (Ethan Wu)With all that’s happening in Ukraine, this week’s coup in Burkina Faso has not gotten enough attention. The Economist explains why jihadis are gaining ground in west Africa — and how Russia is capitalising.
82  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.It’s not every day that the president of the European Investment Bank has a go at the European Commission, but yesterday was one of those moments. In the spotlight: Brussels’ highly contested inclusion of nuclear power and gas in its so-called taxonomy for sustainable investments. I’ll unpack the arguments coming from the Luxembourg-based bank and what the EU commission had to say in its defence.Speaking of natural gas, the Gazprom-owned Nord Stream 2 consortium has made controversial appointments to the board of the German subsidiary that would own the last miles of pipeline. Meanwhile, the Germany’s foreign minister yesterday vowed to keep the pipeline offline if Russia invades Ukraine, amid criticism from Latvia among others that Germany’s dependence on Russian gas is creating divisions within the bloc.One appointment is still very much in the dark: Italy’s next president. Four election rounds have ended with a majority of blank votes. The latest speculation is that a woman could be propelled into the post, but the centre-left continues to push for Mario Draghi, the prime minister.The EU’s draft legal text permitting investments in nuclear power and gas to be labelled as sustainable is off to a bad start. First, the European Commission controversially sent out the draft text a few minutes before midnight on New Year’s Eve. (The FT had the scoop here)Then, a deluge of critical comments poured in, including from Germany’s government, which has vowed to vote against it (though it doesn’t have the power to block it) if the final text doesn’t significantly reduce the scope of eligible investments in nuclear and gas.The inclusion of the two sources of energy was a compromise needed to get pro-nuclear countries, led by France, as well as pro-gas governments in southern and eastern Europe on board. In a recent interview, the commissioner overseeing this file, Mairead McGuinness, said she doesn’t expect significant changes to the text.Now, the European Investment Bank, which sees itself as the bloc’s “climate bank”, as described by its president, Werner Hoyer, is piling on criticism.In a news conference yesterday, Hoyer said the bank has never invested in nuclear projects and “has no intention to change that”, no matter what the final taxonomy will say.On gas, Hoyer — a German national — complained that the rules are too complex and that nearly a month after the draft came out, “we still haven’t fully digested the details”.“The move out of, so to speak, dirty gas into clean gas.must meet criteria which have reached [such] a level of technical complexity, in that paper, that you get drowsy,” Hoyer said.“What I would not like to see is if someone wants to move out of dirty fossil fuel projects into clean gas projects, he or she will end up with nuclear solutions, because it is simply too complicated.”His advice, Hoyer said, was to fine tune the details or else risk having the taxonomy “misused or discredited”.A European commission spokesperson said the final text would be published soon and sought to dismiss Hoyer’s comments.“I don’t think it is something that makes people drowsy,” said commission spokesman Eric Mamer. “I think it is something that focuses people’s minds on the delicate balance that needs to be found in order to ensure that this transition is a success, while maintaining both the need of stable supplies of energy and progressively lowered reliance on fossil fuels.”Was the European Commission wrong to include both nuclear and gas in its taxonomy proposals? Tell us what you think and click here to take the poll.For years, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline has been a flashpoint of political controversy in Europe, and a power struggle between Moscow and Washington — with Berlin stuck in the middle. It has also caused strife within Germany’s new coalition government. But the latest chapter in this saga is among the most unusual yet, writes Erika Solomon in Berlin.The Kremlin-backed gas project last year announced it was setting up a subsidiary to run the final 54km segment of the pipeline through Germany’s waters. The goal was to try to get around the European Union’s “unbundling” regulations, which require that the companies producing, transporting, and distributing gas within the bloc are separate entities.Unbundling was never going to be an easy sell for Nord Stream 2, which is technically its own entity, but is wholly owned by Gazprom, which provides the pipeline’s gas. Critics argued that even a German subsidiary, itself wholly owned by Nord Stream 2, would not be a solution.When the subsidiary, Gas for Europe GmbH, was finally announced on Wednesday, opponents went from sceptical to incredulous.“Seriously?” one German official privately said. “Now they are just trolling Europe,” said a European lawyer who has helped fight the project. Both asked not to be named.Topping the list in terms of public outrage was the initial proposal for chair of the board, a controversial former diplomat. Late last night it emerged that the foreign ministry had refused to clear him for the post, Der Spiegel reported.Yet it is the other newly appointed members of the board and the new company’s management that critics argue are even more problematic.The supervisory board’s two other members are Paul Corcoran, the chief financial officer of Nord Stream 2, and Elena Burmistrova, the director-general of Gazprom Export.The managing director of Gas for Europe is Reinhard Ontyd, who was previously the chief commercial officer of Nord Stream 2.None of these appointments seem likely to ease concerns of the new subsidiary operating independently — or the likelihood of opponents such as Poland challenging the plan in court.“If this is their board, then this is not unbundling,” said Thomas O’Donnell, an energy analyst at the Hertie School in Berlin. “But I actually don’t get what they are doing any more.”With EU-UK trade talks on hold as London is consumed by the ‘partygate’ scandal, our sister newsletter Britain after Brexit is looking at fresh research from the London School of Economics, which found that the uncertainty created during the UK’s negotiations with the EU between 2016-2019 caused material negative effects to GDP growth. (More here)Is Italy poised to elect its first woman president? That is the question gripping Italians, as the presidential election process moves into its fifth day today, after the first four rounds of secret ballots failed to anoint a new head of state, write Amy Kazmin and Davide Ghiglione in Rome.Mario Draghi, prime minister, has long been seen as the presidential frontrunner. But as the political stand-off over his potential ascent to the presidency continues, talk that lawmakers could instead choose a woman for the role is intensifying.Politicians “know the country is getting impatient — they know they have to come out with a solution fast, but the solution should be interesting,” said political commentator Gianni Riotta, former editor of the business newspaper Sole 24 Ore. “We never had a woman as president, so any woman that is elected would have a favourable wind. It would be such an innovation. The symbol would be powerful.”Among those whose names circulating are Elisabetta Belloni, who was appointed by Draghi in May to become the first female head of the country’s intelligence agencies.A female pioneer within Italy’s then male dominated foreign service, Belloni led the foreign ministry’s crisis response unit from 2004 to 2008, and later secured the ministry’s top job. From there, she was named head of Italy’s Department of Information Security, which oversees the country’s foreign and domestic intelligence services.But there has been some pushback against the idea of Belloni, with some Italians taking to social media to express concerns about the head of the spy agency taking charge as the head of state.Another possible candidate is justice minister Marta Cartabia, the former president of Italy’s constitutional court. As minister, Cartabia has been overseeing reforms intended to help speed up trials and make the legal system more efficient — a persistent concern of international investors.But despite the frisson around talk of a woman president, it still may not be on the cards this time, as the centre-left Democratic party is reportedly convinced Draghi as president is Italy’s best bet.
83  Emergency measures announced by president Recep Tayyip Erdogan last month have helped the Turkish lira to post a relatively calm start to 2022 after a chaotic December even as analysts remain deeply uncertain over its outlook.New government-backed savings schemes unveiled by the authorities — combined with other steps including a multibillion-dollar intervention by the central bank — have restored temporary stability. But few analysts see those fixes as a lasting solution to Turkey’s currency dilemma, given Erdogan’s determination to keep interest rates far below the country’s rocketing inflation rate.“I see this as electro shock therapy,” said Emre Akcakmak, managing director at Greenwest Consultancy in Dubai. “The patient was about to be lost and now it’s back to life. But did this cure the patient? I don’t think it is a long-term solution.” Erdogan’s order for the central bank to cut rates four times, despite rising inflation, sent the lira plummeting in the final months of last year. As it threatened to spiral out of control in mid-December, crashing through record lows of TL16, TL17 and TL18 to the dollar, the president unveiled a state-backed savings scheme aimed at luring Turkish savers back to the national currency.Interest in the products, which promise to compensate savers who hold lira for any exchange rate losses that they incur, has been limited so far, albeit climbing steadily. As of January 24, TL196bn ($14bn) had been transferred to the new mechanisms out of total banking sector deposits of TL5.4tn, according to data shared by the finance ministry with the Financial Times.Less than 30 per cent of that shift has been driven by savers switching their dollar and euro holdings into local currency.Still, the announcement helped pull the lira back down from its historic lows and has been followed by an unusual window of calm. The currency, which lost 44 per cent of its value against the dollar last year, is down just 2 per cent since the start of 2022, according to Refinitiv data. This compares with a fall of about 0.01 per cent for MSCI’s broad emerging market currencies gauge.Turks’ rush to buy dollars, euros and gold, a phenomenon that puts pressure on the lira, has also cooled. Residents’ foreign currency deposits fell three weeks running in the period up to January 14, according to central bank data.Uptake of the savings scheme could yet be bolstered by companies, which were invited to join on January 11 and have been offered a tax incentive to take part. Paradoxically, however, overenthusiastic signing-up would deepen concerns about the cost of the mechanism to the state, which will foot the bill for any exchange rate losses.While Turkish officials have hailed the scheme as a triumph, some analysts believe that the lira’s central bank is still spending the country’s foreign currency reserves on supporting the lira, albeit at a less intense pace than in December, when it burnt through at least $7bn.Ibrahim Aksoy, an analyst at HSBC in Istanbul, says authorities may be using the proceeds of new regulation, introduced at the start of January, that forces exporters to sell 25 per cent of their foreign currency earnings to the central bank.Aksoy said that the measure, which bankers say has already come into force, should contribute around $1.25bn a week to the central bank’s reserves based on exports of roughly $20bn in January. But no such increase has been observed.“The stability in the lira is coming both from the partial, short-term success of the savings mechanism and from the fact that the central bank is probably supporting the lira,” Aksoy said.Others cite different reasons for the tranquility observed in Turkish markets. A senior Istanbul-based banker, who asked not to be named, said that he had seen a significant push to defend the level of TL13.8 to the dollar — but that he had not seen any signs of intervention in the financial markets over the past week.He said that “very low” trading volumes meant that “the lira can appreciate even with small ticket transactions compared to the past”. He added that large Turkish corporates complained of facing pressure from authorities to avoid making large foreign currency purchases if possible.Erdogan, who has enjoyed a small bounce in his approval rating as markets have stabilised this month, has already declared the savings scheme a great success. Speaking last week, he said that it had “skimmed the froth” off the exchange rate, adding: “We do not think that we will experience the return of the excessive volatility that comes from unbalanced foreign currency demand in the markets.”Central bank governor Sahap Kavcioglu said on Thursday that the government’s “lira-isation” plan would combine with growing exports, investment and employment to bring down inflation that stood at a two-decade record of 36 per cent in December — a strategy that has been met by scepticism from economists given the country’s deeply negative real interest rates.Analysts warn that a host of factors could disrupt the fragile equilibrium. Guldem Atabay, an analyst at the research platform Istanbul Analytics, said that authorities appeared to be gambling on the idea that a strong 2022 tourism season would bring in sufficient foreign currency revenues to eliminate the country’s trade imbalance, long a source of pressure on the lira.She warned that impending rate rises by the US Federal Reserve could suck capital out of emerging markets and said that a likely rise in Turkey’s inflation rate in the months ahead could cause Turks to start buying dollars again.“They think they’re very successful in fighting back the deprecionary forces,” she said. “But I’m afraid it will backfire in the medium term.”
84  Germany’s “immoral and hypocritical” relationship with Russia and China has driven a wedge between western and eastern Europe, Latvia’s defence minister has said in comments that highlight cracks in the west’s unity.Artis Pabriks told the Financial Times that western Europe’s “wishful thinking” about security was evident in its response to Russia amassing more than 100,000 troops on its border with Ukraine.In strongly worded remarks that lay bare the tensions within Nato over how to handle Russia, Pabriks said Berlin had an “immoral inability” to allow howitzer guns once stationed in Germany to be shipped from Estonia to Ukraine to help its defence against a possible invasion.German companies were also threatening to quit Lithuania in relation to its dispute with China over the de facto Taiwanese embassy in the Baltic country, even as Germany invoked “values” when seeking to punish Poland over its rule of law violations, he added.“How are you acting yourself when it comes to Lithuania, Russia, China?” Pabriks asked. “It’s immoral and hypocritical. It’s driving a division line between west and east in Europe.“Germans forgot already that Americans were granting their security in the cold war. But they should [remember]. It’s their moral duty,” he added.Nato is under pressure to respond not just to Russia’s sabre-rattling on Ukraine but its demands to rewind the alliance’s eastern Europe expansion and change the continent’s security set-up.Eastern European countries have been dismayed by Berlin’s refusal to send lethal weapons to Ukraine and the lengthy delay Estonia is facing over the howitzers. Berlin has a say as the weapons were originally based in eastern Germany before being transferred first to Finland and then Estonia.Pabriks said: “If a person is walking in a dark alley and somebody is being beaten up and I’m saying ‘once you’re beaten up I’ll call an ambulance’, it’s not proper.”He suggested that Russia would seek to use the Germans’ reticence to act. “They will try to exploit it,” Pabriks warned.Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in 2004 became the only former Soviet states to join the EU and the Nato alliance. But they have complained of being ignored over the dangers of Moscow’s belligerence in Georgia in 2008 and in 2014 with the annexation of Crimea.Pabriks said part of this was because western Europe was farther from Russia. “They’ve been living in peace for years. They think about gas, exports and co-operation. For us border countries, it’s different. For us it’s existential. Our past doesn’t give much chance of just trusting [Russia]. It would be death for us.”Pabriks added: “European security cannot be done without a German leading role. At this moment, when we’re looking at how they’re acting on European defence and Nato, the readiness of the Bundeswehr [German army], the hesitance to use military force, it’s absurd for the current times.”The chancellery and foreign ministry in Berlin both declined to comment on the remarks. But Annalena Baerbock, German foreign minister, defended the country’s ban on arms exports to Ukraine, saying that to allow them would represent “a 180 degree change in our foreign policy” that ran the risk of “closing the door for de-escalation”.The foreign ministry also commented on Twitter about the EU decision to launch a World Trade Organization case against China in relation to the Lithuania dispute: “A European response to coercive measures is needed. It is a sign of European solidarity.”Latvia on Thursday proposed an increase in its defence spending from Nato’s target of 2 per cent of gross domestic product to 2.5 per cent. Pabriks said that despite this US troops were needed in the Baltics, echoing calls by Estonia’s prime minister to the FT. “We need deterrence now,” he added.
85  As Russian troops amass on the approaches to Ukraine, Ukrainian citizens are bracing themselves for war. “Emergency kit” is a phrase I hear used more and more among my friends and acquaintances all over the country; the question on everyone’s mind is whether there will be an attack. I have been asked this numerous times over the past few weeks and I cannot provide a satisfactory answer. The only thing I am sure about is that every bit of moral, political and military support that Ukraine gets from its friends and allies makes an invasion less likely.The crisis erupted on December 17 when Russia presented the west with an unexpected ultimatum. Its list of demands included a commitment in writing to halt any further eastward expansion of Nato, the removal of multinational Nato troops from Poland and the Baltic states, and the possible withdrawal of US nuclear weapons from Europe. Most crucial was that Ukraine never be allowed to join the alliance.The demands were considered non-starters in Washington and found unacceptable by all members of Nato. The result is that we now find ourselves locked in the most intense diplomatic confrontation between east and west since the end of the cold war.There are significant differences between this crisis and previous ones. Most important is the emergence of China as the leading partner in what began as the Sino-Soviet alliance, accompanied by the reduction of the former Soviet Union to the territory of Russia — a state whose economy is not in the world’s top 10.These changes are crucial for understanding Russia’s foreign policy today. Its aggression towards Ukraine can be seen as part of an attempt to turn the clock back to Soviet times and reinstate Russian control over the former Soviet space — or at least limit western influence over what used to be Moscow’s east European empire.So does Vladimir Putin want to re-establish the Soviet Union, as is occasionally suggested today? Not really. His goal is rather to reinstate or maintain the Kremlin’s control over the former Soviet space more efficiently by creating dependencies, preferably ruled by autocrats, in place of the former Soviet republics — an imperial power structure with him as the ruler of rulers at the top.History cannot tell us what might or might not happen tomorrow. But what it can do is provide a better understanding of how we got to the situation we are in today and what is at stake — especially as in this case the discipline of history, or at least a version of it, is right at the heart of the dispute.The current crisis is a reminder that the dissolution of the Soviet Union — closely associated in the public mind with Mikhail Gorbachev’s resignation as president of an already non-existent country on Christmas Day 1991 — was not a one-act play. It is, rather, a continuing saga with numerous sequels; a process rather than an event.Last July, Putin published a long essay specifically dealing with the history of Russo-Ukrainian relations. The key argument of the article, “On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians”, was formulated in its very first paragraph. Referring to a recent press conference, Putin stated that “when I was asked about Russian-Ukrainian relations, I said that Russians and Ukrainians were one people — a single whole. These words were not driven by some short-term considerations or prompted by the current political context.”What the essay suggested was that there had been no such thing as a separate Ukrainian nation. The argument, which swept aside differences in language, history and culture — especially political culture — between Russians and Ukrainians, was perceived by many as a denial of Ukraine’s right to statehood. But the claim that the Russians and Ukrainians constitute one people is not new, either in Putin’s pronouncements or in the history of Russian political thought.The origins of that claim go back at least to the mid-19th century when, in order to accommodate the rising Ukrainian national movement, Russian imperial thinkers formulated a concept of the tripartite Russian nation consisting of the Great Russians (or Russians in today’s understanding of the word), Little Russians, or Ukrainians, and the White Russians, or Belarusians. It was also around this time that the imperial authorities prohibited Ukrainian-language publications in the empire, all but arresting the development of the Ukrainian political and cultural movement.That policy had its limits. It slowed down the development of a modern Ukrainian national project but did not stop it altogether. As the empire fell in the flames of the Russian Revolution, the Ukrainian activists created a state of their own and in January 1918 declared independence. In neighbouring Austria-Hungary, Ukrainians declared independence as the Western Ukrainian republic. This independence turned out to be shortlived, but it set the agenda for generations of Ukrainian leaders.By the time the Bolsheviks had taken control over most of what used to be the Russian Ukraine in 1920, the idea of independence had gained popularity among the Ukrainian masses and could not be simply dismissed by the new authorities — the Bolsheviks were forced to recognise Ukraine as a separate nation and even grant a pro forma independence to the Ukrainian Soviet republic. Indeed, the Soviet Union was created in 1922-23 as a pseudo-federal rather than a unitary state precisely in order to accommodate Ukraine and Georgia, the two most independent-minded republics, whose communist leaders simply refused to join the Russian Federation.Ukraine, as the most populous republic after the Russian Federation, played the key role not only in the creation of the USSR but also in its dissolution. It was the Ukrainian referendum of December 1 1991, in which over 90 per cent of participants voted to leave the USSR, that spelt the end of the cold war superpower.The Ukrainians had answered the question of whether they wanted their country to be independent — not whether they wanted to dissolve the USSR. But the USSR fell apart within a week, when Russia’s parliament approved an agreement negotiated by Boris Yeltsin and his Ukrainian and Belarusian counterparts, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, in the hunting lodge of Viskuli in western Belarus. That agreement dissolved the Soviet Union, recognised the independence of the former Soviet republics, and established the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in place of the now defunct USSR.The explanation for this was given more than once by President Yeltsin in conversations with President George HW Bush: without Ukraine, Russia would have been outnumbered in Gorbachev’s Union by the Muslim Central Asian republics. Demographic and cultural factors certainly figured in that calculation, but so did economics. Russia was not prepared to bear the burden of the Union without the Union’s second-largest economy, that of Ukraine. So the old Union had to go.Addressing the Russian parliament on December 12 1991, Yeltsin stated that the formation of the CIS was the only way to “ensure the preservation of the political, legal and economic space built up over centuries but now almost lost”. Yeltsin did not want Gorbachev’s reformed Union: his preferred political model was confederation, not full independence for the republics. The Commonwealth, whose creation was a compromise forced on Yeltsin by Ukraine, became central to Russia’s bid to re-establish its control over the post-Soviet space and its status as a global power.It seemed that the leaders of the Soviet republics, the Russians in particular, had managed to avoid the usual violent disintegration of empires, preventing not only a widely feared nuclear war between the newly minted nuclear powers of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, but also a conventional war between the main post-Soviet successor states. But the subsequent years found Russia involved in conflicts with post-Soviet states, offering support to separatist movements and eventually using its military forces outside its own borders. That was hardly a scenario imagined in the euphoria of the early post-cold war years, given the victory of democratic forces in Russia and some other former Soviet republics.The Soviet Union ceased its existence in a manner reminiscent of other continental empires, including its neighbours, the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary, disintegrating along ethnic lines.But the end of the competition between Moscow and Washington never included a political settlement concerning the post-Soviet space. The US, having sought to prevent the disintegration of the USSR as long as possible, ultimately decided to recognise and support the independence of the former Soviet republics. Russia, for its part, never accepted anything but the conditional independence of the former republics, predicated on an alliance with Moscow and belonging to Russia’s sphere of influence.Although the CIS was devised for the specific purpose of accommodating Ukraine, the Ukrainian leadership was not interested in any form of joint statehood with Russia. It even formally refused to join the Commonwealth that it had helped to create.Kyiv’s stubborn reluctance to give up the nuclear weapons it had inherited from the USSR — the third-largest arsenal after those of the US and Russia — was based on its concern about possible Russian aggression. When the Ukrainians finally agreed to give up nuclear weapons in 1994, they insisted on guarantees of their territorial integrity and sovereignty. The Budapest Memorandum, which provided Ukraine with assurances instead of guarantees, was the result. One of the “assurers”, apart from the US and the UK, was Russia.Yeltsin’s Russia attempted to keep Ukraine within its sphere of influence by means of economic ties, especially Ukraine’s dependence on Russian gas. Putin’s Russia tried to follow suit, but as Ukraine continued its drift away from Russia towards the European Union, Russia tried to bribe President Viktor Yanukovich with a $15bn loan to prevent him from signing an association agreement with Brussels. A popular uprising drove Yanukovich out of the country when he ultimately refused to sign such an agreement with the EU, although he had promised Ukrainian voters that he would do so.Russia accepted the fugitive, blamed the US and Europe for provoking and supporting the popular revolt and annexed Crimea. Moscow then began its destabilisation of the Donets Basin (Donbas), the easternmost part of Ukraine, bordering on Russia. The resulting war is still going on, and many expect the Donbas to be the flashpoint of a new conflagration if a Russian invasion takes place. Some are concerned that the conflict could engulf other European countries and go global.How does Nato fit into this story? As the second world war drew to a close, Soviet armies conquered eastern Europe and occupied it for two generations. Nato was established in 1949 as a defensive alliance to prevent further Soviet westward penetration.Not surprisingly, after the disintegration of the USSR, east European nations joined the alliance in order to prevent a recurrence of their long political and economic subjection — a process that Russia now deliberately misrepresents as an aggressive “eastward expansion” of Nato led by Washington and Brussels. Poland offers a particularly striking illustration of east European insistence on joining Nato: the Poles threatened Washington with the development of their own nuclear capabilities if they were not offered membership.Russia’s invasion of 2014 became the driving force behind Ukraine’s insistence on joining the alliance. Immediately after the fall of Viktor Yanukovich’s government in February of that year, the new Ukrainian leadership declared that it had no plans to join Nato. But the annexation of Crimea and the war in the Donbas brought the majority of Ukrainians into the pro-Nato camp. If less than 20 per cent of those polled supported joining Nato in 2013, almost 60 per cent favour it today. Despite this change in attitude, Nato continues to deny Ukraine a Membership Action Plan. But Russia’s current demand to bar Ukraine from Nato forever may very well backfire, leading ultimately to the opposite result.Russia now gives the impression of moving faster than ever before to re-establish its control over the post-Soviet space. The Kremlin’s support for Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus has helped him to quash peaceful protests against his corrupt rule. Russian military intervention in Kazakhstan this month helped President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev put an end to the violent protests in that country.But Russia is paying a price for its support of authoritarian regimes in the post-Soviet space. The Belarusian opposition, which had regarded Russia as an ally, has ceased to do so and is now looking more than ever towards the west. It remains to be seen how soon Tokayev will manage to repair the damage done to his reputation in the eyes of Kazakh elites and citizens for inviting foreign troops into his country.Russia today is following in the footsteps of former imperial powers, from the Ottomans to the French, who lost political, financial and cultural capital the more they clung to their imperial possessions. Attempts to resuscitate a failing empire alienate neighbours — and even potential allies — leading to isolation. And if history shows us one thing, it is that eventually every empire must fall.Serhii Plokhy is professor of Ukrainian history at Harvard University.

86  In early February last year, US president Joe Biden made the short trip to the state department’s headquarters to deliver the first big foreign policy address of his presidency, and a pledge to stare down threats from Vladimir Putin’s Russia.“The days of the US rolling over in the face of Russian aggression.are over,” Biden said. “We will not hesitate to raise the cost on Russia and defend our vital interests and our people. And we will be more effective in dealing with Russia when we work in coalition and co-ordination with other like-minded partners.”A year later, the 79-year-old president is facing a moment of reckoning on those words, as Russian troops gather on the border with Ukraine amid the threat of a possible invasion, and Putin tries to press Nato into limiting its reach and influence in the region.The outcome of the stand-off is going to determine not just the balance of power in Europe, but also Biden’s vision of the US as a force still capable of confronting autocratic regimes aggressively by uniting western democracies, after the divisions and isolationism of the Trump years.If Putin either stands down, or overplays his hand with a Ukrainian assault that backfires, the promise of the so-called Biden doctrine will remain intact. If not, it risks being shattered, dealing a blow to US efforts to stand up to other adversaries including Iran, North Korea and, most importantly, China.The crisis is unfolding just a few months after America’s chaotic military withdrawal from Afghanistan, which was designed to free up capacity for bigger foreign policy priorities, but also led to scepticism about the resolve of the US to project power internationally.“This is about Russia’s behaviour in Ukraine, but it is [also] about everything,” said Heather Conley, president of the German Marshall Fund of the US. “I’m not entirely sure the president or the administration knows how the story is going to end, because to confront growing authoritarian behaviour.whether it’s in the South China Sea, or the Baltic Sea, you need probably less rhetoric and more showing of strength.”Kori Schake, director of foreign and defence policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, added: “The consequences would likely be severe in Asia [if the US were to] ignore Russian aggression. It would telegraph our unwillingness to uphold the liberal order [and] encourage Chinese aggression.”As the stakes keep rising, Biden and his foreign policy team have notably hardened their stance and ramped up their diplomatic efforts on the crisis.This week, the Pentagon put 8,500 troops on standby, ready for deployment in support of a possible Nato reaction force to shore up vulnerable members of the alliance’s eastern flank.While Biden has ruled out sending ground troops to Ukraine itself, he is offering more military aid to Kyiv. The US and European allies are also intensively discussing a package of economic sanctions against Moscow that would be far more aggressive than those used after the annexation of Crimea in 2014.“The gradualism of the past is out. This time we’ll start at the top of the escalation ladder and stay there,” a senior Biden administration official said on Tuesday.But some in Washington fear that Biden’s hand remains weak. William Cohen, the former US defence secretary under Bill Clinton, said there may be an “opportunity to really unite the Europeans in a way that we haven’t seen before”, but he would not count on it.“I think at this point, for [Putin] to back away, just pull back without having some significant concessions, that’s not going to take place,” he said. “So I don’t know what the Biden doctrine is at this point. I think he’s not in a good position because of the divisions here and also in Europe.”The US and Russia are moving to buy themselves more time to find a diplomatic solution. This week, Antony Blinken, secretary of state, delivered written responses, co-ordinated with allies, to Russia’s demands over Europe. Moscow said there was “little cause for optimism” based on the document but suggested that a conversation would continue “on secondary issues”.The US has rebuffed Putin’s requests to bar Nato from admitting Ukraine as a member, or limit troops within the alliance, but it has opened the door to a debate about transparency on military exercises, arms control and missile deployments.With the outcome of the talks up in the air, Biden’s turn towards a more forceful strategy against Putin has been greeted with some relief in Washington. One former senior US national security official said that despite some differences with European countries, the president had managed to corral a sufficiently strong response that might give Putin some reason for pause.“If Putin undertakes some sort of military action, he will find himself with a rupture from the west,” the former official said. “He will put himself in a position of facing off quite directly with the United States and Europe, in a way we haven’t seen in decades.”Even Mitch McConnell, Republican leader in the Senate, gave Biden some credit. “They are preparing to take steps before an incursion, not afterwards.It appears to me the administration is moving in the right direction,” he said this week.Rachel Rizzo, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, noted that the possibility of moving troops to the eastern flank of Nato would have been “surprising” a few weeks ago but was now “a legitimate policy option”.“What we are seeing is the ability of this administration to pivot as the geopolitical space requires,” Rizzo said.Jeanne Shaheen, the Democratic senator from New Hampshire who co-led a congressional delegation to Ukraine last week, said in a statement to the Financial Times that Biden’s strategy was working. However, there have been doubts raised that Germany, in particular, is fully on board with the toughest sanctions proposed.“President Biden has rightly employed a ‘diplomacy first’ agenda and is utilising every aspect of our diplomatic corps to respond to Russia’s belligerence,” Shaheen said.The prospect of conflict has already sparked questions about whether the Ukraine crisis will distract Biden from China, which he has described as the US’s biggest foreign policy challenge.“The US has reduced its military too much to carry out an assertive national security strategy simultaneously in two theatres,” said the American Enterprise Institute’s Schake.But there is little doubt that what happens in Ukraine over the next few weeks will prove a pivotal moment not just for Biden but also for US foreign policy in the 21st century.“This is it, this speaks to how America’s credibility is going to work,” said Conley of the German Marshall Fund. “My question is: are we ready? Is this administration ready to take difficult steps when tested?”

88  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
89  British organisations and large businesses should prepare for possible Russian state-backed cyber attacks, a top security official warned on Friday, citing recent hacks of dozens of official Ukrainian websites.Scores of Ukrainian government computer networks were hit with a cyber attack last week that included a message, which flashed on Ukrainian computer screens: “Be afraid and wait for the worst.” The US and Nato condemned the attack, which Ukrainian officials suspected emanated from Moscow.Paul Chichester, director of operations at the National Cyber Security Centre, urged vigilance and said it was “vital that organisations follow [cyber security] guidance to ensure they are resilient”.He added: “Over several years, we have observed a pattern of malicious Russian behaviour in cyber space. Last week’s incidents in Ukraine bear the hallmarks of similar Russian activity we have observed before.”The NCSC, the defensive arm of the UK’s signal intelligence agency GCHQ, said while the UK was not attributing responsibility for the recent cyber incidents in Ukraine, it was “urgently investigating” them. It had not identified any active, Ukraine-related threats against British organisations.It pointed to the NotPetya virus attack in 2017 that is estimated to have cost companies across the world over $1.2bn. The UK has blamed that attack on Russia.The British warning mirrors a similar one from the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the FBI this month of possible cyber attacks emanating from Russia on critical infrastructure.Canada’s foreign affairs department suffered a hack on January 19, the same day that country’s top cyber agency warned of potential Russian attacks.Analysts said Russian cyber attacks could be aimed at raising the political costs for the US and Nato allies responding to a potential invasion of Ukraine, where 106,000 Russian troops have massed on the border.Steve Barclay, the UK cabinet office minister, warned this week that Britain’s public services risked being shut down by hostile cyber threats. The UK has taken a robust approach to the Russian troop build-up.Prime minister Boris Johnson warned of Russian plans for a “lightning war”, while over the weekend the UK said it had evidence that Russia’s president Vladimir Putin was seeking to install a puppet regime in Kyiv. The UK has sent 30 specialist troops to Ukraine to train the country’s armed forces in the use of 2,000 short-range anti-tank missiles supplied by Britain.Moscow has repeatedly denied that it plans to invade and senior Russian officials have blamed the west for escalating tensions by deploying forces and publishing “fake” claims of Russian regime change plots in Ukraine.To protect themselves from the risk of Ukraine-related cyber attacks, the NCSC recommended that business and large organisations patched their systems, checked data backups and practised good “cyber hygiene”.
90  China has offered support for Russia in the face of its stand-off with the US and Nato over Ukraine, saying Moscow had “reasonable security concerns” that Washington and its allies should take “seriously”.Wang Yi, the Chinese foreign minister, told Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, that European regional security could not be guaranteed by “strengthening oreven expanding military blocs”, in comments that appeared to back Russian opposition to Ukraine joining Nato in the future.Speaking on Thursday on a videoconference call with Blinken, Wang urged all parties to “abandon the cold war mentality” and called for “balanced” negotiations to resolve tensions over Ukraine, according to a Chinese foreign ministry statement.The state department said that Blinken stressed the need for de-escalation and diplomacy in his call with Wang, but also “underscored the global security and economic risks posed by further Russian aggression against Ukraine”.Russia has amassed more than 106,000 troops on its border with Ukraine, sparking fears that President Vladimir Putin is preparing to invade. Nato has beefed up its presence in eastern member states while a number of western powers have stepped up supplies of arms and equipment to Kyiv.Moscow has demanded security guarantees of the west, including that Ukraine should never become a member of Nato and that the security alliance should roll back deployment in states that joined after 1997.The US and Nato delivered formal written responses to Moscow on Wednesday, echoing previous statements that Russia’s core demands were unacceptable and that all countries should be able to ask for Nato membership.Russia said the responses left “little cause for optimism” but suggested a conversation would continue “on secondary issues”.Wang’s comments come as China prepares to host the Beijing Winter Olympics, which it hopes will be not be overshadowed by war in Ukraine. They also point to rising concern in Beijing about US efforts to bolster alliances in Asia and Europe to counter the rise of China.China and Russia have also stepped up co-operation over the past year, including holding more joint military exercises. Xi Jinping, Chinese president, also spoke to Putin more than any other foreign leader last year.Washington has warned Moscow that it will impose powerful financial sanctions in response to an invasion. In a call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday afternoon, Biden said the US and its allies were ready to “respond decisively” in the event of a Russian invasion, according to the White House.The US president also said America was exploring “additional macroeconomic support” to help Ukraine’s economy weather the pressure from Russia’s threats — and reassured the Ukrainian president that the US embassy in Kyiv remained open despite the departure of diplomats’ family members.The Biden administration is watching closely for any signs that Beijing is planning to help lessen the pressure on Moscow in the event that Washington proceeds with any sanctions.Victoria Nuland, US under-secretary for political affairs, said on Thursday it would not be in China’s interest to side with Russia.“If there is a conflict in Ukraine, it is not going to be good for China either,” Nuland said. “There will be a significant impact on the global economy. There’ll be a significant impact in the energy sphere.”Wang also called on the US to “stop playing fire on the Taiwan issue” and to “stop interfering” with the Beijing Winter Olympics, which are due to start next week. The US is not sending diplomatic representatives to the Games in protest at China’s alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang.The spectre of Taiwan-China relations has loomed large as Beijing responds to Moscow’s aggression towards Ukraine.Ukraine and Taiwan hold historic importance for Russia and China, respectively, and some experts see the US response to a Russian invasion of Ukraine as a test for how it would react to a Chinese move to invade Taiwan, a self-governing island over which Beijing claims sovereignty.
91  The UK and EU are preparing to hit new Russian gas projects with sanctions if the Kremlin orders an attack on Ukraine, the first time Europe has weighed targeting a sector it relies on for 40 per cent of its gas imports.The plans, being drawn up with US support, would severely curtail financing and technology transfer for new gas projects, according to people briefed on the discussions.The sanctions being considered reflect concern over a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine following Moscow’s deployment of more than 100,000 troops near the border with its neighbour. The measures would form part of a wider package of potential economic measures, with the severity to be adjusted depending on the scale of any Russian offensive, people close to the discussions said.While US and European officials have stressed that “all options are on the table” regarding sanctions, some countries such as Germany have urged greater caution as Europe contends with a winter gas supply crisis.However, Annalena Baerbock, German foreign minister, told the Bundestag on Thursday that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would supply natural gas from Russia to Germany, was included in the sanctions package being discussed with allies.Co-operation between the UK and EU on Russia sanctions is a sign of willingness to collaborate on foreign and defence policy despite big tensions on post-Brexit issues, such as trading arrangements for Northern Ireland.While Russia accounts for only a small proportion of the UK’s gas imports, the country’s supplies have a large impact on overall European prices, affecting UK consumers.Targeting new Russian gas developments is seen as a way of striking at the country’s main industry while potentially avoiding some of the short-term pain that would be felt in western countries if energy flows were immediately disrupted.“Europe looking to hit long-term Russian gas production capacity would likely be a step up from anything we’ve seen before,” said James Waddell at Energy Aspects. “It would hurt Russia by going after a sector they really care about, but it wouldn’t be cutting off your nose to spite your face in the way trying to restrict exports would be in the short term.”US and European officials have declined to publish a list of potential sanctions. Measures targeting Russia’s financial sector and the ability of Russian banks to deal in dollars are also under discussion.Europe’s willingness to target Russia’s vast hydrocarbons industry could affect European companies including BP, Total and Shell, which invest in the Russian gas sector. Russia is one of the world’s largest producers of oil and gas, but its energy sector relies on joint ventures with foreign companies as well as international technology and expertise.The country has plans to grow its gas industry, including expanding liquefied natural gas (LNG) developments in the far northern Yamal peninsula, where France’s Total is one of the largest investors alongside Novatek and Chinese backers. The French company has dubbed the development “the gas that came in from the cold”. The launch of the first Yamal cargoes in 2017 was hailed by Russian president Vladimir Putin as evidence of the country’s ability to overcome US sanctions.BP owns almost a fifth of Russia’s national oil champion Rosneft, which has been increasing its gas output in recent years and has ambitions to break state-backed Gazprom’s monopoly over gas exports.Last year Shell signed a five-year “strategic co-operation” agreement with Gazprom, having already worked with the company on the development of LNG projects in Russia’s far east.In 2014 US energy company ExxonMobil found its new investments in Russia essentially frozen after Washington took a harder line than European capitals when launching sanctions related to Russia’s activities in eastern Ukraine.The sanctions torpedoed one of the main expansion plans of ExxonMobil’s then chief executive Rex Tillerson, though the company’s established energy ventures in Russia were able to continue.The Ukraine crisis comes as average European gas prices have reached a record high in recent months. Russia and Gazprom have been blamed by some European politicians for stoking the gas crisis by restricting exports to long-term contracts while draining Gazprom-controlled storage facilities in Europe.Russia has pointed to its fulfilment of long-term contracts and said that approval of Nord Stream 2 — which bypasses Ukraine to run directly to Germany through the Baltic Sea — could lead to more gas flowing to Europe.The US state department said on Wednesday that Nord Stream 2 would “not move forward” if Russia invaded Ukraine.The International Energy Agency this month said it believed Russia could be supplying much more gas to Europe, accusing Moscow of throttling supplies at a time of “heightened geopolitical tensions”.Letters in response to this article:Renewables must replace gas as geopolitical priority / From Adrie de Groot, Enzersfeld, AustriaEurope can show Putin that threats to gas supply cut both ways / From Ambassador (ret.)

92  Russia said it had “little cause for optimism” on Thursday after the US rejected Moscow’s demands to roll back Nato’s expansion, but left the door open for further diplomacy as the west seeks to defuse tension over a possible invasion of Ukraine.Reacting to the written response from Washington to a list of security demands, Moscow said it would take its time to review the US missive before issuing a formal response.“You can’t say that our ideas were taken on board or [that the US and Nato] showed any kind of preparedness to listen to our concerns,” Dmitry Peskov, President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, told reporters on Thursday.The US has warned that Putin is planning a renewed invasion of Ukraine after massing 106,000 troops at its border and vowed “massive” western sanctions will be imposed in response to any further Russian aggression.Russia denies it has plans to invade but has threatened “the most unpredictable and grave consequences” for European security if the west rejects its security demands, formally outlined in two draft treaties released last month.Russian demands include a request that Nato pledges never to admit Ukraine, halt its eastward expansion, and roll back its force deployments in former communist countries in eastern Europe that joined after 1997.The US has repeatedly said this would be unacceptable while insisting it is ready to co-operate with Russia on issues such as arms control and force deployments.After the US handed over a written reply to the Russian proposals, secretary of state Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that the transatlantic alliance would not go back on its open-door policy and leave countries free to associate with Nato.Moscow claims the US and Nato are fuelling tensions around Ukraine by supplying Kyiv with arms and by training its military eight years into a slow-burning war with Russian-backed separatists in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas. The conflict, triggered shortly after Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, has killed 14,000 people.Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, said the US response “allowed us to count on the start of a serious conversation, but on secondary issues. There’s no positive reaction in the document on the main issue,” according to Interfax.Peskov would not say whether Lavrov would meet Blinken again to discuss the proposals or if Putin was prepared to hold another round of talks with US president Joe Biden.“There is always potential to continue dialogue. It’s in our interests and the Americans’ interests. Even if our views are sometimes diametrically opposed, you always need dialogue,” Peskov said.Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Victoria Nuland, the US under-secretary for political affairs, said that despite Lavrov’s comments, the US still hoped that Moscow would “come back to the table”.“The most important thing we heard from Moscow today is that the documents are with President Putin, that he is studying them. And as I said, we hope he will see here a real opportunity for a legacy of security and arms control rather than a legacy of war,” she added.
93  It hasn’t taken long for the warm glow of a cosy dinner between the EU Brexit lead Maros Sefcovic and Liz Truss, the UK foreign secretary, to begin to fade from the Brexit negotiations over the future of Northern Ireland trading arrangements.Truss’s attempt to reset the old arguments by reframing the Northern Ireland debate in the wider strategic context of EU-UK common interests — Ukraine, China, Iran, climate change — was always going to founder on the details.Even though the two sides are still keeping it deliberately civil in their bland joint statements (something Lord David Frost never achieved) there is little attempt to conceal the gulf in positions when it comes to actually implementing the Northern Ireland protocol.Boris Johnson has gone back to hurling brickbats, accusing the EU of implementing the deal he signed in an “insane and pettifogging” manner, while Truss uses her perch at the Foreign Office to post videos implicitly accusing the EU of failing to protect the peace process.The slow return to foghorn diplomacy does not go unnoticed in Brussels and nor does the deteriorating UK political context which — until Boris Johnson’s fate is decided one way or the other — now effectively paralyses the process.As one EU official explains it, this creates a negative feedback loop in Brussels: “Why would Truss cut a deal now with the prospect of a leadership election hanging in the air? And why would the [European] Commission make concessions when Truss cannot cut a deal, even if she wanted to? There are no incentives on either side to move.”So the process is stuck. But here’s a question that’s being quietly pondered in some quarters in both London and Brussels: is that really such a bad thing? Or at least, is that worse than the other alternatives on the table?The difficulty is that neither side is in a position to “win” the argument over how Northern Ireland should simultaneously remain both part of the EU single market (for goods) and part of the United Kingdom.Frost shaped up to force the issue last October, threatening Article 16 and a unilateral application of the UK’s proposed “honesty box” approach to the Irish Sea border. The EU threatened a trade war. The UK backed off.By the same token, the EU started legal action over the UK’s failure to implement the deal it agreed in 2019, but then paused it.Brussels understands that, as joint custodian of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement, it cannot force the issue without effectively taking sides in Northern Ireland’s bitterly divided political landscape. Past form says that EU leaders will be very wary of interfering with that balance.Sefcovic talks of his desire for a deal before the Stormont elections in May but when you delve into the intractable substance (as Britain after Brexit did in detail this month) and consider the wider UK political context, there is a vanishingly small chance of that happening. Indeed officials say the discussion on some key points of border management, and on State Aid, has actually moved marginally backwards.So an informal standstill, accompanied by Truss’s more diplomatic tone — and EU diplomats do credit her for not deliberately getting up everyone’s noses, all the time, like Frost did — actually works for both sides.In the meantime, the protocol, partially implemented and operating under extended “grace periods” to reduce the border frictions, continues to function, in a fashion.No one is saying this is an ideal state of affairs, or that it can continue that way indefinitely, only that it is probably better than the alternatives.Northern Ireland businesses don’t like the uncertainty, but the NI economy is doing fine.The European Commission doesn’t like the prospect of the UK codifying the grace periods with new facts on the ground, but the actual risks to the single market are small in the short term.The UK doesn’t like the border at all, but it will do the bare minimum to keep the technical discussions alive.So we stagger on and, given time, the political facts on the ground could also change quite radically in the coming months. Johnson may be ousted and a new, more pragmatic prime minister (one far less invested in denying a deal he created) may be installed.The Stormont elections may also reorder the debate. If Sinn Féin emerges as the largest party and Unionists refuse to work with it in government, collapsing the power-sharing executive and returning power to London, a new set of political imperatives takes hold.As David Lidington, the former de facto deputy prime minister in Theresa May’s administration, observed this week at a UK in a Changing Europe event, if power did return to Westminster (where Sinn Féin refuses to take its seats in a parliament now making the rules for Northern Ireland) the UK government might also change its position.“In such circumstances, I think the UK government may see the attraction in doing a deal on the Northern Ireland protocol to mollify those in Northern Ireland who will be furious and frustrated at the return of direct rule from London,” he wrote.Such a pause and changes in the political landscape might also create space for a deeper rethink of a deal that is proving politically very difficult and continues to poison the wider EU-UK relationship, putting a lock on exploring some of those improvements we discussed last week.As David Henig — a former UK civil servant and prominent critic of many Brexit decisions taken by the Johnson government — argues in a forthcoming paper, the ultimate solution may lie in seeking a “covenantal relationship” based on more open-ended political commitments, rather than text-based protocol discussions.“A treaty can after all easily be broken, as we have seen, whereas a deeper relationship is likely to endure,” he writes for the European Centre for International Political Economy, arguing that the spirit that created the 1998 peace agreement will need to be applied to this intractable problem if an enduring solution is to be found.All that is for the future. For now, amid all the huffing and puffing in Westminster, it’s time to breathe.To follow the news driving the European political agenda, sign up for Europe Express, written by my colleague Valentina Pop in Brussels and delivered to your inbox every weekday morning by 7am CET.Quantifying the effects of Brexit — and disaggregating them from other factors, such as Covid-19 — will keep lots of economists busy for years to come, but there was a fascinating contribution to the literature this week from two economists at the London School of Economics.This paper from Swati Dhingra and Thomas Sampson at the LSE’s Centre for Economic Performance finds that the uncertainty over Brexit as the UK negotiated its exit between 2016 and 2019 caused material negative effects to GDP growth — even though aggregate trade with the EU broadly held up over that period.So despite physical trade not being affected, the shock of the 2016 Brexit vote led to higher import costs and consumer prices, lower investment and slower wage and GDP growth. They conclude that voting to leave the EU reduced UK GDP by about 2 to 3 per cent by the end of 2019, which translates into a loss of £650 to £1,000 per person, per year.As Sampson explains, the chart above shows UK GDP growing faster than the “rest of G7” from 2013 to the start of 2016, but then slowing from 2017 onwards, as other G7 members pull ahead.The paper is quite technical, but Sampson argues that the “totality of the evidence” they present supports the conclusion that Brexit was a major factor in this weaker UK performance — driven by lower investment, reduced productivity and sterling depreciation rather than shifts in trade.As Sampson observes, on the upside, this “could be good news” if the Trade and Cooperation Agreement with the EU generates renewed certainty and leads to a rebound in investment.Of course, things could go the other way if the non-tariff barriers introduced by the TCA that have led to an approximately 15 per cent drop in imports and exports from 2019 levels since the border was introduced in 2021, act as a further drag on growth.Given that we’re only halfway through implementing full-border controls for goods and services — with much uncertainty over how these will affect trade and investment in the medium term — that chapter is yet to be written.But the UK must hope that, based on this work, the recent Brexit past does not prove to be a guide to future performance.And, finally, three unmissable Brexit storiesPost-Brexit divergence in financial services has the potential to create an opportunity for European banks lending to big British companies. While the EU has decided to break with new global rules governing lending to corporates, the UK has not. “Open markets only work if everybody is playing by global rules,” a senior executive at a UK bank tells financial regulation editor Laura Noonan.But elsewhere there was a vote of confidence this week in post-Brexit Britain from Citigroup. The US bank is to spend £100m refurbishing its 42-storey tower at 25 Canada Square in Canary Wharf, which it bought for £1.2bn in 2019 as part of a global strategy to own, not rent, its major office buildings to save costs.As tensions between Russia and the west over Ukraine mount, trade writer Alan Beattie looks back at the EU’s misguided attempt to use trade as a tool to pull Kyiv into its economic orbit via a “deep and comprehensive free trade area”. As Alan points out, some optimistic souls even saw the DCFTA as a possible model for the UK’s relationship with the EU after Brexit. Not any longer.

95  Early into his term, US president Joe Biden waived US sanctions on the Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Why sour US-Germany relations at the moment he was proclaiming America was back? Discretion would be the better part of valour. In any case, Germany’s gas dependence was a logical outcome of former chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision to hasten the end of German nuclear power. With hindsight, Biden might regret that waiver. Germany’s reluctance to offend its main gas supplier is a leading cause of transatlantic tension amid Russian president Vladimir Putin’s Ukrainian troop build-up. Half of Germany’s gas supply comes from Russia. In normal times that would be placing too many eggs in one basket. In mid-winter, with rising energy inflation and Russian units amassing on Ukraine’s border, it gives Putin a weapon. The curious thing — and a source of anguish in Washington — is that Germany still half-believes the pipeline will give it leverage over Russia, rather than vice versa. Some German ministers echo Merkel’s claim that Nord Stream 2 is a commercial project with no geopolitical implications. They cannot have it both ways. Either the pipeline is an incentive for Russia to behave well or it has no impact either way. The third explanation — that it gives Russia a tool to divide Europe — has more going for it. In the face of the biggest potential threat to Europe’s security in decades, the US is still trying to forge consensus among its allies. Germany is the biggest foot-dragger. The question is how Biden can get round this. One solution, which he is pursuing, is to find Germany alternative suppliers. Qatar is top of the list — as are stepped-up US liquefied natural gas shipments. But the logistical challenges are big. There appears to be no appetite in Germany to change its mind on nuclear energy. Germany’s anti-nuclear feelings have been high since the Soviet Union’s 1986 Chernobyl meltdown. Merkel’s move was prompted by a public backlash following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan. But the goal did not originate with her. Gerhard Schröder, Merkel’s predecessor, was the first to announce Germany would phase out nuclear energy. Anti-nuclear sentiment seems to trump geopolitics. This month, Germany shut down three of its remaining six nuclear plants, weeks after Russian troops had concentrated on Ukraine’s border. The rest will be closed later this year. Anti-nuclear feeling also seems to outweigh concern over global warming. France is upping its bet on nuclear energy while Germany, which has higher carbon intensity than most of its neighbours, insists that Brussels should not treat nuclear energy as a renewable. This puts Germany in a tenacious minority. In the build-up to the 2003 Iraq war, Robert Kagan famously argued that Europeans were from Venus and Americans were from Mars. That captured the mood before the Iraq invasion — Germany and France were both implacably opposed. Events proved them right. It does not capture today’s Europe. Many of Nato’s members, notably France, the UK, Poland, the Baltic states, are as hawkish on Russia as America is. But Venus has served as a good metaphor for Germany since the second world war. With the noblest of intentions, Germany has been driven by a desire to avoid repeating history and atone for its destruction of Russia. The impulse is inherently moral. That does not mean it is practical. Without much evidence, Germany believed that its commercial ties with the Soviet Union played a big role in ending the cold war. There are few grounds to think the threat of financial penalties will make Putin think twice. Russia has amassed $620bn in reserves since it annexed Crimea in 2014. It is also diversifying its markets: China is set to become one of Russia’s largest gas buyers. Berlin, meanwhile, is blocking export of German-made weapons to Ukraine. On Wednesday, Christine Lambrecht, Germany’s defence minister, told Kyiv that Berlin’s gift of 5,000 helmets was “a very clear signal we stand by your side”. As the world ventures further into the jungle of great power rivalry, Germany’s approach offers a test case of whether its mix of ethics and commerce — “Merkantilism”, as two scholars recently dubbed it — can calm the region. The world would be a better place were it to work. The evidence so far suggests that Germany has become useful to Russia, the Mars of this crisis, even if it does not mean to be.
96  Denmark has begun withdrawing special forces troops from Mali, after the west African country’s military junta insisted on their departure.Relations between Mali, at the heart of a jihadi insurgency that has killed thousands of people and displaced millions, and France, which is leading the counter-terrorism fight, are rapidly deteriorating. The junta earlier this week asked Denmark to withdraw its 100 special forces troops from a French-led European special forces mission.Mali’s interim government, led by the head of a 2020 coup that ousted the democratically elected president, has taken an increasingly hostile stance towards ex-colonial power France and moved closer to former cold war ally Russia.“The coup generals last night sent out a public statement where they again reiterated that Denmark is not welcome in Mali, and we of course will not put up with that,” Jeppe Kofod, Danish foreign minister, told reporters on Thursday.The move comes the day after 15 European countries led by France said in a statement that the deployment was legal and called on Bamako “to respect the solid grounds on which our diplomatic and operational co-operation are based”.In a sign of how far relations with France have deteriorated, Mali’s interim foreign minister told local radio on Wednesday night that Paris should stop interfering in Mali and should get “rid of its colonial reflexes”.Al-Qaeda and Isis-linked groups control wide swaths of territory across central and northern Mali, which jihadis briefly captured in 2012, sparking a brutal spiral of violence that has spread into neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger.The Danish troops arrived in the country last week to join the European counterterror force, known as Takuba. But the Malian government said in a statement that “no accord authorises the deployment of Danish special forces”.Takuba is meant in part to replace Operation Barkhane, France’s 5,000-troop mission in the Sahel, which has been active since 2013 and is being wound down. It is mainly French, but includes troops from Estonia, Lithuania, Romania and other nations. Norway, Portugal and Hungary are waiting for approval to deploy troops to join Takuba.Mali’s government reacted with outrage to France’s decision last summer to halve the number of troops in Barkhane and close some of its bases in the country in order to focus more closely on the tri-border region between Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso.With France departing, the junta has turned to the Kremlin-linked Wagner Group, whose mercenaries have been accused by the UN of possible war crimes in Libya and the Central African Republic. The junta denies that it has contracted with Wagner, which western analysts say is an unofficial arm of Moscow.But diplomats in Bamako and a northern Mali official told the Financial Times that hundreds of Wagner Group’s fighters were already in the country. General Stephen Townsend, the head of US Africa Command, echoed this sentiment in an interview with Voice of America last week.“They’re deploying there, supported by the Russian military. Russian Air Force aeroplanes are delivering them,” Townsend said. “The world can see this happening.It’s a great concern to us.”William Linder, president of risk consultancy 14 North Strategies and an ex-CIA officer with experience in the Sahel, said: “Mali’s junta, wittingly or unwittingly, is making itself a pawn in Russia’s game.”He added: “The junta probably senses that opposing the French, with Russian encouragement, wins them legitimacy and public support. Ultimately, Russia will benefit, Europe will be less unified and jihadists will gain an upper hand in the Sahel.”
97  South-east European countries have backed Nato’s military build-up in the Black Sea region as tensions escalate between Russia and Ukraine, with Hungary striking a lone chord of defiance.Budapest, which has good relations with Moscow, has threatened to stay out of the alliance’s efforts to support Kyiv, citing longtime disagreements with Ukraine, but is expected to be part of a broader strengthening of Nato’s eastern flank as fears of conflict rise.Romania is strongly in favour of Nato’s preparations. President Klaus Iohannis said on Wednesday that “the security crisis created by Russia is not just about Ukraine.but about the security of the entire Euro-Atlantic area”. He added that Russia wanted to “unacceptably change the parameters of the European security architecture”.Romania, which shares a 600km border with Ukraine, was preparing for war and potential consequences such as a refugee crisis, an economic downturn or Russian curbs on energy supplies, Iohannis said.According to a survey by pollster Avangarde, two-thirds of Romanians feel Russian-Ukrainian tensions threaten their country, with a majority in support of a Nato build-up in response. About three-quarters of respondents in another poll by Inscop support the country’s Nato membership, including the presence of US military bases in the country.“We are ready to host an increased allied presence in our territory,” Iohannis said, adding that Bucharest was in contact with allies over increasing the number of troops in the country.France has said it is ready to send troops to Romania, while US president Joe Biden has also said Nato’s troop presence in Romania may be increased as the Ukrainian conflict intensifies.In Bulgaria, premier Kiril Petkov has discussed his country’s level of involvement with his security council. “We will focus on developing further Bulgarian military capabilities and potential under Bulgarian command, with help of our allies where needed,” Petkov tweeted.According to a strategy presentation on Wednesday by defence minister Stefan Yanev, a Bulgarian army battalion may join Nato exercises if needed. “Russia’s position is difficult to interpret as a positive signal,” Yanev said.Spain and the Netherlands have already sent fighter jets to Bulgaria to help it maintain air patrols as Sofia lacks sufficient air defence capabilities. Spain has also sent a frigate to the Black Sea several weeks ahead of schedule.Nato wants stronger defence capabilities in the region, including the four countries that share a border with Ukraine or the Black Sea — Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria.Asked about a troop deployment to Slovakia and Hungary, a Nato spokesperson quoted secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg, who on Monday said the enhanced presence in eastern Europe “could include the deployment of additional Nato battle groups. These deployments are proportionate and in line with our international commitments and they reinforce European security for all of us.”Slovakia’s foreign minister Ivan Korcok told the Financial Times: “In this critical situation I consider this proposal a logical step aiming at strengthening defence and deterrence in our eastern flank.”Hungary has stayed silent about plans to participate in the Nato forces’ build-up. Its foreign ministry told the FT that it wanted to “avoid a new cold war” and preferred direct talks between Russia and the west rather than amplifying tensions, without going into detail.Around 1,000 Nato troops could be deployed to Hungary in battle groups similar to those already in the Baltics, CNN reported on Wednesday. Hungarian news website HVG quoted an unnamed government official who confirmed talks were continuing but said no decision had been taken.Budapest has threatened to stay out of western efforts to support Ukraine. “We ask [Russia and the west] to speak to one another directly, and we very clearly tell them we want no part in their conflict in this region,” Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said on Wednesday in the daily Magyar Nemzet, which usually reflects the government’s political line.Prime minister Viktor Orban is due to travel to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin next week.Szijjarto told Magyar Nemzet that Budapest was committed to Moscow while it was wary of Kyiv. Asked about western demands for Hungary not to tighten bilateral ties with Putin, Szijjarto said: “Nobody can request such a thing from us.”He said Russia supplied Hungary with Covid vaccines when supplies from other sources were scarce, bought gas cheaply from Moscow, and that “a single text message to the Russian foreign minister” had been enough to evacuate Hungarian citizens from Kazakhstan this month.In contrast, Kyiv curtailed the rights of more than 100,000 ethnic Hungarians living in western Ukraine, Szijjarto said in the interview. He recounted long disagreements over the use of minority languages or rights to hold public office. A failure to resolve the disputes led Hungary to veto Ukraine’s bid to start accession talks with either Nato or the EU.“Even in the context of eastern European security, I honestly told my EU and Nato colleagues: unless Ukrainians step back from this politics, the Hungarian government will have very limited options to support Ukraine in any way, even in this conflict,” he said.He added that the approach to Ukraine was not influenced by strong bilateral ties with Moscow, saying it had “no Russian dimension”.Letter in response to this article:Hungary’s stance on Russia is shaped by its history / From Andreas D Stefanovszky, Budapest, Hungary
98  For James Joyce’s literary alter ego, history may be the nightmare from which he is famously trying to awake. For many more of us, that nightmare might be Ulysses itself.Notoriously impenetrable in parts, the Irish classic turns 100 on February 2 as Ireland enters the final year of its decade of centenaries — a rolling commemoration of the events that were as pivotal to its history as Ulysses has proved formative to world literature.So, if ever there was a time to crack what has been dubbed Ireland’s most-popular least-read book, it could be now — indeed, Paschal Donohoe, Ireland’s bibliophile finance minister, admitted Ulysses had last year been his “great Covid project” after he finally found “the courage to pick it up and begin delving into the extraordinary world” inside.With images of Anglo-Irish Treaty negotiations of 100 years ago fresh in my mind from a fascinating exhibition at Dublin Castle — which was handed over to a provisional Irish government in a major step towards full independence just weeks before the novel’s publication in Paris in 1922 — I, too, have dragged my long-owned but still-unread tome off the shelf.I can take heart from Dan Mulhall, Ireland’s ambassador to the US, whose Ulysses: A Reader’s Odyssey is just published. He takes a practical approach: if some bits of the book prove just too baffling, simply bin them and skip on a few pages.But he also offers a compelling reason to tackle it now: “Ulysses is an odyssey through the English language.it’s an odyssey of character.but it’s also an odyssey through the life of the world in the early 20th century,” he told an online book launch. “And it so happens that those themes have come back again in our day 100 years after Joyce published his novel.”Ulysses, loosely modelled on Homer’s epic account of Odysseus’ return home after the Trojan War, takes place on a single day in Dublin — June 16, 1904 — and Mulhall sees his portrayal of that time as a depiction of “a society on the cusp of change”.But Joyce wrote the novel in exile in Trieste, in the then Austro-Hungarian empire, as well as in Zurich and Paris, as the first world war raged and in its immediate aftermath.Ireland, at the time, was living through its own upheaval, from the Dublin lockout of 1913-14, a huge and pivotal industrial dispute, to the Easter Rising of 1916, in which an armed nationalist rebellion rose up against British rule and proclaimed an Irish Republic, to the 1919-21 war of independence, the partition of Ireland and the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921.Just over a fortnight after Ulysses was published, the British handed over Dublin Castle to nationalist leader Michael Collins; 1922 was the year in which civil war broke out between the supporters and opponents of the Treaty and the year of the foundation of the Irish Free State.Séamus Cannon, chair of the Friends of Joyce Tower Society (based in the 19th century fort just south of Dublin where Joyce lived for a week in 1904 and where Ulysses opens), says the civil war years are “not a centenary people feel comfortable with. So it’s nice to have Joyce to commemorate”.A hundred years since its publication, Sinn Féin, the nationalist party founded in 1905 by Treaty negotiator Arthur Griffith (who gets a look-in in Ulysses), is cementing its position as the most popular party north and south of the border. It is widely forecast to come out on top in Northern Irish elections in May and in Ireland’s election due in three years.Joyce, Cannon reckons, “would have regarded himself as an Irish nationalist, but a non-violent one” and he pokes fun at the Irish language revival by having a milkmaid addressed in Irish by an Englishman — only for her not to understand him.Joyce might, then, have smiled at novelist and satirist Flann O’Brien’s joke of translating Ulysses into Irish — something he didn’t do (others did).According to the writer, one of Ireland’s other literary greats, “If they won’t read it in English, I said to myself, bedamn but we’ll put them in the situation that they can boast they won’t read it in Irish aither.”Spurred on by the minister’s example and Cannon’s description of Ulysses as “so funny and enjoyable”, I am determined that this will be the year I do.
99  The EU has launched a case against China at the World Trade Organization over its de facto ban on exports from Lithuania in a dispute over Taiwan, adding to tensions between two of the world’s biggest economies.Brussels said China had blocked imports from Lithuania and other EU member states since December if they had Lithuanian content in their products.“These actions, which appear to be discriminatory and illegal under WTO rules, are harming exporters both in Lithuania and elsewhere in the EU,” the European Commission stated.Valdis Dombrovskis, the trade commissioner, said: “The EU is determined to act as one and act fast against measures in breach of WTO rules which threaten the integrity of our single market. We are in parallel pursuing our diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the situation.”Dombrovskis told reporters the EU would drop the case if China ended its measures.Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania’s foreign minister, welcomed the decision and the solidarity shown by other EU countries. “This step is a clear message to China that the EU will not tolerate politically motivated acts of economic coercion,” he said.Landsbergis added that Lithuania wanted to de-escalate the situation but needed to protect both its interests and those of its companies and foreign investors.The dispute began after Vilnius permitted a Taiwan representative office to open. Beijing considers the island part of its territory and acts against those who recognise its existence formally.Other EU states host Taipei representative offices, using the name of the Taiwanese capital to avoid disputes with China. Beijing stripped diplomats from the Baltic country of their diplomatic status and blocked imports.The commission said it had evidence that Beijing had refused to clear Lithuanian goods through customs and rejected import applications from the country. It also said China pressured EU companies to remove Lithuanian parts from their supply chains.Officials said China blamed a “technical glitch” for the fact that customs software rejected requests.Taiwan has been buying many of the goods turned away by China and set up a $200m investment fund for Lithuania. Lithuanian exports to China fell by 91 per cent in December 2021 compared with the previous year.Taipei pledged to give Lithuania and the EU its full support. “We firmly believe that any behaviour that violates international norms will be condemned and corrected,” said Joanne Ou, a Taiwan foreign ministry spokesperson.Beijing lambasted the EU’s actions, saying the issue was a bilateral one. “The problem between China and Lithuania is a political problem, not an economic problem. The problem between China and Lithuania is the result of Lithuania’s treachery and damage to China’s interests,” said Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry.The EU has few legal tools with which to hit back at China. It has proposed an anti-coercion instrument that would allow the commission to take urgent tit-for-tat measures such as an import ban. Dombrovskis urged member states and the European Parliament to approve the tool as soon as possible.Consultations at the WTO will last for 60 days, after which the EU can ask for an adjudication panel that will take at least six months to reach a verdict but could allow Brussels to impose retaliatory tariffs. If the decision goes against China, it can forestall punishment by appealing.The WTO’s appellate body is not functioning but members, including the EU and China, have set up a parallel system.The EU expects China to abide by any final ruling and end the ban. Support for the WTO complaint among member states was unanimous, officials said.But several countries believe Vilnius has needlessly provoked China. Germany is particularly anxious to preserve access to the lucrative Chinese market.“There is a modus operandi on Taiwanese representations in the EU. Lithuania did not consult with any member state before it took this decision and now requires unconditional solidarity from EU member states,” said one EU diplomat. He warned that the bloc should not allow relations with China to be driven by “ad hoc events”.Dombrovskis said he hoped the dispute would not damage wider co-operation on issues such as climate change. “We aim to deepen and strengthen our relationship with China.”
100  Buongiorno and welcome to Europe Express.Italy’s presidential election enters a hot phase today, with political blocs able to declare their favourite candidate a winner with a simple majority. If only they could agree on what to do about Mario Draghi. We’ll explore the latest and who some of the floated names are.On the eastern front, Russia got its written reply from the US yesterday: unsurprisingly, Nato’s door remains open to new members — the opposite of what the Kremlin wanted to hear. Meanwhile, European Central Bank warned lenders with significant Russian exposure to ready themselves for sanctions in case of an attack on Ukraine. Nothing to see here, Vladimir Putin told Italian business leaders, urging them to “feel as comfortable as possible” about the Russian market.Speaking of Ukraine, I’ll bring you up to speed on why a proposal for an EU military training mission caused disagreement among EU foreign ministers earlier this week.And in EU antitrust news, Intel scored a provisional victory in a case dating back some 20 years that pinged back and forth in the EU court system and still has one appeal left. One thing all sides can agree on: faster procedures.Political negotiations over whom to anoint as Italy’s next head of state are intensifying, as the presidential election process moves into a hot phase today following three inconclusive rounds, write Amy Kazmin and Davide Ghiglione in Rome.Italian lawmakers are effectively deciding the future of Mario Draghi, the former European Central Bank president, who was pulled out of retirement last year to lead the government amid a deep political, economic and health crisis.With his long career in public service and stellar international reputation, Draghi has long been considered a natural head of state.But members of Draghi’s fragile national unity government fear that him moving into the country’s lavish presidential palace could propel Italy into early elections, if parties cannot agree on a new prime minister — a tricky task given looming general elections in 2023. Yet they have also been unable to reach a consensus on any other mutually acceptable presidential candidates.Amid this fundamental dilemma, lawmakers have been casting a deluge of blank ballots in the first three rounds of voting, reflecting their agreement to avoid any result that could unsettle the delicate political equilibrium amid ongoing negotiations.“It is clear all political forces want to ensure a certain continuity and are aware that they need to vote for a president with a pro-European approach, able to handle the national recovery and resilience plan as well as the economic and health crisis,” said Cristina Fasone, a professor of comparative public law at Rome’s LUISS University.“But that doesn’t necessarily mean that they will be able to prevent a political crisis from happening,” she said.When the fourth round of voting takes place later this morning, the threshold for victory will be lower: a presidential candidate will need just half the votes cast to be declared the new head of state, making it easier for a political bloc to push a favoured nominee to victory.In the first three rounds, victory would have required a two-thirds majority.With pressure mounting, Enrico Letta, leader of the centre-left Democratic party, has declared that Italy’s political leaders must work quickly to forge a deal on the way forward.“Our proposal is to lock ourselves in a room and throw away the key, with only bread and water on hand until we reach a definitive solution,” he said.In recent days, rightwing parties have proposed several potential alternative candidates for the presidency, including Elisabetta Casellati, who is president of the Senate and a member of Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party.But all the right’s proposals have been forcefully rejected by the left, which has, however, struggled to propose its own alternatives.“There is still a lot of confusion among Italian political parties,” Fasone said. “The names that have been put forward by the parties do not necessarily have any value.”The outcome of the process will have repercussions not just for Italy but for the entire EU, given the country, as the largest recipient of the EU’s €800bn recovery fund, is due to receive nearly €200bn in grants and loans in a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reboot its economy.Worker shortages are omnipresent in Europe and particularly acute in IT and healthcare; in construction, where demand has been turbocharged by booming house prices and an infusion of EU funding for green retrofitting projects; and in hospitality, where ever-changing Covid rules make jobs seem less secure. (More here)When EU foreign ministers earlier this week were unable to give their green light to a military training mission to Ukraine, the discussion wasn’t even about the kind of combat training the US, the UK and Canada are conducting.Rather, the issue was about how much visibility to give to six to 10 advisers (up to 35 at a later stage) the EU wants to send to Ukraine to help out with a revamp of the country’s military education system, which still uses Soviet-era methods.Out of four options put forward by the EU’s diplomatic service (EEAS) in December, two are still on the table. First, a classic EU common security and defence mission with its own headquarters and command and control structures, which was the preferred choice of most countries on Monday.The EEAS paper, seen by Europe Express, describes this option as having “high political visibility in Ukraine and demonstrates the EU engagement in the country”. The downside, which seems to have spooked some capitals, is that “the possible impact on EU’s broader policies and interests in the region is difficult to predict, especially in light of recent developments and increasing tensions caused by the build-up of Russian troops in and around Ukraine”.The ministers of Germany, Italy, Spain and Greece would rather go with the other, less visible, but also faster option — a so-called “assistance measure” funded through the EU’s new financial instrument called the European Peace Facility. This would allow a faster deployment as it would skip the months of preparations, planning and setting up command and control structures. And without much visibility for the EU, “this option would be more adapted to current geopolitical circumstances” the EEAS paper reads.A spokesperson for Germany’s foreign ministry yesterday said EU countries were in agreement over the mission but were still discussing the instrument and legal basis for it — something Berlin hopes can be swiftly resolved. The spokesperson reiterated Berlin’s position that their preferred option was the one via the European Peace Facility.EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell also expressed confidence (around min. 1.35.36 of this panel discussion) that an agreement will be reached soon on what he described a “symbolic” mission, anyway: “Maybe without the crisis they would continue procrastinating and debating endlessly, but thanks to the crisis I think the decision will be taken.”US chip giant Intel scored a win against the European Commission yesterday in a case dating back to the early 2000s, but the legal wrangling will go on for even more years, highlighting the need for more efficient rules on Big Tech, writes Javier Espinoza in Brussels.The US company is still fighting a €1.06bn fine imposed by Brussels in 2009 for allegedly trying to undermine a competitor.This dates back to when EU regulators penalised the company for attempting to disadvantage competitor Advanced Micro Devices by handing out rebates to computer makers, including Dell in exchange for buying the majority of their chips from Intel.In the two decades since the original complaint was submitted, the case made its way to the EU’s top court, which partly upheld the decision but in a rare move sent the case back to the lower General Court. Yesterday, the General Court annulled the fine and criticised the commission for its “incomplete analysis” that did not meet legal standards.The commission can still appeal against the ruling. Margrethe Vestager, the bloc’s competition chief, accepted defeat and said she would “study in detail what we can learn from this judgment; what is the balance between the things we won and the things we lost and the annulment of the fine”.Legal experts said the judgment was damning for the commission’s record. Damien Geradin, a Brussels-based lawyer, said: “This is a win for those seeking a more economic and less formalistic approach to abuses.”Consumer group BEUC deplored the ruling and said the lengthy legal battle only made the case for “an urgent, speeding up of antitrust procedures”.Intel said it would comment only after completing its own review of the judgment.
101  Seven years on from a devastating artillery strike on his home town of Mariupol, on Ukraine’s eastern flank, Vitaly Dragniev said he felt a deep sense of unease at the renewed threat of bloodshed.“Of course I feel more vulnerable here. It’s just 30km from Russia and 10km from the front line,” he said, referring to the contact line with Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine’s Donbas region.He recalls with pain the morning of January 24 2015 when his neighbourhood was the site of one of the most infamous incidents of the long-running conflict with the separatists. In the space of 30 seconds, 126 rockets blitzed the area of Soviet-era housing blocks, killing 30 civilians, including two children, and injuring 117 others.Ballistic evidence showed the artillery had been fired from nearby separatists’ positions. Some locals still disbelieve it but Dragniev was adamant. “It was the Russians, the invaders,” the 35-year-old said as he waited outside a supermarket close to where the missiles struck.Mariupol is again in the line of fire, as the city’s 565,000 residents weigh the threat of renewed Russian aggression, even if Ukrainian officials insist that talk of an invasion is an elaborate Kremlin bluff.Ukraine says Russia has amassed at least 127,000 troops at various points along the border, including in occupied Crimea and the two breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. On Tuesday, the Kremlin put its troops in the Rostov area to the east of Mariupol on heightened combat readiness.Mariupol was briefly captured by the separatists in 2014 before Ukrainian forces retook control. Home to a naval port and two of Europe’s biggest steelworks, it is a target for Russian forces should President Vladimir Putin choose to attack Ukraine again — as the US and UK predict with increasing insistence.If Russian forces were to sweep westwards, either to secure a corridor from the mainland to the Crimean Peninsula it seized in 2014, or to carve off a coastal strip of land all the way to Odesa, Mariupol lies in the way. Capturing the city would also deprive Ukraine of port access to the Sea of Azov, an important export route.“I think we here in Mariupol will be the first to be targeted by attacks and occupation,” said Yevhen, a lawyer who had just returned to the city from Kyiv.“I’ve no plans to flee, I’d rather take up arms and fight. This is my home,” he continued. “Putin says we’re brothers but he’s doing everything the opposite way since they grabbed Crimea from us and occupied Donetsk and Luhansk.”Ukrainian officials continue to play down the risk of a wider war — in the same breath asserting that its well-trained, better-equipped and battle-hardened army would be able to hold its own.“There’s no panic. The army is much stronger than in 2014. Everything will be OK,” said a military policeman stationed at a checkpoint outside the city, when asked about the lack of visibly reinforced positions.Vadym Boychenko, Mariupol mayor, also minimised the imminent threat. “War is playing out on TV and social media. But I really don’t think there’s a risk of such a war,” he said in a Financial Times interview.He continued sarcastically referring to Russia: “There’s no sign of increased activity by our eastern ‘friends’ [Russia]. I think our politician friends [in the west] are pumping up the situation. This is part of the negotiation and everyone wants to flex their muscles.”Ihor Dyumin, an army captain speaking from the local military headquarters, insisted that “the forces based in Mariupol and the region are sufficient and capable of pushing back the enemy, from the ground, sea and air”.However, a National Guard sergeant who declined to give his name was less sanguine about the invasion threat. “It’s scary, I think there’s a 50/50 chance it will happen,” he said.Boychenko, the mayor, made the point that the largely Russian-speaking population of Mariupol had since 2014 become more pro-Ukrainian, after the city absorbed 100,000 displaced people from Donetsk. It has also put money into rebuilding schools, hospitals and roads.But loyalties remain divided.“Of course we’re frightened that a full-blown war can break out.maybe Russia will invade,” said Veronika, rocking her baby’s pram on a snowy sidewalk. But she added: “Provocations can happen from both sides.” She blamed Ukrainian forces for the deadly 2015 rocket attack.Nella Vasylivna, a pensioner born in Russia to Ukrainian parents, said: “I think it’s all a provocation.” The US was “ratcheting up the situation” with its plans to increase its military presence in eastern Europe, “and now they want to be in Ukraine”.At the giant Azovstal steel mill, construction worker Oleksiy sipped a morning vodka and lamented a “very bad” situation because “the common folk who are not to blame for anything will suffer most”.“There will be no war,” his workmate chimed in. “You’re asking us what we want for a future but the reality is that they’re all — the higher powers — deciding our fates for us.Russia, England, Germany, the US, everyone.”
102  Germany’s former economy minister Peter Altmaier promised it would act as the “economic locomotive” that pulled the world out of its Covid-19 crisis — but instead the country now looks more like Europe’s laggard.For a while, Germany was a pillar of relative resilience, its economy shrinking less than most of Europe in 2020. However, for the past year other countries have been rebounding faster and even Italy is expected to regain pre-pandemic levels of gross domestic product before Germany, which is teetering on the brink of a winter recession.“Germany had a very good first half of the crisis, but in 2021 things reversed,” said Gilles Moec, chief economist at French insurer Axa, adding that weaknesses in the economy were evident “before the pandemic when Germany was already underperforming”.Much of the recent underperformance of Europe’s largest economy stems from its greater exposure to global supply chain bottlenecks that have hit manufacturing, as well as a weaker recovery in household spending, economists said.The country’s place near the foot of the European growth table was confirmed this month when its Federal Statistical Office estimated that national output grew 2.7 per cent last year — less than half the expected French and Italian rates and well below the 5.1 per cent growth forecast for the eurozone overall.When quarterly GDP figures are published for Germany and France on Friday, they are set to underscore the diverging performance of the eurozone’s two largest economies. Analysts expect the German economy to even shrink slightly in the final three months of 2021 compared with the previous quarter, while France is expected to grow by 0.5 per cent. This week the IMF blamed “supply disruptions” for downgrading its 2022 German growth forecast from 4.6 per cent to 3.8 per cent.The stiffening headwinds underline the challenges confronting Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s coalition government, especially as it plans to squeeze public spending next year when Germany’s constitutional debt brake comes back into force.Robert Habeck, economy minister, said on Wednesday that “the consequences of the corona pandemic are still being felt and a number of companies are struggling with them”. But despite these “major challenges” he expected the economy to rebound with growth of 3.6 per cent this year.While most economists agree on the sources of Germany’s recent weakness, there is less consensus on whether the country is likely to catch up quickly or remain in the doldrums for a prolonged period.The answer is likely to hinge on how long supply snarl-ups continue to leave manufacturers short of many materials from semiconductors to lithium — preventing them from fulfilling record order books.“Germany is an open and trade-integrated economy so it is more affected by the supply problems that have been created by the pandemic,” said Salomon Fiedler, an economist at investment bank Berenberg.One of the hardest hit areas has been Germany’s carmaking industry, in which domestic production slumped 12 per cent last year to 3.1m vehicles — down more than 50 per cent from pre-pandemic levels in 2019.Overall industrial production in Germany was still 7 per cent below pre-crisis levels in November, while in France it was down 5 per cent and in Italy, the eurozone’s third-biggest economy, it was even up slightly.Marco Valli, chief European economist at UniCredit in Milan, said Germany was held back by its greater reliance on making vehicles, machinery and equipment. “The pandemic has provided a boost for consumer goods and this is much higher for both France and Italy,” he said.Economists said Germany’s underperformance in 2021 was also related to a shortfall in household spending, which was still 2 per cent below pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter of last year, while French household spending was down less than 1 per cent.“France has had a stronger recovery of private consumption,” said Katharina Utermöhl, senior economist at German insurer Allianz. “While Germany’s fiscal response was larger, the fear factor among people has been greater.”Germany has struggled to vaccinate people as fast as its neighbours, with 72.7 per cent of its citizens fully vaccinated, compared with more than 75 per cent in France and Italy. Because unvaccinated people face rising Covid-19 restrictions, this is likely to further restrict Germany’s consumer recovery.Labour shortages are another constraint. Detlef Scheele, head of the Federal Employment Agency, has estimated the country needs to bring in 400,000 skilled foreign workers a year — far more than it has done recently — to offset the impact of its ageing workforce.Germany is also likely to be hit by the slowdown in China, its second-largest export market after the US. “If the market on which Germany has been betting for many years is disappointing then, as an export machine, you have a problem,” said Axa’s Moec.Joachim Lang, director-general of Germany’s BDI business lobby group, said the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant will cause further disruption to factory production in China and other Asian countries that “threatens to affect supply chains again this year”. Nonetheless, most economists still expect Germany to start regaining lost ground once supply bottlenecks ease and coronavirus restrictions are lifted. With a final fiscal stimulus this year — financed by issuing as much as €100bn of extra debt and €7.4bn from the EU recovery fund — the country “could go from one extreme to the other: from recession to growth champion,” said Carsten Brzeski, an economist at Dutch bank ING.There were early signs of optimism in IHS Markit’s latest purchasing managers’ index survey of German businesses on Monday, which reported its highest level since September and “tentative signs of easing” in supply chain problems.UniCredit’s Valli predicted Germany’s economy would lag behind France and Italy again this year — before outstripping them with growth of 3.8 per cent in 2023.“We expect supply bottlenecks to have faded in 2023 and then we expect the German economy to catch up,” he said.
103  The writer is head of macro research at the BlackRock Investment InstituteEurope is changing its rule book. The European Central Bank presented a new monetary policy strategy last autumn and is putting it to the test this year.That comes as discussions about reforming Europe’s fiscal framework are getting under way under the French EU presidency. Changes are needed.Disbursements from the Next Generation EU economic recovery programme and suspended rules on deficits have allowed the fiscal stance of the bloc to be smoothly recalibrated this year to support spending. But the reapplication of the EU’s deficit rules under Stability and Growth Pact again next year would reintroduce excessively tight fiscal policy. This would raise questions about the level of stimulus that can be provided by the ECB.Despite its new framework, the ECB is struggling to navigate the post-pandemic restart. The surge in inflation has sparked lively discussions about the need for a policy adjustment by the central bank.While the US Federal Reserve will raise rates soon and start whittling down its balance sheet later this year, the ECB has ruled out increasing rates this year and instead plans to provide further stimulus through its quantitative easing programme of asset buying. The minutes of the December meeting show increasing disagreement on the governing council though and next week’s ECB meeting will be closely watched for changes in the guidance.Parallels have been drawn with the measures taken by the Bundesbank in the early 1990s, when Europe last experienced inflation this high. Such comparisons overlook that the inflation drivers are completely different today. Instead of exuberant demand in the wake of German reunification, today’s inflation is mostly due to supply constraints amid the post-pandemic activity restart.The pandemic is likely to have increased the European labour market mismatch between job openings and job applicants in terms of locations or qualifications. Yet any resulting wage increases are part of the adjustment process in a market economy, and not necessarily signs of a wage-price spiral being set in motion.Exactly how long the current inflation surge will last is difficult to predict, especially in the light of rising geopolitical risks concerning the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Fortunately, the ins and outs of the near-term inflation dynamics are not the key point in the policy debate. What matters is the fact that euro area inflation dynamics are driven by shifts on the supply of goods and services. Clearly, tighter monetary policy by the ECB would not resolve supply-side bottlenecks in, say, the German car industry. Instead, the ECB’s policy should support the required reallocation of resources by explicitly accepting inflation overshoots.This notion goes beyond the pandemic: it also applies to the transition to net zero. Decarbonising the European economy requires big shifts in resources towards low carbon sectors. In addition, it requires massive public investment spending.Plans submitted for Next Generation EU funding show that measures to help the bloc meet its object of becoming carbon-neutral by 2050 are above-target, but they still fall short of the required spending. Early action is crucial. Only an orderly climate transition makes climate-related supply shifts predictable and spreads them over a long period, thus limiting the inflation impact.While energy prices could continue to cause upward pressure on inflation, as ECB executive board member Isabel Schnabel recently highlighted, staff projections still put medium-term inflation close to, but below, 2 per cent. And with inflation expectations remaining anchored below, the ECB can afford to look past energy price spikes.As the ECB debates policy normalisation, governments are discussing potential reforms to Europe’s fiscal rules. For the ECB, memories still linger of the 2011 policy error raising rates on the back of rebounding energy prices. The same is true for the self-defeating fiscal austerity around the same time that materially slowed the European recovery from the global financial crisis.One way to reflect the secular decline in interest rates would be to raise debt limits, as Klaus Regling, head of the European Stability Mechanism, has proposed. Another way would be to extend the timeframe over which countries are expected to converge to the Growth and Stability pact rules. The Next Generation EU programme is an important step towards a collective fiscal response. But European governments cannot afford to stand still on national fiscal policies either.
104  Russia’s military build-up on its border with Ukraine has set off alarm bells and led to a flurry of transatlantic diplomacy. Gideon talks to Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, about what President Vladimir Putin is seeking to achieve, and whether he can realise these goals without launching an attack on Ukraine.
105  The US and Nato told Moscow they were committed to keeping the transatlantic alliance open to new members, rebuffing a central Russian security demand in written responses that could determine the outcome of the Ukraine crisis.The step was announced on Wednesday by Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, after weeks of tense negotiations aimed at defusing the stand-off and removing the threat of an armed conflict in Europe.“Nato’s door is open, remains open and that remains our commitment,” Blinken said.Jens Stoltenberg, Nato chief, later added that the alliance had delivered its own formal reply to Russia and reiterated that it would “not compromise on core principles”, including the right of all countries to join and the equal defence of all members.The western responses followed a request from Russia’s president Vladimir Putin for a written answer to his demands on security in the region.Depending on Moscow’s reaction, the co-ordinated western responses could prompt further escalation or additional negotiations on regional security, leading Russia to step back from the brink of an invasion.Putin warned in December of unspecified “appropriate military-technical measures” if the western alliance did not agree to curb its expansion close to Russia’s borders.“We are open to dialogue. We prefer diplomacy. And we’re prepared to move forward, where there is the possibility of communication and co-operation,” Blinken said. He added that there were “positive things” that Moscow should accept in the document.Blinken said he expected to speak to Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, “after Moscow has had a chance to read the paper and is ready to discuss next steps”.He added that Russia should de-escalate its “aggression” toward Ukraine, “stop the inflammatory rhetoric” and adopt a “spirit of reciprocity” in talks on security in Europe.The US had frequently rebuffed Russian demands to bar Ukraine from joining the alliance or reduce troop levels on Nato’s eastern flank. However, western allies have said they were willing to negotiate on missile deployments, arms control and transparency around military exercises.While Nato’s response rejected Russia’s core demands, Stoltenberg said he hoped the country saw the potential of the alliance’s offers for areas of compromise. These include proposals to reopen channels of communication by re-establishing mutual representation offices in Moscow and Brussels, measures to reduce air and sea incidents and opening “a serious conversation on nuclear arms control”.“It is no secret that we are far apart and there are some serious differences.but at the same time that makes it even more important that we look into the proposals and listen to reciprocal concerns and try to find political solutions,” he said.US officials were unsure which way Putin would go. Wendy Sherman, deputy secretary of state, warned that Washington still had “every indication” that Russia was planning an attack before mid-February. She added that “probably President Xi Jinping [of China] would not be ecstatic” if the attack happened during the Beijing Winter Olympics, which begin next week.In recent days, US and Nato allies have increased defence and security assistance to Ukraine and put thousands of troops on standby to protect the alliance’s vulnerable eastern countries.They have also sought to settle the details of an economic sanctions package to punish Russia if it followed through with an attack.US and European officials have vowed to target Russian banks, cut the country off from the Swift international payment system, impose export controls that would limit its access to western technology and cripple its energy sector, the biggest source of its foreign reserves.Biden has also suggested that Putin could be personally targeted, and Blinken said the “steps we will take go directly to things president Putin cares deeply about”. Even so, there are still divisions among western allies over the details and scale of such sanctions.A senior French official said on Wednesday night that “we obtained the signal of re-engagement that we are looking for” from the Russians during more than eight hours of Normandy format talks in Paris to discuss the eastern Ukraine conflict that predates the latest Russian troop movements.“We obtained a good signal in difficult conditions” that would help find a path towards de-escalation, the official said of the discussions, which involved political advisers from Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany. The talks are set to be reconvened in Berlin in two weeks.
106  Fewer than ten out of almost 12,000 eligible companies demonstrated they were ready to comply with new green reporting rules brought into force in Europe at the start of the year, a major business representative group said.The Conference Board, the US-based membership club for big business, warned that the majority of European companies it had analysed could fail to provide data at their financial year end about capital spending on key issues such as renewable energy.The EU rules that came into effect this year require any listed business with more than 500 staff to publish the percentage of revenue, capital expenditure and operating costs from activities covered by the green taxonomy — a classification system that defines “environmentally sustainable” activities in line with the bloc’s climate change objectives.Financial institutions must report on how much of their portfolio is compliant with that system.The global assessment conducted for the business group showed “only a handful” had published taxonomy audits, including Acciona, a Spanish infrastructure company.There was widespread ignorance among members, said Anuj Saush, leader of the governance and sustainability centre of the Conference Board, and it was sending almost 200 members a briefing on how to comply.“Most are simply not aware of the taxonomy. And among those who are aware there is a perception that this is something just for investors and asset managers to do. But it is for all companies,” he said.China, Japan, South Africa, Canada, the UK, Malaysia and Singapore were also developing their own taxonomies, Saush noted. “There could be multiple different reporting standards across different jurisdictions. You need a dedicated team to manage it.” The aim of the reporting rules is to reduce “greenwashing” by setting standards for what is sustainable, and to allow lenders and investors to reliably identify companies that are reducing their climate change risk.The EU rules cover six environmental objectives. These include climate change adaptation, sustainable water use and prevention of pollution. If an activity meets the criteria and contributes to these goals, it can be classified as compliant.There are no penalties yet for not complying but companies that do not do so could find it harder to attract funding.The EU directive applies to around 11,700 large companies including banks, insurance companies and public-interest companies. The Conference Board survey, working with Sustainalytics, a research ratings firm, found that among the key reasons for the lack of preparedness was delays to the legislation.“Companies only got six months to prepare from when the rules were published,” said Anne Schoemaker of Sustainalytics, noting there was also a lack of clarity.“When you take a close look there is a lot of ambiguity to the rules. Companies will do things differently, data providers will do things differently and auditors will have their own interpretations.”For this year, businesses only have to state the proportion of their activities taking place in taxonomy-related fields. In the next year, they must classify how aligned they are with it.“A cement company will probably have 90 per cent of their activities eligible but zero per cent aligned,” explained Schoemaker, referring to the proportion of cement business that would be covered by the rules versus those that would count as sustainable.Most companies assessed so far had less than 10 per cent of their revenues associated with activities covered by the taxonomy, she estimated. Only 15 per cent had any revenue, capital spending or operating spending aligned with green goals.The taxonomy is still evolving. The EU is debating whether to class investment in nuclear energy and cleaner gas power as sustainable. The European Commission has opted to include them as green after a push by France and Germany, prompting Austria and Luxembourg to threaten legal action.The Commission last year tabled a corporate sustainability reporting directive that would extend taxonomy reporting to large private companies and smaller listed ones, require independent auditing of the report and compel the information to be digitally tagged so it is machine readable, allowing EU-wide databases to be built.“It will be a recurring cost,” said Saush. “The standards will be reviewed every three years in the EU. Every affected company needs a dedicated team on this now.”
107  Vladimir Putin sought to convince some of Italy’s most prominent businessmen to “feel as comfortable as possible” about the Russian market during a videoconference that studiously avoided mention of the topic in most minds: the 106,000 Russian troops stationed around Ukraine.Business leaders including the chief executives of banking group UniCredit, tyre manufacturer Pirelli and state-owned utility Enel discussed Moscow’s climate change ambitions, economic reforms and business opportunities as part of an event on Wednesday organised by the Italian-Russian chamber of commerce, according to participants.The meeting went ahead despite a plea from Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s office on Tuesday evening to postpone it, said a government official. The head of the Italy-Russia chamber of commerce, Vincenzo Trani, insisted it was too late to reschedule it, said four people involved in the discussions. A spokesperson for Trani was not immediately available to comment.The encounter underlined the Kremlin’s efforts to sway the European business elite as the US and Europe debate a package of sanctions in case Putin invades Ukraine. The US has warned Moscow was preparing another military attack after its annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in 2014.Geopolitical tensions between Moscow and the EU and US were not discussed at the meeting, but one participant said there was “a general feeling of embarrassment”. Another said that while the meeting was “badly timed”, backing out at the last minute would have exposed them to retaliation since they had all been doing business in Russia for years.Francesco Starace, chief executive of Enel, suggested Russia lift its carbon emissions targets, said several participants who spoke under the condition of anonymity. In attendance on the Russian side were the ministers of energy, transport, finance, industry and trade as well as top business figures. Enel declined to comment.Other Italian state-controlled companies — including oil company Eni, oil service group Saipem and gas transport company Snam — planned to attend the meeting but pulled out on Tuesday.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied that any Italian executives had dropped out under pressure from Draghi’s government, saying the changes were because of illness and scheduling conflicts.Other participants including UniCredit chief Andrea Orcel, Pirelli chief Marco Tronchetti Provera and Generali chair Gabriele Galateri di Genola, discussed their companies’ presence in Russia.During the initial part of the meeting, which was televised, Putin said Russia wanted Italian business “to feel as comfortable as possible about the Russian market”. He stressed that Italy, one of Europe’s largest importers of Russian gas, had been able to buy gas supplies “far below spot market prices that grew significantly due to the cold winter and a supply glut” thanks to long-term contracts with Kremlin monopoly Gazprom.The meeting had “nothing to do with the current situation or any sanctions,” Peskov said before the encounter. “Life goes on, business interests are not going anywhere, they have a presence on the Russian market [.] As long as they’re making money in Russia, they’re interested in having this conversation.”The date of the event was agreed in November with the knowledge of Italy’s foreign ministry. Putin occasionally holds business meetings with European business executives. He met French executives last year and German business leaders in 2019, according to the Kremlin’s website.Italian government officials have insisted the meeting was a private event. However, the Italian-Russian business committee that helped organise it was created by foreign minister Luigi Di Maio in 2020.“This would have been no news at a different time. Clearly for the Italian government not to call this off at such a sensitive time was a mistake,” said a chief executive, who nevertheless attended.
108  The western alliance has patched up some of the cracks that appeared last week as it seeks to deter Russian aggression against Ukraine. President Joe Biden, who had suggested a “minor incursion” by Moscow might leave Nato members split, on Monday proclaimed “total unanimity” after a video call with European leaders. US officials have said any Russian invasion of its neighbour will provoke sanctions starting “at the top of the escalation ladder”. Efforts also continue along the diplomatic track, with the US on Wednesday delivering a letter containing its response to President Vladimir Putin’s demands to reshape Europe’s security architecture.Yet western efforts to present a united front continue to be marred by wavering by one of its most influential members: Germany. While the US and UK have sent defensive weaponry to Kyiv, Berlin is declining to do so — and has blocked delivery of howitzers from Estonia to Ukraine, prompting indignation from Nato allies. Olaf Scholz’s coalition has sent mixed signals over whether it is prepared to halt the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline if Russian troops enter Ukraine, and to support financial sanctions such as barring Moscow from the Swift interbank payments system.Historical factors, including Ostpolitik, the detente with Soviet-bloc countries initiated by Scholz’s forerunner as chancellor, Willy Brandt, and a reliance on Russian gas imports built up since the 1970s, weigh on Berlin’s thinking. Germany’s position on sending arms to Ukraine is underpinned by a longstanding ban on lethal weapons exports to conflict zones. The guns in Estonia came from East Germany, exported to Finland after German reunification, so are covered by end-use restrictions.There are strong reasons, however, for the Scholz administration to show solidarity with US-led efforts to marshal robust economic sanctions — and press the powerful German business lobby to do the same. There can be few bigger risks to energy supplies, and to German business relations with Moscow, than a war in the heart of Europe. Doing everything possible to cajole Putin to pursue a diplomatic, not military, solution to his security demands is imperative. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline has, moreover, always been a political, not economic, project — designed to free Russia from reliance on an export pipeline across Ukraine. While Scholz hinted last week that Nord Stream’s future would be in question if Russia invaded Ukraine, he should be more explicit in stating that the pipeline cannot operate in those circumstances.Sanctions being touted against Russia would have an impact on businesses and the wider economy in Germany and across Europe. Yet for the threat of punitive steps to be a credible deterrent, the Kremlin must believe its counterparts are prepared to suffer some pain. German concerns about the potential side-effects of measures against Russian banks — including on Berlin’s ability to make payments for supplies — would be better discussed privately between western capitals, not flagged publicly.German businesses are not alone in trying to turn a blind eye to the Ukraine crisis. While they have Russian investments and shareholders to consider, this week was no time for leading Italian companies to hold a video meeting with Putin on what the Kremlin billed as the “potential for further expanding ties”. Business as usual is scarcely possible with a European partner that is menacing its neighbour with an army of more than 100,000. The best hope of an eventual return to something like normality is to reinforce the west’s solidarity and resolve in its twin-track policy of deterrence and diplomacy.
109  The European Central Bank has warned lenders with significant exposure to Russia to ready themselves for the imposition of international sanctions against the country if Moscow invades Ukraine.The warning from the ECB, which supervises 115 of the biggest eurozone banks, came as the US warned that Russia would face “massive consequences” if sent troops into Ukraine.Sanctions would raise considerable risks for the international banks with large Russian exposure including Citi in the US, France’s Société Générale, Austria’s Raiffeisen and Italy’s UniCredit.ECB officials have asked for details of how the banks would handle different scenarios, such as a move to block Russian banks from accessing the Swift international payments system, according to several people briefed on the talks.The requests underlined how the ECB wants to ensure that European banks are able to comply with any sanctions regime and quickly cut out clients with whom they are banned from doing business.The central bank has explored the risks of various possibilities and pressed the banks to share details of their own assessments and contingency plans, according to people briefed on the discussions.It has also requested information on Russian and Ukrainian exposure from Deutsche Bank and ING, the biggest lenders in Germany and the Netherlands, respectively. Citi, Deutsche Bank, SocGen, Raiffeisen and ING declined to comment, as did the ECB. UniCredit could not be reached for comment.International banks, including their Russian subsidiaries, have about $121bn in assets owed to them by Russian-based entities, and there is $128bn in loan and deposit funding from Russian entities to foreign banks, according to the Bank for International Settlements.SocGen has the biggest financial exposure to Russia of any European bank, with €2.6bn, according to research from JPMorgan. Austria’s Raiffeisen has €1.9bn of exposure, while UniCredit has €1.4bn.Andrea Orcel, chief executive of UniCredit, was among the top executives from large Italian companies who joined a video meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin on Wednesday to discuss economic ties.A senior executive at one of the banks said the main risk from sanctions was for its Russian investment banking operations, which deal with big multinational companies and oligarchs, rather than to its commercial banking unit, which mostly deals with midsized companies.The executive said the biggest “systemic risk” would be if Russia was cut off from the Swift payments network, which could “have an impact on the whole banking system in Russia”. However, the executive said the Russian central bank planned to activate a domestic interbank payment system to replace Swift, if needed.An additional risk for the European banks was that conflict in Ukraine could hit the value of the rouble, reducing the value of equity held in their Russian subsidiaries.Another European bank executive said there was a concern about the risk of going to jail in Russia if Moscow retaliated against banks that tried to implement international sanctions. “We need to be able to implement sanctions very fast.sometimes it takes time, you may have relationships to wind down,” the executive said.Michael Lyons, partner at law firm Clifford Chance, said sanctions could affect a broad group of banks operating in Russia. “Customers of retail banks are not just regular individuals, but also corporates, and private [business] entities. Some may have sizeable private wealth management divisions.”
110  Russia has positioned a liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker next to its Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad, in a rare move that has raised eyebrows in the industry as tensions rise with the west over Ukraine.Kaliningrad, a 15,000 sq km square territory separate from mainland Russia that is sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania, normally receives pipeline gas from Russia’s state-backed gas giant, Gazprom.But satellite tracking shows the Gazprom-owned Marshal Vasilevskiy LNG tanker, which was designed to supply gas directly into Kaliningrad’s grid, has sailed to the Baltic coast in recent days, leading industry observers to speculate that it is part of Moscow’s contingency planning in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.Analysts said they believe Moscow may be reinforcing Kaliningrad’s gas supply options in case any Russian incursion into Ukraine results in the disruption of pipeline gas supplies, either through western sanctions or a decision by Russia to restrict supplies to Europe.“It’s something of a conspiracy theorists’ dream to see this tanker suddenly show up off the coast of Kaliningrad,” said Tom Marzec-Manser at ICIS, an energy consultancy.“It’s impossible to say with certainty why it’s there, but it will feed into the atmosphere of concerns about gas supplies in Europe as tensions over Ukraine rise, as it looks like Russia could be making contingencies in case of disruptions to supplies.”Gazprom declined to comment on the tanker’s movements.With gas prices in Europe already reaching record highs this winter, stoked by lower Russian exports, fears over supplies have risen.The Marshal Vasilevskiy, named after the military commander who planned the counteroffensive that repelled German forces from outside Moscow in the second world war, is a special type of LNG tanker known as a floating storage and regasification unit, which can connect directly into the gas grid without the need for a separate regasification terminal.The tanker is the only one of its kind in Russia and was launched in 2019 as part of a project designed to reinforce Kaliningrad’s “energy security taking into account its geographical setting”, according to Gazprom’s website. But the tanker has been mainly used since then for conventional shipments of LNG around the globe. This is the vessel’s first return to Kaliningrad since 2019, according to satellite tracking data.“There are two ways to look at this; from the Russian side this is sensible contingency planning in case gas supplies through Lithuania to Kaliningrad somehow get disrupted in the coming weeks,” said Laurent Ruseckas at IHS Markit.“From the western side you could view it as a warning that Russia believes it can supply all of its territory no matter what happens to gas exports. But it is in neither side’s interest to see gas supplies disrupted.”A second Gazprom-controlled tanker, the Energy Integrity, briefly listed Kaliningrad as its destination last week after loading a cargo of LNG in Cameroon.While the Energy Integrity has since changed its destination on satellite tracking it has continued to sail north along the coast of west Africa. Most cargoes of LNG from Cameroon, which Gazprom markets under an offtake agreement, sail south to go round the Cape of Good Hope to Asia.The US has been speaking with major gas producers such as Qatar as well as other producers to see what could be done to supply Europe in the event Russian flows are disrupted.US officials have warned that sanctions in the event of a Russian incursion into Ukraine could be severe, though European countries including Germany are keen to avoid disrupting energy trade. Investment bank Stifel warned this week that European gas prices could quadruple if Russian exports to Europe were cut off.“We are prepared to implement sanctions with massive consequences that were not considered in 2014,” senior White House officials said this week. “That means the gradualism of the past is out, and this time we’ll start at the top of the escalation ladder and stay there.”The officials added that they wanted to avoid “minimising unwanted spillovers”.
111  It was Russia’s interior minister Vyacheslav von Plehve who, a century ago, infamously said: “What this country needs is a short, victorious war to stem the tide of revolution.” In 1904, in the midst of growing public dissatisfaction with the Czarist government, he viewed the forthcoming Russo-Japanese conflict as a welcome distraction from domestic unrest. His doctrine spectacularly backfired, however. The Russian Empire did go to war with Japan, but suffered a catastrophic defeat; the resulting 1905 revolution forced the tsar to establish the first Russian constitution and parliament, the Duma. Von Plehve himself did not live to see this — he was killed in 1904 by the very same revolutionaries his war was intended to suppress. Given Vladimir Putin’s historically low electoral ratings, and Russians’ pessimistic views of their country’s economic prospects, it is hard not to recall von Plehve’s dictum. Whether or not Moscow invades Ukraine, it is already distracting the world — and ordinary Russians — from growing problems such as stagnating incomes, corruption, and the catastrophic handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny strongly believes this is the motivation for Putin’s current foreign policy “spectacle”. But brinkmanship requires credible threats. If Putin’s bellicose discourse were not backed up by the necessary troop movements, it would not be taken seriously. And while we do not know whether the war will actually happen, the prospect of conflict has already damaged the Russian economy. On January 24 alone, the stock market fell by 7 per cent in rouble terms; this drop was accompanied by the weakening of the rouble and sovereign bonds. Since the beginning of the year, the dollar-denominated RTSI index lost almost 20 per cent. It is back to its pre-pandemic levels — even though oil, Russia’s main export commodity, is worth a third more than it was back then. The Russian market’s performance is especially striking given that global stock prices are now trading at 20 to 40 per cent above their pre-pandemic peaks. January 24 was also unprecedented for Russia’s Central Bank move to support the rouble. Russia’s budget breaks even when the oil price is at $44 per barrel. When it is higher, the Russian Finance Ministry uses excess export revenues to fill up the sovereign wealth fund by taxing the oil firms and handing these revenues to the Central Bank to buy dollars. Since today’s oil price is almost double the break-even level, the Central Bank should be investing heavily in dollars. On January 24, it stopped buying any. Why are the markets so nervous? Russia’s macro fundamentals are actually very good: its gross domestic product is already above pre-pandemic levels, and according to the IMF’s Fiscal Monitor, it is the only large economy to have balanced its 2022 budget, with a predicted fiscal surplus in 2023 and 2024. Russia’s sovereign wealth fund stands at 12 per cent of GDP. Its sovereign debt is very low, so the central bank can extinguish inflation by raising rates without substantial fiscal pain. Yet, investors are still scared. Despite high oil prices, capital outflow is high and the rouble is weak. Forecast GDP growth rates are well below the global average. This is because markets believe that the worst is yet to come. The invasion has not yet happened, but neither has it been ruled out — and a war would mean new, severe sanctions. It is unlikely that the west will impose an oil and gas embargo on Russia, as it did on Iran. Russia is a top oil exporter (second only to Saudi Arabia) and an essential supplier of gas to Europe. However, Nato allies have the power greatly to harm Russia’s financial system. This is why markets price in substantial rouble depreciation and decline in the price of Russian debt. In the event of an invasion, it is likely that Russia will be suspended from the Swift payment system, that its largest banks will be placed under full sanctions and the assets of its richest citizens frozen. While Russia has substantial reserves and its own national (albeit imperfect) Swift substitute, it will experience further financial problems, and bank failures, with an impact on the purchasing power of ordinary citizens. Will this deter Putin? In 2015 he famously said: “Our sovereignty is not up for sale,” implying that financial costs will not prevent him claiming territory he considers to be his. Since then, he has indeed ramped up repression, ensuring that popular discontent does not translate into a tangible political challenge. On the other hand, this may be a mistake — just as von Plehve’s doctrine turned out to be. The markets’ reaction to Putin’s brinkmanship already suggests a real war may cost him much more than he is able to bear.
112  A year after Britain left the EU, the UK’s big banks are facing a scenario that was far from the vision of Brexit’s architects: their EU rivals could soon be able to lend more cheaply to British corporates than they can.The EU’s banks are getting a helping hand because of the bloc’s decision to break with some of the final parts of Basel III, the globally agreed capital rules. This will allow EU banks to use less capital when they make loans to corporates without a credit rating, reducing their lending costs. Before Brexit, the UK’s banks would have benefited from the same relief.“It’s a big issue,” said a senior executive at a large UK bank. “There’s a risk. that BNP can lend to a load of higher quality UK corporates at cheaper rates than UK banks.Open markets only work if everybody is playing by global rules.”Corporate lending is just one of the areas of possible post-Brexit divergence the City of London is watching with trepidation in 2022 as the EU and the UK advance new financial regulations at a pace not seen since the immediate aftermath of the 2007-08 crisis.Work in progress in both jurisdictions includes fleshing out plans to overhaul markets regulation, detailing how the UK will implement the latest Basel banking accords and creating new digital asset and anti money laundering regimes in the EU.“Divergence is not going to happen through a roll back of historic rules, it’s going to come from the different approach to rulemaking,” said Simon Gleeson, lawyer and partner at Clifford Chance. Banks say different rules in the EU and UK will push up administrative costs for companies trying to comply with two regimes.A key area of concern for finance executives, industry groups and advisers is the latest package of global banking rules agreed in Basel in 2017. The EU in November published hundreds of pages for implementation. British banks must wait until the second half of 2022 to see if the Bank of England will give banks the same relief on corporate and business lending. A person familiar with the plans said the BoE’s Prudential Regulation Authority would consult industry and take their concerns into account.Still, UK banks and their advisers are bracing themselves for tougher treatment on capital generally than their peers in the EU, with particular concerns around business lending.“The new Basel treatment of corporate lending is problematic as most corporates outside the US do not have credit ratings, which will make lending to them more capital consumptive for banks [applying the Basel rules],” said Simon Hills, director of prudential regulation at the UK banks’ lobby group UK Finance.“If the PRA does not adopt the same approach as the EU with respect to unrated corporations, then EU banks may be able to lend more cheaply to UK corporates, hollowing out their traditional UK corporate lending focus,” he added.The UK bank executive nonetheless has sympathy for the competing interests the PRA is trying to balance.The authority has a new secondary mandate to consider growth and competitiveness, which would nudge the regulator towards giving UK banks the same reliefs as the EU, to preserve a level playing field. But prudential and political concerns weigh heavily against this course of action.“The UK will 100 per cent not follow suit” on relief to unrated corporates, said one seasoned UK financial regulation expert, who described the EU approach as “unsound” from a banking policy point of view. “Politically the UK could never say we are following the EU and not the global standard,” they added.Since London continues to allow banks to sell into the UK from the EU even as Brussels erects borders, banks say EU lenders will be able to do business in the UK more cheaply than their British counterparts. The situation could drag on until 2032, when the EU’s relief is set to expire.“The UK regulator is still making up its mind about [whether to extend the same relief],” said Hills. He hopes the UK will ensure a “level playing field” for its banks and those based in the bloc.London has also yet to announce whether it will follow the EU in delaying implementation of the entire Basel package until 2025, leaving UK banks with less certainty than their EU counterparts.They will also have to adapt to the potential uncertainty of having a national regulator that can constantly refine rules. “One of the good things that EU membership did for the UK is it solved the problem that we previously have, which was generally known as a ‘restless regulator’,” said Gleeson.In the EU, regulations take a long time to pin down, are typically highly detailed and become permanent in complex primary law once agreed. But an advantage of this approach is that “they can’t go around changing it”, said a senior policy executive at a large UK bank who is lukewarm about the promise of “more agile” UK policymaking.In other areas, however, the EU is taking a more restrictive approach than London, which could give the UK a competitive advantage.One of these is around digital assets, where a Brussels package, markets in cryptoassets, or MICA, lays out proposals that would, among other things, greatly constrain banks’ dealings with cryptocurrencies. If the EU agrees those plans, it is “probably” a competitive advantage for the UK, Gleeson believes.The EU is also creating a single anti money-laundering authority, AMLA, which Chris Woolard, former interim head of the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, said “might make the European market more efficient.or it might be yet another body that banks and others have to deal with”. Money laundering falls under a variety of regulators in the UK, including the FCA, HMRC, the National Crime Agency and the Serious Fraud Office.Trading is another area of reform. The UK has already introduced some new measures in niche areas, including a special regime for listing companies that want to raise money to make opportunistic investments, known as SPACs, and announced a series of other reforms to make listing in London more attractive.Market regulation is another potential area for divergence as the EU reviews its landmark Mifid II package and the UK advances its Wholesale Markets review.A senior lobbyist at a large international bank said both UK and EU regulators could improve market efficiency and reduce costs, “even if that means different rules in different places”.“Once it was decided that equivalence was no longer on the cards, a pipe dream, there was no point in consistency and convergence,” he said. “Now, the approach is to get the best deal possible in each jurisdiction.”
113  Denmark said it would lift almost all Covid-19 restrictions and stop designating it a “societally critical” disease on Wednesday in the latest sign that western European countries are easing or even eradicating strict measures brought in to combat the Omicron coronavirus variant.Magnus Heunicke, Denmark’s health minister, wrote to parliament on Wednesday saying that he would remove all Covid-19 restrictions on February 1, except for testing on arrival from abroad.Just as the Danish government did in September, when it lifted all restrictions, it will also stop calling Covid-19 a “societally critical disease”, meaning that it will no longer have the legal basis to introduce wide-ranging curbs.“Tonight we can begin to lower our shoulders and find our smiles again,” said Mette Frederiksen, Danish prime minister, on Wednesday evening. “The pandemic is still here, but with what we know now, we can dare to believe we are through the critical phase.”Denmark is the latest European country in recent days to announce it is dropping most or nearly all measures as it follows in the footsteps of the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands even as infection rates remain at, or close to, record highs across the continent.Denmark still has one of the highest number of Covid-19 cases per capita in the world, currently more than 10 times its previous peak as Omicron causes tens of thousands of daily infections. But the number of patients in intensive care continues to fall and, even with Omicron, never hit the peaks reached from April 2020 and January 2021.Ireland, which introduced an unpopular 8pm hospitality curfew just before Christmas as Omicron raged, last Saturday scrapped almost all pandemic restrictions, including pub opening hours and limits on social gatherings.In the Netherlands, authorities have decided to relax some restrictions as of Wednesday, even as the number of infections continues to rise.“We are taking a very big step,” prime minister Mark Rutte told reporters on Tuesday, while adding that the government will reassess the measures in three weeks.European countries reacted quickly with varying measures of strictness to the emergence of Omicron in December, but have been relieved in the past few weeks that a much-feared rise in intensive care patients has not materialised.Coronavirus infections in the UK have fallen for the second week in a row, according to the country’s Office for National Statistics. Almost 3m people were infected with Covid-19 in the week ending January 22, the ONS infection survey estimated, down from 3.4m recorded a week earlier.From Thursday, England will drop its mask mandate in shops and on public transport, alongside scrapping vaccine passports. Scotland plans to relax its work from home guidance from January 31 after reopening nightclubs and ending capacity limits on events earlier this week.However, health leaders warned the country’s health service was still under pressure. Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospital and community health services, said it was “important to recognise that this Covid surge isn’t over, and that the NHS is still operating under extremely difficult circumstances”.Sweden, Norway and Finland all announced this week that they were likely to ease restrictions in the coming days and weeks.“We can tolerate more cases now, so then it is natural to look at easing restrictions, and that is what we are doing.This means we can live with a higher infection rate in society without the health system blowing up,” Ingvild Kjerkol, Norway’s health minister, told TV2.Sanna Marin, Finnish prime minister, said that the opening up of “low-risk” cultural and sporting events and longer hours for restaurants could be on a “shorter timetable than expected”.Sweden said on Wednesday that it would extend its existing restrictions for 14 days but expected, on the current trajectory, to lift most of them on February 9.
114  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
115  This is the year in which the newly geopolitical EU is supposed to repurpose its long-established clout in trade policy into a tool for global strategic power. It isn’t going very well.In the first two weeks of January the EU looked pretty weak in response to an immediate test case, China’s bullying of Lithuania. Latterly, the EU’s divisions over helping Ukraine to resist Vladimir Putin’s threats are a sharp reminder that it has tried using trade as a political lever before — with rather unfortunate consequences.The immediate cause of Putin’s annexation of Crimea and proxy invasion of Donbas in eastern Ukraine in 2014 were the Maidan demonstrations in Kyiv, which began in November 2013. The protests forced out the Kremlin’s man in Kyiv, Moscow-aligned president Viktor Yanukovich. The context was the EU’s attempt, if not actually to turn Ukraine into an accession state, then to pull it into the Brussels orbit via a “deep and comprehensive free trade area” (DCFTA) embedded in a wider political association agreement.The DCFTA, which provisionally came into force in 2016, is economically a pretty good deal for Ukraine. Some optimistic souls even cited it as a possible model for the UK’s relationship with the EU after Brexit. It gives privileged access to the EU single market but doesn’t require direct jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Critically, it is also loaded up with political and administrative conditions intended to draw its signatory towards the EU governance model. (That is, the model before Hungary’s Viktor Orban and Poland’s Law and Justice Party started trashing it, obviously.) The idea is market access and soft power combining to create a friendly and prosperous neighbour.But the DCFTA conditions and the associated messaging reduced almost to nil any idea that Ukraine would be able to keep a firm foot both in the EU and Russian economic camps. The latter is the Eurasian Economic Union, a grouping into which Moscow has managed to entice or bully Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and which acts more like a protection racket than a trade agreement. Putin occasionally used to suggest tripartite talks to enable the EU, Ukraine and Russia to co-operate on trade, but Brussels — no doubt correctly — saw that as a disingenuous tactic to delay and distract.For the EU, using a politicised trade deal to turn Ukraine’s eyes firmly to the west proved a dangerous game. It also inevitably fuelled concern in Moscow about Ukraine’s aspirations to join Nato.Putin, despite signalling a commitment to norms of international governance by taking Russia into the World Trade Organization in 2012, turned publicly against the Ukraine DCFTA in 2013, and Yanukovich heeded his master’s voice.Brussels negotiators were taken aback. Karel De Gucht, then the EU’s trade commissioner, says: “We were in fact surprised that all of a sudden they were so much against it.” He adds: “How, exactly, this idea developed within the circles of the Kremlin I don’t know.”If it came as a shock to the trade negotiators, they were badly advised by the EU’s foreign ministers. It was not an issue on which so much should have been left to trade policy. Like the US in the cold war, the EU has tried to use soft power (and market access) to extend its influence eastward. Unlike the US in the cold war, it doesn’t have hundreds of thousands of troops lined up on its eastern border to back it up.Nor has the DCFTA produced spectacular results. More than five years after its preferential access began, Ukraine still sells only just over a third of its goods exports to the EU. This contrasts unfavourably with neighbouring Moldova, which has a similar DCFTA with the EU and which sends more than two-thirds of its exports there.Ukraine, a dysfunctional economy with a woeful business climate, has failed to get itself in shape to take advantage. Nor has the EU been able to provide enough aid or crisis lending to rescue it from balance of payments problems and help it to develop. The EU has largely left it to the IMF to provide emergency external financing, and EU technical assistance has fallen short of expectations. EU-oriented Ukrainian elites remain firmly committed to looking westwards, but it has to be admitted there isn’t a great demonstration effect so far for the benefits of doing so.We’re now in a place where the EU (as a collective entity rather than its individual member states), having helped to trigger Putin’s aggression, isn’t even considered to be a geopolitical actor worth inviting to summits to defuse it. Trade and soft power can be part of an effective strategic policy. But the recent history of the EU and Ukraine suggests they are not substitutes for big guns and cold cash.
116  Good morning. Today we all hold our breath, awaiting the Federal Reserve’s statement at 2pm Eastern Time and the press conference that follows. There has been speculation that officials might raise the possibility of a 50 basis point rate increase at the March meeting, or of a 25bp rise at all seven of its remaining meetings this year. Either would spook the market, and both strike us as wildly unlikely. Mostly we will be listening for hints about whether the Fed might shift its balance sheet into run-off mode as soon as bond buying stops in March.In the meantime, more on the US stock market’s gymnastics, and a few thoughts on the increasingly frightening situation on the Ukrainian border.We will spare you the play-by-play on another batty day in US equities. But two things strike us as worth noting. First, although it sold off again, the market is still making distinctions. It still favours shares that are sensitive to rates and economic growth. Witness the KBW Bank index, which ended the day in the green.Second, Tuesday brought a reminder of what has powered US equities for so long, and could keep powering them: really good earnings. American Express came out with a big fourth-quarter beat, crushing analyst expectations. It reported record quarterly spending fuelled by young consumers. Spending on its card network in the fourth quarter was 11 per cent above pre-pandemic 2019, and the company expects more strong spending this quarter. The stock closed up close to 9 per cent.The real test this year: do we have enough Amex-es to offset tighter financial conditions?While most investors are focused squarely on the volatility in equity markets, another, more significant story continues to unfold: tensions on the Russia-Ukraine border. We will not speculate on the probability that the brinkmanship devolves into open conflict, as opposed to serving as the necessary prelude to a diplomatic solution — except to note two things.First, every expert we spoke to saw a low likelihood of anything that could be described as invasion or territorial annexation, but that the economic consequences of any such event would be significant (to say nothing of the political and humanitarian consequences). Second, local currency and bond markets reflect worries, but not panic, about the situation. Ukrainian dollar bonds that mature in the next year or so are trading near to par. Those with longer maturities have seen their discount grow over the past two months, but not to desperation levels:Similarly, while the rouble has not collapsed in recent months, it has not strengthened as oil prices have shot up, as it has in the past. Political risk has depressed the Russian currency (note the inverted rouble/$ scale):The two main mechanisms by which a deepening conflict would affect regional and global markets are international sanctions against Russia, and rising prices of natural gas and oil, if Moscow were to restrict outgoing supply to Europe.One factor that is relevant to Russia’s ability to withstand sanctions, and its willingness to use its oil and gas for leverage, is its high level of what we might call financial insulation. This has been built up since 2014, when sanctions bit following the annexation of Crimea.Russia has bolstered itself against potential sanctions. As Simon Quijano-Evans, Gemcorp’s chief economist, puts it:Here is a chart from Quijano-Evans, showing Russia’s rising reserves of foreign currency, as well as falling levels of external debt at its banks and corporates:The country’s combination of low government debt and low dependence on state spending is unique and provides room for manoeuvre:This is not to say sanctions would be painless. Its stock market and sovereign bonds could take even more of a beating than they already have (eastern European stock and bond markets would feel the pain as well). But only the most extreme sanctions could force Russia into a financial crisis. And there are two reasons to think that the most severe sanctions — for example, making it very difficult for the country’s banks to get access to external dollar funding — are unlikely to be imposed. The first, as explained by Edward Glossop, Aberdeen Standard economist, is that:The second issue is that sanctions will not just hurt Russia. Data from the Bank for International Settlements shows that international banks, (including their Russian subsidiaries) have some $121bn in assets that are owed to them by Russian entities. On the other side of the ledger, international banks have some $128bn in loan and deposit funding owned by Russian entities. Squeeze the Russian financial system too hard, and western banks, particularly in Europe, will start to squeal.That leaves the question of Russia tightening the taps on its oil and gas exports. The big risk here is that this could potentially have a stagflationary effect, that would in turn knock global equity and bond prices. As Nanette Abuhoff Jacobson, a strategist at Hartford Funds, put it to us:Quijano-Evans sees open conflict leading to higher energy prices and lower confidence. Both would dampen economic activity, and force banks that are tightening policy now to reverse course. The result could be stagflation.As the master of setting out dire consequences, the economist Nouriel Roubini, put it to us in an email:What are investors to do? Edward Al-Hussainy of Columbia Threadneedle says that the only positive bet one can make is that open war can be avoided, and that Ukraine bonds and the rouble will rise sharply. For those without confidence in that outcome, he says various hedges are available: get long the bonds of oil-exporting countries in the Middle East, and short those of energy importers such as Turkey. Buy high-yield bonds of energy producers in the US shale patch. Short European high-yield corporates, while buying German long bonds, as a hedge against recession there.But the biggest risk posed by war, however big or small, is not stagflation. It is more war, especially in a world reeling from a pandemic and where other political tensions are festering. Here again is Quijano-Evans:Roubini spells out the worst-case scenario:These risks are at the extreme edge of the probability distribution. But they should not be ignored.

117  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.The US and the EU may be inching towards a common line on Russia sanctions, but within the bloc there are still some fissures that make for prime time ammunition in domestic politics.Case in point: Poland’s public venting yesterday at Germany’s stance towards arming Ukraine. We’ll unpack the arguments and ask why the situation is more nuanced than what Warsaw is claiming.With the European Court of Justice having set a date for its verdict on whether a new mechanism linking EU funds to rule of law breaches is legal, we’ll look at the latest deadlines and prospects for Hungary and Poland.Poland’s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki yesterday hit out at Germany for allegedly blocking European weapons deliveries to Ukraine, but the story is much more nuanced, write James Shotter in Warsaw, Richard Milne in Oslo and Valentina Pop in Brussels.“Germany’s withholding of approval for the delivery of weapons from Estonia to a state which is preparing to defend itself against an aggressor is a huge disappointment,” Morawiecki wrote on Facebook, reiterating longstanding Polish concerns about Germany’s relationship with Moscow, including the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will send Russian gas directly to Germany while circumventing central Europe.The salvo is the latest criticism of Berlin by Poland’s conservative-nationalist government, which has long had an uneasy relationship with its western neighbour.Given its history, weapons sales from Germany are far more restricted and bureaucratic than from other countries. In the Estonian case, the German parliament would need to authorise the resale to Ukraine, as the sale relates to Soviet-made D-30 howitzers, which were stationed in former East Germany and exported after German reunification to Finland, which then handed them to Estonia in 2009.Under contractual obligations linked to that sale, both Finnish and German authorities need to approve the re-exporting of those weapons to Ukraine, a process that would take many months.Germany’s government spokesperson Christiane Hoffmann on Monday said the government was still studying whether or not to approve the weapons delivery. “The federal government has not yet made a decision on this matter,” she said.A German cabinet meeting today is set to look at the issue. There are voices within the government that seek a leaner weapons export regime that could act faster when needed — but a coalition agreement among the three parties is still pending on this matter.Finland’s defence ministry said: “Estonia’s request is being processed in normal export control procedure and no decision has been made yet. The process usually takes weeks or months.”Estonia’s ministry of defence confirmed it was waiting for approval from Germany to send the howitzers, and that the delivery had not been blocked. However, Baltic officials have expressed their impatience with Berlin’s bureaucratic processes.One issue Germany could be blamed for after Monday’s meeting of foreign affairs ministers is its reluctance, along with that of Italy, Greece and Spain, to approve an EU training mission for security officials in Ukraine, said three EU diplomats briefed on the matter.“But we have the impression that there is movement on this issue — there are fewer countries opposing it compared to a few weeks ago,” one of the diplomats said.One of the findings in the latest IMF World Economic Outlook is that high-income countries fared better than expected in 2021, largely because of their coronavirus vaccination rollouts. Prospects for 2022, however, look worse than what the fund forecast in October, mainly because of the Omicron variant, supply shortages and unexpectedly high inflation. (More here)The clock is ticking. Poland and Hungary will find out in three weeks whether their challenge to Brussels’s new rule of law enforcement mechanism has won over the EU’s top court, writes Andy Bounds in Brussels.The European Court of Justice yesterday announced it would rule on February 16 whether the regulation, which permits the European Commission to withhold EU funding in the case of rule of law violations, is lawful.The auguries are not particularly good for the two member states, after the EU’s advocate general recommended their challenge be turned down.Before the Luxembourg court gives its ruling, Warsaw and Budapest need to respond to informal letters of inquiry sent by the commission late last year asking them to explain rule of law shortcomings.Johannes Hahn, the budget commissioner, this week said Poland’s deadline of Monday had passed without a letter being received. Hungary’s deadline expired yesterday, but it has promised it will respond to questions from the commission by the end of the week, diplomats have told Europe Express.The commission letters are a step towards possible formal proceedings under the new rule of law conditionality mechanism, which will become politically possible assuming the commission gets a favourable judgment from the ECJ.It looks likely that the commission will formally start rule of law conditionality proceedings against the two countries, but the timing is delicate. Brussels is stuck in a stand-off with Warsaw and Budapest over their long-stalled bids for a share of the €800bn NextGenerationEU programme, and triggering the conditionality mechanism will only further inflame political tensions.What’s more, Hungary is gearing up for elections in April, making any commission decisions on EU funding during the next few months hugely sensitive. Hahn insisted on a call with reporters yesterday that Brussels has to act “according to guidelines and rules” rather than looking at election dates.But even if Brussels kicks off a rule of law conditionality case against Hungary soon, officials think it is unlikely the case will get to the council (which has to adjudicate on these matters) before the Hungarian election on April 3.Separately, Clement Beaune, the French European affairs minister, said he would resume hearings in February under article 7 of the EU treaty, which can lead to a country’s voting rights being suspended, declaring the matter a “very strong priority” for Paris. The last hearings under this procedure were held in June 2021.
118  Tiny Zug was once an innocent sort of place, known for its baking nuns, half-timbered houses and a kirsch-soaked torte favoured by Audrey Hepburn.Then it became a low-tax paradise and a magnet for corporate letterboxes: home to Glencore and other, even less cuddly behemoths. And now, in the unassuming business parks and low-rise office blocks that gently sprawl from the small old town centre, it has become Europe’s cryptocurrency kingdom.Or, as the clever marketeers of Zug like to call it: “Crypto Valley”. In a recent report, one local investor, CV VC, wrote that there were now 960 crypto start-ups in Switzerland, employing more than 5,000 people. Nearly half of the start-ups — 433 — are based in Zug.None of this is hard to miss these days: visitors to the country might conclude, based on advertising footage, that distributed ledger technology was third only to chocolate and luxury watches in Swiss contributions to the world. The fintech bro has almost become a more common fixture in the vastly overpriced bars of Zurich than the Paradeplatz banking pro.But there is a cold wind blowing through crypto valley, as there is across the blockchain world. UBS this week warned of a looming “crypto winter” as the Federal Reserve raises rates. Bitcoin’s price collapse in recent days is the first sign that the party is over, the bank’s analysts believe.And so quiet Zug finds itself on the front line of global finance. Switzerland, at least, seems to think crypto is here for the long term. While other governments seek to rein in crypto businesses, the country has been keen to promote them in recent months. In February 2021, Bern introduced a new “blockchain law” to codify how digital assets should be treated by the courts when it comes to the peculiar aspects of things such as proof of ownership and custody.The market regulator, Finma, has meanwhile been extremely proactive in trying to engage with and understand the new crypto world. It has even licensed two crypto banks in the country: Seba and Sygnum. Switzerland, Finma’s position indicates, intends to have a first-mover advantage when it comes to crypto fintech.The big figures in the industry — hardly a surprise — see a prosperous Swiss future for crypto too. On a recent visit to Sygnum’s offices, chief executive Mathias Imbach told me that the volatility and exuberance many sober investors have associated with crypto is just froth but beneath it are some serious propositions and investment opportunities.Underpinning the Swiss interest in crypto and the crypto world’s enthusiasm for Switzerland, of course, are some shared values: a belief in the power of technology for example, and more importantly, a libertarian bent that favours political and institutional freedom.But there is an elephant in the room here, perhaps an even bigger one than the vertiginous sell-off in cryptocurrencies in recent months. And this, it would seem, Switzerland still does not have a long-term answer for, regardless of where crypto prices are in a year’s time or how institutionalised the industry has become.Crypto technologies and businesses are increasingly at the centre of global illicit financial flows and criminal enterprise. Western intelligence agencies, an old source from a previous reporting gig told me recently, are very worried about the ways in which crypto technology is enabling illicit financial and political activities.Meeting with a crypto asset manager in Zug on a freezing morning a few weeks ago, over coffee in his office, I got a disarmingly frank assessment of the problem in Switzerland: for sure, there are a number of unscrupulous outfits in crypto valley, he said. And perhaps worse, there are an even larger number of very naive entrepreneurs keen for cash and clients, who consider themselves unbound by the rules governing mainstream finance.Crypto asset management, the asset manager added, has become the go-to home for many compliance-averse financial advisers who were booted from Switzerland’s scandal-prone private banks in recent years. And many of crypto valley’s clients, it seems, are politically exposed persons that have been “off boarded” from banks’ books amid reputational fears over white-collar crime.In Zug, therefore, it seems that — regardless of the prevailing market weather, winter or summer — crypto’s bright future risks being a repeat of Switzerland’s murky financial past.
119  André Ventura honed his belligerent political style as a pundit on Benfica football club’s television channel and other soccer shows that regularly degenerated into insults and shouting matches.His rapid-fire polemics have been delivered to a much wider audience during campaigning for Portugal’s parliamentary election, to be held on Sunday, as the far-right populist Chega party he founded sets its sights on a role in government.Polls show that Chega, which translates as “Enough”, could emerge as the third-largest party, an outcome that would extinguish the idea — cherished by many Portuguese until recently — that the country was immune to far-right populism.As the poll gap between the ruling Socialist party (PS) and the opposition centre-right Social Democratic party (PSD) narrows, it could also make Chega’s support vital to the formation of a right-of-centre government.“There will not be a government on the right without Chega,” Ventura told supporters on a recent campaign stop in northern Portugal, as he stood in front of a poster that promised to shake up the system.Ventura, who recently marked his birthday by posting a picture on social media of himself praying in church, set up Chega less than three years ago and is its only public face.The son of a Lisbon bike shop owner who attended a Catholic seminary before studying law, Ventura worked as a lecturer and tax consultant before moving into politics as a local councillor for the PSD. He quit the party in 2018 and now talks about becoming deputy prime minister in a Social Democrat-led government.Campaign debates and social media have given the 39-year-old a platform for a range of contentious proposals, including life imprisonment for violent crimes, chemical castration for paedophiles, a single income tax rate and a drastic reduction in the size of parliament.Corruption is a constant theme. “These bandits have been robbing our country for decades,” he told supporters at a campaign dinner, proposing big increases in jail sentences for graft.During town centre walkabouts, flag-waving supporters cheer and opponents heckle. “Get a job,” called a man in the northern town of Aveiro, throwing back at Ventura the phrase that Chega activists often shout at their critics.In the same way that opponents describe his TV punditry career as driven by a desire for media exposure rather than passion for football, they see his politics as guided more by personal ambition than ideological fervour.“Ventura emerged from the moderate PSD, not an extremist background,” said António Costa Pinto, a politics professor at Lisbon university’s Institute of Social Sciences.Yet while Portugal has no significant immigration issues, Ventura has sought to stigmatise the country’s small Roma community and has been fined by Portugal’s antiracial discrimination commission for social media comments about them.He has repeatedly described people receiving state benefits as having “a Mercedes at their door”, saying many were “welfare scroungers”. In a country where one in five people are at risk of falling below the poverty line, he has offered no evidence for his claims.A court ordered him last year to apologise to a family of African origin that he insulted in a TV debate, a decision upheld by the Supreme Court, which found the remarks were in part racially motivated. “Minorities have rights, but also responsibilities,” Ventura said last year at a march organised by the party under the slogan “Portugal is not racist”.Ventura was not available for interview and Chega did not respond to a request for comment.Santiago Abascal, leader of Spain’s hard-right Vox party, has travelled to Lisbon to support his campaign, as did Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s Rassemblement National, during Portugal’s presidential election last year. In 2020, Chega accepted an invitation to join Identity and Democracy, a far-right group in the European Parliament.The party won only 1.4 per cent of the vote in 2019, as Ventura was elected as its first and only MP. But he polled almost 12 per cent in the presidential election two years later, as party politics on the right fractured in opposition to a PS government supported by the radical left.Chega could win more than 6 per cent of the vote on Sunday, according to polls, to overtake the Left Bloc and the Communists. The two far-left groups have backed António Costa’s minority Socialist government since 2015, but voters are likely to punish them for triggering the election two years ahead of schedule by rejecting his 2022 budget.If Chega can secure third place, Rui Rio, the PSD leader seeking to replace Costa as prime minister, would need the party’s support to form a viable government. He, however, has ruled out any government role for Ventura’s party.“It’s going to happen, if not after this election then after the next one,” said Francisco Pereira Coutinho, a constitutional law professor at Lisbon’s Nova university. “It’s going to be impossible to have a majority on the right without the populists.”Before the rise of Chega and Vox, the third-largest party in Spain, political analysts argued that long, rightwing dictatorships lasting into the 1970s had “inoculated” both countries against the wave of nationalist populism that has emerged in Europe.But half a century after the demise of those regimes, voters in Portugal are less fearful of being socially shamed for having avowedly rightwing views.Parliamentary arithmetic means it is not just Portugal’s voters who face a choice. “Sooner or later,” Pereira Coutinho said, “a losing PS will have to choose between making a minority PSD government viable by abstaining in parliamentary votes or forcing them to turn to Chega for support.”
120  But Kovtun, who is introduced as a political analyst on air, is now worried about the possibility of war, as the shows heighten their bellicose rhetoric amid escalating tensions on the Russia-Ukraine border, in what some observers say is a move by the government to convince the public that any conflict would not be Russia’s fault.“They swing together with the party line,” he said, referring to the talk shows’ traditional pro-Kremlin positioning.In recent weeks, state media have broadcast a stream of accusations against Ukraine even as 100,000 Russian troops mass along the border, sparking international fears Moscow could be planning to invade its neighbour. The picture painted by the shows is of Kyiv as an aggressor, backed by a belligerent west, with the alliance posing a dangerous threat to Russia and driving it unwillingly towards conflict.The talk shows are particularly proactive. Participants — many of them on the fringes of Russian politics — were “constantly calling for a strike, to attack, to enter, to defeat, to annex”, said Irina Petrovskaya, who hosts a show analysing TV content on the opposition-minded Echo of Moscow radio station, in a recent broadcast. The programmes were beset by “military hysteria”, she added. Society is ready for war, in that it has absorbed the Kremlin and Russian state media’s depiction of the situationState news broadcasts tend to be more measured. But this week they alleged Ukrainian forces had transported chemicals to the country’s east for potential use as chemical weapons and listed towns held by Russian-backed separatists in the region where such “provocations” could take place. In a report published last week, the US state department described this and other claims as “disinformation and propaganda” intended to “influence western countries into believing Ukraine’s behaviour could provoke a global conflict”. The document noted several cases where the US believed Russia was manufacturing pretexts for military action.Ivan Davydov, a journalist who produces a media column for Russian online outlet Znak, recently wrote that “expectations of war are becoming routine” across state TV. The effect was to normalise the concept of conflict. “War becomes possible when people stop seeing it as something out of the ordinary,” he added.This contrasted with 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and backed a separatist uprising in east Ukraine, he told the Financial Times. Back then Russia and state media outlets denied or downplayed Moscow’s military and political involvement in east Ukraine. But pundits were now depicting armed conflict “as a possible — though not very desirable — option for solving accumulated problems”, he said.Across state media, Russia was presented as “the most peace-loving country on the planet”, he added. According to media outlets, western leaders “don’t want to listen, they throw around accusations, they provoke, they threaten”, with Moscow forced to respond.Denis Volkov, of the independent Russian polling centre Levada, said the state media messaging seemed to have succeeded in influencing the public. In a December poll by the organisation, only 4 per cent of Russians said they believed their country was to blame for escalating tensions. Some 50 per cent blamed the US and Nato, while 16 per cent blamed Ukraine. “Society is ready for war, in that it has absorbed the Kremlin and Russian state media’s depiction of the situation, that ‘it’s not us, it’s them’,” he said. But despite the state media barrage, most Russians prefer not to think about conflict, say observers. Focus groups suggested people were tired of existing in a constant state of confrontation with the west and Ukraine, with the attitude being “it’s frightening, unpleasant, and I don’t want to get involved”, Volkov said.“When you are living in Ukraine you feel the war, but in Russia, [people] do not talk about the war,” said Arshak Makhichyan, a 27-year-old Russian climate activist who was recently detained in Moscow after staging a lone protest against the potential conflict. A Levada poll in December found that 53 per cent of respondents said an armed conflict would not happen or was unlikely.“The public consciousness is somehow filtering it out, it doesn’t want to know about it,” said sociologist Sergei Belanovsky, founder of the Belanovsky Group research group. People, especially outside central Moscow, were more focused on domestic problems than foreign policy, with online discussions dominated by price rises, local news or anti-vaccine content, he said. Some 32 per cent of respondents to a poll by Levada in January said their quality of life had deteriorated in the previous year, while just 11 per cent said it had improved. In addition, as elsewhere, the influence of TV is declining as the role of the internet grows, analysts say. The degree to which the talk shows can be considered a bellwether of the Kremlin mindset is also unclear. “Nobody knows, not you, not me, what Putin thinks,” Kovtun said. “And [the broadcasters] are trying to guess it too.”

122  The top executives of some of Italy’s largest companies including Pirelli, Generali and UniCredit are due to hold a video meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin to discuss economic ties, even as Europe and the US threaten to impose punishing sanctions on Russia if it invades Ukraine.The meeting on Wednesday, which the Kremlin said would cover “the potential for further expanding ties between the two countries’ businessmen”, comes despite rising tensions over a possible confrontation in Ukraine.It also comes as transatlantic allies have laboured to agree a unified approach over the brewing crisis in Ukraine following missteps that exposed sharp differences over how to respond to Putin.The date of the event — organised by the Italy-Russia chamber of commerce and the Italo-Russian business committee — was agreed in November with the knowledge of Italy’s foreign ministry.An Italian government official said the event was “a private initiative which does not envisage the participation of any personalities linked to public institutions”. Organisers said the event would go ahead as a way to maintain dialogue regardless of geopolitical tensions.The Italo-Russian business committee, set up with the support of Moscow and Rome, is co-led by Marco Tronchetti Provera, chief executive of tyre manufacturer Pirelli, and Dmitry Konov, head of petrochemicals producer Sibur.Participants in Wednesday’s meeting are due to include Provera as well as Francesco Starace, chief executive of Enel; Andrea Orcel, chief executive of banking group UniCredit; and Antonio Fallico, the Russia chair of Intesa Sanpaolo, according to a list seen by the Financial Times. Spokespersons for the companies confirmed the executives would be in attendance but declined to comment further on the meeting.People close to Eni initially said chief executive Claudio Descalzi was due to attend, but an updated list of participants on Tuesday showed that the company’s vice-president would go instead. A spokesperson for Eni later said the company was no longer planning to participate, without providing a reason for the change.Generali’s chief executive Philippe Donnet also appeared in an earlier list of participants. After publication of the FT story on Tuesday evening, the company said chair Gabriele Galateri would attend instead.Also listed were senior figures from Kremlin-run companies including oil monopoly Rosneft’s chief Igor Sechin, one of Putin’s closest allies, and Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund.“The participants did not express any doubts,” Dmitry Peskov, Kremlin spokesman, told the FT before changes were made to the list of Italian participants. Dmitriev declined to comment.Putin holds these meetings “because he expects that big business can weaken the west’s Russia policy”, said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Centre. “This was his approach to Germany and the whole of Europe — right now it seems they see Italy as a weak link in the EU that he can influence so that they push to weaken European sanctions policy if there’s a serious military escalation in Ukraine.”The US has warned that Russia may be planning a renewed invasion of Ukraine after massing 106,000 troops near its border and allegedly plotting to install a puppet government.Moscow has rejected the accusations but warned of “the most unpredictable and grave consequences” if the US does not agree to roll back Nato’s presence in eastern Europe and vow never to admit Ukraine to the transatlantic alliance. The White House has said the demands were unacceptable.Italian prime minister Mario Draghi, who on Monday joined US president Joe Biden’s videoconference with EU and Nato allies to discuss the western response to Russia’s military build-up, has said Europe’s business ties to Moscow make serious sanctions all but impossible. On December 15, he also played down the risk of Putin invading the country.“It would not be the right moment” for the EU to give up Russian gas supplies, he said, adding: “Do we have missiles, ships, cannons, armies? At the moment we don’t and at the moment Nato has different strategic priorities.”The Kremlin said Putin and the executives planned to discuss “current topics of Russia and Italy’s trade, economic and investment relationship” as well as the potential for expanding ties. “Special attention will be paid to the potential for developing co-operation on energy, industry, finance and [green] technology,” it added.Italian officials and businessmen defended the event, which they said was part of a regular cycle of meetings between Putin and companies with big investments in Russia.“Everyone’s objective is dialogue, not escalation, in this context there is no political stance on the part of businesses,” said one business leader who is planning to attend.Lucio Caracciolo, analyst and editor-in-chief of geopolitical magazine Limes, said: “There is the risk of economic sanctions that would negatively impact the Italian economy and the Italian businesses that trade with Russia, therefore the meeting is a way to keep dialogue channels open.”Putin praised his phone conversations with Draghi last month. “With such a well-intentioned approach and [high] level of our relationship, Italy could play a role in normalising Russia-EU ties and even the negotiations that are going on now with Russia and Nato,” he said.Italy and Russia have enjoyed trade ties since Putin’s friendship with former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi in the 2000s.Trade volumes between Russia and Italy grew 54 per cent year on year from January to November 2021 to $27.5bn, according to the chamber of commerce.Though much of the total came from growth in Russian energy exports amid rising oil prices, Italian exports to Russia also rose 20 per cent, to $11bn.This story has been updated to reflect that after publication of an earlier version, Eni pulled out from the meeting and that Generali is now planning to send its chair, not its chief executive
123  US officials said there was growing “convergence” with the EU on financial sanctions aimed at crippling Russian banks in the event of an invasion of Ukraine, as western countries sought to settle on a package of economic countermeasures to a possible attack.In a call with reporters on Tuesday, the morning after US president Joe Biden held a videoconference with European leaders to co-ordinate their positions on the crisis, senior US administration officials said they were still hopeful that the threat of devastating economic consequences could deter Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, from an invasion.“His tolerance for economic pain may be higher than other leaders. But there is a threshold of pain above which we think his calculus can be influenced,” said one senior Biden administration official.US and EU officials have been trying to forge a united front on punitive measures to be imposed on Moscow in the event of an attack, with Washington trying to rally the EU towards the most economically devastating measures.An EU official said on Tuesday that “further work behind the scenes” was needed to “get absolute clarity on” what the “triggers for sanctions” might be — referring to the nature and scale of Russian attack that would result in punishment.But on the substance of the measures, Biden administration officials on Tuesday stressed that there had been a “really encouraging convergence” between the allies, particularly on financial sanctions being contemplated on both sides of the Atlantic.That alignment focused on “the size of the financial institutions and state-owned enterprises” to be targeted, as well as the “severity” and “immediacy” of the measures, and “the extent to which the prohibitions would affect existing stocks of risk in addition to new flows of financing”, one US official said.The White House has publicly backed efforts in Congress to slap sanctions on Russian financial institutions including Sberbank, VTB, Gazprombank and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.The attempt to find a common position on sanctions came as Emmanuel Macron, the French president, and Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, were due to meet to co-ordinate the European position on the crisis. It follows moves by the US and Nato to shore up military support for their members in eastern Europe, including by putting troops on standby for deployment.UK foreign secretary Liz Truss, who said she would be visiting Ukraine next week, said: “It’s important at this moment that we see all of our partners around the world step up. We are leading by example but we want to see others follow that example.”As well as financial sanctions, the US and EU are also debating export-control measures to deprive Russia of sensitive technologies and curbs on the country’s energy sector. The US and EU also discussed ways to mitigate the fallout in Europe from the potential loss of Russian energy supplies to the continent. Biden administration officials confirmed they had been in talks with countries including Qatar and Australia to bump up gas production and cover a shortfall of supplies in Europe if needed.But even as they prepared to respond to a possible attack, European and US officials were also seeking a common position on the diplomatic talks involving US secretary of state Antony Blinken and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov to defuse the crisis.One EU official said there had been extensive co-ordination with the US on written responses to Russia’s security demands that Blinken is expected to deliver to Lavrov in the coming days.“The full report has been walked through with us in incredible detail on each and every point,” the EU official said. “So I think it offers, if you like, a number of avenues for resolution, for mitigating. The question is whether that is what Russia wants.”Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesman, told reporters that Russia would consider its next steps after it received a written US reply to its draft security proposals later this week. He added it was following the US deployments with “great concern”, accusing Washington of “de facto escalating tensions around Ukraine”, according to Interfax.Russia announced further snap military drills in western and southern regions near the Ukrainian border on Tuesday, which it said were not connected to the Nato force movements.The defence ministry released video footage of the exercises, which included deployments of Iskander missile launchers, which are capable of hitting Kyiv, and said 6,000 troops were taking part in the drills in the south.Russia has deployed more than 106,000 troops and more than 60 battle tactical groups near the Ukrainian border in recent months, including as part of a major joint exercise with Belarus set for February.
124  Russian troops massing on the Ukrainian border are pointing their weapons in the wrong direction. Jittery markets represent a greater threat to Russia than its neighbour’s mooted membership of Nato.As an emerging economy, Russia is already exposed to disinvestment triggered by US rate rises. An invasion of Ukraine would accelerate that trend and trigger US and European sanctions.Not that Vladimir Putin cares a jot what foreign investors think. Politics trumps economics, Lex believes. An invasion could bolster the strong-man credentials of the Russian president even as it impoverished his country further.Local inflation, rising 8 per cent annually, is already at a six-year high. No wonder the Bank of Russia has doubled its key lending rate in the last year to 8.5 per cent.Russia has prepared for some of the risks. It has bolstered its foreign exchange reserves with hefty purchases of gold, now at a 15-year peak of more than $630bn. Savings-poor emerging economies often rely on foreign sources of capital. Putin has been keen to stop this dependency recurring in Russia. Between 2014 — when Russia annexed Crimea — and 2020, the country bought an average of 180 tonnes of gold annually. Few nations rival this — or would aspire to do so.Russia’s strong trade position is another buffer. The positive balance nearly tripled to $21bn by November. Exports of oil and natural gas have soared, bolstering Russia’s stock of hard currency. But the rouble has fallen a tenth against the dollar in the past three months.The local stock market index Moex, dominated by natural resource producers, has fallen 31 per cent in the same period in dollar terms. At about 10 times estimated earnings the market valuation is nearing the lows of 2015. The dividend yield has hit 7 per cent.Might that tempt contrarians? The world’s precarious macro situation weighs against bargain hunting. The Fed’s insistent message is that rates must rise and its balance sheet must shrink. Wall Street is in retreat. If a conflict cut off Russian oil and gas flows, the risk-off switch would become a rout.A cessation of sabre-rattling would merely mean another impasse. Only a few brave foreigners bought Russian assets in the past. Even they should stay clear when nationalism rather than national prosperity propels events.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

125  As Europe enters its coldest months, business and households face gas prices that have more than quadrupled since last year. This could grind on indefinitely if European leaders do not end their dependency on fossil fuels. The gas price crisis and mounting geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine have once again highlighted that Europe needs a secure, local supply of renewable energy and to cut down gas consumption, much of which goes on heating our homes. Over 40 per cent of the gas the EU imports is used for heating buildings, and a third of European homes use gas for heating. Reducing energy demand through better insulated homes and accelerating the take-up of renewable heating will help put Europe’s energy dependencies on a new footing. Before the gas price crisis — and before the pandemic and the highest inflation in decades — 50m Europeans, or one in four households, were already struggling to afford heating. Even those families not personally threatened by energy poverty were directly affected. Gas companies across Europe have folded or shut their doors to new customers. In one case in the Netherlands, 90,000 customers saw their bills suddenly double after their provider was taken over. Brussels has already pledged a “renovation wave” as part of the EU Green Deal. Now it is time for member states to launch this in earnest. Shortly before the end of last year, the European Commission proposed new legislation to renovate the most energy-hungry buildings ahead of yet another EU leaders’ meeting that discussed the energy price crisis. There is about €1.8tn available, including €670bn from the recovery fund, a third of which is earmarked for climate action. Surveys show that people want to live in energy-efficient homes, and they are looking to their government to speed the transition to greener buildings. We need to match this political will and public desire with a credibly financed vision of the warm and affordable homes we want to live in, and with the laws and policies to make it happen. Meeting the Paris climate agreement goals also requires that we change the way we build, insulate and heat our homes. The early impacts of climate change are noticeable in Europe already; a recent model by the Euro-Mediterranean Centre on Climate Change showed that rising temperatures could cause heatwaves to increase at least tenfold by 2050. Some are already responding. Helsinki — with its 300,000 households, and biting winters — has a clear plan to be climate neutral by 2035, with a complete phaseout of coal and gas for heating. In France, the Abbé Pierre Foundation is trialling support systems to help people on low incomes invest in renovating their homes. The Netherlands has 50 “natural gas-free districts” where the government supports alternative, low-carbon heating sources. This is a huge economic opportunity for rebuilding a post-pandemic economy, one that takes us closer to net zero. Home renovations can create millions of jobs, especially in small and medium-sized enterprises. In Spain alone, according to trade unions, energy efficiency renovations can create work for nearly half a million people. At every level, the expertise points to clear social benefits of pursuing this campaign to revamp our homes and doing it now. Energy is the world’s indispensable business and Energy Source is its newsletter. Every Tuesday and Thursday, direct to your inbox, Energy Source brings you essential news, forward-thinking analysis and insider intelligence. Sign up here.Across Europe, the worst-performing homes from an energy efficiency perspective are disproportionately occupied by low-income households, and so far they have largely missed out on renovations. By targeting these homes, we can both reduce energy poverty and ensure the benefits of the Green Deal are felt by the families who need it most. Better homes also improve air quality, reducing the considerable public health impacts linked to respiratory disease from having to endure the cold and damp, and other effects on people spending more than 90 per cent of their time in ill-designed spaces. This is a moment of ambition and investment in Europe. The resources and tools are there, as is the strong call for climate action seen in every recent election across EU member states. Without a decisive change, we face a severe uphill battle to seize these obvious opportunities, while cutting energy bills — and that is without the risks of geopolitical interference and climate turbulence.The appetite is there, as is a bracing spirit of ingenuity. We need to harness this energy into an inclusive and just renovation effort, which lets Europeans see and feel the Green Deal improving lives in their own homes.Where climate change meets business, markets and politics. Explore the FT’s coverage here.Are you curious about the FT’s environmental sustainability commitments? Find out more about our science-based targets here
126  You have to do a cartoon-like double-take to recognise the newly sleek Mike Pompeo. If what goes into his mouth has changed, the words that come out of it continue to describe a hostile and flammable world. Donald Trump’s last secretary of state worries that his successors in government lack “the resolve and the steel” to deter Russian menaces against Ukraine. A soft or even ambiguous US is a tantalising invitation not just to the Kremlin, he warns, but to aggressors from Tehran to Pyongyang.This is not just a man with presidential designs making his presence felt as 2024 nears. His actions rhyme with those of Republicans with much less to gain. Many in the House of Representatives want to tighten sanctions against Russia before, not after, any attack. The party’s senators voted to sanction the Nord Stream 2 gas line from Russia to Germany. One as prominent as Marco Rubio would increase military aid to Ukraine and declare Russia a state sponsor of terrorism in the event of an invasion. Others visited Kyiv last week in a bipartisan show of solidarity.It is futile, perhaps, to cast around for consolations as a European war looms, but here is one that stands out. For a party that is many years into an illiberal drift, the Republicans are oddly firm in defence of Ukraine. Russian grievances against Nato elicit sympathy on the wider American right but Washington’s elected Republicans have been slower to follow. Such is their hawkishness, their scorn for Democratic “concessions” to Moscow, you wouldn’t know that almost none voted for Trump’s first impeachment over a threat to withhold military aid from Ukraine.This isn’t to mock or even tease. These are politicians under intense strain from Kyiv-sceptic colleagues on the US right. The broadcaster Tucker Carlson has a large audience for his view that Ukraine is “strategically irrelevant to us”. Alt-right praise for Russian president Vladimir Putin is sometimes not even grudging. In the US, qualms about Nato bring together old-style isolationists and a younger genre of conservative for whom Russia is a stout fortress against a lax, post-Christian west. If the Republican party has been able to hold the line against all this, that is an event worth marking. It implies that, whatever their feats on social media, autocracies have only gone so far in subverting America’s frontline political class.It also suggests liberals should tone down their fear of collusion among the world’s different strongman movements. The idea of a Nationalist International gained credence when the US, Russia, Turkey, Brazil and the Philippines had leaders who answered to that ideological label. Not since the worst of the cold war had liberalism felt more harried and encircled than it did around 2018. Almost by definition, however, nationalists struggle to co-operate, at least on a lasting basis. As long as the planet is of finite size, practitioners of belligerent and unilateral foreign policy will tread on each other’s interests or egos. When they do, a shared philosophic distaste for “globalism” isn’t enough to hold them together.This, more than anything, explains the Republicans’ surprising vigilance against a Russian leader they are accused of privately admiring. Even if there is an underlying harmony of worldview, a shared belief in power politics and spheres of influence, the Russian sphere brushes against the US one. Putin’s aims (“to evict the United States from Europe”, in the crisp words of former US official Fiona Hill) can’t be reconciled with American hegemony. Which to sacrifice — populist comradeship with Putin or US grandeur? — is not even a question for some Republican politicians.The point is captured in the singular person of Pompeo. No secretary of state since the postwar order began was less invested in its institutions and norms. But that nationalism makes him less likely to accommodate Russian sensitivities than a more conventional diplomat would be in his place. (The Republican grandee and stickler for realpolitik James Baker comes to mind.) The same may be true for the Trump generation of congressional Republicans.None of which is to say they are right. There is something thoughtless about the hard Republican line. There are the same Iraq war-era incantations that “weakness is provocative” (always? everywhere?), the same under-researched allusions to 1930s appeasement. But a clichéd hawkishness is better than the moral equivocation some liberals had feared. The mystery is whether it withstands a conservative movement that tends to wag the Republican dog in the end.
127  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.Western allies say they are all on the same page in trying to deter Russia from invading Ukraine, but there are subtle differences in how they interpret the same evidence. We’ll unpack why Berlin, Paris and other EU capitals have not followed London and Washington in pulling some of their diplomatic staff from Ukraine and why some are warning that doing so could hurt Kyiv economically.Meanwhile, the first round of Italy’s presidential election ended with a majority of votes cast without any name on them. Here’s the FT’s take on what this means and why Mario Draghi may stay on as premier after all.With UK foreign secretary Liz Truss in Brussels yesterday, we’ll also look at what the latest round of Brexit talks brought about.And two years after the European Commission put forward guidance on how countries should put security over discounts when rolling out 5G technology, we’ll explore the findings of an audit into how that policy is shaping up.With the US and the UK speaking of an imminent risk of war and pulling their non-essential staff from Ukraine, EU countries are taking a more cautious stance and warn of economic consequences for Kyiv, write Victor Mallet in Paris and Valentina Pop in Brussels.UK prime minister Boris Johnson on Monday said 60 Russian battle groups were on the borders of Ukraine, which he described as evidence of a “plan for a lightning war that could take out Kyiv”. Johnson took part in a call with US president Joe Biden and several European leaders last night, after Washington announced plans to potentially deploy 8,500 troops to central and eastern Europe to help shore up Nato’s defences in case of a Russian attack.But in Paris, Berlin and Brussels, officials are wary that western positioning could prove counterproductive.“The UK is developing positions that are very explicit, very alarmist.We have to be careful not to create self-fulfilling prophecies,” said a senior French official.Paris shares the same information and risk analysis with its allies in Washington and London, the official said. “We must not underestimate what’s already happened. Donbas is 400km of frontline. There are lots of soldiers deployed, dialogue is difficult.”Meanwhile, Germany’s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock warned of economic consequences. Speaking in Brussels yesterday, she said her government’s focus was on the “economic support of Ukraine” and warned that talk about evacuations “shouldn’t be used to create uncertainty regarding investments in Ukraine”. (The European Commission doubled down on economic support yesterday, announcing another €1.2bn in grants and loans for Ukraine.)Baerbock made a point by stressing that she was not pulling diplomatic staff from Ukraine. “The security of our staff has utmost priority. But for now we are in a situation where we continue to work on the ground, where there are companies on the ground,” she said.A spokesperson for Germany’s government later said family members of Kyiv-based staff could return to Germany if they so wish, but that no massive evacuation was planned.In a videocall with EU foreign ministers yesterday, US secretary of state Antony Blinken explained that the US evacuation is voluntary and only for non-critical staff and their family members, said EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell after the meeting.Borrell said Blinken did not provide any new information that would prompt EU capitals to carry out evacuations. “I don’t think there is a need for us to do any kind of precautionary measure from the point of view of the number of our staff and their permanence in Ukraine,” he said.Moscow’s Moex stock index fell more than 5.5 per cent yesterday, taking its losses this year to nearly 15 per cent, following the partial withdrawals from their embassies in Ukraine by the US and UK. Russia’s government debt also slumped, pushing yields to their highest level in six years, as the potential for western sanctions prompted investors to dump Russian assets. (More here)Another week, another inconclusive meeting between Maros Sefcovic, the EU’s Brexit negotiator, and Liz Truss, the UK foreign secretary, to try to agree changes to post-Brexit trading arrangements with Northern Ireland, writes Andy Bounds in Brussels.The atmosphere has warmed considerably since Truss took over the talks from Lord David Frost, who quit as Brexit secretary just before Christmas.Their second meeting, as their first, included a joint statement — something Frost refused to agree to. There was even a handshake for the cameras before the meeting at the European Commission’s Berlaymont headquarters in Brussels.Earlier this month, Truss wined and dined Sefcovic at her grace-and-favour mansion in the countryside for the first meeting. His budget does not match that of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, so it was sofas in the office and lunch in the commissioners’ dining room.In separate press appearances, the pair urged a swift resolution to an issue clouding their entire relationship.Truss said she wanted to “work constructively with the EU” and get a solution “in short order”.Sefcovic made clear the EU was not prepared to agree a radical rewrite of the Northern Ireland protocol, which governs trade between the EU and UK. It was time to be “laser-focused” on practical challenges faced by people and businesses in the region.The joint statement did not claim any progress was made. “The meeting took place in a constructive atmosphere with the aim to advance the talks,” it read.They will meet again next week. Sefcovic has said February is the last chance for a deal before campaigning for May elections in Northern Ireland starts.But with UK prime minister Boris Johnson under pressure to quit and Truss a frontrunner to succeed him, analysts say the likelihood of a deal by then is slim.Rolling out 5G technology can be patchy even within a country, but when it comes to the EU, the uneven deployment also reflects uneven regulatory regimes and different attitudes towards China, writes Javier Espinoza in Brussels.It’s a famous tale in Brussels: regulators issue guidelines for countries to follow on a policy area and then each member state ends up interpreting the way it suits its own economic (and geopolitical) interests.The same is happening with the rollout of 5G, a crucial technology that will enable the mass adoption of the Internet of Things and will bring the use of technology to a whole new level. The EU in 2020 issued guidelines on security restrictions countries can invoke to block the access of certain vendors from non-EU nations.A report from the European Court of Auditors published yesterday and looking at how those guidelines are implemented across the bloc found that about half of the EU nations had not adopted the bloc’s goal of rolling out 5G by 2030. The report also warned of security concerns because of patchy implementations of said guidelines, which essentially means some users are safer than others, depending on the country they live in.The study revealed that six of the eight largest vendors, including China’s Huawei and South Korea’s Samsung, were not based in the EU.“Legislation in non-EU countries can differ considerably from EU standards, for example in terms of personal data protection,” the report stresses.The auditors worry users in the bloc may be subject to foreign laws when control centres are located outside the EU.Annemie Turtelboom, the EU auditor responsible for this report, said unclear and non-binding rules meant member states were allowing foreign vendors in some places and not in others.“Member states’ approaches towards 5G security, and in particular the need for concerted action, remains an issue of strategic importance for the EU’s technological sovereignty and the single market,” she said.
128  Deutsche Bank alerted Germany’s financial crime watchdog to a €160,000 payment made by a client to one of its most senior bankers, which the men later explained was part of a failed attempt to buy a Porsche.Asoka Wöhrmann, then head of Deutsche’s private client business in Germany, received the money in 2018 from Daniel Wruck, managing director of Ice Field Dry Ice Engineering, a company that cleans chemical plants, according to documents seen by the Financial Times and people familiar with the matter. Wöhrmann has since become chief executive of asset manager DWS.As well as taking the highly unusual step of filing a suspicious activity report on a transaction involving one of its own bankers, Deutsche has recently widened an internal investigation into the matter, according to people familiar with the situation.After the payment to Wöhrmann was discovered in late 2018, it emerged that he had first transferred €160,000 to Wruck in September 2017. Both Wruck and Wöhrmann told the FT that the money was supposed to be used by Wruck to buy a new Porsche Panamera on behalf of Wöhrmann.“As a friend — and because he was personally known to the Porsche dealer — [Wruck] offered to help with the configuration and the order of the car,” a lawyer representing Wruck told the FT, adding that Wöhrmann therefore wired the discussed amount to be spent on the car to Wruck.Documents seen by the FT showed that Wruck at the time was in the process of ordering a new Panamera for himself. In July 2017, he told his dealer by email that Wöhrmann was his “friend” and “needs to get the same killer price [as I get]!!!!!”.A day before wiring €160,000 to Wruck, Wöhrmann first sent it directly to the Frankfurt Porsche dealership, which refunded it immediately as no order or invoice existed, documents seen by the FT showed.Porsche said that buyers of a new vehicle normally did not have to pay anything until they were invoiced two to three weeks before delivery.In September 2018, 12 months after Wöhrmann transferred the €160,000 in a transaction labelled “DW vehicle”, Wruck wired the same amount back to Wöhrmann, according to documents seen by the FT.A lawyer for Wruck said that her client had been unable to transfer the money for the car to the dealership “because Porsche wanted to receive the money directly from the prospective owner” and hence refunded the cash to Wöhrmann.Ultimately, Wöhrmann did not buy a new vehicle via Wruck but, in April 2018, signed a contract himself with the dealership for a used Panamera Turbo priced at €139,500. The DWS boss paid for the car himself in August, when he also picked it up.Neither man explained why it took 12 months for Wruck to repay the €160,000 that was not ultimately used to buy a car.At the time of the payments, Wruck and Wöhrmann were both involved in joint venture negotiations over Auto1 FinTech, a start-up initially backed by Deutsche, Allianz, Auto1 and outside investors.Wruck’s payment to Wöhrmann was spotted by Deutsche Bank’s anti-financial crime unit and reported to the Financial Intelligence Unit, according to four people familiar with the matter. The FIU and markets regulator BaFin declined to comment.Deutsche told the FT that it never commented on the existence of suspicious activity reports. “It is important to understand that SARs are alerts of potential suspicions and are not conclusions that any wrongdoing has occurred,” the bank said. “If and to the extent there are indications of wrongdoing, we look into it.”A senior compliance officer at Deutsche raised the matter with Wöhrmann, who explained the Porsche background, according to people familiar with the bank’s evaluation of the issue. Deutsche decided there was no evidence of illegal conduct but informally “admonished” Wöhrmann for acting unwisely, these people said.The bank’s compliance staff have recently revisited the matter, screening Wöhrmann’s bank accounts. He declared in an affidavit that he had never received any other payments from people linked to the Auto1 FinTech joint venture, the people said.DWS told the FT in a statement that Wöhrmann “strenuously rejects insinuations connected to his time as head of the German private bank of Deutsche Bank”.The bank last summer also looked at Wöhrmann’s use of a personal email account during the Auto1 FinTech negotiation, after Süddeutsche Zeitung flagged four business-related emails from a GMX address, a free German email service.The lender’s code of conduct stipulated that “only Deutsche Bank-approved communications devices and applications may be used for the conduct of any bank business whether by email, chat or other electronic messaging”.After the Süddeutsche Zeitung inquiry, the lender deemed those emails isolated events and innocuous.However, people involved in the Auto1 FinTech talks told the FT that Wöhrmann relied on his GMX account for months. “At least 50, if not 100” messages, including terms sheets, the business plan and other confidential information were sent to the account, according to one person familiar with the matter. Wöhrmann also used it to send emails sharing his views with the rest of the group, the people said.Deutsche has stepped up the probe into the email usage and the Porsche payments after it “received new information”, a person familiar with the matter said.DWS said that its chief executive had, in his previous role, “facilitated the talks of the involved parties of Auto 1 FinTech” and that he represented “the interests of Deutsche Bank at all times and instances”. The company declined to comment on the details of the money flows and the potential violations of Deutsche’s email policies.
129  Website developers are in short supply in Europe’s post-pandemic economy, so Stefan Knoll is using unorthodox tactics to hire them and other staff.The founder of Deutsche Familienversicherung, a fast-growing insurer based in Frankfurt, is offering €500 to anyone who interviews for a vacancy, another €1,000 to those who make it to a second round, and €5,000 more to those who complete a six-month probation.“It is particularly difficult to find anyone with IT skills,” he said. “We compete with giants like Allianz who can easily hire hundreds of people around the world — but we are not interested in hiring people in India, we want people here in Frankfurt.”Knoll’s unusual strategy is symptomatic of the staff shortages spreading across Germany and much of Europe. The result is a bullish labour market that gives EU countries a rare chance to end the high levels of joblessness and underemployment that have bedevilled the bloc since the 2008 financial crisis.The shortages are particularly visible in IT and healthcare; in construction, where demand has been turbocharged by booming house prices and an infusion of EU funding for green retrofitting projects; and in hospitality, where ever-changing rules make jobs seem less secure and more onerous.But the labour shortages are evident in other sectors too. A survey of 9,000 German companies by the KfW development bank and Ifo research group in October found 43 per cent were hampered by a lack of qualified staff — a record high since German reunification in 1990.In France, 54 per cent of service sector businesses are also finding it hard to recruit — the highest on record in a survey conducted since 2000. The government now offers subsidies to help the long-term unemployed train with employers that have unfilled posts.The speed of the rebound has been remarkable. After the 2008 financial crisis, EU unemployment rose for four years. Now, by contrast, it is at an all-time low, falling to 7.2 per cent in November. Even youth unemployment has fallen, closing in on a record low at 15.5 per cent.This is despite the end of most short-time work schemes introduced to mitigate coronavirus’ economic impact: the European Central bank estimates only 1.8 per cent of workers were still furloughed in October, versus 20 per cent in April 2020.“It has been a super-swift labour market recovery in Europe,” said Katharina Utermöhl, senior economist at Allianz. “We will see the upswing continuing in 2022 to set record lows in unemployment.”Although the Omicron variant may yet deliver a setback, economists expect employment to continue growing, spurred by the EU’s €800bn recovery plan. Unlike the US and UK, labour market participation is already above pre-pandemic levels in France and Spain, and only just short in Italy and Germany. Across the EU, the percentage of people aged 20 to 64 with a job stands at an all-time high of 73.5 per cent.“Over the next couple of years the eurozone will have a substantially stronger economy than before because government spending will be higher and spending by companies will be higher,” said Peter Schaffrik, global macro strategist at RBC Capital Markets,Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Macroeconomics said that if growth forecasts are correct, the eurozone employment will enter “uncharted territory”, with the biggest gains in countries such as Spain and Italy that lagged for years.That gives governments a rare opportunity to drive through reforms to help Europe’s long-term unemployed. Furthermore, although EU workers are not yet receiving the large wage increases that many US workers enjoy, they are well placed to bargain for better pay and conditions.Philippe Martin, chair of the independent Council of Economic Analysis advising France’s government, noted that more French employers are hiring staff on secure, permanent contracts, reversing the trend of more precarious, short-term arrangements. A deal reached this month in the hospitality sector, delivering an average 16 per cent pay rise, is also a sign that wage pressures are building.“It is much easier to have positive labour market reforms in an environment where the economy is growing,” Vistesen said.In contrast with previous reforms, which were aimed chiefly at boosting the quantity of jobs, governments are now focusing on raising their quality.Germany’s coalition government has pledged to introduce a €12 minimum wage that will benefit some 7m workers, despite employers warning it could hit hiring.Spain, meanwhile, is launching a crackdown on temporary contracts, which account for a quarter of the workforce, in reforms agreed between business and unions but yet to pass parliament.Rafael Doménech, head of economic analysis at BBVA, said these reforms were “not ambitious enough to solve the structural problems of the Spanish labour market”, with unemployment at 14.1 per cent in November.Even so, Ignacio de la Torre, chief economist at Arcano Partners, noted that Spain’s economy was adding 90,000 jobs a month, and the next round of collective bargaining deals should lead to significantly higher wages.Italy has a different problem: although unemployment is lower than in Spain, too many people choose not to work, women especially. But Rome, the biggest recipient of EU funds, now aims to create 264,480 childcare places over four years as part of a €26bn plan to boost the participation of women and young people.Guidogiorgio Bodrato, economist at Berenberg, said Italy’s jobs recovery was still at an early stage, with many new jobs on insecure temporary contracts. Even so, EU recovery funds would spur public sector hiring while tax cuts could boost private sector employment.“Demand is really solid and is going to stay solid for at least the next three years,” he said. “Even with a lag, Italian employment is improving very fast.”
130  In November, Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan received a gift to mark his taking over the helm of the Organization of Turkic States. The large, gold-framed map of “the Turkic world”, depicting communities of ethnic Turks across Europe and Asia, spoke to a deeply rooted nationalist vision of pan-Turkic unity.But the decision by Kazakhstan’s president Kassym-Jomart Tokayev to ask Vladimir Putin for help in suppressing protests that rocked his country has dealt a blow to Erdogan’s dreams of forming a bloc made up of Turkey and “brotherly” nations in the former Soviet Union.“The fact that Tokayev called Russia and Putin and not Turkey and Erdogan is proof that the big boss [in the region] is still Russia,” said Bayram Balci, director of the French Institute for Anatolian Studies in Istanbul.Putin, he said, had proved that he “can come in and save the regime”, adding: “This is something that Turkey cannot do for its allies in Central Asia.”The idea of brotherhood among Turks from the Balkans to China has cultural resonance in parts of Turkish society, speaking to the legend that Turkey’s modern-day population is descended from nomads from Central Asia.Resurrection: Ertugrul, a hit TV series launched by the state broadcaster in 2014, captured millions of viewers with its epic depictions of the Turkic warrior hero who lived a romantic nomadic existence and went on to found the Ottoman Empire. The rightwing opposition IYI party takes its name and logo from Ertugrul’s Kayi tribe.Erdogan himself is better known as an admirer of the Ottomans. But he has taken to drawing on Turkic imagery and symbolism in recent years as he has wooed nationalist voters and allied with the rightwing Nationalist Movement party.Efforts to build co-operation between Turkic states predate the current president, starting in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Turkey was the first country to recognise many of the newly independent states. The Turkish international development agency, TIKA, was founded in 1992 in order to send aid to the fledgling nations.The push to build ties gathered pace in 2009 with the founding of the Turkic Council, which was driven by Turkey and Kazakhstan’s now sidelined former president Nursultan Nazarbayev.Halil Akinci, the group’s founding secretary-general, said that rather than “drinking raki or vodka and sitting around singing cirpindir karadeniz” — a Turkish nationalist song — “we started to think of more useful and beneficial co-operation.”Akinci said that Ankara never had any intention of “ruling over or uniting” Turkic states, but rather wanted to promote economic, educational and cultural co-operation.In addition to building influence across the Balkans, the Arab world and Africa over the past decade, Turkey has significantly increased trade with Central Asia.Yet compared with the influence of China and Russia in the region, Ankara’s role remains “largely insignificant”, said Alp Coker, head of the Turkey desk at the London-based consultancy GPW. “Turkey never really established any military, political or economic influence to a meaningful extent,” he said.The exception, Coker said, was Azerbaijan, where Turkey is not only a key partner on energy and trade but also helped Baku to win a surprise victory in a war with Armenia in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020.That success, along with the upheaval in Kazakhstan, has spurred suggestions from some senior former Turkish military officers that the Turkic Council should have a military dimension.That would raise eyebrows in Moscow, where Ankara’s jostle for influence in parts of the former Soviet Union is part of a complex relationship of co-operation and competition with Russia that extends to Libya, Syria and Ukraine.Asked to respond to the Turkic world map that Erdogan was given last year, the response of Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, was pointed.“Our Turkish partners are cherishing the idea of Turkic unity, and it is normal,” said Peskov, a fluent Turkish speaker. “But the only thing I regret is that this map doesn’t have a big red star in the centre of the Turkic world.” Such a star, he added, should be marked on the Altai Republic, the legendary home of the Turkic race. It is a part of modern-day Siberia.
131  That Moscow has deployed more than 100,000 troops to Ukraine’s border is also being taken by UK officials as an opportunity for Britain to project its global standing post-Brexit, prove the continuing weight of its security services and demonstrate its military kinship with Washington and the US-led military alliance, Nato. “The UK is being vocal and assertive because traditional security is one of the few spheres in which the UK is still fairly strong and is not affected by Brexit,” said Michael Clarke, a former director of the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank. “It is one of the few areas where our European partners still have to take us seriously. The UK has the imperative here, and the opportunity, to show what ‘Global Britain’ might mean in an important security context.” Over the past week, Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, has lambasted what he called Putin’s “ethnonationalist” provocations and announced that the UK would send anti-tank missiles to Ukraine. The US and Baltic states have also sent weapons.Liz Truss, foreign secretary, then took the unusual step on Saturday of declassifying intelligence from MI6, the UK’s Secret Intelligence Service, which claimed Russia was plotting to install a pro-Moscow leader in Kyiv. Then, on Monday, Johnson, in response to rising fears of a potential Russian attack on Ukraine, warned Moscow that any such invasion would be a “disastrous step”. Russia, which has accused the UK of fuelling tensions in the region, denies it plans any attack. French officials on Monday also described the UK position as “very alarmist.We have to be careful.” The UK — like the US but so far unlike EU countries — has partially withdrawn staff from its embassy in Kyiv. Britain “was off the diplomatic pace.with the PM mired in various scandals”, said Lord Peter Ricketts, the UK’s former national security adviser. But “there has been a distinct pick-up in tempo”. For all their post-Brexit differences, the EU has made maintaining strong defence and security ties with the UK a key objective. Truss is also understood to want to avoid what happened when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and the UK was seen as being absent on the international stage. “[I] doubt if Vladimir is quaking in his boots,” said one British diplomat. “But if the noise being generated by us and allies delivers de-escalation, the UK will suddenly look like a player again.”The UK has so far sent to Ukraine a team of about 30 specialist troops from the special operations Ranger Regiment as well as 2,000 short-range anti-tank missiles, and Wallace has said he is open to sending more. “Britain opens military aid bridge to Ukraine,” blared an approving headline on the website of one of Ukraine’s most important military consultancies, Defense Express. “In two days, Britain has provided more anti-tank weapons than all Nato countries since 2014,” it added. Brussels officials say the diplomatic aspects of British participation became clear at the G7 meeting in Liverpool, England last month where the UK, France, Germany and the EU’s chief diplomat Josep Borrell agreed on a strong commitment of co-operation to deter Russia.Militarily, the UK is also viewed by the EU’s eastern states as the continent’s most important partner in Nato, the region’s prime security guarantor.Last year the UK sent 140 engineers to help Poland secure its border with Belarus after Minsk’s authoritarian regime engineered a migrant crisis on the EU’s eastern flank. At the time, the UK ministry of defence said the personnel would “support Polish troops with planning and specific engineering tasks”. Poland’s defence minister called the deployment an “expression of our allied solidarity”.A similar dynamic may play out in Ukraine. If Russia does invade its neighbour, few believe there will be active military support from any Nato member, be that the US or the UK. Instead, London would be expected to provide further technical military support and intelligence. “We have no plans to send UK combat troops to Ukraine,” Downing Street insisted on Monday. Britain is also seen by senior EU officials as an indispensable partner in any sanctions package — as last year, when London and Brussels co-ordinated a package of Belarus sanctions.Lastly, there is British diplomacy, where Clarke argues the crisis plays to the UK’s “old cold-war” strengths. Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu has agreed to meet his UK counterpart Wallace in Moscow. Truss is also expected to visit Moscow and Kyiv in the coming weeks for diplomatic talks. Perhaps the most important element of those talks will be if Britain can contribute meaningfully to a detente, Clarke suggested, such as by “helping give Moscow a ladder to climb down, even if there is some military action” as well.
132  President Vladimir Putin has insisted during the crisis over Ukraine that Nato should stop its encroachment towards Russia’s borders. But his demand is having unintended consequences in Europe’s far north, reviving talk of whether Finland and Sweden should join the military alliance.As the world’s attention focuses on the Russian troops massing on Ukraine’s border, leaders from across the political spectrum in both Nordic countries have stressed that they have the option to apply for membership at any time.“The debate is vivid and unprecedented. A lot is going on. A lot depends on what happens next,” said Henri Vanhanen, foreign policy and EU adviser to the centre-right National Coalition party, Finland’s main opposition group and a proponent of Nato membership.Swedish and Finnish foreign ministers met Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg in Brussels on Monday, the latest in a series of diplomatic conversations that have included Finnish president Sauli Niinisto speaking to both his US and Russian counterparts in recent days.“Nato’s door remains open.Sweden and Finland are our closest partners,” Stoltenberg said after the meeting.Pekka Haavisto, Finland’s foreign minister, said: “Finland is not a member of Nato, but maintaining the national room to manoeuvre and freedom of choice are also integral parts of Finland’s foreign, security and defence policy.”Both Nordic countries, which gave up their traditional neutrality because of their membership of the EU and its mutual defence clause, have grown closer to Nato in recent years, allowing its troops to cross their territory in times of crisis or during exercises.Russia has threatened a sharp response should Nato expand further by including the two countries around the Baltic Sea. The foreign ministry in Moscow said in December that Sweden and Finland joining Nato “would have serious military and political consequences that would require an adequate response from the Russian side”.Anna Wieslander, director of northern Europe at US think-tank Atlantic Council, said Russia’s own actions were pushing Sweden and Finland to consider a move that Moscow did not want.“If we are in a comfortable place in Sweden, then there’s not much push to change our security policy. There are other issues that are more important. You need that external threat and that’s counter-productive for Russia,” she added.Ann Linde, Sweden’s foreign minister, said she was “deeply concerned” about Russia’s intentions towards Ukraine and its “aggressive rhetoric”, while stressing that it was important to have met Nato together with Finland.Sweden and Finland have recently deepened their defence co-operation with each other and there has long been an assumption that the two countries would act in lockstep on any move to join Nato.Observers believe the debate around joining Nato is deeper in Finland, perhaps reflecting the fact that it has never let its military guard down, maintaining heavy defence spending and a large pool of reservists, while Sweden ended conscription and cut back heavily on its forces.Since the nadir of the early 2010s, when Sweden’s defence commander conceded it could not defend itself for more than a week and the country was unable to scramble jets as Russia practised a dummy bombing raid on Stockholm, Sweden has upped its military spending and reinstated conscription.Stockholm appears more politically divided over Nato than Helsinki. The ruling centre-left Social Democrats are firmly against membership, while the centre-right opposition is united in wanting to join.In Finland, centre-left prime minister Sanna Marin caused consternation last week when she said it was “very unlikely” that the country would apply for membership during her term in office. Under heavy criticism from an opposition that maintains that Finland should keep its options open, Marin said her comments had been “overinterpreted”.Still, many in Helsinki repeat the half-joke that Finland is only “one sauna” away from joining Nato, meaning that the party leaders and president could decide quickly — in a sauna or not — to apply for membership if circumstances dictated.“If Finland was in a serious consideration of Nato membership, we probably wouldn’t even know it at this point. It’s not wise to show your cards beforehand,” said Vanhanen.He added that Finland used its Nato option as a “deterrent” in its foreign policy, keeping its strategy and plan vague and its public pronouncements subtle. Finland recently raised its military readiness, but gave no details.Sweden, on the other hand, sent convoys of military vehicles down motorways and on passenger ferries to the island of Gotland — often compared to an aircraft carrier in the Baltic Sea — in a highly visible response to Russian ships in the vicinity.“I used to think that Sweden would have to take the lead, as we’re the biggest Nordic country. But given how the dynamics are now, I would bet more that it could start moving quicker in Helsinki than Stockholm,” said Wieslander.The debate is not purely about what Nato membership could mean for Sweden and Finland, but also about what the two countries — with their crucial strategic position in northern Europe — could bring to the military alliance.Kaja Kallas, Estonia’s prime minister, told the Financial Times the decision would be for Sweden and Finland only. But she added: “If they decide to do so, we would be strong supporters for them in Nato.”Kallas noted that they would add strong military capabilities and help the three Baltic states “who are like a peninsula in terms of Nato”. She added: “It would definitely strengthen the security situation here.”
133  In the affluent Paris suburb of Montesson, Carrefour store manager Laurent Pasguay has plastered his mobile phone number and photo throughout the sprawling hypermarket.“Customers say the store is too big, so it’s up to us to find ways to help them navigate and enjoy it,” said Pasguay. “They call or text when the lines are long at the cashier or when they can’t find the products being promoted this week. ” The food retailer has adopted this tactic at all its hypermarkets in France, where consumer enthusiasm for big weekly shops has waned.The success of chief executive Alexandre Bompard’s promised turnround may hang on such details. Since arriving in 2017, the 49-year-old has cut costs aggressively, slashed prices to win back customers, invested to catch up in ecommerce and exited unprofitable markets including China.The results have been mixed. On the plus side, cash generation has improved significantly, allowing Carrefour to resume cash dividends and buybacks for the first time in years. Yet its business in France continues to suffer because of stiff competition and reliance on hypermarkets, while ecommerce penetration is low and operating profit has barely budged.As a result, investors remain wary of the group that pioneered the hypermarket in France in the 1960s and exported it to become among the world’s biggest food retailers.Its shares trade at a roughly 35 per cent discount to the European food retail sector and have slumped 20 per cent since Bompard took over. That lags behind increases over the same period of 64 per cent for Dutch leader Ahold Delhaize and 30 per cent for Tesco in the UK. US food retailers Walmart and The Kroger Co have left it in the dust, with rises of 84 per cent and 105 per cent.The performance has frustrated Bompard and at times strained his relationship with Carrefour’s biggest investors, the Moulins family and Brazilian billionaire Abilio Diniz, who hold 10 per cent and 8 per cent stakes in the company respectively. Billionaire Bernard Arnault sold his stake last year.Carrefour has also become a takeover target: Canada’s Couche-Tard showed interest last year before the French government scuppered its approach and smaller domestic rival Auchan wants to revive a bid after it was previously rejected in October, according to people familiar with the matter.Bompard said the “hard and unglamorous” work of the turnround was now complete, setting Carrefour up for growth driven by ecommerce and opportunities in online advertising and data.“All the bricks are now in place for a new, powerful model,” he said in an interview late last year. “I believe we are at a tipping point for our industry and, once we prove that, then the market’s perception of Carrefour will change.”Bompard is expected to present a new strategy in the coming months. It will build on five-year targets announced in November to triple ecommerce revenue to €10bn and add €600m to group operating profit, which would be an uplift of 30 per cent from 2020 levels.If successful, the digital push would validate the heavy investments Bompard has made. Like other food retailers, Carrefour has had to spend heavily on software, logistics, warehouses and skilled workers to enable ecommerce.Supermarket chains in many countries have so far struggled to make sizeable profits from online grocery because of the resources required. In France, however, Carrefour benefits from consumers favouring click-and-collect over home delivery, which is more expensive to operate.Bompard believes Carrefour has figured out how to thrive in the ecommerce era: “If we were having this conversation even two years ago, I would not have necessarily said that.”But with ecommerce only 4 per cent of group sales in 2021, investors have focused on Carrefour’s physical retail operation, which includes 13,000 stores it operates directly in nine countries, with the biggest being France, Brazil and Spain.France has dominated the debate because Carrefour still generates half of revenues domestically and comparable sales growth there has been muted outside of the 2020 pandemic boost. Price competition in the country has been more intense, analysts say, because France has more players than elsewhere in Europe or the US. Carrefour lost 5 percentage points of market share since 2010, mostly to the privately held groups Leclerc and Intermarché, and discounters such as Lidl, according to Kantar Worldpanel.“The French business is more strategically challenged than people think,” said Bernstein analyst William Woods.To cope, Bompard has closed and sold off stores, shed headquarters staff and invested the savings into lowering prices and in technology. By 2020, Carrefour achieved €3bn in cost cuts, and pledged another €2.4bn by 2024.Stemming French hypermarket share losses has also been a priority. In Montesson, Pasguay has installed a sushi counter, a salmon smoking station and a stand staffed with Neapolitan pizza makers. In a nod to discount rivals, a section of the store offers low-price household basics and seasonal goods.Pasguay holds morning management meetings to scrutinise the store’s daily net promoter score generated by customers’ ratings in the Carrefour app. The store is ranked against others in real time. “If the score drops, it’s a warning,” said Pasguay.Some question whether better service and cheaper prices than urban centre rivals can reinvigorate sales, when it is the size of hypermarkets and the time needed to shop at them that many consumers dislike.“Consumption habits have changed in the past 20 years as the population gets older and people buy more non-food items online,” said Frédéric Valette, an analyst at Kantar Worldpanel. Carrefour has stemmed hypermarket share losses, but “the competition is still very intense”.For lossmaking French stores that Carrefour cannot fix, Bompard has farmed them out to motivated entrepreneurs, often former employees who want to be their own bosses.Under a “lease management” model, Carrefour signs a long-term contract under which the entrepreneurs run their stores as they see fit, employ the staff directly and choose their own inventory and promotions. The stores must still carry some Carrefour products, and the group shoulders capital expenditures. Both share any losses for a transition period.One big advantage: new managers can scrap certain terms of Carrefour’s union contract that give workers benefits, such as paid time off when a child is ill, employee discounts or annual bonuses.Carrefour has long had many smaller-format supermarkets under lease management or franchise, but in 2018 only two hypermarkets had such arrangements. After a period of experimentation, Bompard added 10 in 2020, 10 in 2021 and plans 16 more this year.Former Carrefour store manager Nicolas Catrix took over a struggling hypermarket in the town of Sens Voulx in 2019. He cut costs on cleaning and security, trimmed staff from 160 to 125 and started to buy more local produce. “Every morning I look at the accounts and ask myself what can I spend less on that will not affect customers’ experience?” he said. “The store was losing money and it does not any more.” Tensions emerged with staff over changes to their contract terms, he admitted. “Workers lose out when stores go under lease management,” said Michel Enguelz, a representative at trade union organisation Force Ouvrière. “It’s a financial manoeuvre, nothing more.”For Catrix, the experience has been successful enough that he has signed contracts for two more stores.Barclays analyst Nicolas Champ said investors viewed lease management positively because it showed Bompard’s creativity in tackling old problems.But he said Carrefour need to do more to improve its standing with investors: “They either have to consolidate the French market. or they need to improve performance there markedly by turning around hypermarkets and taking market share in ecommerce to improve margins.”For Bompard the choice is not so stark. “I’ve never been as confident in the model that we are building,” he said. “However, I will continue to analyse any deals that come up. The progress we have made allows us to evaluate them very coldly and with very high standards since we do not need them.” **This story has been amended to clarify the size of the stakes in Carrefour owned by the Moulins family and Brazilian billionaire Abilio Diniz.
134  The US has placed about 8,500 troops on standby for possible deployment to central and eastern Europe to shore up Nato’s defences as western leaders pledged to form a united front against the threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.The Pentagon’s announcement that it was prepared to move additional personnel to Nato’s eastern flank came as the US and its allies hardened their response to Russia’s build-up of forces along the Ukrainian border.“At the direction of the president and following recommendations made by secretary [Lloyd] Austin, the United States has taken steps to heighten the readiness of its forces at home and abroad,” said John Kirby, Pentagon spokesperson.“They are prepared to respond to a range of contingencies, including support to the Nato Response Force, if it is activated,” he added.The step was announced just before President Joe Biden held a wide-ranging video conference call from the White House situation room with European leaders, which lasted an hour and 20 minutes. The conversation covered both diplomatic efforts to defuse the crisis and punitive actions against Moscow in the event of an attack on Ukraine.“The leaders underscored their shared desire for a diplomatic resolution to the current tensions and reviewed recent engagements with Russia in multiple formats,” the White House said in a statement.“The leaders also discussed their joint efforts to deter further Russian aggression against Ukraine, including preparations to impose massive consequences and severe economic costs on Russia for such actions as well as to reinforce security on Nato’s eastern flank,” it added.A Downing Street spokesperson said allies agreed to “swift retributive responses including an unprecedented package of sanctions”, while an EU official said the leaders pledged “full transatlantic unity”.During his briefing with reporters, Kirby said no decision had been made on whether to deploy additional US troops to the region, but he noted they would now be ready within five days instead of 10. The multinational Nato response force, if activated, would involve the deployment of up to 40,000 personnel.The White House call involved Boris Johnson, UK prime minister; Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor; Emmanuel Macron, France’s president; Andrzej Duda, Poland’s president; and Mario Draghi, Italy’s prime minister, as well as EU leaders and the Nato secretary-general.The virtual meeting of western leaders followed days of escalating warnings that an invasion by Russia could be imminent, including a British alert that Moscow was plotting to install a pro-Kremlin puppet government in Kyiv.In an ominous statement, Johnson said on Monday that there was evidence of Russian plans “for a lightning war that could take out” the Ukrainian capital, which would be “painful, violent and bloody business” for Moscow. “I think it’s very important that people in Russia understand that this could be a new Chechnya,” he said.Britain also ordered a number of its embassy staff and family members to leave Ukraine on Monday, a day after the US told family members of its embassy staff to evacuate Kyiv because of the risk of “significant military action” by Russia.Despite the growing drumbeat of military conflict, western diplomats have continued to stress that a diplomatic solution remained a possibility and the preferred option.Antony Blinken, secretary of state, said the US would send written responses to Russian demands in the coming days, which could ease tensions and provide the basis for a settlement. Ned Price, state department spokesperson, said Blinken was discussing the response with allies and “incorporating that feedback into the written response”.
135  Italian lawmakers unleashed a deluge of blank votes in the first round of the presidential election on Monday in a delaying action amid intense backroom negotiations to resolve an impasse over whom to anoint as head of state.Of the 976 ballots cast, 672 had no name written on them — reflecting an agreement among members of Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s fragile national unity government to avoid an outcome that could upset Italy’s delicate political equilibrium.While Draghi, a former president of the European Central Bank, is widely viewed as frontrunner to be Italy’s president, lawmakers fear his election as head of state could inadvertently propel the country into early elections unless parties can agree his successor as prime minister.Political leaders are trying to hammer out an agreement on either an alternative consensus presidential candidate or on the shape of a new government if Draghi gets the job.“We are facing a perfect storm,” said Gianluca Passarelli, a professor of political science at Rome’s Sapienza University. “If Draghi becomes president of the republic, the government may not hold. The parties are racing against time to find a person who can hold the majority together until the 2023 elections. This is the pivot of the intense negotiations of these hours.”The blank ballots ensured no candidate had the necessary support to win the presidency, giving parties more time to negotiate. The process will continue with a second round of voting on Tuesday.Two senior members of parliament from opposite sides of the political spectrum told the Financial Times that the absence of a “plausible alternative” president increased the odds of Draghi eventually getting the job.However, a centre-right lawmaker said: “[This] is not without major stomach aches within the governing coalition.” Voting took place over five hours to maintain strict Covid-19 protocols and social distancing, with some of the electors who are suffering from the virus casting their ballots at a drive-through facility.Outside the parliament, where votes were being counted, Andrea Marcucci, a senator from the centre-left Democratic party, said: “It is not easy to find a solution.“It is crucial to find a president who represents the entire nation but also necessary to guarantee authoritative leadership at the helm of government so we can move forward, manage emergencies and secure the EU recovery funds,” Marcucci said.In the next two rounds of voting, a candidate will require the support of two-thirds of electors to win the presidency. But from the fourth round, likely to take place on Thursday, a candidate can win with just half the votes plus one, raising the prospect of a political bloc being able to push through its favoured nominee without a broad consensus.The election to replace incumbent Sergio Mattarella, whose term ends on February 3, comes at a turbulent time for Italy, which has just begun a programme of economic and social reforms to reboot its chronically underperforming economy. The EU will provide up to €200bn for the programme, but Italy will have to adhere to strict timelines in order to receive the funds.Left-leaning politicians and senior bureaucrats said Draghi has refused to offer reassurances on the composition of a potential future government, including any successor as premier, adding to the hesitation over elevating him to the presidency.Italy’s heads of state have the power to name prime ministers, though those appointed must eventually secure the support of a parliamentary majority, and approve or veto cabinet appointments.“Everyone wants to avoid a snap election but they also want a government with a stronger political presence. They don’t want technocrats in key posts and another one as president,” said one senior official.
136  Nato members began sending additional ships and fighter jets to allied countries in eastern Europe yesterday as Boris Johnson said that Russia had massed enough troops close to Ukraine for a “lightning war” in which it would try to seize Kyiv.The UK prime minister’s comments came in response to fears of a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine. Nato said its members were putting military forces on standby for a potential attack.The White House also announced that US president Joe Biden would hold a video call to discuss Ukraine later on Monday with European leaders, including Johnson, French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Olaf Scholz.Johnson said there were 60 Russian battle groups on the borders of Ukraine, which he described as evidence of a “plan for a lightning war that could take out Kyiv”. “That would be a disastrous step,” he said. For Moscow, any invasion is “going to be a painful, violent and bloody business. I think it’s very important that people in Russia understand that this could be a new Chechnya”.Russia has deployed more than 106,000 troops close to its border with Ukraine in recent months.Alexander Lukashenko, Belarus’s strongman leader, said he would deploy “an entire contingent” of his army at the Ukrainian border in response to Nato force deployments in the Baltics and troop build-ups in Ukraine.“This has nothing to do with any occupation. We just want to defend our southern border,” he added.At a meeting of EU foreign ministers and US secretary of state Antony Blinken, the bloc reiterated its warning that it would impose “severe costs” on Russia in the event of any attack and said it had “accelerated” work on those sanctions.The EU also reaffirmed its “commitment to further support Ukraine’s resilience”, including in the areas of “professional military education”.Over the weekend, the UK said it had evidence that Russia’s president Vladimir Putin was seeking to install a puppet regime in Kyiv.A senior French official said: “The UK is developing positions that are very explicit, very alarmist. We have to be careful not to create self-fulfilling prophecies.”While western powers have released intelligence on Russia’s alleged intentions, Moscow has repeatedly denied that it plans to invade. But the Kremlin has said the risk of conflict is “very high” in the eastern Donbas border region, where more than 14,000 have died since 2014 in a slow-burning war with Russia-backed separatists.On the Nato moves, Jens Stoltenberg, the alliance’s secretary-general, said: “I welcome allies contributing additional forces.Nato will continue to take all necessary measures to protect and defend all allies, including by reinforcing the eastern part of the alliance.“We will always respond to any deterioration of our security environment, including through strengthening our collective defence.”Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesman, told reporters that the west was to blame for escalating tensions by deploying more forces and publishing “fake” claims of two Russian regime change plots in Ukraine.“This isn’t happening because of what we, Russia, are doing. This is all happening because of what Nato and the US are doing and the information they are distributing,” Peskov said.Peskov added that Putin wanted to “avoid [a] similar tense situation in the future” by focusing on security talks with the US and Nato.The US is expected to send Russia a written response this week to its draft proposals to end Nato’s eastward expansion, roll back its deployments in eastern European countries and pledge never to admit Ukraine — a step that would essentially rewrite the entire post-cold war security order in Europe.“Unfortunately, we all live in these aggressive surroundings.This is the reality in which we live. Our head of state, as the commander-in-chief and the person who defines our foreign policy, is taking the essential measures so that our security and interests are ensured at the appropriate level,” Peskov said.Alexander Grushko, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, accused Nato of “demonising” Moscow to justify the “pointless” deployments, according to Interfax.Grushko said the spectre of a renewed Russian invasion of Ukraine “existed only in inflamed minds in the west” and was “being used to demonstrate that the alliance is in demand and ready to come to the defence of its helpless allies in the face of the Russian threat”.“The more Nato pumps into pointlessly strengthening its eastern flank, the louder the cries about Russian aggressiveness are,” Grushko said.Nato’s statement on Monday came as several western countries said they had taken steps to evacuate families of diplomats based in Kyiv out of the country. Britain on Monday ordered a number of its embassy staff and their family members to leave Ukraine. The move came after the US on Sunday told family members of its embassy staff to leave Kyiv because of the risk of “significant military action” by Russia. The US and UK said their embassies would remain open.Moscow’s Moex stock index fell more than 7.5 per cent and yields on Russia’s government debt hit their highest level in six years, as the potential for western-imposed sanctions prompted investors to dump Russian assets. The central bank stepped in as the rouble closed in on a record low against the dollar by limiting foreign currency purchases.Gas futures linked to TTF, Europe’s wholesale gas price, jumped more than 11 per cent to €88.40 a megawatt hour. Russia supplies about a third of Europe’s gas. The rouble lost 1.5 per cent to trade at 78.9 to the US dollar, a 14-month low.Ukraine is not a member of Nato, but western officials have warned that any conflict could affect neighbours to the west.Nato said examples of the alliance strengthening include an already announced move by Denmark to send a frigate to the Baltic Sea and France’s readiness to send troops to Romania.Spain has sent the frigate Blas de Lezo from Ferrol on its Atlantic coast to the Black Sea several weeks ahead of schedule, for which Stoltenberg thanked prime minister Pedro Sánchez at the weekend.José Manuel Albares, Spain’s foreign minister, told the Financial Times that such deployments “showed Spain’s commitment to the security of Europe, whether the eastern or southern flank”.
137  The writer was US ambassador to Nato, 1993-98Ukraine will never join Nato, and there will be no war between Russia and the west. The first has long been assured. The second will depend on whether Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden follow the tried and trusted methods of international diplomacy.As early as May 1989, President George H W Bush laid out aspirations for the post-cold war era: to create a “Europe whole and free” and at peace. The challenge was to engage Russia in broader European security and politics without it playing a spoiler’s role. Nato would remain and Russia would not be stigmatised as having lost the cold war. In 1997, Nato decided to take in three new members, Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary — the first two to reassure everyone about Germany’s future.The Nato-Russia Founding Act established a joint council in which Moscow would be an equal partner. The allies would not let Ukraine become part of a Russian sphere of influence, but also knew it could not be included in Nato. The result was the Nato-Ukraine Charter which gives Ukraine the right to consultations at Nato and a long list of areas of co-operation, together with a promise that in time it might be considered for Nato membership.The flaw in this arrangement lies in the so-called open-door policy, which the US and its allies continue to assert. But “open door” only means the right to apply to join Nato. It does not means an applicant will gain the unanimous vote it needs to join. Ukraine is unlikely ever to secure unanimity at Nato.The same goes for Georgia, something the second Bush administration forgot when, at Nato’s 2008 summit in Bucharest, it pushed for “membership action plans” for the two countries. Other allies rebelled; but to keep Bush from going home empty-handed, they agreed that Ukraine and Georgia “will become members of Nato”. In diplo-speak, that meant “never” and was understood as such.Putin, who had always been bitter about the collapse of the Soviet Union and its consequences, bided his time until 2014, when Russia seized Crimea and sent troops into Ukraine’s mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region.The current crisis in Ukraine is the next step in Putin’s bid for Russia to play in the big leagues again and to be recognised as such by the US. It is doubtful that he has ever intended to invade, which would make Russia a pariah state for years to come. For his part, Biden signalled a desire to talk by ruling out a role for US military forces. Russia then signalled its readiness to resume diplomacy by tabling two draft treaties.Diplomacy is thus now front-and-centre, with only the terms of agreement to be hammered out. The US has the tougher job: Putin has an audience of one, whereas Biden has to deal with 29 allies, Ukraine, Georgia, other members of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and critics at home.The outcome will recognise that Ukraine will not join Nato and that countries will still be allowed to apply (although there are no serious countries left on the list of potential new members). Additionally, the two sides will agree to confidence-building measures. These are already on the table, and the Nato-Russia Council has been resuscitated. The US also needs Russia to end cyber attacks and interference in US and European democracies. Moscow has already moved to close down REvil, a major hacking network based in Russia.The message from the Geneva meeting last week between US secretary of state Antony Blinken and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov was clear: the crisis has moved into the dealmaking stage. It’s just the terms that have to be worked out.The US and Nato, along with Russia if Putin understands where his country’s real interests lie, will have a chance again to pursue a Europe whole and free and at peace.
138  Turkey suffered a manufacturing shutdown after problems with the country’s gas supplies forced the state to impose electricity cuts on industry.Tofas, a Turkish carmaker part-owned by Fiat Chrysler, was among those announcing a halt in production on Monday, according to Turkish media, after the government said it would impose three days of power cuts on heavy industrial users this week. Others included Renault’s joint venture, which said it would halt production at its factory in Bursa, in the west of the country, for 15 days from Monday.The outages, which risk stoking Turkey’s already soaring inflation and hitting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s export targets, come after Iran — which provides around 10 per cent of Turkey’s natural gas — last week announced that it would temporarily suspend gas exports to its neighbour because of technical problems.The drop in supply, combined with high demand for energy as cold weather and snow have swept the country, has put heavy pressure on the power network in a country where more than half of electricity is produced in gas-fired power stations.“It’s an extraordinary shortage for Turkey,” said Emre Erturk, founder of the Istanbul-based consultancy Energy IQ. “This kind of country-wide curtailment plan has never been adopted for this long.”The decision was met with dismay by Turkish manufacturers, who complained they were given little notice of being forced to halt production this week — with power outages affecting different provinces on different days.Botas, the state gas importer, announced an exemption for companies making crucial goods including medicines, milk and meat products.But analysts and industry figures said that the move risked hitting key manufacturing sectors, including automotive, steel and textiles.The power shortage could threaten Erdogan’s efforts to put exports at the centre of what he has termed his new economic model. He hopes booming overseas sales will be the upside of a sharp slide in the Turkish lira, which lost around 45 per cent of its value against the dollar last year.“It will have consequences in terms of export growth,” said Ozlem Derici Sengul, the founder of the Istanbul-based Spinn Consultancy. “If it does not stay as a one-time shock, we may have to revise our overall growth estimates down.” Derici Sengul added that a prolonged shutdown could also further fuel inflation, which was close to a 20-year high of 36 per cent in December.Turkey sent a delegation of officials to Iran on Monday in an effort to resolve the crisis, according to Bloomberg news service.Tehran oil minister Javad Owji said at the weekend that Turkey had urged Iran to continue gas exports and postpone repair operations. “But considering that it was risky and could cause incidents, we had no other choice but to bring down the [gas] pressure and exports,” Owji told local media. “Based on our contract and safety issues, we have to fix the leak at the first possible opportunity. But the cold weather made us postpone it for a few days. This problem definitely needs to be resolved while we see this as a matter of principle.”In a telephone conversation on Saturday, Erdogan told President Ebrahim Raisi that Turkey considered its neighbour a “reliable source of energy”, according to Iranian media. No further details were given.Erturk, the energy analyst, said that while Ankara had made significant efforts to increase its gas importing capacity in recent years, it had failed to renew critical long-term contracts that expired last year with Russia and Azerbaijan.An earlier version of this story said inflation hit a 20-year high in January.
139  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
140  Over the weekend, I had breakfast with a former Downing Street official, who still lives and breathes UK politics. He asked me if I thought Russia would invade Ukraine in the next couple of weeks. I replied that I thought it distinctly possible. My friend looked stricken. “Oh, no,” he exclaimed, “a war is about the only thing that could save Boris.”That reply captured the current mood of deep insularity in Britain. But the UK is not unique. In fact, most of the big countries in western Europe are currently in the midst of destabilising political transitions — which make them even less prepared than usual for a confrontation with Russia.In the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s grip on power is becoming steadily weaker. The main debate in Westminster seems to be whether the prime minister’s remaining time in office is better measured in weeks or months. In France, Emmanuel Macron is less than three months away from a presidential election. In Germany, Olaf Scholz has been chancellor for just a few weeks and is trying to hold together an untested coalition government. In Italy, an electoral college will begin voting for a new president of the republic on January 24. If Mario Draghi, the current prime minister, gets the job, the Italian government will have to be reconstituted and might fall.Democracies usually find it hard to focus on a “quarrel in a far away country between people of whom we know nothing” — as Neville Chamberlain said of Czechoslovakia. But this is a particularly distracted time in western Europe, which may make it a good time for President Vladimir Putin to make his move in eastern Europe.In Britain, Johnson now has to concentrate on trying to fend off his own political demise. Largely unnoticed by the public, the UK government has adopted a hawkish position on Ukraine. The British have been flying defensive weaponry into the country and have publicly accused Russia of planning a coup in Ukraine.This UK stance is a legacy of a decade and more of bad relations with Russia. The British may also relish the opportunity of demonstrating that, after Brexit, the country is capable of taking notably bolder stands on security issues than the EU. But the cost of Brexit is that the UK’s ability to shape the response of Europe as a whole has been seriously weakened. It is not just that Britain is not at the table when the EU debates Russia. The Johnson government is also widely regarded as flaky and untrustworthy in the other big European capitals.However, French and German instincts on Russia are also widely mistrusted in the rest of Europe. Macron has never disguised his ambition to be the dominant political figure in the EU — an ambition that may seem more plausible, now that Angela Merkel has stepped down after 16 years as German chancellor.But most of Europe’s smaller countries look to America to guarantee their security. Indeed, some fear that the French president could actually undermine their security, by trying to cut a deal with Russia over their heads. Those anxieties were heightened last week, when Macron gave a speech suggesting that the EU should launch its own diplomatic initiative with Russia.French officials reacted angrily to the suggestion that their president was weakening western unity and Nato. Yet they can hardly be surprised at this response, given that Macron has, in the past, called Nato “brain-dead”.All his pronouncements must, in any case, be read in the context of the presidential election. For the moment, a policy of relative firmness towards Moscow looks politically astute for Macron — particularly since it highlights the French far right’s history of sympathy towards Putin. But if a Russian attack on Ukraine causes an energy crisis and an economic downturn across the EU, the timing would be very awkward for Macron — just ahead of April’s vote.The chief question mark hangs over Germany. The Ukraine crisis hits one of the biggest faultlines running through the new coalition government. The Greens, who hold the foreign ministry, are relatively hawkish on Russia. But Scholz’s party, the Social Democrats, have many Russlandversteher (Russia understanders) within their ranks. Gerhard Schröder, the last SPD chancellor before Scholz, chairs the shareholders’ committee of Nord Stream 2, the controversial gas pipeline from Russia to Germany that bypasses Ukraine. That pipeline has become a symbol of Germany’s unhealthy dependence on Russia and disdain for the interests of the countries that lie between Russia and Germany.Vice-Admiral Kay-Achim Schönbach, the head of the German navy, has just been forced to resign — after remarking that what Putin wants is the respect that he “probably deserves”. But many Europeans suspect that he was simply saying in public what many influential Germans think in private. Berlin’s continuing refusal to supply weaponry to Ukraine is bitterly resented in Kyiv.The German desire to play down or even ignore the dangers posed by Putin’s Russia is deeply rooted in history. But it is unlikely to be sustainable. Berlin is closer to Lviv, the largest city in western Ukraine, than it is to Paris. Like it or not, Germany is now uncomfortably close to the front line of Europe’s most dangerous conflict.
141  Russian stocks and bonds took a further hit on Monday, while the rouble also sank, as investors reacted to warnings of a rising threat of military action against Ukraine.Moscow’s Moex stock index was down more than 5.5 per cent, taking its losses so far this year to nearly 15 per cent, following the partial withdrawals from their embassies in Ukraine by the US and UK. Russia’s government debt also slumped, pushing yields to their highest level in six years, as the potential for swingeing western sanctions prompted investors to dump Russian assets.“All the weekend news is pretty bad,” said Viktor Szabo, an emerging markets fund manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “No one wants to be left holding long positions in Russia, so everything is selling off today.”The rouble lost more than 2 per cent against the dollar to hit its weakest level since November 2020. The slide prompted the Russian central bank to halt its regular foreign-exchange purchases in a move it said aimed to “reduce the volatility of financial markets”. The rouble trimmed its losses after the announcement to trade 1.7 per cent lower, down more than 10 per cent since October. The yield on Russia’s 10-year local currency government debt climbed to 9.75 per cent, up from 7.5 per cent three months ago and the highest since early 2016.The latest sell-off came as the UK ordered some of its embassy staff to leave Ukraine, after the US ordered family members of its embassy staff to leave Kyiv because of the risk that Russia would take “significant military action”. Nato has also said its members are putting military forces on standby and “sending additional ships and fighter jets” to allied countries in eastern Europe.Russian assets have come under increasing pressure during weeks of mounting tension on Ukraine’s eastern border, where Russia has amassed about 100,000 troops while making sweeping security demands of the US and Nato. The growing threat of conflict has jolted western investors who loaded up on Russian assets last year, drawn by the country’s high interest rates and conservative management of its economy compared with many other emerging markets.Russian bonds and its currency are now extremely cheap, but investors are preparing for the possibility that tighter western sanctions — such as a prohibition on trading Russian bonds in the secondary market — could leave them stuck holding rouble assets, according to Szabo. The US and EU have threatened stronger curbs in response to any attack, which could include moves to cut off Russian banks from the global financial system and restrictions on the oil and gas exports that provide half of the Kremlin’s budget revenue.“It has by far the best economic policy to be found in emerging markets,” he said. “But if things go pear-shaped it would be a very difficult conversation to have with clients if you’re trapped onshore.”Russian debt comprises more than 7 per cent of a widely followed JPMorgan index of emerging market local currency bonds, meaning many big investors are in effect forced to hold the bonds or risk underperforming their benchmark. That would leave a lot of potential forced sellers of Russia bonds in the event that new sanctions resulted in their ejection from indices.
142  Eurozone businesses reported a weaker than expected start to the year with activity growing at its slowest rate for 11 months despite an easing of the supply bottlenecks holding back manufacturers, according to a closely watched survey.The IHS Markit flash eurozone composite purchasing managers’ index, a monthly poll that takes the pulse of business activity, slowed slightly more than most economists expected to 52.4, down from 53.3 in the previous month.A PMI score above 50 indicates that a majority of businesses are reporting higher activity levels than a month ago. But the survey results suggest the eurozone could emerge in worse shape than expected from the latest surge in infections with the Omicron coronavirus variant.“While the Omicron wave has dented prospects in the service sector, the impact so far looks less severe than prior waves,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. “Meanwhile, perceived prospects have improved among manufacturers, linked to fewer supply shortages, adding to the brightening outlook.”Businesses also reported that average prices charged for goods and services had risen at the fastest rate since the survey started in 2002, indicating that inflation was likely to remain high at the start of this year after hitting a eurozone record of 5 per cent in December.While infection rates across the 19 countries that share the euro have risen to their highest levels since the pandemic began, cinema ticket sales, hotel bookings, job postings and mobility data have fallen far less than in previous surges caused by the coronavirus.Yet services businesses in the bloc said tightened coronavirus restrictions had weighed on demand — particularly in consumer-facing and hospitality sectors — while staff absences due to Covid-19 also inhibited activity. The services PMI reading fell to a nine-month low of 51.2.Euro area manufacturers reported an easing of the supply chain problems that have caused record order backlogs in factories, congestion at ports and shortages of materials, helping to lift the sector’s PMI score to 59, a five-month high.“Average supplier delivery delays lengthened to the least extent since January of last year, with fewer items reported in short supply and shipping delays showing signs of easing,” IHS Markit said.German businesses — particularly in its sprawling manufacturing sector — reported a “surprisingly resilient performance” with the country’s PMI reading rising to 54.3, its highest level since September.The survey cast doubt over predictions Germany could slide into a recession — defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth — this winter. But Michael Holstein, chief economist at Germany’s DZ Bank, said: “We continue to assume that the first quarter will be difficult for the German economy and we do not anticipate a thorough revival until spring.”In France, where the government plans to loosen coronavirus restrictions that were tightened last month, business activity slowed to its lowest growth rate for nine months. The country’s PMI score fell to 52.7 from 55.8, hit by weaker growth in both services and manufacturing.“With the number of new Covid-19 cases having peaked in some countries and some governments having already outlined plans to ease restrictions, eurozone economic activity should pick up a bit in February and March,” said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics.He said eurozone growth “probably came close to a standstill” in the fourth quarter and forecast it would rebound with growth of 0.5 per cent in the first three months of 2022.
143  The UK and US have ordered partial withdrawals from their embassies in Ukraine, warning of a rising threat of Russian military action against the country.Britain on Monday ordered a number of its embassy staff and family members to leave Ukraine. The move came after the US ordered family members of its embassy staff to leave Kyiv because of the risk of “significant military action” by Russia.The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said the security situation in parts of Ukraine was “highly unstable” with clashes between Ukrainian armed forces and Russian-backed armed separatists. About half the embassy staff in Kyiv had been told to return to London with their families, it said.The US state department said on Sunday all US citizens should consider departing immediately because “security conditions, particularly along Ukraine’s borders, in Russia-occupied Crimea, and in Russia-controlled eastern Ukraine, are unpredictable and can deteriorate with little notice”.The warnings come after weeks of mounting tension along the eastern border of Ukraine, where Russia has massed more than 100,000 troops.Senior state department officials said the travel order was not triggered by new security threats, but by the fact that “military action by Russia could come at any time”. They said the US government “would not be in a position to evacuate US citizens in such a contingency”. The US and UK said their embassies would remain open.Ukraine’s foreign ministry called the US embassy withdrawals “premature”.Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesman for the ministry, said: “While we respect [the] right of foreign nations to ensure safety and security of their diplomatic missions, we believe such a step to be a premature one and an instance of excessive caution.”EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Monday that the bloc did not plan to follow the US and pull its diplomatic staff out of Ukraine.“We are not going to do the same thing because we don’t know any specific reasons,” he said ahead of a meeting with EU foreign ministers which was scheduled to include a video call with Antony Blinken, US secretary of state.“Maybe Secretary Blinken has more information he will share,” Borrell said.German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock also said that for the moment, Berlin was not withdrawing its diplomatic staff from Ukraine. “We are constantly evaluating the security situation, including in a meeting today. The security of our staff has utmost priority. But for now we are in a situation where we continue to work with companies on the ground and focus on the economic support of Ukraine. This shouldn’t lead to uncertainty regarding investments in Ukraine,” she said.Russia has warned of “the most unpredictable and grave consequences for European security” if the US does not concede to its demands to roll back Nato’s expansion.The US has sought common ground with Moscow on issues such as arms control. It has promised to send a written response to Russia’s draft security proposals this week after talks with Moscow in Geneva and Brussels failed to reach a breakthrough.But it has warned that Russia’s core grievances against the transatlantic military alliance — which would in essence rewrite the entire post-cold war security order if met — were unacceptable.Blinken on Sunday told the broadcaster CBS that the US remained committed to diplomacy with Russia but was building up “defence and deterrence”.“We are preparing massive consequences for Russia if it invades Ukraine again,” he told the NBC network.US officials reiterated that Washington was developing plans to reinforce Nato members on Europe’s eastern flank. The New York Times reported that Pentagon officials had presented one option to Biden that involved initially sending up to 5,000 US troops to eastern Europe, as well as warships and aircraft. The White House and Pentagon declined to comment on the specific details.US and European allies have vowed sanctions against Russia for aggression against Ukraine and sought to expose its plans by releasing selected intelligence, but have struggled to agree on how to respond.Blinken said the US had been “concerned” for weeks about Russian tactics in the country that included an effort by President Vladimir Putin to replace Kyiv’s government.Moscow’s efforts to destabilise Ukraine were “part of the Russian playbook”, he said, after the UK issued a stark warning of an alleged plot to install a puppet government in Kyiv.The UK’s FCDO said in an unusual statement on Saturday it had evidence Russia was planning to install a pro-Moscow leader in Ukraine.It named the figure preferred by the Kremlin as Yevhen Murayev, a former Ukrainian MP who owns a big television station, but did not provide evidence. Murayev denied the claim.Russia’s foreign ministry dismissed the accusations as “nonsense” and accused the UK of escalating tensions.Tensions among western allies spilled out into the open again at the weekend as the head of Germany’s navy resigned after saying Putin “only wants respect” and that Crimea — which was annexed by Russia in 2014 — would never be returned to Ukraine.Blinken insisted that the “Germans very much share our concerns” about Russian aggression and were part of a united front between Europe and the US.
144  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.Long-delayed due diligence obligations for companies ignoring environmental harm or human rights abuses in their supply chains are inching towards the starting line. We’ll unpack the main elements of the draft proposals ahead of their publication by the European Commission in mid-February.In Rome, a conclave of lawmakers and regional representatives is starting the papal-like process of electing Italy’s new president, with Mario Draghi touted as favourite. We’ll explore the stakes — and the risk that financial markets become jittery if the new government starts flip-flopping on reforms.With EU foreign ministers gathering in Brussels today to discuss Russia sanctions in case of an attack on Ukraine — joined virtually by their US counterpart — we’ll also look at what Sweden and Finland’s separate meeting with the Nato secretary-general is signalling. (Here is the FT’s take on why divisions within the west this time have been laid bare more than usual.)One of the more vexed and contested proposals in the commission’s legislative portfolio is getting closer to its debut, write Sam Fleming, Mehreen Khan and Andy Bounds in Brussels.  Proposals for rules on sustainable corporate governance, which were knocked back twice last year by the commission’s internal regulatory scrutiny board, are tentatively scheduled for release in the middle of February.The commission has yet to finalise the provisions, but under the current draft large companies could find themselves taken to court if they fail to do enough to crack down on human rights or environmental abuses in their supply chains, according to people familiar with the discussions.The rules would apply to companies with more than 500 employees and €150m of annual revenues. There may be an additional category for “high-risk” sectors such as mining, which apply to 250-500 employees. Smaller companies would be exempt.The mooted regime, which is being spearheaded by Didier Reynders, the justice commissioner, has had a fraught genesis. Earlier ideas, including the possibility of forcing companies to withdraw certain non-compliant products from the single market, have not made it into the latest draft — although there is plenty of scope for things to change.Reynders told the FT this month that the commission will come forward with an “ambitious proposal on due diligence, concerning environmental issues and human rights issues” — with the goal of landing the proposals in the first quarter of the year.“We will start with large companies — we don’t want to put too many burdens on SMEs,” he said.Members of the European parliament have been pushing hard for tighter rules, in part because of concerns over the use of forced labour in China’s Xinjiang region. Member states including Germany and the Netherlands have been moving forward with their own regimes.The legislation would allow companies to be taken to court by injured parties if they fail to meet the required due diligence standards, while also permitting EU member states to introduce financial penalties. Companies would need to show they have properly examined risks in their supply chains.The commission declined to comment on the details of the proposals, which are also being overseen by Vera Jourova, commission vice-president.Heidi Hautala, a Finnish Green MEP, said that without access to justice for victims of abuses covered by the directive the instrument would have almost no meaning. “It is something real, if the companies have to do everything in their power to identify the salient risks in the supply chain and work on those risks,” she said.Business groups, while backing an EU-wide framework, have expressed concerns about the proposals. “The new rules should not task European companies with solving problems out of their scope, mixing up the roles of companies and governments,” said BusinessEurope, which represents the bloc’s large employers.Mario Draghi’s leadership and the political support for his plan to reboot the economy helped assuage longstanding concerns in financial markets about the sustainability of Italy’s debts, which now exceed 150 per cent of GDP.Italy’s political cauldron starts frothing in earnest today as MPs, senators and regional representatives begin voting on who will succeed Sergio Mattarella as president of the republic, writes Sam Fleming.The central question is whether the vote propels Mario Draghi into the Quirinale palace from his current role of prime minister, which he assumed last February, and, if so, who will replace him.The political ferment is being watched extremely closely in Brussels. Draghi, the former European Central Bank president, enjoys enviable credibility in the European Commission thanks most recently to his deft handling of Italy’s bid for €191bn in grants and loans under the NextGenerationEU recovery programme.The risk is that his successor will start to struggle to deliver on all the reforms and investments needed to meet agreed milestones in the Italian recovery plan, jeopardising the flow of cash that is heading Italy’s way.While the NextGenerationEU scheme runs until 2026, the Italian recovery plan was built to front-load reforms and disbursements, in part on the expectation that Draghi would serve in the Chigi palace until 2023.The consequences of failing to deliver on agreed reforms are serious: payments could be withheld or even forfeited. Given the political uproar that would follow such a situation, both sides are incentivised to keep the cash flowing.The bigger risk, some officials fear, may be less that Italy falls foul of the commission, but rather that it gets back into trouble with the financial markets. Its structural reform programme includes a range of nettlesome topics including civil justice, public administration, tax and procurement. If Italy falls short, market faith in the country’s growth outlook could start to wane.A new government would also face mounting pressure to hand out tax cuts and extra spending with general elections looming by summer 2023. All this would endanger Rome’s plans for reining in public borrowing — a topic that is going to take on even greater urgency given EU plans to reimpose the EU’s suspended Stability and Growth Pact in 2023, as well as the European Central Bank’s ambitions to gradually dial back sovereign debt purchases.The commission raised a warning flag in November, pronouncing that Rome had not sufficiently limited the growth of its current expenditure in its 2022 budget given its debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 150 per cent.The foreign ministers of Sweden and Finland meet Nato’s secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg in Brussels today, only the latest in a series of diplomatic flirtations between the military alliance and its two most notable northern European non-members, writes Richard Milne, Nordic and Baltic Correspondent.The governments in both Stockholm and Helsinki as well as everyone from US president Joe Biden down on the Nato side have repeatedly stressed in the past few weeks that Finland and Sweden, and they alone, have the right to seek membership of the military alliance. That came after Russia’s foreign ministry broke the Christmas spirit by warning on December 24 that if either country joined Nato there would be “serious military and political consequences”.Both Finland and Sweden are well known for their long periods of neutrality but that stance has changed in recent years, first by signing up to the EU with its weak mutual defence clause, and then in recent years by becoming perhaps the most significant and closest partners with Nato.A decade ago, it was notable that then Nato secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen pointedly warned Sweden that only full membership of the alliance would confer full benefits. Now, US and Nato officials are full of praise for the two countries and hint that any application would both be warmly welcomed and potentially rapidly approved.It is against this backdrop that Sweden’s Ann Linde and Finland’s Pekka Haavisto meet Stoltenberg today. Neither Linde nor Haavisto are currently in favour of Nato membership, and there is far from political unity in either country. But there is a sense that a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine could further change the situation. (Watch this space — and the FT — for more in the coming days.).and later this week
145  Google is facing a fresh complaint from Germany’s largest publishers and advertisers, which are demanding that the EU intervene over the search giant’s plan to stop the use of third-party cookies.Axel Springer, the publisher of titles such as Bild and Politico, is among the hundreds of publishers, advertisers and media groups that have argued to the bloc’s competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, that Google is breaking EU law with its move to phase out third-party cookies from its Chrome browser by next year.The decision blocks advertisers, publishers and intermediaries from analysing users’ preferences while they browse online content — a critical blow to how the industry generates revenues.Axel Springer has been joined by other industry bodies, such as Germany’s federal association of digital publishers, in a 108-page complaint seen by the Financial Times and sent on Monday.They argue that Google’s planned changes will damage their businesses while allowing the Silicon Valley group to collect vast amounts of user data in ways that leave its own ads-based search business unaffected.The complaint is the latest effort to try to force Brussels to open a formal probe that can lead to fines worth up to 10 per cent of global revenues. The tech giant has already received more than €8bn in fines across three separate antitrust cases over the past decade.“Publishers must remain in a position where they are allowed to ask their users for consent to process data, without Google capturing this decision. Google must respect the relationship between publishers and users without interfering,” said the document, which was also sent to the EU’s powerful competition unit.Google’s decision on cookies had been delayed by nearly two years after the Silicon Valley company said it was in talks with rivals and regulators over the change as it sought to avoid “jeopardising” the business of web publishers. A report by the UK’s competition watchdog found that online publishers risked suffering potentially huge revenue losses of up to 70 per cent.EU officials are already worried that Google may be abusing its dominant position to benefit its own advertising services to the detriment of competitors. In the US, regulators have also accused the tech giant of colluding with Facebook to shut down rival ad exchanges.Seeking to avoid further scrutiny, Google has launched a massive lobbying campaign in Brussels against efforts to curb its market power. It has engaged in last-minute attempts to try to influence the EU’s incoming rules on Big Tech with a series of targeted social media posts, emails and advertising campaigns to EU lawmakers.Regulators in Brussels have already opened an informal inquiry into the search giant’s position in the online market, where it acts as the dominant middleman between advertisers and publishers. This is part of a wider investigation into the way Google collects data that started in 2019.The company is also launching an appeal at the EU’s top court against an earlier ruling to uphold a €2.42bn fine for promoting its own shopping comparison service above rivals.Google said: “Many other platforms and browsers have already stopped supporting third-party cookies but Google is the only one to do this openly and in consultation with technical standards bodies, regulators, and the industry, while also proposing new, alternative technologies.”Letter in response to this article:EU lawmakers must resist Big Tech’s blandishments / From Ursula Pachl, Deputy Director General, European Consumer Organisation (BEUC), Brussels, Belgium
146  A daily bombardment of briefings, intelligence, threats and allegations from the White House, Nato, the EU and European capitals has marked a novel approach to avoiding war. The disclosure of information normally reserved for hidden negotiations is highly unusual in modern-day diplomacy.While the strategy has shifted the initial calculus for Russia and negated Moscow’s ability to surprise, it has come at the cost of broadcasting to a global audience the west’s divisions on how to handle Russia.“Aggressors usually like to have a pretext for war, and the Americans going public have made that more difficult,” said Radoslaw Sikorski, who was Polish foreign minister during Russia’s war with Georgia in 2008 and invasion of Crimea in 2014. “[But] it has made it more difficult for us too because it exposed for all to see how disjointed the west is.exposing an impression of western disarray, which goes back years,” added Sikorski, who is now a member of the European parliament.The US initially deployed public diplomacy to convince some wavering European countries that Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, was considering an attack on his south-western neighbour. Europe then adopted the same strategy, leaving no doubt in Moscow of the costs of military action: from painful sanctions on its economy to a better-armed Ukrainian army lying in wait, equipped with western defensive weapons that arrived with fanfare and press releases.“In the beginning of this crisis, the US and the west more generally was losing the information war,” said Michael McFaul, former US ambassador to Moscow. He said the decision to declassify intelligence, highlight Russian proxy actions inside Ukraine and maintain a public dialogue with European partners was “to win back the narrative and reunify the west”.“Of course, it all may not stop Putin from invading again, but with weak cards in their hands, Biden and his diplomatic team are playing them effectively,” he added.At times, the constant publicity has appeared clumsy. The US insistence that a Russian attack is coming has bemused many in Kyiv, with officials insisting they see no major cause for alarm. Espionage findings that might have otherwise been quietly acted upon have been rushed out for public consumption: Britain’s warning this weekend that a coup was being planned in Kyiv — without publishing any evidence — has been met with widespread confusion.And such a public approach has come at the cost of both laying bare differences in opinion between western allies that otherwise could have been masked by private dialogue, and shrinking the space for back-channel negotiations that could offer a breakthrough.“Staying quiet might be perceived as acceptance in Moscow, so there is a need to keep reminding Russia that there is a united front and there will be a sharp response,” said Andrew Lohsen, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank. “The problem is that the longer this goes on, the more of a chance there is for fumbles and mistakes.”Last week brought prominent fumbles. First, French president Emmanuel Macron blindsided European and US allies with a call on Wednesday for a new, European-led negotiation track with Moscow, forcing his administration to clarify that it would complement, not compete, with the continuing peace talks led by the US. Hours later, Biden admitted to the disagreements between western countries over how to respond to Russia, telling a primetime press conference that if Putin decides on a “minor incursion.then we end up having a fight about what to do and not do, et cetera”. Then on Saturday the head of the German Navy on a visit to India told a televised meeting that the west should accept Crimea as Russian and “give Putin respect”. Vice admiral Kay-Achim Schönbach resigned the next day.“Everyone has a different theory.I think [Putin] is trying to make a mess and put Europe on the back foot to see if there is some falling out among Europeans,” said a senior EU defence official. “[The EU] is very united. But the longer it lasts, the greater the possibility of splits.”Some analysts have also questioned whether conducting high-stakes dialogue in press conferences and speeches has impeded efforts to find a negotiated solution. Publicised meetings this month between Russia and the US, Nato and Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe members descended into opportunities for both sides to restate their stringent — and incompatible — talking points. “It will not be helpful for any real effort to find a solution, or to make progress, if I went into all the details [of possible areas for compromise] in an interview with the Financial Times,” Jens Stoltenberg, Nato secretary-general, told the FT before those meetings. “Serious diplomatic efforts require that we don’t conduct them publicly.”And shining a light on the crisis may also have another unintended consequence of forcing Putin to take action to avoid appearing to have backed down under US pressure.“This is fantastic for the Russians. They are back on the centre stage, in the spotlight,” said a senior EU security official. “But it all depends on how Putin can sell it at home.”The number of Russian troops deployed close to the border is still increasing, despite Russian government officials insisting that there is no plan to attack. And after a meeting between the US and Russia in Geneva on Friday achieved the minor breakthrough of agreeing to stay in touch, the talking continues too.“It’s a very tense, very fluid situation that changes every day, every hour, so we shouldn’t pay attention to specific moments, specific declarations. the philosophy is consistent, the goals are consistent,” said José Manuel Albares, Spain’s foreign minister.“We need more co-ordination, it is not negative or positive,” he added. “It’s a simple need to adapt a dialogue that goes back to 1945 to the realities of 2022.”
147  Estonia’s prime minister called for a greater US presence in the Baltics to deter Russia as she made a plea for the west to remain united and not give even the smallest concession to Moscow.Kaja Kallas told the Financial Times that Nato should strengthen its eastern flank in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania irrespective of whether Russia invades Ukraine, something many western experts increasingly fear after Moscow stationed more than 100,000 troops on the border.She added that Estonia would like to see “the big allies present in our region”, an indirect call for US troops to be based in the Baltics as it is the only large Nato country without a presence in the region.“The biggest deterrence there is that you have big friends. If you are bullied at school, the bully doesn’t bully you if you have strong and big friends, and it’s the same with deterrence.The biggest deterrence to Russia is an American flag,” she added.Tensions in the Baltics and elsewhere have increased over Russia’s intentions in Ukraine and Belarus as well as Moscow’s demand that Nato return to its 1997 borders, before Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania joined the military alliance.Kallas called Russia’s request “clearly outrageous”, and part of a pattern of negotiations in line with the doctrine of longtime Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko — demand the maximum, give ultimatums and not give an inch.“Russia has created a problem, and has now threatened to solve this through outrageous demands. The big question is: what is the western response? The west, Nato, the European Union have been very united. It has come as a bad surprise to the Russians. We have to keep this line together,” she added.Kallas said that some compromises with Russia could sound like “small things” such as limiting military exercises or arms control, but that Nato should resist.“What should the west and Nato offer Russia to de-escalate? This question is already a trap. Nato has not created this situation. The only one who can de-escalate is Russia,” she said.She insisted that she saw no “cracks in the unity”, despite recent concerns over French president Emmanuel Macron’s call for European dialogue with Russia. “We might have different ideas on tactics,” said Kallas, but Macron was “a true European” and in general Europe was “united” towards Moscow.Nato has reinforced its eastern flank since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, stepping up its Baltic air-policing mission and placing multinational battle groups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.The current deployment in Estonia is led by British forces with Danish and French troops also present; Canada leads the battalion in Latvia, Germany in Lithuania, and the US in Poland.“We would like to see this anyway, the strengthening of the eastern flank of Nato. Not just if they invade Ukraine. We have been pushing this for a long time,” Kallas said.Estonia, one of the few Nato countries to meet the alliance’s 2 per cent defence spending target, last week announced a large increase in military expenditure, boosting it by €380m up until 2025. It also said it would send anti-tank missiles to help Ukraine defend itself from potential Russian aggression.Kallas said Estonia would bring forward procurement plans already made, lifting spending to about 2.4 per cent of gross domestic product. She urged other European countries to lift their defence spending too, a long-held demand of US presidents, especially Donald Trump.“The important part of it is that we do our share, and we also expect our allies to do their shares.For the bigger allies, it’s always a question that we’re not depending on you, we are doing our share. Other European countries should also increase to 2 per cent,” Kallas added.
148  In the days before Christmas, Italian prime minister Mario Draghi was peppered with journalists’ questions about the biggest issue looming over Italy’s future. Was Draghi ready to move on from the job he took on 11 months ago and assume the presidency when incumbent Sergio Mattarella’s term ends on February 3?Traditionally, protocol dictates prospective Italian presidents firmly rebuff any suggestion of interest in a job whose selection process is akin to a Papal conclave — no formal candidates, multiple secret ballots and intense backroom negotiations. Yet Draghi gave a response which, for Italy’s political class, was clearly a coded offer of availability. “I don’t have any particular aspirations of one type or another,” the former European Central Bank president said. “I am a man, a grandfather, at the service of the institutions.”Draghi abruptly presented Italy’s politicians with a dilemma: whether to retain their country’s most celebrated technocrat as prime minister, allowing him to forge ahead with an ambitious EU-funded reform programme, or to elevate him to head of state, potentially triggering a paralysing crisis over a successor to head the government.MPs, senators and regional representatives will begin voting on Monday on whether to appoint Draghi or someone else to succeed Mattarella, raising the prospect that the government could be weakened or even collapse. The uncertainty has renewed anxieties about Italy’s ability to implement difficult but long overdue reforms to improve its growth prospects.Draghi has galvanised cross-party support for the EU recovery plan, steered a first batch of reforms through parliament and started to cut through Italy’s bureaucratic thicket. Reform momentum and fiscal discipline could falter without his hands-on leadership, putting the entire programme at risk.It is not just Italy’s once in a generation opportunity for an economic reboot that is at stake. The country to a large degree will determine the success of the EU’s €750bn recovery fund, of which Italy is the largest beneficiary — it is due to receive €191bn in grants and loans.The EU’s experiment, backed for the first time with common EU debt, was devised with Italy very much in mind — a chance to make good on previous EU-mandated austerity and perceived lack of solidarity with Rome, which led to the election of the most Eurosceptic parliament in modern times in 2018.“The success of the European project is — to some extent — at stake,” says Ludovico Sapio, European economist at Barclays, the investment bank. “A political impasse or any scenario that disrupts policy continuity and weakens the reform process has negative implications not only for Italy and the sustainability of Italian debt, but also for Europe as a whole. It could be dangerous for the prospects of further European integration.”Draghi, 74, was parachuted from retirement into the prime minister’s office last February amid a deep health, economic and political crisis triggered by the Covid pandemic, which exacerbated already serious longstanding challenges. Italy’s gross domestic product contracted by almost 9 per cent in 2020, as it reeled from the shock of the pandemic.Since his installation, Draghi has revived flagging business and market confidence with the orchestration of a successful Covid vaccination drive and strict controls, and a generous fiscal stimulus to accelerate the economic recovery. Most significantly, Draghi committed Italy to an ambitious timeline to complete difficult structural reforms to boost its longer-term growth trajectory after decades of stagnation and underperformance.That no-nonsense leadership and the broad-based political support for the plan to reboot the economy helped assuage longstanding concerns in financial markets and Brussels about the sustainability of Italy’s heavy debts, which now exceed 150 per cent of GDP.But a messy, divisive presidential election process that triggers a political crisis or derails progress on reforms would seriously worry Brussels — and the financial markets.“Italy can be seen as a potentially ticking time bomb because of its debt,” says Luigi Scazzieri, a senior fellow at the Centre for European Reform think-tank. “If questions were to re-emerge about the sustainability of that debt, the euro’s foundation would once again be questioned.Draghi’s international reputation, record of public service and commitment to Italy’s role in the EU make him an obvious candidate for a seven-year term as a head of state — a role that is not merely ceremonial but carries real powers, especially at times of crisis and deep domestic political divisions.From the Quirinale — the lavish presidential palace that was once the home of Popes and Italian kings — Draghi could use his power to oversee the government and his moral authority to ensure that future administrations keep reforms on track and to check populist policy impulses.“Only if Draghi becomes president can what we’ve seen over the past year — in terms of getting things done — continue,” says historian and prominent political commentator Paolo Mieli, former editor-in-chief of Italy’s leading daily newspaper Corriere della Sera.“As president, he can surveil the government to make sure reforms are carried out.and after the next general election he can act as the guarantor of Italy’s commitments to Brussels.”But Draghi’s elevation to the presidency carries real risks that his national unity government — which has brought together both right and left parties — could collapse over the question of a successor premier to run the government and carry reforms forward until the next general elections, scheduled for 2023.That, in turn, threatens to propel Italy into early elections, undermining Rome’s prospects of meeting the scheduled reform targets on whose fulfilment the continuing flow of EU recovery funds depends.“The real risk of the current situation — and also in relation to the recovery plan — lies in the extremely complex dynamics of events,” says Nathalie Tocci, director of the Italian Institute of International Affairs. “The issue is not ‘Draghi as the only potential guarantor of reforms’, but what happens when an equilibrium is broken and the domino effect is triggered in a totally unpredictable way.“It is not certain that an alternative equilibrium able to hold the parliament together will be found, even if at the moment this is what everyone wants,” she adds. “The current set-up works well, but removing a pawn could change the whole game.”In public, EU officials are sanguine about political developments in Rome. Paolo Gentiloni, the commissioner who oversees economic matters who is also a former Italian prime minister, said last month Brussels was watching developments “with confidence and respect”.However, Italian political turbulence has returned earlier than many in the EU had expected. While the EU’s recovery fund runs until 2026, the Italian plan was designed to front-load reforms and disbursements, in part on the expectation that Draghi would serve as premier until 2023.Draghi’s government has already begun overhauling Italy’s cumbersome justice system, updated audit and control procedures, started to streamline the public administration and passed the first of several competition reforms.Rome received a €24.9bn recovery plan funding tranche last August and is now seeking the next €21bn, after claiming to have met an initial 51 reform “milestones”.But tougher challenges lie ahead, with parliament required to pass new laws to fully implement the nascent changes and wrestle with difficult reforms on tax, public procurement and civil justice. In all, Rome will need to meet more than 100 milestones agreed with the EU to receive the next €40bn.“The situation is going to become messy,” says Daniele Albertazzi, an expert in Italian politics and right wing-populism at the University of Surrey.Lorenzo Codogno, a former director-general of the Italian Treasury, says: “It will be hugely tough. The first targets and milestones were effectively procedural legal and preparatory steps. The real meat starts in 2022.”Brussels is hoping that the momentum built up by the Draghi government — or the threat of EU payments being withheld if targets are missed — will keep Italy on track. Some in EU circles and in Italy’s business community worry more about fiscal discipline, with a new prime minister unable to resist pressure from the parties for spending commitments and tax cuts as the election approaches.“I don’t think structural reforms have been secured yet.it's a long process, not something you can resolve in six months,” says Nino Tronchetti Provera, founder and managing partner of private equity firm Ambienta, which focuses on sustainable investments.“The only thing that is certain about [the recovery fund] is that it represents additional public debt on the shoulders of my daughters [and] virtuous public spending isn’t exactly the house’s speciality,” he adds.The commission has already fired a warning shot, when in November it said Italy had not sufficiently curbed growth in current spending in its 2022 budget, which envisions a fiscal deficit of 5.6 per cent, down from 9.4 per cent in 2021.Davide Vampa, a professor of politics at the UK’s Aston University, says Draghi is “the unifying figure of this coalition, so removing him creates a lot of problems in the short term”.“They might find someone to be prime minister after Draghi that has enough prestige and strength to continue the job, but I cannot see anyone,” Vampa says. As prime minister, Draghi created a national unity government, but his move to the presidency might destroy it. “Ironically, a stability figure like Draghi might become an element of instability.”Even if the technocrat were to remain in the prime ministerial chair, many warn his effectiveness will almost certainly wane over the next year, as political posturing increases and parties grow more fractious ahead of general elections.“Either he becomes president or he is gone,” says Mieli. “It’s like when you have a substitute teacher in a classroom and pupils misbehave, knowing the sub is just temporarily filling in. Things are destined to go to pieces.Parties would understand they would no longer have to deal with him after 2023, and the loyalty and respect we’ve seen so far would be lost.”Others believe Italy’s reform drive will almost inevitably lose momentum as general elections draw closer.“As 2023 approaches, parties will start to look at their constituencies and take distance from policymaking,” says Carlo Capuano, vice-president of global sovereign ratings at DBRS Morningstar.In Italy’s corporate circles, many are now ardently hoping for Draghi’s elevation to the presidency — to secure his future involvement in public life and reassure financial markets and EU partners about Italy’s longer-term direction — despite the risks of short-term turbulence.“Our best bet is to keep him around for another seven years, during which he would surely pull the strings of what goes on in government in terms of recovery fund investments and reforms,” says one top business figure.As president, Draghi would have the power to appoint prime ministers, veto cabinet appointments and send legislation back to parliament for reconsideration — powerful tools that could be used to nudge the reform process forward and keep future populist, Eurosceptic governments from going off the rails.“This country suffers from the increasingly lower credibility of its politicians,” Provera says. “In this context, the president has a very important role.he or she can stabilise the political scenario for years to come.”Simone Tagliapietra, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a think-tank in Brussels, says that as president, Draghi can “make sure the economic policy of the country remains good for several years”.For some Italian politicians, however, the prospect of a more interventionist presidency under Draghi is reason to vote against. Most lawmakers are also fretting about early elections, especially given a recent referendum that reduced the number of MPs and senators from 945 to 600, meaning many will lose their seats.In backroom negotiations, politicians are struggling to find a resolution. Neither Matteo Salvini, leader of the rightwing League, nor Enrico Letta of the centre-left Democratic party have publicly endorsed Draghi’s candidacy.“These days there is one meeting after another, nonstop phone calls and messages,” says a lawmaker from the Five Star Movement. “The tension is palpable. The feeling is that the situation has never been so fluid and unpredictable.”Media tycoon and four-time former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who was convicted of tax fraud in October 2012, had proffered himself as a potential president. But Berlusconi, a deeply polarising figure whose election would have undoubtedly destabilised the government, withdrew himself from consideration on Saturday evening, urging supporters to ‘abstain’ from putting his name forward.Analysts believe that some politicians from across the spectrum are trying to find a respected yet inoffensive alternative individual, who can be propelled into the presidency to maintain the status quo and keep Draghi at the helm of government.“The moment is extremely complex not just because of this election but also because of intense going negotiations on several topics including.whether we can find someone to replace Draghi who can be accepted by the whole political spectrum,” says Daniela Sbrollini, a senator and presidential elector from Viva Italia.Others have advocated the re-election of incumbent Mattarella, with the implicit assumption that he would stand down early, clearing the way for Draghi’s elevation later, though the president is thought to be against a second term on principle.However many warn that having expressed even cautious interest in the presidency, Draghi would be significantly diminished should the governing coalition he leads now refuse to elevate him to the pinnacle of the Italian state.“The worst case is that he does not make it and carries on as PM, and his magic fades away, and his God-like aura is gone,” says Francesco Galietti, founder and CEO of Policy Sonar, a Rome-based political risk consultancy. “That is the end of everything.”
149  Italy risks failing in its ambition to become a more “business friendly” economy unless it presses ahead with major structural reforms, one of the country’s top bankers has warned.Alberto Nagel, chief executive of investment bank Mediobanca, said it was imperative that competition, civil justice and public administration reforms were completed.The 56-year-old, who is credited with modernising a bank that for decades has been a powerbroker for Italy’s financial and business elites, also urged the government not to squander the €200bn EU-backed fund designed to help the eurozone’s third-largest economy recover from the pandemic.“A key priority for Italy is to spend the funds well, avoiding risks of increasing statism and favouring, on the contrary, an ecosystem that should become truly business-friendly,” Nagel told the Financial Times.“[The recovery fund] can be a game changer in terms of additional expected [economic] growth, which is particularly significant for a highly indebted country,” he added.The warning comes as Italian lawmakers prepare to vote in a presidential election this week, with divisions threatening prime minister Mario Draghi’s chances of succeeding outgoing president Sergio Mattarella.Nagel says that Draghi, who has been prime minister since early last year, is the best hope of achieving reforms.“Clearly, the best assurance for this to occur is for Mario Draghi to remain in a top institutional role for some years,” he said of the former European Central Bank chief who, if elected president, would have a seven-year mandate.Nagel’s prescription for Italy’s economy comes as Mediobanca is locked in a power struggle with billionaire entrepreneur Leonardo Del Vecchio, a large investor in both the bank and Generali, Italy’s largest insurer.Del Vecchio believes the Milan-based bank relies for too much of its profits on a 13 per cent stake it holds in Generali. It is a claim that Nagel, who has led Mediobanca since 2013, is quick to push back on.“As far as Mediobanca is concerned the Generali investment makes an appreciable contribution to our financial targets and has a return that is distinctly higher than our cost of equity,” he said.Del Vecchio and construction tycoon Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone, another Generali investor who recently quit its board, are pushing for a shake-up in strategy at the insurer and the departure of chief executive Philippe Donnet.Governance at Generali is also a point of contention between Mediobanca and Del Vecchio and Caltagirone. The pair claim the insurer’s outgoing board should not be allowed to recommend their successors to shareholders before the group’s annual meeting in April — a plan that Consob, Italy’s financial regulator, gave the green light to last week.The dispute is one of several to have flared up in recent months that have tested how Italian corporate governance handles the demands of both minority shareholders as well as those of the state.“Right now there are a number of important [decisions looming] that will be a test for the maturity of Italian capitalism” said Nagel. “Italy must catch up with governance practices favoured by international [markets] in order to make the country more attractive for investments.”Until just three years ago, a formal agreement existed among some of Mediobanca’s influential minority investors that effectively gave them control of the lender.Despite the ructions over Generali, Nagel says he is focused on the future of Mediobanca, which for much of its 76-year history sourced business from an array of family-owned Italian companies that held stakes in the bank, including tyre manufacturer Pirelli and construction group Italcementi.Over the past 10 years, Mediobanca has cut back its cross-shareholdings, generating roughly €5bn in proceeds. Institutional investors now make up more than 45 per cent of its shareholder base, with much of the remainder held by individuals. Del Vecchio recently became the bank’s single largest shareholder with a 19.4 per cent stake.Nagel has sought to diversify bank’s businesses by developing a wealth management division, which he says played an important role in driving revenues to a record high of €2.6bn last year and increasing fee income.Amid the change at Mediobanca over the past decade, Nagel shares a keenness for keeping the bank out of the spotlight long associated with its co-founder and driving force Enrico Cuccia.“We are confident that our sober approach is still the best choice in today’s world,” said Nagel.
150  The last time Ukrainians heard of Yevhen Murayev was when the pro-Russian former lawmaker unfurled a banner in central Kyiv last autumn with the inscription “This is our land!” Following a public outcry, it was taken down a few hours later — an indication of his dwindling political fortunes.Murayev seemed destined to remain in obscurity until Saturday, when the UK claimed he was in line to lead a pliant Ukrainian government as part of a Russian regime-change plot.Western powers say Russian president Vladimir Putin is considering a renewed invasion after massing more than 100,000 troops at the border. The US and UK have warned that Moscow might move to topple Putin’s Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, in a coup.“We’ve been concerned and have been warning about exactly these kinds of tactics for weeks,” US secretary of state Antony Blinken said on Sunday, referring to the UK allegations. “This is very much part of the Russian playbook.”But the UK allegations, for which London provided no evidence and which Russia has dismissed, struck many in Ukraine as far-fetched — including Murayev. He posted a picture of his face Photoshopped on to James Bond’s body and said the claims were “a question for Mr Bean”.“If Russia really has plans to destabilise the situation in Ukraine and bring to power a pro-Russian government, then this is a poorly thought-out plan which will not be supported by Ukrainian society. Russia never understood Ukraine and it does not want to understand,” said Oleksiy Haran, head of research at the Democratic Initiatives Foundation, a Kyiv think-tank. “Russia could have such plans, but they are absolutely absurd.”A native of the eastern city of Kharkiv, Murayev helped former prime minister Mykola Azarov escape across the border to Russia in 2014 after a revolution in Kyiv ousted the Moscow-aligned president Viktor Yanukovich.Murayev remained in Ukraine as an MP for the successor to Yanukovych’s party, then split from it in 2016 to set up two of his own. In 2018, Russia placed him under sanctions — a move he blamed on a falling out with Viktor Medvedchuk, a Putin confidant and the Kremlin’s longstanding main political ally in Ukraine.He was one of three pro-Russian candidates to run for president in 2019 but dropped out before the vote. Murayev’s party did not meet the 5 per cent threshold to win seats in parliament a few months later.“The only way there’s going to be a puppet government is if there’s an invasion [.] and I just can’t believe that Yevhen Murayev could be a candidate to lead it,” Vadim Novinsky, an oligarch and MP for a pro-Russian party, said. “It’s complete nonsense.”In recent months, Murayev, who owns a large Ukrainian TV station, began to mount plans for a comeback after Kyiv placed Medvedchuk under house arrest and shut three other channels close to him last year.Murayev hinted at a possible tectonic shift in Ukrainian politics in an interview on his channel at the start of January in which he said: “For some reason I think that we will have a reboot and there will be a new government” that would resolve the Donbas conflict by the end of the year.“There will be many changes, and they are inevitable,” he said. “Of course, there will be upheavals and they will be difficult [.] but after them there will be a bright future.”Oleksandr Danylyuk, former head of Ukraine’s National Security Council, said the move against Medvedchuk could have opened the way for his rival Murayev to take over as Russia’s favoured proxy.“Russia has always been looking for agents of influence in Ukraine,” Danylyuk said. “Murayev would be an obvious choice — he nicely fits into the pro-Russian niche, previously occupied by Medvedchuk, but also has a potential to expand beyond it because he is considered young and promising.”In a Facebook post on Sunday, Murayev rejected allegations that his party was sympathetic to Moscow. “The time of pro-western and pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine has gone for good,” he wrote.The UK accusations could put Murayev at risk of a similar punishment to that meted out to Medvedchuk.Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky’s chief of staff, did not say whether Ukraine would take action against Murayev but said: “This is useful for Ukrainian society, which must clearly know who is who.” He vowed: “All legal instruments that can be used to protect Ukraine’s sovereignty and the interests of Ukrainian society will be used by the Ukrainian authorities in co-operation with our partners.”The alleged plan to install Murayev was the second western warning of an impending Russian coup in Ukraine in a week.The US earlier said Russian intelligence had similar plans in concert with a different group of Ukrainian politicians close to Medvedchuk — only one of whom was also named by the UK.“A lot of the people who are named as members of this future government aren’t even on speaking terms with each other,” Novinsky said. “It’s a random group of names.”The discrepancies in the US and UK accounts suggested the Kremlin had an array of options to achieve its goals in Ukraine, said Mark Galeotti, a professor at University College London who studies Russia’s security services.“We can anticipate that there will be a whole gamut of different, often speculative ventures under way. And we shouldn’t assume that when we spot one, that’s the Kremlin’s plan,” Galeotti said.“The Kremlin creates these dynamic and often chaotic situations, which will throw up a whole variety of different options. And they will choose and they will shift.”The US and the UK are pursuing a dual strategy of trying to expose Russia’s plans publicly while pushing for a diplomatically negotiated solution that could ease tension.Blinken said the US would continue talks with Moscow after meeting Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov last week. Sergey Shoygu, Russia’s defence minister, has invited his UK counterpart, Ben Wallace, for talks in Moscow, while the foreign ministry said it was weighing a request from foreign secretary Liz Truss to meet Lavrov.The coup allegations could make future talks with Russia less likely, Galeotti said. “Western unity is definitely under pressure, and [the line] being pushed by the US and UK is not helping,” he said. “This is the kind of thing that is going to make those conversations harder.”
151  Media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi has abandoned his long-shot bid to become Italy’s next president, just as the country is poised to choose a head of state of its notoriously fractious political system for the next seven years.In a widely anticipated withdrawal statement, Berlusconi, 85, insisted he had enough support to win the election to Italy’s highest office.But the four-time former prime minister, who was convicted of tax fraud in October 2012, said he had decided to pull his name from consideration so lawmakers from across the political spectrum can choose a less divisive candidate.Berlusconi’s tenure in office was tarnished by sex scandals and alleged corruption, undermining his quixotic quest to promote himself as a unifying national father figure.“I have decided to take another step along the path of national responsibility,” Berlusconi wrote on Facebook.Though rightwing parties had pledged to support Berlusconi’s candidacy, left leaning parties called his potential ascent to the presidency unacceptable, warning it could trigger the collapse of Italy’s fragile national unity government led by Prime Minister Mario Draghi.Berlusconi “was a hard sell and he has obviously come to the conclusion that it cannot be done,” said Daniele Albertazzi, an expert in Italian politics and rightwing populism at the University of Surrey.It was later reported that Berlusconi, who had suffered Covid in 2020, had been admitted to hospital in Milan for routine medical tests.Former prime minister Giuseppe Conte, president of the populist 5 Star Movement, tweeted that Berlusconi’s withdrawal will allow serious cross party talks on a potential consensus candidate for the presidency.“We had made it clear: Silvio Berlusconi’s candidacy was unacceptable,” Conte tweeted. “With his retirement, we take a step forward and commence serious discussion between political forces to offer the country a high profile, authoritative consensus candidate.”Draghi, a former European Central Bank president, has been tipped as a potential presidential contender in a selection process that will formally begin on Monday, as more than 1,000 electors cast secret ballots for their preferred candidate.Many in Italy’s business community are eager to see Draghi elected president — which would give him powers to supervise Italy’s politicians and push for the continuation of a €200bn EU-funded economic and social reform program.But many politicians appear wary of elevating Draghi to the presidency.Some would prefer a less formidable individual. Others fret that Draghi’s ascent could trigger the collapse of the current fragile national unity government, as the diverse coalition probably could not agree on a successor prime minister.“He wouldn’t be there just to unveil monuments and make speeches — he would exert real influence,” Albertazzi said. “Many individuals in parliament worry that picking Draghi means having fresh elections in the spring and they absolutely want to avoid that.”Berlusconi said it was important that Draghi’s government remain in place to carry on with investments and economic reforms.Italy’s presidential elections are notoriously unpredictable, as more than 1,000 lawmakers and regional representatives try to converge on a single candidate. A candidate must secure the support of two-thirds of electors in the first three rounds of secret ballots, but the bar is subsequently lowered to a simple majority of 50 per cent, plus one.
152  Brussels is facing the threat of legal action and the potential sidelining of its landmark sustainable finance rules by EU governments that do not want nuclear power or natural gas to be labelled as green investments.Energy ministers from Austria and Luxembourg told the Financial Times that they would pursue a lawsuit against the European Commission over its so-called green “taxonomy” rules, while a Spanish deputy prime minister said Madrid could opt to use its own green framework, excluding nuclear power and natural gas.The complaints heap pressure on the European Commission, which has proposed that nuclear technology and some forms of natural gas be designated as sustainable investments under sweeping rules designed to help stamp out greenwashing in the finance industry.The anti-nuclear governments of Austria and Luxembourg have begun preparations for a lawsuit against the Commission if the rules are approved in their current form. They argue that nuclear power, which has no carbon footprint but produces toxic waste with radiation risks, violates the EU’s “do no significant harm” to the environment principle.“There’s a solid and a strong argument to go to the European Court of Justice if the Commission decides to proceed and the taxonomy comes into force,” Leonore Gewessler, Austria’s green energy minister, said. “We need to make sure that financial markets stay true to the alternatives of renewable energy.”Critics of the taxonomy are seeking legal routes to challenge the text as it is almost certain to be approved by an alliance of pro-gas and pro-nuclear EU governments in coming months. The draft can only be overturned if it is rejected by a supermajority of both member states and members of the European parliament.The taxonomy regulation categorises industries that generate about 80 per cent of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions, in an attempt to help investors channel capital into sustainable economic activity. The labelling system would then be applied to financial products and green bonds, and guide EU government spending towards the climate transition.But the exercise, which began three years ago, has become bogged down in the sensitive politics of energy sovereignty, as pro-gas countries in eastern Europe and pro-nuclear states like France have demanded that the rules should not penalise energy sources that provide the bulk of their electricity needs and are crucial in the transition to net zero emissions.Germany’s coalition government is split on the taxonomy between the anti-nuclear Greens and more pro-gas coalition partners, the Free Democrats. On Saturday, Germany’s green economy minister Robert Habeck and environment minister Steffi Lemke said if the draft remained unchanged, the German government should reject it.Teresa Ribera, Spain’s deputy prime minister for the environment, said that the categorisation of nuclear and gas was an “error” that did not prepare the EU for net zero carbon emissions by 2050. She warned that Madrid may choose to apply its own standard when issuing green bonds rather than using the EU taxonomy as the basis for its debt issuance.“If it is better suited to our own needs and priorities, we will apply our own standard,” said Ribera. “So there could be different standards: a silver standard at the EU level and a gold standard, at the level of some member states.”Claude Turmes, Luxembourg’s energy minister, who will join the lawsuit with Austria, also said that there was a risk that, rather than providing a common standard for sustainable finance, the taxonomy would “lead to more fracturing as countries will go their own way”. The legal uncertainty risks hindering the taxonomy’s widespread adoption among investors who want to align their portfolios with net zero emissions goals. The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, whose members have €50tn of assets under management, has warned that the inclusion of gas would create an “unnecessary headache” for investors with green ambitions.An independent group of advisers which helped the European Commission design the rules has also demanded sweeping changes, including that gas only qualify for the green label if it produces less than 100g of CO2 per kilowatt/hour when replacing higher polluting sources like coal.Marta Toporek, lawyer at environmental charity ClientEarth, said the current taxonomy “clashes with a number of EU laws, including the EU’s obligations under the Paris Agreement, the European Climate Law and the Taxonomy Regulation itself”.
153  Since the release of its December 2021 meeting minutes earlier in January, investors and analysts have been anticipating more hawkish action from the central bank. Those minutes showed officials weighing the prospects of raising interest rates “sooner or at a faster pace” than they had initially anticipated.Futures markets have since fully priced in a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, with a further three hikes priced in for 2022.“Following the hawkish shift at the Fed’s December meeting, we expect Chair [Jay} Powell to use the January press conference to consolidate expectations for a March rate hike,” wrote Luigi Speranza, chief global economist at BNP Paribas. At its December meeting, the Fed decided to accelerate the rate at which it was tapering its purchases of US government bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Winding down that programme faster gives the Fed more time to raise interest rates: the accelerated schedule now puts the taper on track to end in mid-March. Some analysts, like Andy Brenner, head of international fixed income at NatAlliance Securities, suggested the Fed could speed up its tapering cycle further next week to give itself more flexibility around a March hike. Brenner also said the Fed was likely to begin discussing a reduction in the size of its $9tn balance sheet, another topic raised in December. Kate DuguidUS earnings season is now well under way and some of the largest companies’ results so far have proved lacklustre.Record full-year earnings for Wall Street bank JPMorgan were tempered by a warning that higher costs would bite into profits. Days later, Goldman Sachs pointed to a large jump in fourth-quarter expenses.Meanwhile, projections of substantially slower growth in subscriber numbers sent Netflix’s shares tumbling — a decline which seeped into equity markets more broadly, as concerns about earnings applied fresh pressure to speculative tech stocks that had already sold off dramatically in a volatile start to the year.The challenges conveyed by those big companies have brought the coming week’s crop of results into sharper focus. Financial powerhouses Blackstone, Mastercard and American Express are up next on the earnings roster, as are “Big Tech” behemoths Microsoft, Apple and Elon Musk’s carmaker Tesla — reporting on Tuesday, Thursday and Wednesday respectively.Microsoft is expected to deliver earnings per share of $2.30 for the December quarter, up from $2.03 in the same period in 2020, on sales of $50.6bn, according to FactSet data. Apple’s quarterly EPS are projected to land at $1.89, up from $1.68 on sales of $119bn.Overall, constituents of the S&P 500 blue-chip share gauge are forecast to post year-on-year earnings growth of about 23 per cent for the fourth quarter. But just over a tenth of the index’s companies had reported by the end of last week, leaving room for downward revisions.Analysts are likely to focus on how companies are managing cost pressures against a backdrop of persistently high levels of global inflation. They will also question how far the imminent prospect of interest rate rises — implemented to contain soaring price growth — will help or hinder performance.JPMorgan’s chief financial officer said on an earnings call that the bank should benefit from rising borrowing costs and greater loan demand. But higher rates also erode the present value of future cash flows for highly-valued technology companies, potentially rendering them less attractive as investments. Harriet ClarfeltThe Omicron coronavirus variant is expected to have weighed on European economic activity in January, closely watched indicators of business sentiment due to be published on Monday are forecast to show.Economists polled by Reuters expect IHS Markit’s eurozone composite purchasing managers’ index, which tracks private manufacturing and services activity, to have weakened to a one-year low of 52.6 — dragged down by the hard-hit German services sector. Activity in France is expected to show more resilience, with PMI readings well above those in the eurozone’s largest economy.“With Omicron hitting some eurozone countries, notably Germany, in full only this month, the likelihood of a further drop in the index seems high,” said Sandra Horsfield, economist at Investec. However, she acknowledged that restrictions on activity have generally not been tightened as much as earlier in the pandemic, pointing to a more moderate pace of cooling than in previous waves.In the UK, the composite PMI index is expected to have risen to 55 from a 10-month low of 53.6 in December, reflecting an earlier spread of the latest wave. “We expect the January report to show an easing in Omicron fears as daily infection rates slowed and stricter social restrictions became less likely,” said Horsfield.The headline figures for both the eurozone and the UK are expected to be above the 50 mark, which indicates a majority of businesses reporting an expansion, with stronger readings for manufacturing than for services. While factories’ output across Europe is forecast to remain limited by shortages of components, “there are tentative signs that the supply constraints that held back output last year are beginning to ease”, said Horsfield.

154  Emmanuel Macron’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic has put him in a strong position to win a second term as France’s president — but supporters worry that he will lose his lead as infections with the Omicron variant reach a peak and the public grow weary of the two-year-old crisis. “We are at the tipping point where people are now sick of restrictions. Things could go badly for him,” said one French industrialist who supported Macron in 2017 and wants him to win again in the April election. “They think the situation no longer merits the restrictions.”With Macron preparing to officially declare himself a candidate for re-election, his government is struggling to limit the intense pressure on hospitals from Covid-19 patients, while meeting popular demands to ease the restrictions imposed to control the virus’s spread. Jean Castex, prime minister, on Thursday announced that some Covid-19 rules would be relaxed next month, even though new confirmed infections are running at more than 400,000 a day, according to health ministry data. Until recently, voters broadly backed Macron’s handling of the pandemic. The coronavirus emergency in early 2020 shunted aside the anti-government “gilets jaunes” protests that had shaken his presidency. After early missteps on the availability of masks and tests, Macron was praised for a financial aid programme for workers and businesses and the decision to keep schools open after the first wave.His bet last summer to push vaccination via a “health pass”, with proof of immunisation or a recent negative Covid-19 test required to access public venues, also paid off. It encouraged millions more to accept the jab, saving 4,000 lives and €6bn in economic activity, according to a study by researchers at Bruegel and the French Council of Economic Analysis. The government has since converted the permit into a “vaccine pass”, with a negative test no longer accepted, and following Macron’s declaration this month that he wanted to “piss off the unvaccinated”, a further 1m people have taken their first jabs. That deliberately provocative comment, however, prompted critics to revive accusations that Macron is arrogant and dismissive of the concerns of ordinary people. The havoc that Omicron has played with France’s school system has added to public discontent, with teachers and parents complaining about complex rules on testing and isolation. As Macron presented his vision for the future of the EU in a speech in Strasbourg this week, his government was trying to calm the anger, handing out medical-grade masks and easing the testing and quarantine regime.A protest by teachers’ unions on Thursday followed a strike last week that led to 80,000 people gathering at nationwide rallies. Jean-Michel Blanquer, education minister, was forced to apologise for taking a holiday in Ibiza in late December — even though he broke no rules — after critics said his actions were proof of the government’s chaotic handling of school safety protocols as pupils returned in January.A recent Ifop opinion poll showed public confidence in the government’s ability to fight the pandemic has dropped nine percentage points to 41 per cent since early December. Macron’s popularity has dropped by four points since December, with 37 per cent having a favorable view of his record, according to a January 20 Ifop poll.“The return to schooling after the Christmas holidays was a mess and irritated lots of people — all this on top of the general exhaustion of the health crisis,” said political analyst Chloé Morin.But analysts say the political impact of Omicron is hard to predict. Infections and hospitalisations are still rising but daily intensive care admissions were down roughly 6 per cent last week compared with the previous week.“In the Macron camp, they are hoping that in three weeks or so, the current wave will be over and people will be in a better mood, and as spring arrives they will forget all this,” said Morin. “But it’s also possible that there is another twist or another variant that wrecks things again.”Vincent Martigny, politics professor at the University of Nice, said Macron’s chances “will depend on how people react to Omicron and on whether the government changes the protocols for dealing with the pandemic. If they continue with very restrictive policies, it might hit them in the end.”Omicron has also pulled attention away from issues such as immigration and crime that had dominated debate since last summer. Valérie Pécresse, presidential candidate for the conservative Les Républicains, and the two far-right candidates Marine Le Pen and Eric Zemmour, have struggled to shift the agenda back on to their favoured turf.Macron is polling at about 25 per cent of first-round voting intentions, compared with 18 per cent for Le Pen, 16 per cent for Pécresse and 11.5 per cent for Zemmour, according to recent Ifop surveys.Even if pandemic weariness fails to erode Macron’s advantage in the coming weeks, he faces other headwinds. The issue that triggered the gilets jaunes protests back in 2018 — the cost of vehicle fuel — has returned to haunt the government as rising oil prices send the cost of fuel to the highest level in more than a decade. Meanwhile, a gas shortage across Europe has increased the cost of home heating.Macron has responded to voter concerns by announcing extra spending on law enforcement and capping the rise in household electricity bills this year at 4 per cent by raiding the revenues of state-controlled energy group EDF.He is also trying to keep Pécresse — shown by polls to be his most dangerous rival if they both reach the second round — off-balance by highlighting the differences among her LR supporters over everything from vaccine mandates to France’s role in the EU.The volatility has left even seasoned political observers wary of predicting Macron’s chances. “He is ahead in the polls,” said Morin, “but not unassailable”.
155  Frustrated by his rapidly eroding purchasing power, Orhan last year joined the millions of Turks who have flocked to cryptocurrencies amid soaring inflation and a plunge in the Turkish lira. “The lira is as volatile as a shitcoin,” he said, referring to the catch-all term among crypto enthusiasts for failed digital currencies. The lira plunged by about 45 per cent against the dollar in 2021. “When there are so many economic problems [in our country], people are looking for other ways to make money,” said Orhan, who did not want his second name published.Orhan earned a profit of $4,000 on his initial $1,500 investment and cashed in his gains to buy himself a new computer. The surge in interest in cryptocurrency — and a scandal last year that saw the sudden shutdown of a Turkish crypto exchange that left hundreds of thousands of customers unable to access their funds — has alarmed the country’s authorities who now want to regulate the sector. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said a cryptocurrency law will soon be presented to parliament. He has said his government is engaged in a “war” against cryptocurrency. The governor of Turkey’s central bank, speaking to foreign investors last month, said he was “uncomfortable” with the amount of money flowing into crypto assets.These anxieties are shared by global regulators, who view cryptocurrencies as volatile and speculative. Many have concerns about illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorism financing facilitated by digital assets. The rise in the use of digital assets can dampen the impact of monetary policy decisions and lessen official control of national currencies. China has banned both bitcoin and its creation, or mining, partly due to concerns that it would lose control of money flowing into cryptocurrencies. The popularity of bitcoin has soared in countries with volatile currencies and high inflation. Turkey has the highest crypto transaction volumes in the Middle East, where volumes expanded 1,500 per cent last year compared with 2020, according to a report on global adoption trends from specialist data provider Chainalysis. “Research suggests that many in the Middle East have turned to cryptocurrency to preserve their savings against currency devaluation, a trend we see in other emerging markets like Africa and Latin America,” the report said, adding that research suggest “a highly significant relationship between lira devaluation and [the amount of] lira trading on cryptocurrency exchanges”.While Turks have long chosen to protect themselves against lira volatility by keeping their savings in dollars or euros, data suggest that some of them are turning to “stablecoins”, which are pegged to hard currencies or other assets and act as a bridge between digital coins and national currencies. Data from cryptocurrency specialist Elliptic showed that Turkish lira trading volumes have surged 360 per cent in the past six months of 2021 against the most-traded stablecoin, tether. CryptoCompare, a specialist data company, calculated that nearly TL211bn ($15.8bn) worth of bitcoin was traded last year, compared with just TL20bn in 2020.“Looking forward, we expect crypto adoption to increase in Turkey as uncertainty surrounds inflation of the lira,” said Alissa Ostrove, chief of staff at CryptoCompare. Turkey’s central bank last year announced a ban on using digital assets to make payments. More recently, the country’s banking regulator has told lenders to block customers from taking out personal loans denominated in lira in order to invest in foreign currency or crypto assets. Though few details have been confirmed about the forthcoming bill, experts said it was expected to focus on regulating crypto exchanges. “From what I understand, they are looking at a law that protects users of cryptocurrency,” said Elcin Karatay, a managing partner at the law firm Solak & Partners who has taken part in consultations with members of parliament about the regulations. “I don’t think they want to ban cryptocurrency.”Regulation would be positive for the industry if it “supports the sector, protects the investors, contributes to the economy, and ensures compliance with international markets”, said Onur Altan Tan, chief executive Bitci, the Turkish cryptocurrency platform.Some users fear that the government could seek to prevent them from taking the proceeds of their investments out of the Turkish banking system – even if that would be hard to enforce. For now the prospect of regulation has done little to dent interest in Turkey. TV news channels present bitcoin and ethereum prices alongside the dollar and euro exchange rates. Half-time television adverts at football matches tout the virtues of crypto exchanges. “When I talk about crypto, everybody — my hairdresser, my taxi driver, my waiters — asks: ‘What do you invest in?’,” said Sima Baktas, co-founder of CryptoWomen Turkey, which promotes female involvement in the cryptocurrency world. “Everybody is interested.”About a third of the 2,000 or so people who have taken part in training courses run by her group are housewives, said Baktas. “They say: ‘my husband is earning less money and I want to invest in crypto’,” she said.Authorities have sought to lure people back to Turkish lira investments with a new scheme that promises to protect savers against exchange rate losses. Such steps are unlikely to work, analysts say, as long as Erdogan remains fixated on keeping interest rates far below inflation, which stood at an official rate of 36 per cent in December and is expected to rise further in the months ahead.Orhan, the crypto trader, says that, rather than seeking to regulate digital assets, the government should be examining the root causes of its appeal. “They should be asking: why are people interested in cryptocurrency? Why are they taking this risk?” he said. “When there’s no stability, people look for alternative solutions.”For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFTSign up here with one click
156  The Omicron variant is causing far less damage to the European economy than previous waves of Covid-19, an FT analysis of high frequency data shows, thanks in large part to high vaccination rates and society’s improved ability to live with the virus.Although infection rates across the eurozone have risen to their highest levels since the pandemic began, cinema ticket sales, hotel bookings, job postings and mobility data have fallen far less than in previous surges caused by the coronavirus.This time last year, visits to shops, bars and restaurants had dropped more than 40 per cent below pre-pandemic levels. This year, by contrast, visits have dropped by less than half that amount, according to Google mobility data.“The economic impact of the pandemic is fading by the wave,” said Bert Colijn, economist at ING. “The relatively high levels of mobility are positive for economic activity.”This is reflected in economists’ growth predictions. Silvia Ardagna, economist at Barclays, forecasts that despite Omicron the bloc’s economy will still have expanded around 0.2 per cent during the last quarter of 2021 and again in the first quarter of this year. She also expects “solid growth in 2022-2023 driven by domestic demand”.There is also little sign that Omicron has significantly hurt the jobs market, according to data from Indeed, a job search website. Eurozone unemployment had already dropped in November to below its pre-pandemic, 2019 average.Unemployment is “going to fall to levels that we haven’t seen before” in the eurozone, said Claus Vistesen, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, who expects that tight labour markets combined with economic recovery may boost inflation, which hit a record high for the bloc of 5 per cent in December.Even so, the exponential rise in infection rates has hurt economic activity, as restrictions have forced people to self-isolate and limited public gatherings. That has especially hit consumer services.In the first weekend of January, European cinema revenues in the EU’s four biggest economies were about 20 per cent below the same period in 2020, according to Box Office Mojo data, a US website that tracks global ticket sales. German restaurant bookings were also 30 per cent lower in mid-January than at the same time in 2019.Likewise, tourism and international travel remain weak. Flight numbers are down 35 per cent compared to 2019’s pre-pandemic rates. Hotel bookings have also fallen back to levels last seen in the spring of 2021, according to data from Sojern, a digital marketing platform.Nonetheless, that is a marked improvement on this time last year, when bookings fell by far more.Analysts say one difference with this wave is that restrictions — such as the Covid-19 passes required in countries such as France and Italy to access hospitality and leisure venues — largely target the unvaccinated and those who have not already fallen ill. As they constitute a minority, the rest of the economy can remain open.“Covid cases have risen across Europe, restrictions have been applied and mobility has fallen,” said George Buckley, economist at Nomura. “Still, there are reasons to be optimistic” he added, forecasting a rapid recovery in the spring.Analysts said that another reason for the smaller hit to economic activity this year was that hospital admission and death rates are rising far less than infections. In 2021, much lower infection rates dragged the eurozone into recession.Jack Allen-Reynolds, economist at Capital Economics, expects “the current wave of infections caused by Omicron will burn out more rapidly than previous waves, allowing restrictions to be eased in February”.Indeed, this week France said it would start to ease Covid-19 restrictions from next month as the wave of infections had peaked in the Paris area and were expected to do the same soon in the rest of the country.Better times are forecast for manufacturers as well. Daily German data on truck mileage, a proxy for industrial production, has risen above November levels, a signal that China’s zero-Covid policy has not yet affected global manufacturing supply chains.Even if there are supply disruptions, higher inventory levels mean factories should be able to ride out any shortages more easily than before, said Paul Donovan, chief economist of UBS Global Wealth Management.“Overall, Omicron is likely to be a lot less disruptive than previous waves of the pandemic,” he said. “People have learned to adapt and that minimises a lot of the damage.”
157  The western alliance has threatened the Kremlin with “massive” and “unprecedented” sanctions if Russia attacks Ukraine. But, as the Ukraine crisis reaches boiling point, western efforts to isolate and punish Russia are likely to be undermined by the support of China — Russia’s giant neighbour.When Vladimir Putin travels to Beijing for the beginning of the Winter Olympics on February 4, the Russian president will meet the leader who has become his most important ally — Xi Jinping of China. In a phone call between Putin and Xi in December, the Chinese leader supported Russia’s demand that Ukraine must never join Nato.A decade ago, such a relationship seemed unlikely: China and Russia were as much rivals as partners. But after a period when both countries have sparred persistently with the US, Xi’s support for Putin reflects a growing identity between the interests and world views of Moscow and Beijing. According to the Chinese media, Xi told Putin that “certain international forces are arbitrarily interfering in the internal affairs of China and Russia, under the guise of democracy and human rights”.As Xi’s remarks to Putin made clear, the Russian and Chinese leaders are united by a belief that the US is plotting to undermine and overthrow their governments. In the heyday of communism, Russia and China supported revolutionary forces around the world. But today Moscow and Beijing have embraced the rhetoric of counter-revolution. When unrest broke out in Kazakhstan recently, Putin accused the US of attempting to sponsor a “colour revolution” — a term given to protest movements that seek to change the government — in a country that borders both Russia and China. Senior Chinese ministers echoed those remarks.As Russia and China see it, the uprising in Kazakhstan fitted a pattern. The Kremlin has long argued that the US was the hidden hand behind Ukraine’s Maidan uprising of 2013-14, in which a pro-Russian leader was overthrown. China also insists that foreign forces — for which, read the US — were behind the huge Hong Kong protests of 2019, which were eventually ended by a crackdown ordered from Beijing.Both Putin and Xi have also made it clear they believe that America’s ultimate goal is to overthrow the Russian and Chinese governments and that local pro-democracy forces are America’s Trojan horse.In 1917, President Woodrow Wilson of the US talked of “making the world safe for democracy”. In 2022, Putin and Xi are determined to make the world safe for autocracy.The ambitions of Russia and China, however, are far from being wholly defensive. Both Putin and Xi believe that their vulnerability to “colour revolutions” stems from fundamental flaws in the current world order — the combination of institutions, ideas and power structures that determines how global politics plays out. As a result, they share a determination to create a new world order that will better accommodate the interests of Russia and China — as defined by their current leaders.Two features of the current world order that the Russians and the Chinese frequently object to are “unipolarity” and “universality”. Put more simply, they believe that the current arrangements give America too much power — and they are determined to change that.“Unipolarity” means that, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the world was left with only one superpower — the US. Fyodor Lukyanov, a Russian foreign-policy thinker who is close to President Putin, believes that unipolarity “gave the United States the ability and possibility to do whatever it saw fit on the world stage”. He argues that the new age of American hegemony was ushered in by the Gulf war of 1991 — in which the US assembled a global coalition to drive Saddam Hussein’s Iraq out of Kuwait.The Gulf war was followed by a succession of US-led military interventions around the world — including in Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s. Nato’s bombing of Belgrade, Serbia’s capital, in 1999, has long formed part of Russia’s argument that Nato is not a purely defensive alliance. The fact that Nato bombs also struck the Chinese embassy in Belgrade has not been forgotten in Beijing.After the 9/11 terror attacks on New York and Washington, Nato invoked Article 5 — its mutual-defence clause — and invaded Afghanistan. Once again, according to Lukyanov, America had demonstrated its willingness and ability to “forcefully transform the world”.But America’s defeat in Afghanistan, symbolised by the chaotic withdrawal from Kabul in the summer of 2021, has given the Russians hope that the US-led world order is crumbling. Lukyanov argues that the fall of Kabul to the Taliban was “no less historical and symbolic than the fall of the Berlin Wall”.Influential Chinese academics are thinking along similar lines. Yan Xuetong, dean of the school of international relations at Tsinghua University in Beijing (Xi’s alma mater), writes that “China believes that its rise to great-power status entitles it to a new role in world affairs — one that cannot be reconciled with unquestioned US dominance.”Like Lukyanov, Yan believes that “the US-led world order is fading away.In its place will come a multipolar order”. President Xi himself has put it even more succinctly with his often repeated claim that “the east is rising and the west is declining”.For Russia and China, the making of a new world order is not simply a matter of raw power. It is also a battle of ideas. While the western liberal tradition promotes the idea of universal human rights, Russian and Chinese thinkers make the argument that different cultural traditions and “civilisations” should be allowed to develop in different ways.Vladislav Surkov, once an influential adviser to Putin, has decried Russia’s “repeated fruitless efforts to become a part of western civilisation”. Instead, according to Surkov, Russia should embrace the idea that it has “absorbed both east and west” and has a “hybrid mentality”. In a similar vein, pro-government thinkers in Beijing argue that a fusion of Confucianism and communism means that China will always be a country that stresses collective rather than individual rights. They claim that China’s success in containing Covid-19 reflects the superiority of the Chinese emphasis on collective action and group rights.Beijing and Moscow argue that the current world order is characterised by an American attempt to impose western ideas about democracy and human rights on other countries, if necessary through military intervention. The new world order that Russia and China are demanding would instead be based on distinct spheres of influence. The US would accept Russian and Chinese domination of their neighbourhoods and would abandon its support for democracy or the colour revolutions that might threaten the Putin or Xi regimes.The crisis over Ukraine is a struggle over the future world order because it turns on precisely these issues. For Putin, Ukraine is culturally and politically part of Russia’s sphere of influence. Russia’s security needs should give it the right to veto any Ukrainian desire to join Nato, the western alliance. Moscow also demands to act as the protector of Russian speakers. For the US, these demands violate some basic principles of the current world order — in particular, the right of an independent country to define its own foreign policy and strategic choices.The Ukraine crisis is also about “world order” because it has clear global implications. The US knows that if Russia attacks Ukraine and establishes its own “sphere of influence”, a precedent will be set for China. During the Xi era, China has built military bases all over contested areas of the South China Sea. Beijing’s threats to invade Taiwan — a self-governing democratic island that China regards as a rebel province — have also become more overt and frequent. If Putin succeeds in invading Ukraine, the temptation for Xi to attack Taiwan will rise, as will the domestic pressure on the Chinese leader from excitable nationalists, sensing the end of the American era.Russia and China clearly have similar complaints about the current world order. There are also some important differences between the approaches of Moscow and Beijing. Russia is currently more willing to take military risks than China. But its ultimate goals may be more limited. For the Russians, the use of military force in Syria, Ukraine and elsewhere is a way of repudiating the claim made by former US president Barack Obama that Russia is now no more than a regional power. Dmitri Trenin of the Carnegie Center in Moscow argues that, “For the country’s leaders, Russia is nothing if it is not a great power.”But while Russia aspires to be one of the world’s great powers, China seems to be contemplating displacing the US as the world’s pre-eminent power. Elizabeth Economy, author of a new book called The World According to China, argues that Beijing is aiming for a “radically transformed international order” in which the US is in essence pushed out of the Pacific and becomes merely an Atlantic power. Since the Indo-Pacific is now the core of the global economy, that would essentially leave China as “number one”. Rush Doshi, a China scholar working in the White House, makes a similar argument in his book, The Long Game. Citing various Chinese sources, Doshi makes the case that China is now clearly aiming for American-style global hegemony.The difference in the scale of the ambitions of China and Russia reflects the difference in their economic potential. Russia’s economy is now roughly the size of Italy’s. Moscow simply does not have the wealth to sustain a bid for global supremacy. By contrast, China is now, by some measures, the world’s largest economy. It is also the world’s largest manufacturer and exporter. Its population of 1.4bn people is roughly ten times that of Russia. As a result, it is realistic for China to aspire to be the most powerful country in the world.But while the differences in the economic potential of Russia and China makes Xi ultimately more ambitious than Putin, in the short term it also makes him more cautious. There is something of a gambler’s desperation in Putin’s willingness to use military force to try to change the balance of power in Europe. Trenin argues that, having seen Nato expand into much of what was once the Soviet bloc, Putin sees Ukraine as his “last stand”.In Beijing, by contrast, there is a strong feeling that time and history are on China’s side. The Chinese also have many economic instruments for expanding their influence that are simply not available to the Russians. A signature project of the Xi years is the Belt and Road Initiative, a vast international programme of Chinese-funded infrastructure that stretches into Central Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas.As America has become more protectionist, China has also used its trading power to expand its global influence. This month has seen the launch of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a vast new free-trade area in the Asia-Pacific that includes China and several American strategic allies, such as Japan and Australia — which the US is not taking part in. Granting or withholding access to the Chinese market gives Beijing a tool of influence that is simply not available to Moscow.But will gradualism work? Or do Russia and China need some kind of dramatic moment to create the new world order that they seek?History suggests that new governing systems for the world generally emerge after some kind of seismic political event, such as a major war.Much of the security and institutional architecture of the current world order emerged as the second world war was closing or in its aftermath, when the UN, the World Bank and the IMF were set up and their headquarters were situated in the US. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) came into force in 1948. Nato was created in 1949. The US-Japan Security Treaty was signed in 1951. The European Coal and Steel Community, the forerunner of the EU, was also founded in 1951. After the end of the cold war, rival Soviet-backed institutions such as the Warsaw Pact collapsed and Nato and the EU expanded up to the borders of Russia. China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, the successor to the Gatt.The question now is whether Russia and China’s ambitions for a “new world order” will also need a war to come to fruition. A direct conflict with the US is simply too dangerous in the nuclear era and will not happen unless all sides miscalculate badly (which is always possible).Russia and China may, however, feel that they will be able to achieve their ambitions through proxy wars. An unopposed Russian victory in Ukraine might signal that a new security order was emerging in Europe, involving a de facto Russian “sphere of influence”. A successful Chinese invasion of Taiwan would be widely read as a sign that the era of American dominance of the Pacific was over. At that point, many countries in the region that currently look to the US for their security, such as Japan and South Korea, might choose to accommodate themselves to a new China-dominated order.Alternatively, a new world order might emerge through tacit acquiescence from Washington. That outcome does not seem likely with the Biden administration in power, unless there are some dramatic last-minute concessions from the US over Ukraine. But Donald Trump could return to the White House in 2024. At least rhetorically, he seems sympathetic to aspects of the Russian-Chinese world view.The former US president sometimes denigrated Nato and suggested that America’s allies in Asia were free-riders. His “America First” philosophy eschewed traditional language about an American mission to support freedom around the world. At times, Trump was also frank in expressing admiration for both Xi and Putin. And, as a self-proclaimed dealmaker, Trump is sympathetic to ideas of spheres of influence.Yet Russia and China do not seem inclined to sit back and wait for Trump to return to the White House. They know that even Trump’s Republican party includes many hawks, intent on confrontation with both Russia and China. In any case, a great deal can happen between now and the next presidential election in November 2024.Russia’s impatience is clear from Putin’s willingness to force a crisis over Ukraine. The prospects for a new world order that is more congenial to Russia may depend on whether his Ukrainian gamble works. But even if Putin fails to achieve his goals in Ukraine, the threat to the US-led world order will not disappear. A rising China, led by an ambitious President Xi, will make sure of that.
158  Nato’s promise to one day admit Ukraine into the fold was an “ugly compromise”, but was not to blame for the threat of conflict with Russia, the military’s alliance’s former secretary-general has said.Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, who as head of Nato declared in 2008 that Ukraine “will become a member”, told the Financial Times that Vladimir Putin’s demands for the alliance to abandon that pledge was a false pretext for the Russian president’s “revanchist crusade”.“He’s a guy whose world broke apart in 1989,” said de Hoop Scheffer, referring to the tumultuous events of that year, which included the fall of the Berlin Wall, that preceded the collapse of the Soviet Union. “Whatever Nato would have agreed. Putin would be the same Putin.”He continued: “Giving in on Ukraine now is the wrong way to go.because nobody can guarantee that [Putin’s] appetite will not grow. Putin wants much more than Ukraine and Georgia. Belarus, Moldova, Armenia: he wants his empire back.”Russia claims that Nato broke agreements struck after the Soviet Union’s demise not to expand into Moscow’s former satellite states. Nato has insisted that sovereign states have the right to choose their own foreign, defence and security policies.In negotiations this month, Russia has demanded the US and Nato vow never to admit Ukraine and Georgia into the alliance as part of a series of agreements it said it required to safeguard its security. The Kremlin views absorbing Ukraine as the red line the US-led alliance must never cross.Moscow has stationed more than 106,000 troops close to the border with Ukraine and threatened a “military technical” response if those demands are ignored.Nato’s Ukraine pledge, given at a stormy summit in Bucharest, represented a messy consolation for supporters of Kyiv’s membership — led by then-US president George Bush — who were defeated in an attempt to get the alliance to agree on beginning the country’s formal admission procedure.“In retrospect, when I look back at this now, for Nato a reconfirmation of the open-door policy would have been preferable.but that’s easy to say now,” said de Hoop Scheffer, a former Dutch foreign affairs minister.“Nato’s in a bind because we’ve told Ukraine you can enter the house but you’re not allowed on the porch,” he continued. “Compromises are ugly. and Nato is living with that compromise ever since.”In talks with Russia this month, the US and Nato have firmly rejected Moscow’s request, saying that it contravenes one of the alliance’s founding principles.While supporting that position, de Hoop Scheffer said that in reality Kyiv had no prospect of membership due to the same opposition that existed in 2008.“For the foreseeable and the unforeseeable future they’ll not become a Nato member. And I think the whole group around that table in Bucharest knew this,” he said. “It was already clear then that in the eyes of the opponents [of Ukraine’s membership] it was until hell freezes over. There was no time limit whatsoever.”“[Putin] was of course furious about the wording,” de Hoop Scheffer recalled. “Although then, and right up until now, he very well knows.that Nato and the Americans are never ever going to wage war with Russia over Ukraine.”
159  The UK warned on Saturday that Russia was plotting to install a pro-Moscow leader in Ukraine at a time of mounting western alarm over an imminent Russian invasion of the country.The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said it had evidence that Russia’s President Vladimir Putin was seeking to install a puppet regime as it considers whether to invade — and named Yevhen Murayev, a former Ukrainian MP, as a potential leader favoured by Moscow. It did not release that evidence.Liz Truss, UK foreign secretary, said that the revelation “shines a light on the extent of Russian activity designed to subvert Ukraine and is an insight into Kremlin thinking”.She added: “Russia must de-escalate, end its campaigns of aggression and disinformation, and pursue a path of diplomacy. As the UK and our partners have said repeatedly, any Russian military incursion into Ukraine would be a massive strategic mistake with severe costs.”Murayev is a pro-Russian politician from the northern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. He is a former member of the Party of the Regions, the party of Viktor Yanukovich, the pro-Russian president who was ousted in the Maidan revolution in 2014. Murayev created his own party Nashi, named after the Russian youth movement, but is a fairly minor political figure.Russia itself placed sanctions on Murayev, who owns a major TV station, in 2018. On Saturday, he posted on his Facebook profile a picture of his face manipulated on to an image of James Bond and wrote “Details tomorrow”, adding a smiley emoji.“I have been under Russian sanctions since 2018 because of my conflict with [Viktor] Medvedchuk,” Murayev told pro-Russian website Strana, referring to a rival pro-Moscow politician close to Putin whose allies the US accused of being pawns in a similar Russian plot earlier this week.“My family’s assets there have been seized. How the UK secret services and the Foreign Office square that with Russia supposedly wanting to make me the head of an occupation government — that’s a question for Mr Bean,” he added. Oleksandr Danylyuk, Ukraine’s former national security chief, told the FT that “Russia was always in search for agents of influence in Ukraine.Murayev would be an obvious choice”. He added that Murayev “is not short of financial resources”.Ukraine’s parliament has about 50 members who are supportive of Moscow and opposed to Ukraine’s western alignment.The UK also highlighted four other former Ukrainian politicians who it said had continued links with Russian intelligence services: Serhiy Arbuzov, former first deputy prime minister of Ukraine; Andriy Kluyev, former chief of staff to Yanukovich; Vladimir Sivkovich, ex-deputy header of Ukraine’s national security and defence council; and Mykola Azarov, former prime minister of Ukraine. All four are believed to be in exile in Russia.The US Treasury department placed sanctions on Sivkovich this week, saying that in 2021 he had “worked with a network of Russian intelligence actors to carry out influence operations that attempted to build support for Ukraine to officially cede Crimea to Russia in exchange for a drawdown of Russian-backed forces in the Donbas”, where separatists continue to receive support from Russia.The Treasury department also accused Sivkovich of working with Russian intelligence services in 2020 to promote disinformation about the US presidential election.Russia has massed 106,000 troops on the border with its western neighbour and Nato officials fear a Russian invasion is impending.Britain’s claims of a Russian plot — released in a statement late on Saturday — are a highly unusual disclosure of intelligence, but fit a pattern of western diplomacy in recent months designed to draw attention to Russian plans for military action or destabilisation of Ukraine.In response to London’s warning, the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement cited by state newswire RIA Novosti: “The disinformation spread by the UK Foreign Office is yet more evidence that it is Nato countries, foremost the Anglo-Saxons, who are escalating tensions around Ukraine.”“We call on the Foreign Office to end its provocative activity, stop spreading nonsense and concentrate on studying the history of the Tatar-Mongol yoke,” the ministry added in an apparent dig at UK defence secretary Ben Wallace’s recent speech on Russia and Ukraine’s shared history.Washington expressed its concern at the allegations. Emily Horne, an official for the White House’s National Security Council, said: “This kind of plotting is deeply concerning. The Ukrainian people have the sovereign right to determine their own future, and we stand with our democratically elected partners in Ukraine.”The White House said US President Joe Biden met his national security team on Saturday, and “affirmed that if Russia further invades Ukraine, the United States will impose swift and severe consequences on Russia with our Allies and partners”.
160  Germany’s naval chief has resigned after controversial comments he made about Russia and Crimea sparked a damaging diplomatic row with Kyiv just as fears grow of an imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine.Vice-Admiral Kay-Achim Schönbach was filmed at an Indian think-tank last week saying that Vladimir Putin should be given the “respect he probably deserves” and claiming that Crimea would never be returned to Ukraine.The comments showed sympathy with Russian policy at a time of mounting western alarm at Moscow’s intentions towards Ukraine. Russia has amassed 106,000 troops on the border with its western neighbour and Nato officials fear a Russian invasion is imminent.The Ukrainian foreign ministry summoned Germany’s ambassador to Kyiv to protest Schönbach’s comments that Ukraine will never regain control of Crimea and meet the criteria for Nato membership.It said it had also communicated to the German ambassador to Ukraine, Anka Feldhusen, its “deep disappointment” over Germany’s continued refusal to provide Kyiv with weapons. Germany has long pursued a highly restrictive policy on arms exports and is making no exception for Ukraine.In a statement, Schönbach said he had asked the defence minister to relieve him of his duties as inspector of the German navy “with immediate effect”.“The ill-considered remarks I made in India about security and military policy are an increasing burden on my office,” he said. “In order to avert further damage to the German navy, the Bundeswehr and above all the Federal Republic of Germany, I consider this step advisable.” He added that the defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, had accepted his resignation.The German government had been quick to distance itself from Schönbach’s comments. But Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said they were part of a pattern of unhelpful behaviour by German officials.“Ukraine is grateful to Germany for the support it has provided since 2014, as well as for its diplomatic efforts to resolve the Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict,” Kuleba tweeted on Saturday. “But Germany’s current statements are disappointing and run counter to that support and those efforts.”The reaction to the scandal in Berlin political circles was furious. Reinhard Bütikofer, a senior figure in the German Green party, one of the partners in Germany’s coalition government, said Schönbach’s comments were “more than an embarrassment”.“Utterly unacceptable. There must be consequences! But this is NOT the position of the German foreign ministry,” he said.The row coincides with a frantic diplomatic drive to deter Russia from invading Ukraine. Putin has vowed an unspecified “military-technical response” if the west rejects his security demands. These include a call for Nato to remove all its forces from Bulgaria, Romania and other ex-communist states in eastern Europe that joined the alliance after 1997 — a move the alliance has deemed unacceptable.The tension over Schönbach’s faux pas comes just weeks after Ukraine’s defence minister Oleksii Reznikov criticised Germany in a Financial Times interview for blocking the supply of weaponry to Ukraine.Reznikov said Berlin had vetoed Ukraine’s purchase of anti-drone rifles and anti-sniper systems via the Nato Support and Procurement Agency. Germany has since relented on the first item, after deeming it non-lethal.Ukraine has also been highly critical of Germany’s support for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will bring Russian gas directly to Germany under the Baltic Sea, bypassing Ukraine. Its critics say it will weaken Kyiv and also tighten the Kremlin’s grip on European energy markets.The video of Schönbach shows him saying that Putin should be treated as an equal by the west, and referring to Russia as an “old. and important country” that the west and India needed “against China”.“What he [Putin] really wants is respect,” he said. “And by God, giving someone respect is low-cost, even no-cost. it is easy to give him the respect he really demands — and probably also deserves.”Schönbach also said that the “Crimean peninsula is gone, it will never come back, this is a fact”. That contradicts the official western line that the annexation of Crimea was illegal and must be reversed.The German defence ministry said Schönbach’s comments “do not in any way correspond to the ministry’s position, either in terms of content or in choice of words”.
161  The writer was UK ambassador to France 2012-16 and is author of ‘Hard Choices: What Britain Did Next’The political relationship between Britain and France is the worst I have known it in 40 years as a diplomat. A recent Harris Poll shows that this sour mood is now affecting public opinion in France, with only 40 per cent of respondents seeing the UK as an ally, far short of the 74 per cent for Italy and 73 per cent for Germany and Spain.Contrast that with the mood a decade ago, when David Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy agreed a new defence partnership, the French looked on with admiration tinged with jealousy at the London Olympics and then gave the Queen a rapturous reception on her state visit in 2014.Brexit marked the turning point. Britain was widely seen in France as not just leaving the EU, but turning its back on its European neighbours — a perception reinforced by the Johnson government’s continuing effort to ignore Europe as it defines a new role in the world. The aftershocks of Brexit have also been felt more in France than other EU countries, from disruption at Channel ports to spats over fishing licences around the Channel Islands. There were always going to be post-Brexit frictions. But this is much more serious — a fundamental breakdown of trust between the two governments, and particularly between Emmanuel Macron and Boris Johnson.The French were left shell-shocked by the UK’s threats to renege on the Northern Ireland protocol. Macron was exasperated by what he saw as Johnson staging a public row with him at the G7 summit in Cornwall over exporting sausages to Northern Ireland, in an attempt to shift the blame for the difficulties in implementing the Protocol. The tragic death of 27 migrants in the Channel last November should have been the moment to reconcile differences. Instead, Johnson wrote a letter to Macron full of proposals which he knew the French could not accept, and published it before it reached Macron’s desk.The handling of the Aukus submarine deal with Australia was the last straw. For France to lose this massive contract to the US and UK was always going to be difficult. But the manner of its announcement left Macron feeling humiliated. Joe Biden publicly accepted that it had been handled clumsily and launched a full-scale damage repair exercise. Johnson did the reverse, making matters worse with his schoolboy mockery of the French President.When No 10 then floated the idea of a new strategic alliance with France in the British press, the reaction in Paris was glacial.The blame for this sorry state of affairs does not lie entirely in London. Macron and his ministers have also been provocative, making irresponsible threats, such as to cut off electricity to the Channel Islands. But in the past, UK-French co-operation in areas like business, culture and sport continued largely unaffected by political ructions, underpinned by the dense web of human ties. The Harris Poll is a reminder that even this cannot be taken for granted. It is not that the French are becoming hostile towards Britain, but simply indifferent. The French media take little notice of what is happening in the UK, apart from bemused coverage of the antics at Westminster. In the French presidential election campaign, none of the candidates are calling for a reset of relations with London. The real risk is that the two countries drift apart, which is why it is so stupidly short-sighted for the UK to deny the next generation of young British and French people the opportunity to live and study in each other’s country through the Erasmus scheme exchanges.Since Britain left the EU, bilateral relations with European neighbours have become more important than ever. In his speech to the European Parliament this month, Macron said that the condition for future friendship was that the British government stood by its word. A message, perhaps, to the next prime minister?
162  The conservative MP Friedrich Merz has been elected leader of Germany’s Christian Democratic Union, promising a “new beginning” for a party still reeling from its defeat in last September’s Bundestag election.Merz was elected with 94.62 per cent of the vote of delegates at a CDU party conference, after promising to form a “powerful opposition” to the Social Democrat chancellor Olaf Scholz and his SPD-green-liberal coalition.His victory was a foregone conclusion, after he soundly beat two other candidates to win a poll of CDU members in December. He has long enjoyed huge popularity among the CDU’s rank and file, though the party’s senior leadership has always been suspicious of his robust brand of conservative politics.Merz’s election marks the end of a long period of introspection for a party that is getting to used to being on the opposition benches for the first time in 16 years and only the third time in its history. It garnered only 24.1 per cent in the September election, compared to the SPD’s 25.7.Speaking to delegates before the vote, Merz launched a broad attack on Scholz, accusing him of a lack of leadership. He said that he had called for mandatory vaccinations but so far failed to present a government bill on the issue to the Bundestag: that he has been silent on inflation, which is at its highest level in 30 years; and that he has yet to travel to Washington and Moscow, despite a crisis on the Russian-Ukrainian border.“All your predecessors. would have shown leadership in a situation like this,” he said. “They would have been in daily contact with their partners.”Merz rose to prominence in the 1990s, when his reputation as a liberal reformer with a flair for oratory marked him out as a rising star in the CDU. He became leader of the Christian Democrats’ parliamentary group in 2000 but lost the job in a power struggle with Angela Merkel and in 2009 quit the Bundestag to pursue a career in business. From 2016 until 2020 he was chair of BlackRock Germany, a job that made him a multimillionaire.Saturday’s election was third time lucky for Merz. His last two bids for the CDU leadership ended in narrow defeat — first to Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer in 2018 and then to Armin Laschet, the former prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, last January. Both were considered moderates committed to Merkel’s centrist, pragmatic course while Merz is a conservative who often complained that the CDU had drifted too far to the left under his old rival.In his speech on Saturday, Merz said he would seek to improve the morale of his beleaguered party, saying that its electoral defeat contained a “new beginning, a new chance”. He said his three tasks as leader would be to form a strong opposition, win the four critical regional elections to be held in Germany this year and draft a new party programme.In his speech Merz set out a firmly conservative agenda, saying the CDU would “protect the family” and “stick up for the Bundeswehr and our European and international obligations”, and oppose the creation of an “overpowering European federal state”.He said the party’s job was not to “run after the spirit of the times”, and identified one of his key priorities as reform of Germany’s social security system.While acknowledging the need to fight climate change, he took pains to stress his differences with Scholz’s “traffic light” coalition on the issue, and especially on the role of the state in mitigating global warming.Climate policy “can’t just be implemented through the public finances, high taxes and levies,” he said. “It can only work if we take business with us.”“We know that the economy isn’t everything, but without a successful, competitive economy we won’t succeed in greening our country or maintaining our welfare system over the long run,” he said.
163  The US is holding talks with Qatar and other large gas exporters to plan contingency measures in case a Russian invasion of Ukraine disrupts supplies to Europe.The talks with Qatar and EU member states, focused on securing additional seaborne liquefied natural gas cargoes, have gained urgency after high-level security negotiations between Washington and Moscow this week yielded minimal progress.This has increased concerns that conflict could hit gas supplies at a time when Europe is facing record prices. However officials warned that there was no “magic wand” to solve the potential shortfall with the continent already in the grip of an energy crisis.“We’re looking at what can be done in preparation for an event, especially midwinter with very low [European natural gas] supplies in storage,” a senior US administration official said.“We discussed what can be moved around the market, what can help.the things we can prepare now for deployment if and when there is an escalated crisis”.Another person briefed on the discussions with Doha said there was “potential to explore a long-term guarantee of LNG security, especially as Qatar will greatly increase its LNG production over the next few years”.“In the short term it will be dependent on the willingness of other client countries to reroute and availability of unallocated LNG” the person said. “However, Qatar did reroute its supplies in 2011 for Japan after the tsunami hit so there’s precedent, but only if there’s a crisis.”Preliminary discussions have started between Qatar, the world’s biggest exporter of LNG, the UK and European states about long-term gas supply “solutions,” the person added.Most of Qatar’s LNG is shipped to Asia where the Gulf state’s clients agree to fixed, long-term contracts.US President Joe Biden is due to hold talks with Qatar’s Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, in Washington this month, the person briefed on the discussions said.Tensions between the west and Russia have soared as Moscow has deployed about 100,000 troops on the Ukrainian border. The US has threatened severe sanctions against Russia if it invades, while some energy officials have accused the Kremlin of already leveraging its gas exports.Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency, said last week that Russia was throttling gas supplies to Europe at a time of “heightened geopolitical tensions”.There are fears that conflict could lead to a further drop in gas supplies to Europe, which is facing a growing cost of living crisis as gas prices have soared.With gas stocks at record low levels for the time of year, officials fear Europe could face industrial disruption, blackouts, or even a loss of heating supplies if Russian exports were to fall sharply.The senior official in the Biden administration acknowledged that contracts between LNG exporters and Asian buyers could complicate efforts to divert supplies to Europe.“There’s no magic wand,” the official said. “It’s all really hard, really complicated. Looking to do it within the constructs of how markets work, how commercial terms work, how cargoes work.”The official added it had become clear that Russia had been squeezing gas supplies in recent months in order to gain leverage over European capitals.“This is not a market situation we’re dealing with. These are not market forces. These are manipulated markets,” the official said.Europe’s reliance on Russian gas has complicated efforts to present a united front against Moscow’s threats.While most observers expect Russia to avoid completely cutting exports, there are concerns Moscow could still squeeze supplies further, or that gas export infrastructure in Ukraine could be damaged by conflict.Energy executives have warned about the potential effect of US sanctions after Biden this week said punitive measures could include stopping Russian banks from dealing in US dollars — the main currency of the global commodities trade.One energy industry executive said that Europe would almost certainly face extremely high prices in the event of disruption that required co-ordinated government action to source seaborne LNG cargoes.“They will effectively have to compete for all the supply in the market, taking cargoes away from Asia, and the likely end result is the taxpayer will pay,” the energy executive said.“It would be like procuring PPE at the start of the pandemic, with governments needing to intervene.” Doha has been locked in a dispute with the EU over a 2018 European Commission investigation into QatarEnergy’s long-term, fixed contracts. The probe has frustrated Doha and put a brake on Qatar investments and LNG supplies to Europe, causing the Gulf state to halt projects in France and Belgium.However, the person briefed on the discussions said talks between Qatar and EU officials had also restarted over resolving a European Commission investigation into Qatar’s long-term contracts on the continent.The person added that Europe needed to guarantee a long-term deal with Qatar or others to ensure stability and reduced dependence on Russia.“People have become much more focused on gas security,” he said.
164  Bitcoin dropped to a six-month low on Saturday, extending a steep fall recorded in the previous session as the cryptocurrency market was swept up in a powerful shift by investors out of speculative assets.The price of the biggest digital token by market value fell 4.3 per cent in the European morning on Saturday to $35,127, the lowest level since July 2021. Bitcoin has now lost almost a quarter of its value this year.Other cryptocurrencies have also come under intense selling pressure, with an FT Wilshire index of the top five tokens excluding bitcoin down 30 per cent in the first month of 2022.The cryptocurrency rout comes as investors have dumped shares in tech companies on expectations the US Federal Reserve will move to rein in loose pandemic monetary policy to combat inflation. Global stock markets posted their biggest declines in more than a year this week, with the fast-growing companies that powered the rally from the depths of the coronavirus crisis enduring intense falls.Investors now forecast the Fed, the world’s most influential central bank, will raise interest rates three to four times this year, something that has sent bond yields surging. Higher yields on low-risk assets like US government bonds make the potential returns that can be earned through speculative investments like cryptocurrencies look less appealing, analysts say.Andrew Sullivan, managing director at Outset Global in Hong Kong, said Asia was seeing “huge volumes going through in a number of markets as investors move to cash” on Friday, as technology shares in the region fell.The sharp sell-off in digital assets also came a day after the Russian central bank announced on Thursday draft proposals seeking to ban all cryptocurrency trading and mining. The proposed regulations would also block cryptocurrency investment by banks and forbid any exchange of cryptocurrency for traditional currencies in Russia, one of the world’s largest centres for crypto mining.The central bank said in its 36-page report that the rapidly rising value of cryptocurrencies “is defined primarily by speculative demand for future growth, which creates bubbles”, adding they “also have aspects of financial pyramids, because their price growth is largely supported by demand from new entrants to the market”.The announcement initially had little impact on bitcoin, which rose as much as 3.7 per cent against the dollar on Thursday. But by Friday afternoon in Asia the cryptocurrency had dropped more than 10 per cent from the previous day’s high to hit its lowest level since August.“The Russian regulators have been frustrated [with the cryptocurrency industry] for several years and none of their warnings have been heeded,” said Vince Turcotte, Asia-Pacific sales director at Eventus Systems.He added that while the Russian proposal was “relatively harsher”, it was only the latest in a slew of announcements on cryptocurrencies by regulators across the globe focused mainly on protecting retail investors.Turcotte likened the situation in Russia to that of China before Beijing began a more forceful crackdown on the industry. “Nobody listened to [Chinese officials] until they actually brought the hammer down,” he said. Last year, China declared that all crypto activities were illegal.
165  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
166  The House of Hungarian Music, a small glass-built venue with a roof like a fluffy pancake, is billed as a centre for a city seeped in music. A blend of gallery, concert hall and outdoor performance space, it was conceived as a glade, a clearing in the woods, with a perforated roof for trees to poke through and for shafts of light to pierce deep into the heart of the building. Witty, whimsical and seemingly weightless, it is a delicate addition to Budapest’s Varosliget.Designed by Japanese architect Sou Fujimoto, the House of Hungarian Music is part of the rebirth of Budapest’s Varosliget (or City Park), which was the focus of Hungary’s millennial celebrations in 1896, a thousand years since the Magyars had settled in the country. The venue is the first new building in Europe’s biggest new cultural quarter, but has also become entangled in the culture wars that prime minister Viktor Orban has been waging.The first thing to note is that this eccentric building is a genuine delight. The second — and I note this a little sheepishly — is that I was on the jury that selected the design. At the time, I raised objections, initially to the project’s site in the park. Why, I wondered, in a city full of abandoned industrial buildings, could some of these not have been repurposed?My next objection was that if this weird and difficult design had been submitted by a young, inexperienced practice, it could well have been a disaster. It was lucky that it transpired to be Fujimoto, an architect with real skill in creating delicate, surprising and ethereal architecture.Spindly columns rise like saplings to support a kitsch canopy, its underside sparkling with 30,000 randomly tessellated spiky gold leaves intended to resemble autumn foliage. It is punctured by 100 tubes of anodised gold, funnelling yellow-tinged light down to ground level. It is quirky, eccentric and fun — though it’s unclear quite how well it will age.The interior wasn’t finished when I visited but the intent was clear: a series of exhibition galleries deep inside, and around them the glazed public spaces, the inhabitant always conscious of the park outside. Circulation is simple, revolving around the vortex of a spiral stair that sheds weight as it rises through the height of the building, from a dense concrete corkscrew to a delicate cantilevered construction. A lot of heavy engineering has gone into making this building look so effortless.The main concert hall is completely glazed, which you would think might be an acoustic nightmare but Nagata Acoustics (the firm that engineered Hamburg’s Elbphilharmonie and the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles) has ensured it works using a serrated glass wall. This has been done in New York, where the musicians at Jazz at Lincoln Center play against a backdrop of the city’s skyline. In Budapest, the set is the park, as it is for the whole building. There is a tradition of alfresco music in the long, hot Hungarian summers and this pavilion in the park will surely prove a popular venue.Perhaps partly to assuage residents’ fears about the scale of this development, the park itself has been completely reimagined. What was once a scruffy, dusty, neglected (though well-used) space is now a superb piece of green infrastructure. The playgrounds are as good as any I have seen, cycle and running routes have been carefully planned, planting completely transformed — something for those who might never visit a museum. Its site on a series of natural springs has been fully exploited, using the hot water to heat the buildings.It might look like a fey, whimsical structure in a park, but all architecture is political. Orban, in power since 2010, has sought to rebuild Hungary’s status, forging an identity at the vanguard of the culture wars, using populist nationalism and Christian rhetoric to depict himself as a defender of “European values”.The rebirth of the Varosliget, which will also include a vast, futuristic museum of ethnography, an odd design by local architects Napur, and a new national gallery by Japanese practice SANAA, has been criticised, notably by Budapest mayor Gergely Karacsony, as an unnecessary environmental burden.Hungary, though, has had an outsized impact on music, from composers Liszt to Ligeti via Bartok and Kodaly, but particularly on its pedagogy, the teaching of music through innovative, humane and intriguing techniques, and on attitudes to understanding music as a cultural and physical phenomenon. The part of this building that is devoted to teaching acknowledges this tradition. It also raises the spectre of the understanding of music as a tool for building a nationalist and political agenda. The historical exhibition here leans towards this notion of nationhood, but perhaps we can forgive that as pride in its huge cultural impact.This might well be a political project, an attempt to remake culture in a new image, but it has brought in international architects and animates a flagging neighbourhood. Sitting in the new concert hall, the audience will look out on to the backdrop of the Vajdahunyad, a fairytale castle from the original 1896 exhibition. Its gothic skyline was an attempt to coagulate Hungarian historical architecture into one proto-Disney landmark, an architectural distillation of the dream of a greater Hungary (then still a reality), of Transylvanian castles, gothic abbeys and Renaissance palaces. The styles may change, but whimsy, the sentimental picturesque and the politics remain.
167  The US and Russian foreign ministers ended the highest-level talks yet on Moscow’s security demands over Ukraine by agreeing to continue diplomacy, in comments suggesting the meeting had created a small window for detente amid heightened risks of a conflict at the heart of Europe.The meeting between Antony Blinken and Sergei Lavrov in Moscow on Friday was the latest diplomatic initiative designed to deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again.It came as Moscow clarified on Friday that it wants Nato to remove all its forces from Bulgaria, Romania and other ex-communist states in eastern Europe that joined the alliance after 1997 — a move deemed unacceptable by the transatlantic alliance.Blinken said Washington planned to share written security proposals with Russia next week, adding that the meeting had put the two countries on a “clearer path” to understanding each other’s concerns. President Joe Biden was “fully prepared” to hold a meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin if there were a belief that such a conversation would help find a breakthrough, he added.Lavrov “now has a better idea of our position and vice versa.and that’s precisely why we met”, Blinken told reporters after the talks, adding that both men “agreed it is important for the diplomatic process to continue”.Lavrov said Putin “was always prepared” to talk to Biden but said future talks would depend on “serious preparation”. The meeting with Blinken, which followed three rounds of lower-level negotiations Moscow deemed a failure last week, were “candid” and “useful” ahead of an expected written US response to Russia’s demands, he added.Russian state newswire RIA Novosti shortly after cited a foreign ministry source as saying Lavrov and Blinken might meet again next month after the US responds to Moscow’s security proposals.Western officials say Putin is closer than ever to a renewed invasion of Ukraine after amassing more than 106,000 troops close to its border in recent weeks. Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in 2014 and has since spearheaded a separatist war in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas border region, in which more than 14,000 people have died. Putin has vowed an unspecified “military-technical response” if the west does not agree to a series of security proposals.Lavrov on Friday dismissed warnings of a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine as “hysteria” and accused the west of encouraging Kyiv to “completely sabotage” a long-stalled peace agreement in Donbas.The US has sought to de-escalate tensions while warning of “crippling” sanctions in the case of any Russian aggression against Ukraine. But western unity frayed this week after Biden suggested a western response would depend on the scale of Russia’s intervention and France’s President Emmanuel Macron proposed separate European-led security talks with Moscow.Biden later clarified his comments by saying that Russia would “pay a heavy price” in the event of any incursion, while French officials insisted the Macron’s offer was not intended to undermine US-led negotiations.The US and its European allies have said Russia’s demands that Nato pledge never to admit Ukraine and to roll back the alliance’s eastward expansion — in essence rewriting the post-cold war security order — are unacceptable.Nato said: “Russia’s demands would create first and second-class Nato members, which we cannot accept.”“I can’t say whether we are on the right track or not,” Lavrov said on Friday. “We will understand that when we receive a written response to all of our proposals.”Biden on Friday held his first virtual summit with Japan’s prime minister Fumio Kishida, after which the White House said the leaders had agreed to work closely together to deter Russian aggression and co-ordinate “strong action in response to any attack”.Asked if Japan had agreed to join the US in imposing sanctions on Russia following any invasion, a senior US official said the leaders “did not get into the specifics about possible steps”. In Tokyo, Kishida did not respond directly to a question from reporters about whether Biden had asked him to join the US in taking measures against Russia.
168  Oil has rallied strongly in early 2022, surpassing a seven-year high this week as traders rushed to lock in supply on expectations of resurgent demand, patchy production and an unstable geopolitical landscape.Brent — the international crude oil benchmark — traded above $87 a barrel on Tuesday for the first time since 2014, rising as high as $89.50 on Thursday before trimming some of its gains.“People are just on high alert,” said Amrita Sen at consultancy Energy Aspects. “Anything that could remotely impact supply to downside or demand to the upside, the market is reacting.”The initial uptick came after Yemeni rebels claimed responsibility for a drone attack in the United Arab Emirates. The incident had no effect on oil output, but appeared to spook traders.Prices increased again after an explosion in Turkey briefly halted exports along a pipeline from Iraq’s Kurdish region. The febrile atmosphere has been stoked by the possibility of the US imposing sanctions on Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.Aided by those fillips, Brent futures have already added about 12 per cent in January, after an ascent of 50 per cent last year, as fears fade about the Omicron coronavirus variant significantly slowing down the global economic recovery.Now, some analysts are predicting that oil could surpass the $100 mark this year. Such a scenario would add fresh fuel to already rapid global inflation.US bank Goldman Sachs said this week that it expected Brent to reach $100 a barrel in the third quarter and to average $96 a barrel in 2022, rising to $105 in 2023. Energy Aspects is forecasting average prices of $85 a barrel in 2022 but $112 in 2023.Oil’s price surge has been underpinned by a view among some industry analysts that supply will tighten as the worldwide economy continues to rebound, leaving limited spare capacity to meet any future shortfall.Producer group Opec, led by Saudi Arabia and its allies, including Russia, have committed to replacing the output it cut at the start of the pandemic by a combined 400,000 barrels a day every month throughout 2022.But since that agreement was reached in July, few countries other than Saudi Arabia and the UAE have managed to hit their contribution to the monthly uplift consistently.In December, Opec+ increased output by only 250,000 b/d, according to the International Energy Agency, after Nigeria, Angola and Malaysia all underproduced. Russia also pumped less than its quota for the first time since the 2020 cuts were introduced.December’s shortfall means that the group is producing 790,000 b/d less than it planned to at this stage, the IEA said in its latest monthly oil report, released this week.The US and other large oil consumers have repeatedly called on the Opec+ group to boost supply faster. But even if they agreed to lift the monthly target, technical and operational issues in several countries mean the group would probably continue to fall short.“In reality Opec+ don’t have the spare capacity that they claim to have on paper,” said Sen.With global demand expected to return to pre-pandemic levels of approximately 100m b/d in 2022, there are questions about the availability of spare capacity to cover any operational or geopolitical disruption to current supply levels.Historically, economists and policymakers have argued in favour of maintaining spare capacity — often defined as additional production that can be brought online in 30 days and sustained for 90 days — of approximately 5 per cent of global oil supply, to avoid price volatility.Current estimates of the amount of additional production available vary. The IEA forecasts that spare capacity could shrink from about 5m b/d to below 3m b/d by the second half of the year, with most of that held in Saudi Arabia and the UAE.Goldman Sachs forecasts that it will fall further, predicting that Opec+ spare capacity will reach “historically low levels this summer” of about 1.2m b/d.Spare capacity is of particular concern because global oil inventories have fallen well below pre-pandemic levels after the US, Europe and Japan made large draws on their stocks. Across OECD countries, inventory levels are at their lowest level since 2000, according to Goldman Sachs.“It is quite rational to assume that there could be a disruption of 1m b/d,” said Damien Courvalin, head of energy research at the US investment bank. “That’s at least half of your spare capacity so then you really have zero buffer left.”Some analysts are less worried. “It’s perceptions of capacity constraints [but] we don’t actually think there are capacity constraints,” said Paul Horsnell, commodities strategist at Standard Chartered, adding that he believed there was sufficient spare capacity in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and the UAE to cover most scenarios this year.Standard Chartered is predicting a supply crunch, driven by rising demand and insufficient production growth — particularly outside Opec — but not until 2024. It has forecast average prices for Brent of $75 a barrel in 2022 and $77 in 2023.Sen at Energy Aspects also anticipates a supply crunch in 2024 but believes it has started. “We’ve been talking about a supply crunch from 2022 to 2025 for some time now,” she said. “It’s a function of the lack of spare capacity and lack of investment that has been made worse by Covid because demand has recovered quicker in some ways.”During previous commodity cycles, today’s high prices would have resulted in investment that would boost supply and rebalance the market. But pressure to reduce dependence on oil and gas is limiting such spending, particularly at the publicly listed supermajors.“Even at these prices, which are giving such high returns, [companies] are effectively prioritising [environmental, social and governance],” said Sen. “If investment doesn’t go up now it never will.”
169  Three Baltic countries are sending anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine as a group of European countries try to help Kyiv defend itself better against potential Russian aggression.The move, which follows a British dispatch this week of anti-tank weapons to Kyiv, highlights a split among European powers about whether to arm Ukraine and risk provoking Moscow.Estonia was providing Ukraine with Javelin anti-tank weapons while Latvia and Lithuania were sending Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and other equipment including thermal sights after receiving permission from the US, the three countries’ defence ministers said on Friday.“Let’s face it: the war in Ukraine is ongoing and it is important to support Ukraine in every way we can so that they can resist the aggressor,” Kalle Laanet, Estonia’s defence minister, said.Dmitry Peskov, spokesperson for Russian president Vladimir Putin, said this week that western arms supplies to Ukraine were “extremely dangerous and do nothing to reduce tensions”.There is not a consensus among European countries over sending arms to Ukraine. Germany, notably, is refusing to do so, leaving the UK and the three Baltic countries to lead the way with pledges of equipment.Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, reiterated on Friday that his country’s government “has a very clear position” on arms exports. “That position is.that we have not supported the export of lethal weapons out of Germany,” he told reporters, adding this was a stance that had been held by successive governments for years.Kyiv last month complained about Berlin blocking the supply of arms through Nato’s procurement agency.Britain this week flew some 2,000 short-range anti-tank missiles to Kyiv and is providing 30 specialist troops to train Ukrainian forces how to use them. The Czech government is proposing to send artillery shells.A state department spokesperson confirmed that Washington had authorised “third party transfers” from US allies including Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to “provide US origin equipment from their inventories for use by Ukraine”. The spokesperson added that the US was also expediting up to $60m in “lethal and non-lethal equipment” from the Pentagon’s own stocks and had authorised up to $200m in funds to provide emergency support for Ukraine’s defence.Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, said on Friday that Washington had in the past year provided $650m of security assistance to Ukraine. “We’re continuing to provide that assistance. We have additional deliveries that are scheduled in the coming weeks,” he said.Since 2014, Washington has provided drones, Javelin anti-tank missiles and armoured vehicles. It has also approved sales of patrol boats, including weapons and electronic systems. The new equipment sent is expected to include anti-tank missiles, ammunition and other equipment.Moscow was enraged last year when Ukrainian forces used a Turkish-supplied Bayraktar drone to strike against a artillery position of Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas region.Ukraine’s defence ministry said on Thursday it was receiving “unprecedented” military assistance from its allies in the face of pressure from Moscow.Analysts have warned that the kind of weaponry provided in recent weeks would be unlikely to make a decisive difference in a full-scale war with Russia, particularly given Russia air superiority and long-range missiles. Kyiv has previously appealed for more sophisticated kit, including air defence, electronic warfare and cyber defence systems.The Baltic states have consistently sounded the alarm over Russia’s actions since its invasion of Georgia in 2008, and have intensified the warnings ever since Moscow’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Members of Nato, the three Baltic countries have troops from the US, UK, Germany and other countries present on their territory to help with air defence and deter Russia.Arvydas Anušauskas, Lithuania’s defence minister, said on Friday: “We sincerely hope that Ukraine will not need to use the weapons being handed over. The Baltic states urge Russia to cease its aggressive and irresponsible behaviour.”Artis Pabriks, Latvia’s defence and deputy prime minister, said: “I strongly urge Russia to de-escalate situation at the border with Ukraine and respect its sovereignty.”
170  The head of the IMF said that the global economy would have to navigate an “obstacle course” this year with the ongoing pandemic and geopolitical tensions deepening a global inflation problem.Speaking on Friday at the virtual World Economic Forum held instead of the normal in-person gathering at Davos, Kristalina Georgieva warned that the outlook for the global economy this year would be far from smooth.“[The year] 2022 is like navigating an obstacle course,” the fund’s managing director said. “We anticipate the [global] recovery to continue but it is losing some momentum and it is faced with the renewal of [Covid-19] infections.much more persistent than anticipated inflation and.record high debt levels.”With an eye to the worsening tensions between Russia and Ukraine, Georgieva said that many of the causes of inflation were not simply explained by levels of spending and demand being too high compared with global supply capacity.Commenting that inflation was not just a problem that central bankers could fix, the IMF head added that “the pressure on prices comes from food prices shooting up [caused] to a certain degree because of [the] climate. and energy prices shooting up, and this is a very complicated story in which there is also an element of geopolitical tensions”.Georgieva said the US Federal Reserve was “acting responsibly” in its tightening of monetary policy, and was balancing the need to fight rising prices and protect the recovery at a time when “inflation in the US is turning into an economic and social concern”.However, higher US interest rates would hit some countries, especially those with high levels of dollar denominated debt, which “could throw cold water on what for some countries is already a weak recovery”.Georgieva urged them to act quickly. “If you have currency mismatches, now is the moment to address them,” she said.Noting China’s slowing economy, Georgieva said this was a concern for the rest of the world in 2022 and that Beijing should think about both loosening policy to encourage growth and whether its zero-Covid policy was still optimal given the more contagious Omicron variant.“What Omicron is teaching all of us is that it is a highly transmittable variant of Covid and may be much more difficult to contain without a dramatic impact on the economy and our view is that this has to be taken into account,” she said.“We will see how China integrates this message, both in terms of the policies they apply but also in terms of how they advance on the direction of what are the vaccines that are most effective and how that would be integrated [into] China’s [policies to control infections].”The IMF will publish its latest forecasts for the global economy on Tuesday next week.
171  My chief difficulty with most remedies to the Ukraine crisis is that they start by boarding a time-machine to correct long-ago events. This gives their solutions a theological air, which address the world as it should have been not as it is. Very few of us wish to see conflict between the US and Russia, which together account for more than 90 per cent of the world’s nuclear stockpile (I won’t list those I suspect are exceptions as they don’t deserve attention. Oh, alright then: John Bolton). That leaves almost everyone else. The dove-ish types cite a 1990 verbal undertaking that the then US secretary of State, James Baker, gave to Mikhail Gorbachev that Nato would not expand an inch eastward if the two Germanies reunited. Everything that followed, notably Nato’s expansion to include 14 former Soviet states and Warsaw Pact countries over the following years, was thus a betrayal. This may be the case. But it tells us little about how to act now. Moreover, Gorbachev really should have insisted on putting that oral pledge in writing. Lots of statesmen say lots of things in the moment. Are we to believe that had Baker not given that undertaking the USSR would have fought a war to stop German unification? Hard to believe.The Russia hawks have their own Tardis which transports them to the infamous 2008 Nato Summit in Bucharest. That was the meeting in which Georgia and Ukraine were promised Nato membership in the distant future when the leopard lies down with the kids etc. This was the cardinal sin that elevated the Russian threat to the two fledgling republics without offering them additional security. Mohandas Gandhi would have called it a postdated check on a failing bank. According to the hawks, had Georgia and Ukraine been admitted there and then, the Russia threats we face today would not be happening. I also find that hard to believe. My guess is that their admission in 2008 would have provoked a full-scale showdown between Russia and Nato. As it happens, the same thing has been taking place in slow motion. Russia nibbled off parts of Georgia a few weeks later then grabbed a chunk of Ukraine in 2014. We are now entering the third, potentially far deadlier phase. At any rate, both the doves and the hawks start with alleged original sins that cannot be corrected.I have one suggestion, which at this point has only slightly better odds than a long-shot: Ukraine should be persuaded to become a neutral buffer state. I get here by process of elimination. Letting Russia ride roughshod over a sovereign state is unacceptable, though some argue we should permit Moscow its sphere of interest, just as the US has always had its own in the western hemisphere. That is a repugnant option. But so too is reckless talk of direct western conflict with Russia, which could threaten all of us. For an alarming example of Washington war talk, read this. The likelier outcome is that Ukraine will descend into a quagmire in which the west funds a bloody Ukrainian resistance to an intensifying Russian incursion that directly occupies Donbas and spreads westward by means covert and overt. The west offers little match for Putin’s skill with active measures. Sweden and Finland join Nato. The US bulks up its military presence in Poland and the Baltics. Ukraine turns into a giant proxy theatre for the new conflict between Russia and the west.We would be naive to think Putin will be deterred by the threat of economic sanctions. As my colleagues Max Seddon and Polina Ivanova reported, Russia has built up a large sovereign wealth fund fuelled by higher oil and gas prices and has diversified Russia’s central bank reserves away from the US dollar (almost a fifth is now in Chinese renminbi). This is a country that survived the siege of Leningrad and the battle for Stalingrad. It can take economic pain. Can we stomach the higher gas prices that are coming? Biden’s inflation antenna suggests we have limited appetite.Which leaves us with a diplomatic grand bargain. Here is not the place to sketch out possible sequencing and linkages required of such creative diplomacy. I am just flagging the urgent need for it. Ultimately, of course, Ukraine cannot be forced to become a buffer state. It has to want it. Rana, do you have a fourth option? I assume you would also rule out both capitulation and war and are hoping for a modus vivendi that lies somewhere between.Ed, I’m no expert in Ukrainian politics, but my gut is that you are absolutely right that a 2008 Nato admission for Georgia and Ukraine would have simply quickened what we are seeing now, and that this a powder keg that is going to blow soon, an event for which Nato has no real plan. I like the idea of Ukraine as a buffer state, in part because my limited understanding (from one trip there) is that while there are some Ukrainians who want to be more tightly aligned with the west, there are also plenty that identify culturally and politically with Russia. A bad combo for a country that could become the centre of a proxy war.The part of this Note that interests me most (and which frankly I know the most about) is the Russian move into rmb. This has been happening for a while, and is part of what might be called a new Great Game in global currency, which is part of the larger political game you refer to. China wants to bring all the countries within its political orbit into a new currency system that would not only bolster Beijing, but diminish the dollar. If the dollar is no longer the sole global reserve, America’s room to manoeuvre in everything from, say, putting sanctions on rogue nations like Russia or Iran, to managing its own debt load, comes under pressure. As does its global influence. This is, to my mind, a much more serious risk over the midterm (say 5-10 years) than most people think. I’ve written multiple times about the massive market implications of a post dollar world. The political implications are even bigger.If I were Europe, I would be preparing for this paradigm shift, which is coming over years or decades in any case thanks to the rise of all kinds of sovereign digital currency, by getting a new energy policy. It’s insane how vulnerable Europe is to Russian petropolitics, as evidenced by the fact that energy prices are the largest driver of inflation in the EU. And if I were in the White House, I’d be looking to work with Germany (which has often hedged its bets between China/Russia and the US) to come up with a new vision for what the 21st century transatlantic economic and security partnership should look like. A bipolar world is more stable than a tripolar one.
172  Erik Webb Dempsey, a 53-year-old originally from Atlanta, Georgia, moved to Prague nearly 30 years ago and still hasn’t tired of the Czech capital. “It’s simply the most beautiful city I’ve ever been to. The view of Prague Castle from the Charles Bridge is breathtaking day or night.”Beyond its architectural charms, “the standard of living is very high”, he says, citing the city’s long record of low unemployment and its excellent public transport; “you don’t need a car”. Dempsey, who is chief financial officer at The Julius hotel, owns a four-bedroom, 125 sq m flat in Liben in Prague 8, 5km from the city centre. Similar flats in the area sell for €600,000-€875,000.Since the pandemic began, residential life in Prague’s city centre has also taken on a new appeal. The city’s notorious stag-party scene has been a Covid casualty. One Prague-based stag tour company, called Pissup Tours, reports an 80 per cent drop in British customers, its main customer base, since March 2020.The Airbnb market has been in hibernation. Of Prague’s 650,000 apartments, 14,077 were available for short-term let on Airbnb in July 2019, according to Inside Airbnb data. In mid-July 2021, there were just 7,000 — and only 10 per cent had been rented out in the previous three months (compared with 60 per cent during the same period in 2019).The same period has signalled changes to Prague’s cultural and culinary scenes. Foster + Partners and David Chipperfield are among 20 architects vying to design a new CZK6.1bn (€251m) concert hall in the regenerating Holesovice district, just across the River Vltava from central Prague 1.And new restaurant openings are bringing a more global choice to the city, according to another American expat, 40-year-old Luke Bodenschatz, who works in hotel management. “We also take our beer very seriously here and there is a thriving scene of new breweries,” he says.The result? Rather than being overrun by tourists (2019 saw a historic high of 8m visitors, which fell to 1.4m in 2021, according to Prague City Tourism), “the city has been cleaned up and it feels much more like it belongs to the people who live there,” says Prokop Svoboda, managing partner at Svoboda & Williams estate agency. The shift is driving a new appetite for city-centre living.Many potential buyers want to try living in the centre while it’s still relatively quiet, he says: “Prague 1 was always more popular among expats, but the pandemic has changed this.” For local workers, unaffordability has been an issue. According to analysis by the developer Central Group, in Prague an average 70 sq m new flat costs 15.9 times the average salary. “People resent the fact they can’t afford to buy property,” says Svoboda.For renters, however, the pandemic opened a brief window of affordability. During lockdown, many Airbnb landlords put their flats on the long-term lettings market instead, leading to a surplus of stock.“In 2020, you could rent small apartments near the historic Old Town Square for about CZK13,000 (€535) a month, which is what you would pay for an apartment on the outskirts of Prague and half the usual Old Town price,” says Denisa Visnovska, a partner at Lexxus estate agency. Singles and couples took advantage of the low rates.Demand was tempered, however, by prospective tenants’ fears that a return of the tourist market would prompt landlords to terminate long leases in favour of more profitable holiday rentals. And now rental prices are returning to pre pandemic levels, Visnovska says.Demand is now overtaking supply again, with 25 per cent fewer flats for sale in the first half of 2021 than the previous year, according to a market report by Svoboda & Williams. Housing stock for sale has also decreased in traditionally sought-after locations such as Dejvice, Bubenec and Karlin.“People aren’t selling,” says Svoboda, whose agency reports prime resale price rises of 10.7 per cent in H1 2021 year on year, and 8.7 per cent rises for prime new-build in that period. Based on sold prices, the average apartment price in Prague rose by 3.9 per cent between Q3 and Q4 2021 to CZK110,000 (€4,530) per sq m, according to Deloitte.“Relatively few can afford to own their own home in Prague, which is adding to the increasing willingness to rent,” says Svoboda. His agency says that for the first time, the majority of clients in the prime CZK55,000+ a month market are locals.They include “high-ranking managers” seeking three or four-bedroom apartments for CZK70,000-CZK100,000 a month, says Jan Kolar, lead broker at Czech Republic Sotheby’s International Realty.Along with the price of beer, affordability of housing is forever a hot topic in Prague. And as long as tourist numbers remain subdued, the desirability of city centre living will remain high, says Svoboda. “We think this breathing space will last for a while longer. It’s making the centre of Prague more attractive — and it’s driving property prices up.”
173  The writer was US Director of Central Intelligence (1991-93) and Secretary of Defense (2006-11)Europe and the US wait anxiously to see if Russian president Vladimir Putin will give the order to invade Ukraine. For years, western statesmen and commentators have puzzled over what makes Putin tick.After Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014, then US secretary of state John Kerry complained: “You just don’t in the 21st century behave in the 19th-century fashion by invading another country on a completely trumped-up pretext.” Others have called Putin’s aggressive policies “inexplicable” and bound to lead to a “quagmire”. Yet, here we are in early 2022 waiting for Putin to call the shot.I believe his actions, however deplorable, are understandable. Almost everything Putin does at home and abroad is rooted in the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, which for him marked the collapse of the four-century-old Russian empire and Russia’s position as a great power.Internally, the Soviet collapse and subsequent period of “reform” led to chaos, lawlessness, poverty and a dramatic weakening of the central government at the hands of both oligarchs and regional authorities. Since becoming president in 1999, Putin’s objectives have been straightforward: to restore and expand central government authority (not to mention enhancing his personal dominance and wealth), and to return Russia to its historical role as a major power. In short, authoritarianism at home and aggression abroad.The restoration of Russia’s role as a great power began with a return to its historical policy of creating a buffer of subservient states on the periphery — the so-called near abroad. Putin’s embrace of this strategy of securing the near abroad is seen in his actions in Belarus, Moldova, Transnistria, Georgia, the 2020 Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, Kazakhstan and, most dramatically, Ukraine.He has no desire to recreate the Soviet Union — he does not want to be responsible for the problems of former Soviet republics. What Putin wants is subservience, and for those now-independent states to bend the knee to Moscow — and to be a bulwark against the west and democracy.Former US national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski observed that without Ukraine, there can be no Russian empire. Putin fears a Ukraine that is economically and politically orientated towards the west with an ever-closer security relationship with the US and other members of Nato — even if it is not a member of the alliance. He regards that as a critical security risk and, just as bad, an alternative economic and political model likely to be increasingly attractive to Russians — a dagger pointed at the heart of Russia.Putin seems determined, therefore, to take whatever measures he deems necessary either to destabilise and bring down the current western-orientated government of Ukraine or to try to seize the country by military force.Putin’s restoration of Russia as a great power has also involved significantly strengthening the country’s military capabilities, as well as pursuing an aggressive foreign policy, especially in the Middle East and Africa. He sees the US as the primary enemy and is determined to do whatever he can to exacerbate American tensions at home, disrupt relationships with our allies even as he interferes in their internal affairs, and weaken the US position internationally. In these endeavours, he has enjoyed an increasingly close partnership and commonality of purpose with the Chinese.Because of Russia’s stunted economy, demographic challenges and other weaknesses at home, Putin has dealt himself a poor hand — but until now he has played it rather skilfully. He has received a great deal of unintended help from the US. Our domestic divisions and near-paralysis in Congress, our perceived withdrawal from the Middle East and, more broadly, from our six-decade-long global leadership role, and ignominious scuttling out of Afghanistan — together these have led many countries to hedge their bets and develop closer economic, political and security ties with both Russia and China.Putin’s problem is that, as dictators are wont to do, he has overplayed his hand. His aggressive threats against Ukraine have galvanised Nato and reaffirmed its clarity of purpose. His menacing policies have made Ukrainians even more anti-Russian and driven the country further into the arms of the west. Any Russian military action will result in Ukrainian resistance as well as larger Nato military deployments on Russia’s western border, potential suspension of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and painful economic sanctions.Moscow has deployed some 100,000 troops to the borders of Ukraine. What now? Putin finds himself in a situation where Russian success is defined as either a change of government in Kyiv (with the successor aligned with Moscow) or conquest of the country. The 18th-century French diplomat Talleyrand is meant to have said: “You can do anything you like with bayonets except sit on them.” Putin must use those troops soon or face the humiliation of withdrawing them without achieving anything except pushing Ukraine closer to the west. In either case, he has placed himself in a difficult position at home and abroad. The US and its allies must do what they can to exacerbate his difficulties.Letter in response to this article:West may provide Putin with the enemy he needs / From Richard Watson, Sacramento, CA, US
174  Liz Truss, UK foreign secretary, has called for liberal governments to “face down global aggressors” in a highly charged speech aimed at Russia and China.Truss said Moscow and Beijing have been “emboldened in a way we haven’t seen since the cold war”, in an address at the Lowy Institute, a Sydney-based think-tank, following talks with her Australian counterpart.Truss and Ben Wallace, UK defence secretary, are in Sydney for discussions with the Australian government over closer security ties following the signing of the Aukus deal last year. The pact between London, Canberra and Washington was designed to enable Australia to obtain nuclear-powered submarines as part of an effort to counteract an increasingly assertive China.Truss and Marise Payne, Australia’s foreign minister, signed an agreement on Thursday to co-operate on combating cyber security threats and boosting infrastructure investment to bolster stability in the Indo-Pacific region.Truss used her speech to demand that Russian president Vladimir Putin step back from a possible conflict with Ukraine “before he makes a massive strategic mistake”.Moscow has massed more than 100,000 troops on its border with Ukraine and western allies including the US have warned that Putin may be planning an invasion. Russia has denied any such intentions.“Invasion will only lead to a terrible quagmire and loss of life, as we know from the Soviet-Afghan war and conflict in Chechnya,” Truss said.She also argued for stronger alliances between countries including Australia, the UK, Japan, India, Indonesia and Israel to curtail the growing power of “global aggressors”.“They seek to export dictatorship as a service around the world. That is why regimes like Belarus, North Korea and Myanmar find their closest allies in Moscow and Beijing,” she said.At a press conference alongside Wallace and Payne, as well as Peter Dutton, Australia’s defence minister, Truss sought to further justify the need for alliances such as Aukus.She cited China’s “economic coercion” against Australia and Lithuania, Russia’s military “aggression” and Iran’s attempts to secure a nuclear weapon as challenges that required protection of trade routes and strengthening of security in the region.Payne backed the comments, saying “unbridled aggression” by authoritarian governments should not be tolerated by liberal democracies.China hit back at the criticism, saying the UK and Australia had exaggerated the “so-called Chinese threat”.“China is firmly opposed to this, and the parties concerned should immediately stop the wrongdoing of creating division and provoking confrontation,” said ‍Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson for the foreign ministry.Wallace said that “nothing is off the table”, when asked if Britain could establish a military base in Australia.The UK foreign secretary’s strongly worded speech, which quoted Margaret Thatcher, was delivered as Boris Johnson battles to remain prime minister in the face of domestic controversies and a revolt among Conservative party MPs.Truss has been tipped as a potential contender to replace Johnson should he stand down following an inquiry into the so-called Partygate scandal, which involved a series of Downing Street events that allegedly broke coronavirus restrictions.She reiterated in Sydney that she supported Johnson “100 per cent” and wanted him to remain in the job.
175  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.A flurry of last-minute security meetings are taking place in an attempt to convince Russia to refrain from invading Ukraine: US secretary of state Antony Blinken will meet his Russian counterpart in Geneva today after having travelled to Ukraine and Berlin, where he held a so-called quad meeting with the UK, France and Germany. We’ll look at the latest news and why prospects for a diplomatic solution are rather gloomy.Today marks the deadline for Brussels’ taxonomy consultation and the independent experts who advise on the rules have delivered a stinging assessment of the European Commission’s inclusion of nuclear and gas. The FT has the scoop.In tech regulatory news, the commission yesterday published its findings into a sectoral inquiry about the Internet of Things. We’ll unpack the findings and what this means for future competition probes and regulation.Speaking of tech, the EU’s ambition to quadruple its own production to reach 20 per cent of global chip manufacturing by 2030 was on display at the World Economic Forum yesterday, with commission president Ursula von der Leyen announcing an EU Chips Act for early February. The proposals will include changing the bloc’s state-aid rules to allow subsidies for EU-based production facilities “that benefit all of Europe”. (Looking at you, Intel.)And in anti-corruption news, the European Public Prosecutor’s Office in Luxembourg yesterday brought its first case to trial in Bulgaria — involving bribery in relation to EU farming subsidies.Eight days after Russia’s foreign ministry declared talks with the US and Nato over averting war in Ukraine and wider issues of European security to be a pointless “dead end”, Russia’s foreign minister is in Geneva to talk to his US counterpart. It seems we are giving peace a chance, again, writes Henry Foy in Brussels.The bad news is that when Sergei Lavrov and Antony Blinken sit down today the risk of conflict appears higher than a week ago. In that time, Russia has increased its military deployment close to the Ukrainian border to 106,000 troops and bolstered them with missiles that can hit Kyiv and infrastructure that experts say is to support a potential invasion. Joe Biden, US president, was blunt on Wednesday, saying that he expected Russia to “move in” and stage an attack.What exactly the two men can say to each other to break a deadlock that endured over more than 10 hours of talks in two formats between US and Russian negotiators in the same city 11 days ago is unclear. The US and Nato have rejected Russia’s core demands of banning Ukraine from the alliance and restricting military deployments in eastern member states, while Russia has dismissed western counterproposals for talks on limits on missiles and exercises.“These are difficult issues we’re facing. Resolving them won’t happen quickly. I certainly don’t expect we’ll solve them in Geneva tomorrow,” Blinken said during a visit to Berlin yesterday. “But we can advance our mutual understanding. And that, combined with de-escalation of Russia’s military build-up on Ukraine’s borders, that can turn us away from this crisis in the weeks ahead.”The stop in Berlin — after visiting Kyiv — came at a good time. It allowed the US’s top diplomat to reaffirm Europe and the US were “speaking and acting together with one voice when it comes to Russia” after a meeting with ministers from Germany, France and the UK.That remark took on added significance after Biden’s comments on Wednesday that a “minor incursion” by Russia would prompt US allies to “fight about what to do and what not to do”, and a pitch a few hours earlier by France’s President Emmanuel Macron for Europe to open its own channel of negotiations with Russia.Both those statements sparked alarm among EU and Nato members — and in Biden’s case, in Ukraine — before being clarified by their respective administrations. But you can be sure Lavrov’s team took good note of the potential for division.Lavrov’s spokesperson said the talks in Geneva would “evaluate the results of the negotiations” that took place last week with the US, Nato and OSCE members — negotiations that Russia has said were devoid of results. If they agree to talk about more issues, that would already be considered progress.In total, Russia has deployed more than 106,000 troops to sites close to the Ukrainian border, according to western and Ukrainian officials. The forces include between 55 and 60 battalion tactical groups, which are highly mobile and strategically independent assault units. (More here.)How prepared is the EU in case Russia invades Ukraine?

She said: “We are confident that the sector inquiry’s findings will provide guidance on the commission’s future enforcement and regulatory activity. We are also hopeful that it will stimulate companies to proactively address those concerns.”She described the sector as having “high barriers to entry” with small players concerned about how Big Tech is amassing huge swaths of data.Here are the main concerns when it comes to voice assistants:
176  An EU proposal to label nuclear power and some natural gas as sources of green energy has come under fire from experts hired by Brussels to help draw up the sustainable investment rules.The group of scientists want Brussels to amend its “taxonomy on sustainable finance” to limit use of gas and nuclear energy or risk undermining EU climate goals.Environmentalists and some member states have already criticised the EU over the draft plan, which will allow nuclear energy and some forms of natural gas to be considered as sustainable for decades. The designation is part of rules designed to guide investment into green activities.In a document seen by the Financial Times, the expert group that has helped to design the taxonomy over the past three years wants Brussels to deny a green label to electricity produced from natural gas that produces more than 100 grammes of CO2 per kilowatt hour. That is compared with more than 550kg/kW of capacity annually over 20 years allowed in the draft. Natural gas has a lower carbon footprint than coal but still produces CO2. It can qualify for the green label if it is used to switch from coal.The stance will heap pressure on Brussels to amend the taxonomy in the face of a scientific and political backlash. The feedback will be sent to the European Commission on Friday as part of a consultation between Brussels, member states and experts on the rules. The text is due to be finalised this month.Nuclear power and some forms of natural gas were included in the draft taxonomy late last year after Brussels was put under severe pressure from some EU governments that wanted to avoid key sources of energy being penalised. They included France, among Europe’s most pro-nuclear countries, and gas-dependent states in eastern Europe.In the commission’s draft, nuclear power, which has no carbon footprint but produces toxic waste with radiation risks, is considered as sustainable as long as countries can prove they can safely dispose of the waste. New nuclear power permits can be granted until 2045.The experts say the inclusion of nuclear energy contravenes the principle of “do no significant harm”, which is vital in ensuring eligibility for the green label. The document demands “substantial changes” to the text in order to ensure that new nuclear power stations contribute to the EU’s climate targets.The experts add that in its current form, the taxonomy would “not be suitable” in helping to classify sustainable finance products.The scientific criticism will embolden anti-nuclear countries such as Austria and Luxembourg, which have vowed to sue the commission at the European Court of Justice if the taxonomy is approved in its current form.Despite vocal criticism from some corners, the draft is almost certain to be approved as it requires a super-majority of member states and MEPs to reject it. EU legislators cannot propose their own amendments.France, Europe’s biggest nuclear power, has been instrumental in demanding that nuclear technology is given the sustainable label. French president Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday said the inclusion of nuclear “was in line with the protection against climate change”.
177  Diplomats from the US and Russia have shuttled across Europe for security talks over Ukraine but military analysts have had their eye on more ominous movements: the further deployment by Moscow of arms and personnel around its border with its southern neighbour.Russia has bolstered its military presence on the border with Ukraine while engaging in weeks of diplomatic talks, with a series of deployments that western officials and analysts say could indicate preparations for a renewed invasion.After Moscow’s lead negotiator said discussions last week with the US and Nato had hit a “dead end”, Russia moved additional units to the Ukraine border from the country’s far east and reinforced existing deployments within striking distance of Kyiv.In total, Russia has deployed more than 106,000 troops to sites close to the border, according to western and Ukrainian officials. The forces include between 55 and 60 battalion tactical groups, which are highly mobile and strategically independent assault units.Russia’s military posture showed “they could initiate a conflict within a matter of weeks rather than months”, said Michael Kofman, a senior research scientist at CNA, a Washington-based think-tank. “They sent quite a few units [.] before any conversations even took place. So clearly they weren’t betting very much on diplomatic success.the likelihood of war has increased considerably in the last week.”Russian officials deny they are planning to attack Ukraine but have threatened an unspecified “military-technical response” if their demands for Nato to halt its eastward expansion — which would essentially rewrite Europe’s post-cold war security order — go unmet.Ruslan Pukhov, director of Moscow defence think-tank Cast, said Russian president Vladimir Putin had turned to the threat of invasion after losing other avenues of influence in Ukraine. These include the collapse of Normandy format talks brokered by France and Germany last autumn, as well as Kyiv’s moves against a leading pro-Russian MP and three TV channels close to him the previous winter.“What are the tools Russia and Putin have apart from coercive diplomacy and direct military intervention?” Pukhov said.The White House continues to mount a diplomatic effort to deter Russia from a renewed invasion of Ukraine by threatening sanctions in response to any aggression and by continuing talks with Moscow about its security proposals.But US and Nato officials have said they consider as unacceptable Russia’s big demand that the alliance pledge never to admit Ukraine, leading President Joe Biden to admit on Wednesday that he expected Putin to “move in” on Ukraine.Officials and analysts say Moscow is already well prepared.In addition to troops, tanks and other weaponry, since the end of December Russia has begun moving ammunition stockpiles, field hospitals and supporting security services to sites close to the border. According to western intelligence officials, these deployments suggest an invasion is being prepared.“They have enough on the border in terms of quantity and quality and capability to conduct a range of activities. That could be as small as a military intimidation, a raid, a strike [or] all the way up to more muscular options,” one senior western intelligence official said.“But if they really intend a full-scale invasion with the intent of taking and holding territory, then the consensus is that they would need more troops than currently deployed.”That is especially so, the official added, as “the signs are that the Ukrainians are not going to buckle, even under a pretty punishing air and ballistic missile attack. That they will try to hunker down and then once it is over, stand and fight against whoever comes in.”In recent weeks, Russia has deployed 36 Iskander missile launchers close to the border, which are capable of hitting Kyiv.Moscow has also moved some tank landing ships south to the Black Sea, while its existing air bases near the border mean large numbers of strike aircraft and combat helicopters can reach Ukraine without being relocated.“The scope of these capabilities that they are bringing in is concerning,” the senior western intelligence official said.Meanwhile, Russia has dispatched separate forces to conduct joint military exercises in Belarus, which borders Ukraine. The units involve Russian S-400 and Pantsir air missile defence systems, which western officials say could be used to deter any Ukrainian allies from reconnaissance or support operations during an invasion.A full land invasion could entail Russia seizing as much as two-thirds of Ukraine’s territory by deploying troops from the eastern border, Belarus, Crimea and the Black Sea, Kofman said.“The big question is, will they look to conduct regime change and then a settlement? Or are they actually intending on partitioning Ukraine?” he added.Instead of a full invasion, Russia might opt to destabilise Ukraine with paramilitary attacks, hybrid actions and cyber attacks, such as the one last week that took down about 70 Ukrainian government websites and was widely attributed to Russia.It could also achieve many of its potential military goals through devastating air strikes, Pukhov said.“Even from Russian territory, it would be rather easy to smash the Ukrainian armed forces, especially if you don’t do a massive land operation — you use high precision weapons and other tools, which we [the Russians] have and Ukraine doesn’t.”Letter in response to this article:Sleeping on the job is encouraged in Russia / From Mergen Mongush, Moscow, Russia
178  “There is no band. Il n’est pas de orquestra! This is all a tape-recording.” David Lynch’s bizarre, unsettling movie Mulholland Drive sees its two female protagonists enter the mysterious “Club Silencio”, a literal theatre of the absurd in which everything appears in the kind of vivid, memorable, illogic of a dream.The sinister multilingual MC, the overwrought cabaret singer, the miming trumpeter, each is a strange figment of the central character’s reimagining of her own life and, of course, of the unsettlingly dark mind of Lynch himself.Exactly a decade after the 2001 release of the movie, Lynch created a Silencio in our own parallel universe, a seductively cool, surreal nightclub six flights of stairs below the streets of Paris’s rue de Montmartre. Open till sunrise, it became a cult success, a super-cool late-night hang-out with a throbbing beat and shadowy retreats in vaults and dreamy side-rooms. Its bathrooms had light-framed mirrors that made your irises look strange.Now Assembly, the French hospitality group behind the club, is back with a new Silencio, a brasserie and cinema in Saint-Germain-des-Prés. It occupies the site of a former movie theatre haunted by the ghosts of the Left Bank culturati, including one-time regulars Jean-Paul Belmondo and François Truffaut.It sits one block along from Les Deux Magots, the café once frequented by Camus, Sartre, de Beauvoir et al and which has become a hang-out for tourists and would-be existentialists. I sense a little nervousness in the new Silencio’s proprietor Arnaud Frisch as he chats to me languidly at a corner table over a perfect ice-cool martini. He explains his profound awareness of the history of the site and the neighbourhood — the movies, the stars, the fact that this was the last independent cinema in the quartier, that very French cultural legacy. But at the same time he is trying carefully to avoid becoming a part of the intellectual heritage industry.So the cinema downstairs is sparse, an intimate room with rows of basic seats (rather than the bloated popcorn and soda-holding behemoths of the big chains). At the end of the picture the screen rises to reveal a bar behind. Here, tacked on to the orange and cream walls, between the cheesy vinyl-upholstered corner counter and the pot plants, are a few framed black and white snaps of moody former customers, directors and impossibly glamorous surfers of the Nouvelle Vague.The restaurant too is defined by its oddly retro, time-slipping vibe. If Lynch’s original lair was a weird, throbbing dream of subterranea which seemed to interconnect, at least in the mind, with the city’s famous catacombs (in fact the basement was where Zola’s “J’Accuse.!” was first printed), this new space is a more urbane, more restrained setting. In a city reinventing its restaurant scene, Silencio is positioned sometime in the late 1970s, part Art Nouveau revival, part vinyl-boothed café-tabac and part disco-ball glam. The designers, Studio KO (who also fitted out London’s Chiltern Firehouse and Folie restaurant) have created a coolly eclectic set from an unprepossessing, low-ceilinged space.Head chef Guillaume Sanchez is lean, inked and intense. He has a whisk and a knife tattooed on his neck and a fork beside one eye (a legacy of his ill-starred Rue St Honoré tea shop/pâtisserie/rock venue/gallery/tattoo parlour “Horror Picture Tea”). He cooks a dream, and not a Lynchian bad one. I only had a burger and a mousse, both were sublime. The other dishes were presented with astonishing style, betraying the skills that won his restaurant Neso a Michelin star in 2019. Only 31 now, his culinary career began when he started apprenticing with the local baker at 13. Cutting-edge cocktails are from French-Irish Remy Savage and service is, in the most un-Parisian way imaginable, prompt, friendly and warm.This is Silencio’s third outpost; El Silencio in Ibiza is a more laid-back beach club saturated with queasily surreal art and a big nod toward the 1970s culture of wealthy hedonism and the disco scene. But it looks like the Saint Germain outpost is more designed for people like me, too old for Ibiza, a little too freaked out by Lynch and too early to bed for his underground club — but just about ready for a strange memory haunted by 1970s chic. Cinematic and dreamy, it embodies a city that is not what it once was, yet in the imagination still is, and perhaps still can be.
179  US authorities have charged four Belarusian government officials with aircraft piracy for forcing a Ryanair flight bound for Lithuania to land in Minsk last year so that they could arrest a leading opposition activist.The US Department of Justice on Thursday said the officials had conspired in May to use a fake bomb threat to divert Ryanair flight FR4978, which was carrying more than 100 passengers including dissident Roman Protasevich, his partner and four Americans.The officials charged were Leonid Mikalaevich Churo, director-general of the Belarusian state air navigation authority; Oleg Kazyuchits, the agency’s deputy director-general; and two officers at the Belarusian state security services: Andrey Anatolievich, whose last name remains unknown, and a second unnamed individual. All are based in Belarus and remain at large, according to the justice department.“Since the dawn of powered flight, countries around the world have co-operated to keep passenger aeroplanes safe,” said Damian Williams, US attorney for the southern district of New York, who was among the officials who announced the indictment. “The defendants shattered those standards by diverting an aeroplane to further the improper purpose of repressing dissent and free speech.”The indictment refocuses attention on a controversy that sparked global uproar and led to sanctions against Belarus, where strongman president Alexander Lukashenko has cracked down on independent journalists and opposition activists to maintain power.US authorities alleged that Churo personally warned staff at the Minsk air traffic control centre of a bomb threat before the flight took off from Athens, and instructed them to divert the aircraft to Minsk in response.According to the justice department, Kazyuchits allegedly told air traffic authorities in Belarus to forge reports about the diversion to hide the fabrication of the bomb threat and the security services’ role in rerouting the flight.According to a post on a semi-official presidential channel on messaging app Telegram around the time of the diversion, Lukashenko had given an “irrevocable command to turn the plane around and land it”.Protasevich is the former editor of Nexta, a Warsaw-based media group that played a prominent role in covering and directing the huge protests that erupted against Lukashenko in 2020 after the dictator claimed victory in what was widely viewed as an undemocratic election.The justice department alleged that Belarusian officers — some of whom were wearing ski masks and holding firearms — met the plane’s passengers on the tarmac in Minsk and ordered them to board airport buses.They were detained upon arriving at the terminal, with one group of passengers — including “Individual-2”, understood to be Protasevich’s partner — placed in a narrow hallway for about three hours, the justice department alleged.A person defined as “Individual-1” by US authorities and understood to be Protasevich, as well as his partner, were then allegedly escorted away and detained.The aircraft piracy charge carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison and a maximum penalty of life in prison.The Belarusian state air navigation authority and the country’s State Security Committee could not immediately be reached for comment.
180  Ukraine has hit back at Joe Biden’s suggestion that a “minor incursion” by Russian forces into the country might not prompt a severe allied response, forcing the US president to publicly reassure Kyiv that any attack by the Kremlin would trigger strong sanctions.“We want to remind the great powers that there are no minor incursions and small nations,” Volodymyr Zelensky, the pro-western Ukrainian president, wrote on Twitter on Thursday.After Zelensky’s rebuke and alarm in other allied capitals, Biden sought to go back on his own comments, saying at the White House that any Russian incursion would spark sweeping sanctions.“If any, any assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that is an invasion,” Biden said on Thursday. “Let there be no doubt at all, if [Russian president Vladimir] Putin makes this choice, Russia will pay a heavy price.”The White House had sought to clarify Biden’s remarks almost immediately after he made them at a Wednesday evening news conference. The president had suggested allies may end up “having a fight” over sanctions if the Kremlin stopped short of a full-scale invasion.Biden’s subsequent effort to reassure allies came after a day of unusually public splits among Nato members over how to handle Putin’s troop build-up on the Ukrainian border.French president Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday urged EU states to conduct their own dialogue with Russia, a stance that appeared to challenge the US and Nato-led diplomacy under way.French officials later insisted that the proposal was not in opposition to the continuing US negotiations with Russia.Jean-Yves Le Drian, France’s foreign minister, said: “It’s normal that Europeans consult together and that there continues to be close co-operation with our allies and partners, because nothing that concerns European security can be discussed and decided without the full involvement of Europeans.”Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, also sought to reassert allied unity, stressing after talks in Berlin with European counterparts that the west would respond whatever the scale of Russia’s military action against Ukraine.“We’ve been very clear throughout that, if any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border and commit new acts of aggression, that would be met by a swift, severe, united response from the US and its allies and partners,” he said.Blinken was in Berlin for talks with German, French and UK foreign ministers ahead of a meeting with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Geneva on Friday.The talks come with tensions still high on the Russia-Ukraine border, where Moscow has massed more than 100,000 troops. International officials have warned of the risks of a new armed conflict in Europe.Russia denies it is planning an invasion but says it could take military action if security demands it has put to the west and Nato are not fulfilled. Moscow has called on the transatlantic military alliance to pledge never to accept Ukraine as a member.Despite US efforts to reassert allied unity, Biden’s comments focused attention on disagreements over the scale of the response that would be triggered if Russia invades Ukraine.EU member states are debating whether cyber attacks or a “false-flag” operation on Ukraine should meet the threshold for massive sanctions against Moscow, or whether these should be triggered in the event of a full invasion.Blinken acknowledged the problem, saying that Russia had many “tools in its playbook” and had a number of alternatives to a full-scale incursion such as paramilitary strikes and acts of hybrid warfare.“In each of those scenarios we’re working very closely together to make sure that we effectively define our co-ordinated response,” he said.Blinken denied that the west was split over how to deal with the Russian threat. He said consultations that the US had held with allies in recent weeks were designed “to ensure that we are speaking and acting together with one voice [when it comes to Russia]”.He also suggested that Nord Stream 2, the gas pipeline Russia built under the Baltic Sea, could be used by Germany to deter Moscow from an invasion of Ukraine. “Gas is not flowing through Nord Stream 2 yet,” Blinken said. “It means the pipeline is leverage for Germany, the US and our allies, not Russia.”France also said it stood ready to continue its support for Nato’s reinforced presence in the Baltic states and was prepared to carry out new missions in Romania in accordance with Nato decisions.US officials confirmed they had authorised allies, including the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, to provide US-manufactured weapons to Ukraine. Officials said deliveries of $260m worth of US defence equipment pledged to Ukraine since August were continuing.A state department official said the US had committed $650m in defence equipment to Ukraine last year.“As President Biden told President Putin, should Russia further invade Ukraine, we will provide additional defensive material to the Ukrainians above and beyond that which we are already in the process of providing,” a state department official said. “We are committed to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and will continue to provide Ukraine the support it needs.”
169  US secretary of state Antony Blinken will meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, on Friday for what may prove last-ditch talks to avert new military action by Moscow against Ukraine. Far from de-escalating as Washington has urged, Russia has been moving troops into Belarus and amphibious assault squadrons towards the Black Sea, ostensibly for “drills”. With the west having signalled it will not go to war over Ukraine with a nuclear-armed Russia, it is imperative Blinken delivers a united western message: that continued diplomatic engagement is worthwhile for Moscow — but that if it chooses a military option, the economic cost imposed by western sanctions will be punitive.That makes it all the more unfortunate that in the immediate run-up to the talks two of the most senior western leaders have given an impression of division. At the European parliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday, French president Emmanuel Macron called for EU states to hold their own dialogue with Moscow, and for a “European proposal” to build a new “security and stability” order in the next few weeks.Having prompted alarm in Brussels, the Elysée Palace said later that France fully supported US-led negotiating efforts; officials said Macron’s call was intended to strengthen, not undermine, Nato unity. The French leader has long suggested that Europeans should take more responsibility for their own defence and security. He made a less well-advised push in 2019 for a European “reset” with Russia. To repeat, in essence, a similar call now — catching western allies unaware — is poorly timed. Not only did Macron’s previous outreach to Moscow discomfit Germany and central European EU members, it made no inroads with Russia’s Vladimir Putin.President Joe Biden compounded things hours later with unguarded comments during a press conference. Acknowledging that Russia might launch only a partial invasion of Ukraine, the president noted that “there are differences in Nato as to what countries are willing to do” in response. There may arguably be some merit in attempting to steer Russia towards less aggressive options by hinting at a sliding scale of retaliatory sanctions. There is none, however, in openly telegraphing splits in the alliance, in the middle of high-stakes diplomacy.Managing a noisy alliance of democracies spanning the Atlantic and the European continent is an arduous task. Yet unity of words and action is crucial if the west is to deter Moscow from further aggression against Ukraine, or respond effectively if it happens. Putin — who faces no real institutional constraints at home on his ability to use force as he chooses — is adept at dividing western counterparts. He should be given no opening to do so. What is said publicly, and how, and what is left for diplomatic and backchannel contacts must be chosen with the utmost care.Much as Macron aspires to a European vision for a new security order, the immediate priority must be agreement between Washington and European capitals on robust sanctions — and defensive military aid to Ukraine — under various scenarios of Russian aggression. This includes “trigger” points if Moscow opts for non-military measures such as cyber attacks. Paris should play a key role by stiffening the resolve of the new Berlin government, which has sent mixed messages over its readiness to halt the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline or bar Russia from the Swift interbank messaging system. Only armed with such agreements can Blinken and western negotiators command credibility as they confront their opposite numbers from the Kremlin.Letter in response to this article:One schoolboy memory of Monty’s Moscow warning / From Peter Jay, Woodstock, Oxfordshire, UK
170  Austria has become the first country in Europe to make vaccination against Covid-19 compulsory for all adults, after lawmakers voted on Thursday to approve the measure in an effort to curb a surge in infections.The government announced the controversial measure in November, but was forced to make significant concessions in the face of fierce opposition and widespread vaccine scepticism that sparked protests in cities across the country.The full implementation of the vaccine mandate and the penalties for those who break it, originally scheduled to be introduced at the beginning of February, has been pushed back until after an “introductory phase” that will begin next month and last until mid-March.Under the new law, those who refuse to be vaccinated will face fines of up to €3,600. The age threshold for the mandate to apply has been raised from 14 to 18.Speaking at a press conference ahead of the parliamentary vote, Chancellor Karl Nehammer said the vaccination programme would “allow society to achieve lasting freedom”.Outlining an “incentive and reward” package to sweeten the proposals, he said those vaccinated would be enrolled in a lottery with the chance of winning up to €500 in vouchers to be spent in Austrian businesses.A federal commission will also now oversee the vaccine programme, with the instruction to recommend its termination as soon as the epidemiological situation permits.The government said it would allocate €1.4bn to implement the measures.The law was approved with broad political support in a parliamentary plenary session on Thursday evening. The opposition Social Democratic Party and liberal Neos sided with the People’s Party and Green Party coalition government to vote the measures through. Only the rightwing populist Freedom Party opposed the plans, which they said they would challenge in the Austrian courts.Austria has been struggling to contain surging coronavirus cases since late last year. Until December, when the country entered a three-week lockdown, nearly one in three Austrians had still not received a single vaccine dose.A new political party — Menschen Freiheit Grundrechte (People Freedom Rights) — has been formed to oppose measures compelling or encouraging people to take the jabs. In September, the party won more than 6 per cent of the vote in the Upper Austria regional election.A vigorous public health campaign and the threat of the new law led to a rush of Austrians being vaccinated, but approximately 25 per cent of the population is still completely unjabbed. Most of those flocking to vaccination centres in recent weeks have been going for booster shots and 45 per cent of Austrians have now had their third dose.Although a December lockdown brought Covid-19 cases down sharply, the spread of the Omicron variant across Austria in the last two weeks has propelled infections to an all-time high. The country reported 27,677 new infections on Wednesday alone — more than quadruple the high of the autumn 2020 wave.The death rate, however, has remained on a steady downward course over the past few weeks.
171  When it comes to business disruption, Brexit is largely out of the headlines now for the simple reason that it has become low-level and endemic. Away from the front pages the problems caused by leaving the EU single market continue to manifest themselves to businesses, helping to drive inflation, by tightening the UK labour market and raising the cost of imports.As the political saliency of the Brexit issue continues to fade, business will find it increasingly hard to generate the public pressure needed to lobby for upgrades to what was a low-ambition EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.Still, not everyone is giving up. This week the British Chambers of Commerce, which represents tens of thousands of businesses, launched a trade manifesto and used the moment to urge the government to think about making “fixes” to the TCA to reduce the drag caused by the existing deal. As Shevaun Haviland, the BCC director-general, who joined from the Cabinet Office last year, told my colleague Dan Thomas, previous promises to resolve some of the limitations of the deal have never materialised. “At the time of the deal, it was like, ‘we’ve got some things to fix underneath it but we’ll get to that quite quickly afterwards’. But we haven’t really been quick enough,” she said.So what might those fixes be? William Bain, the Brexit lead at the BCC, has a wishlist of five top items that he believes could make a big difference to business.Top of his list is a veterinary deal that cuts the requirements of the export health certificates and other “SPS” requirements that contribute hugely to border issues for anyone involved in food or plant products.Second is VAT, which as any small business will tell you, is a nightmare because they have to grapple with 27 different regimes, hitting online sales for SMEs. A Norway-style deal could exempt the smallest businesses and remove the need for a local fiscal representative to clear VAT.Third, the government should reconsider its position on creating its own version of the EU’s “CE” mark on industrial and electrical goods — the UKCA mark. Business remains deeply unconvinced by the idea. Fourth, the government needs to work rapidly to expand the mobility provisions in the TCA to reduce limitations on business travel and work activities in the EU. Bain says cutting side-deals with EU member states should be a priority in 2022.Fifth and last, the government needs to be light-touch in pursuing companies over customs declarations while seeking to improve the “rules of origin” chapters of the TCA to enable wider “cumulation” of inputs when calculating whether a good qualifies for zero-tariff access.It’s not a bad list. And given political events in Westminster and the resignation of Lord David Frost before Christmas, it is not impossible to imagine a future — say under Rishi Sunak — that is more pragmatic than at present.To be clear, this is not about unravelling Brexit or joining the EEA — leaving the EU single and customs union market comes with intrinsic costs — but equally that’s not to say it’s impossible to reduce frictions, despite these limitations.A veterinary deal is controversial because it theoretically limits a trade deal with the US, but as we know, that deal remains a very long way off. Even if a Swiss-style deal is too close for political comfort, groups such as the Food and Drink Federation still argue that it would be possible to build a bespoke arrangement that takes into account the scale and intensity of EU-UK trade in food products.Of course, any such deal is going to have to be predicated on a permanent resolution to the Northern Ireland situation, which will require the UK to crystallise the Irish Sea border, with easements, and show good faith in operating it, including providing reliable data. There are lots of “ifs” here, but the fundamental one is stabilising EU-UK relations in order to begin a discussion on where there are areas of mutual interest in building out the deal.But that raises a second obstacle to these ambitions: given the asymmetry of the EU and UK economies, the EU has less interest in fixing problems given the relatively small exposure of its respective economies to the effects of Brexit.Take conformity assessment — the ability of either side to recognise and certify compliance with each other’s regulatory regimes. During the trade negotiations Michel Barnier was explicit that the EU had no interest in allowing the UK to preserve its position as “a regulatory and certification hub” for the EU’s single market.It seems unlikely that the EU would want to take steps to make it more attractive for investors to invest in the UK over the EU single market.As a result, some “fixes” by future governments are likely to need to be unilateral on the UK side, for example simply recognising CE marks as valid in the UK in order to make it easier for UK business to integrate in EU supply chains. The same goes for light-touch customs controls by HMRC that prioritise trade flows. That may not feel like taking back control of borders, but may yet be the most pragmatic course.The asymmetries are also relevant when it comes to improving the rules of origin chapters of the deal. Bain would like to see an expansion of the ways in which EU and UK businesses can qualify for zero-tariff access to each other’s markets by including a broader range of inputs when calculating what is “local” content.But as Sam Lowe, the trade director at Flint Global observes, there is “little incentive” for the EU to agree to this, since EU exporters have less of a problem meeting the existing requirements than UK exporters.One suggestion, which was rejected by the UK in 2020, is for the UK to reconsider joining the “PEM” group of countries, which would allow for “cumulation” with a number of other countries in the region such as Switzerland and Turkey.But Lowe warned that, while that would help in one regard, it would also create problems in areas such as electric vehicles where the rules of origin were tailored to the specifics of the EU-UK relationship — to be modified to fit the PEM model. In short, it’s complicated.As for better “mobility” provisions to reduce limitations on business travel and work activities in the EU, this will also require overall relations to improve. Talk of side-deals with EU member states is also probably quite optimistic given pressure from the European Commission on member states to do nothing that undermines the EU-wide positions taken in the TCA.The impacts of such a meagre deal are real, and the travel and education industries do have mutual incentives to push politicians on both sides to be creative.A survey by Seasonal Businesses in Travel (SBIT) estimates that the number of UK staff working in French ski resorts has dropped from 8,000 to 2,000 this year. Covid-19 has masked many of these effects, but they will start to be felt as we emerge from the pandemic, which has the potential to move the conversation.Charles Owen, the managing director of SBIT who has called for action to reduce impacts on seasonal travel workers, said the TCA would be improved by a UK-EU-wide Youth Mobility Scheme of the kind the UK has with other countries, such as Australia and Japan.He warns that without it, as holiday trade opens up again, there is a risk that UK operators just cannot meet demand because of the barriers on mainly young UK staff working in Europe. This is contributing to rising prices, shrinking the offer to customers and reducing the ability of the industry to help lead the post-pandemic recovery. Both sides would benefit from such a deal, but the politics of increased immigration are not easy in the current environment.“The officials and politicians we speak to are sympathetic to the request,” says Owen, “but we need a more proactive approach from the UK government to push this forward and reach an agreement with the EU”.In summary, across all these five areas, it won’t be easy to engineer sweeping fixes to the TCA, but equally for those hoping to improve the deal, it is not a counsel of complete despair: there are things that, in a better political environment enabled by a deal on Northern Ireland and perhaps a more pragmatic prime minister, that could be doneBrexit is not in the headlines, but inflation definitely is, hitting a 30-year high this week, with pressure growing on the Bank of England to raise interest rates.Andrew Bailey, the BoE’s governor, warned that a “very tight labour market” would put upward pressure on wages, while rising food prices in particular led analysts such as Kitty Ussher, the chief economist at the Institute of Directors, to warn that inflation was becoming “endemic rather than transitory”.There are many factors driving inflation, but Brexit’s hidden hand — helping to tighten the labour market and raise import costs — makes the BoE’s decision-making harder, because the supply capacity of the economy will be smaller and less flexible, says John Springford, deputy director of the Centre for European Reform.Data from the IMF show that the UK has suffered more inflation than many advanced economies since the pandemic began — a period that, of course, also coincides with Brexit, which is a factor unique to the UK economy.While not a “slam dunk”, adds Springford, it is logical that supply-side issues, exacerbated by Brexit, will play into the UK’s ability to ease pressure on the labour market and the costs of food imports, which the Food and Drink Federation warned this week are rising fast.“Britain lost many EU citizens in the pandemic, and many will not return because of Brexit. Importing goods has become more costly,” says Springford, noting that the BoE is assuming a loss of supply capacity of 3 per cent or so from Brexit.“That means that, as demand recovers from the pandemic, the UK will hit supply constraints more quickly than other countries — indeed it has already, as shown by shortages of food and lorry drivers.”And, finally, three unmissable Brexit storiesTalk of a City Brexodus ahead of the 2016 referendum have proved overblown. This week Lex crunched the numbers on job losses in the Square Mile and found they were a fraction of the worst-case scenarios. But, the column says, in the coming years a lot depends on how financial services firms respond to being forced to split their operations between the EU and London.Next week Italy chooses a new president to replace Sergio Mattarella.

172  The European Commission aims to conclude talks with the UK over Northern Ireland by the end of February, its chief negotiator has said, while giving a bleak assessment of progress so far.Maros Sefcovic told a private meeting of members of the European parliament on Thursday that both sides wanted a deal to avoid the issue dominating the campaign ahead of elections in Northern Ireland in May, according to those present.But he warned that the UK had not changed its demands despite an improved tone after Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, replaced Lord David Frost as Brexit negotiator. He added that London continues to insist on a fundamental rewrite of the Northern Ireland protocol, which it signed in 2019 and which governs post-Brexit trade in the region.Protestant unionist parties have condemned the protocol and are likely to campaign vociferously against it as they try to defend their majority in the Stormont assembly.The region remains tied to the EU single market rules for goods to avoid a trade border on the island of Ireland, which could undermine peace after decades of civil strife. This means goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are subject to customs as well as food and animal health checks.Talks began in October after the EU claimed it was offering to cut up to 80 per cent of checks on animal and plant-based products, and halve the customs paperwork, but London says the offer would not deliver such reductions in practice.Sefcovic and Truss met for talks for the first time on January 13 and will convene again in Brussels on Monday.A joint statement after the last meeting underlined the warmer atmosphere between the two sides but Sefcovic said he was surprised that Truss continued to demand changes the EU has already ruled out.These include dropping customs requirements for goods the UK deems are destined only for Northern Ireland. Truss also wanted an arbitration mechanism to hear disputes before any referral to the European Court of Justice. And she wanted to remove the requirement for the EU to approve state aid, the subsidies given to companies.An ally of Truss said: “There hasn’t been any formal agreement between two sides on a timescale, although of course we’ve always stressed the urgency of finding solutions.“Of course it’s welcome if the EU recognises the problems of talks dragging on into the Northern Ireland election campaign.”Truss outlined her demands in an article in the Belfast Telegraph on Thursday. She said the EU was “treating Northern Ireland as if it was in the single market and part of the EU when we all know it is not”. An EU diplomat said Sefcovic told member states’ ambassadors on Thursday that Truss was adopting demands he thought Frost had abandoned. “We are going backwards in time,” the diplomat said.An EU official said Sefcovic was more likely to pause, rather than end, talks after February if there was no agreement. He has publicly called for more urgency in the process.Sefcovic also told MEPs that business and civil society in Northern Ireland backed the EU’s proposals and that more than 60 per cent of the population supported the protocol. He added that any changes to the protocol could be enacted swiftly once agreed.
173  Christine Lagarde has rejected calls for the European Central Bank to raise interest rates more quickly than planned in response to record inflation, saying it had “every reason not to act as quickly or as ruthlessly” as the US Federal Reserve.The ECB president warned that raising interest rates too soon risked “putting the brakes on growth” and she told France Inter radio on Thursday that she wanted its monetary policy to act as “a shock absorber” instead.Soaring energy and food prices lifted inflation in the eurozone to a record high of 5 per cent in December, well above the ECB’s 2 per cent target, prompting calls for a faster withdrawal of its generous stimulus policies.Lagarde, however, forecast that inflation in the bloc would stabilise and “gradually fall” over the course of this year, referring to the ECB’s forecasts in December when it said inflation would drop below its target by the end of 2022.“It will fall less than we all had all envisaged a year ago, including all the world’s economists, but it will fall,” she said.The Fed and the Bank of England are expected to raise interest rates several times this year after stopping their asset purchases. But the ECB in December said it was “very unlikely” to raise rates this year and outlined plans to continue buying large amounts of bonds for most of 2022.“The cycle of economic recovery in the US is ahead of that in Europe,” Lagarde said. “So we have every reason not to act as quickly or as ruthlessly as one might imagine with the Fed.”Behind Lagarde’s confident stance there are growing divisions within the ECB’s governing council, which came to the fore at its last rate-setting meeting in December over the key questions of how fast price pressures would fade and whether it should withdraw its stimulus more quickly.While council members agreed that “substantial monetary support was still needed” for inflation to stabilise at its target in the next three years, some of them warned that a “higher for longer” inflation scenario “could not be ruled out”, according to minutes of the meeting published on Thursday.“Some members retained reservations about some elements of the proposed package such that they could not support the overall package,” the ECB said. These reservations included criticism of its decision to increase the pace of a longstanding asset purchase programme from €20bn a month to €40bn a month to partly offset the ending of new purchases under its €1.85tn pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) in March.The dissenters, including the heads of the German, Belgian and Austrian central banks, also objected to extending the period for reinvesting the proceeds of maturing bonds under PEPP by a year until at least the end of 2024.Nevertheless, there was general agreement that given high uncertainty over future inflation the ECB should “retain the ability to calibrate and recalibrate the monetary policy stance in a data-driven manner in either direction”.Despite Lagarde’s confidence that inflationary pressures will fade soon, investors are betting that prices will continue to overshoot the ECB’s forecasts and force it to change its policy stance more aggressively than planned this year.Markets are now pricing in two 0.1 percentage point interest rate rises from the ECB by the end of the year, despite the central bank’s insistence that higher borrowing costs in 2022 are not consistent with its guidance.After Germany’s 10-year bond yield — which acts as a benchmark for borrowing costs in the euro area — turned positive on Wednesday for the first time since 2019, Lagarde said rising yields meant “the fundamentals of the economy are recovering”.Critics argue the ECB is being too slow to remove its monetary stimulus because of fears this will push up borrowing costs for governments that borrowed significantly during the coronavirus pandemic.Three German economists — Jürgen Stark, Thomas Mayer and Gunther Schnabl — wrote in a Project Syndicate article this week: “It is becoming increasingly clear that inflation will gain momentum without monetary policy countermeasures”. But they added: “Such tightening would create serious problems for highly indebted eurozone members.”This story has been amended since first publication to clarify Lagarde’s comments about the likely path of inflation this year
174  Europe is already experiencing the worst energy crisis since the Arab oil embargoes of the 1970s. Record natural gas prices are stoking a cost-of-living crisis from London to Warsaw. If Russia invades Ukraine, it could get much worse.The EU relies on Russia for around 40 per cent of its gas in normal years. A steep decline in exports from the country in recent months has served — most likely by Kremlin-approved design — as a reminder of Europe’s huge strategic weakness when it comes to energy.While few observers think Moscow would look to sever gas flows to Europe entirely if tensions escalate further, any additional restrictions on exports in the depths of winter would be likely to send gas prices to new heights.Analysts at Citi warned this week that with a complete loss of Russian supplies Europe would face widespread industrial disruption and “rationing [of] electricity, potentially including rolling blackouts”. At best, with co-ordinated government action and significantly higher prices, Europe could replace two-thirds of Russian gas with seaborne LNG cargoes, Citi estimates.“Given the likely widespread economic and societal impact in Europe, and likely punitive responses, we think Russian policymakers are unlikely to carry out such a threat,” Citi said. “[But] even reducing supply a bit, without a complete cut-off, could have sizeable impacts on prices and industrial production in Europe.”Russian president Vladimir Putin, who has demonstrated in his public comments a solid understanding of how commodity markets function, knows you do not need to cut supplies to zero to have huge influence over markets. In the fourth quarter, Russian exports to north-west Europe were down between 20 and 25 per cent, according to the head of the International Energy Agency.Moscow argues that it is meeting all its long-term contracts to European buyers. But heavily restricting spot sales with little prior warning and draining the storage facilities of Russia’s Gazprom in Europe has left the market desperately tight. Putin has repeatedly tied higher supplies to the approval of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would bypass Ukraine to carry gas direct to Germany.If Europe and the US retaliate to any further action from Russia in Ukraine by imposing sanctions, there are second-order risks. US president Joe Biden has indicated that Russian banks could be cut off from using US dollars in the event of a full-scale invasion. If western banks become wary of dealing with Russian entities, even in euros or other currencies, the risk of disruption increases — even if that was not the primary aim.And while Moscow may be cautious about retaliating by cutting gas sales completely, given that it would have a galvanising effect in European countries, it would be foolish to rule out the possibility.Europe is arguably already experiencing a form of economic warfare from Russia, designed to remind it of its weakness when it comes to energy.Even if the current crises blow over, Gazprom has made clear it does not see Europe as its future, with plans to send the continent headlong into competition with China for its wares. Russia understandably views China’s energy-hungry economy as a huge opportunity and Europe’s aim to reduce fossil fuel consumption as a risk. But to date, Gazprom’s pipeline exports to China have only come from newly developed gasfields in the east of the country that do not supply Europe.Plans are being studied, however, to connect up the western Siberian fields that supply Europe to China via a pipeline running through Mongolia, potentially by the end of this decade. Cold winters 10 years from now could land households in Europe in a bidding war with state-backed Chinese utilities for the gas they need.Today’s intertwined crises in gas prices and Ukraine should finally force action from Europe to reduce its reliance on Russian gas as quickly as possible. That it has not done so already represents a huge failure by European policymakers, leaving a strategic weakness at the heart of the continent.The heart of the EU’s actions should be to accelerate the move towards renewables and investing substantially in energy efficiency. But Europe also needs to act aggressively on gas supplies today, as it will take years for wind and hydrogen to have a significant effect.While domestic gas production should not be discouraged, politicians should be sceptical of claims that Europe can drill its way out of this mess. But securing alternative gas supplies through seaborne LNG contracts, potentially with co-ordinated government support and investment in projects, could at least reduce reliance on Russia in the coming years. To fail to do that now would only encourage Putin.
175  Italy has enjoyed an exceptional period of stability and success under the leadership of Mario Draghi. Installed as prime minister 11 months ago to steer his crisis-battered country to recovery, the former European Central Bank president rescued a faltering Covid-19 vaccination campaign and contained the virus with tough controls and vaccine mandates. The economy has rebounded with a hefty fiscal stimulus. And his national unity government has begun implementing a long-term programme of economic reforms and investment, backed with €190bn from the EU’s recovery fund. It is a once in a generation opportunity to raise Italy’s growth potential, albeit modestly, and to make its mountainous public debt more sustainable. Italians have seen that change is possible.It was always naive to expect Draghi to perform miracles. Italy’s economic and social problems are deep-seated. Special interests are entrenched. Draghi, who was never going to stand in elections due in 2023, was a stop-gap solution. But the reformist Draghi premiership has proved to be disappointingly brief.The reason is the political turbulence created by next week’s process of selecting a new president to replace Sergio Mattarella, whose seven-year term ends in early February. Mattarella has all but ruled out staying on, relaying his objections to two-term presidencies. Draghi has done nothing to dispel rumours of his interest in becoming head of state, saying in December he was “at the service of the institutions”. Draghi’s distinguished public service and ability to wield influence behind the scenes give him impeccable credentials for the job. The problem is the government might wobble or even fall without him.A few months ago, it was a finely balanced judgment whether Italy would be better off with another year of Draghi’s hands-on leadership or seven years as presidential safeguard against the tail risk of a populist government wrecking the public finances and Italy’s place in the euro. The second year of Italy’s recovery plan could prove even more challenging than the first. It needs to meet 100 “milestones”, including difficult reforms to tax, public procurement and competition, in return for instalments of EU money. Projects need to be approved and contracts signed. It is a mammoth task. So if the government ain’t broke, why fix it?The problem is that the hunt for a new president has unleashed political turbulence that is destabilising the government. Some of the 1,009 MPs, senators and regional representatives who will choose the next head of state by secret ballots do not want Draghi, either because they fear he will be overbearing in the role or because his move to the Palazzo Quirinale could trigger snap elections and they will lose their seats. But the lack of plausible alternatives acceptable to all sides means another choice could prove so divisive it incapacitates the unity government or brings it down altogether. The polarising candidature of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who lacks the integrity for the job, is a case in point.The worst outcome would be early elections that derail Italy’s reform and recovery plan. In these circumstances, it would be better to have Draghi in the presidency using the office’s considerable powers and moral suasion to keep the country on track. Engineering his ascendancy and a replacement premier who can keep the government together will be hard. It may require more political heavyweights joining the team. All the main parties except the far-right Brothers of Italy signed a contract with the EU when they agreed to the recovery plan. They need to take ownership of it.
176  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.French president Emmanuel Macron is forging ahead with his “sovereign Europe” rhetoric, catching allies off-guard when it comes to Russia and leaving them scrambling to reassure the US and Nato about a “strong, clear and united transatlantic front” (more here and here).But when compared to his last appearance in the European parliament five years ago, Macron’s federalist ambitions have significantly diminished. We’ll unpack his Strasbourg speech and why he couldn’t escape the shadow of his upcoming presidential election.Speaking of French ambitions, one piece of EU legislation Macron would like to see an agreement on before the April elections — the Digital Services Act — is facing last-minute demands from lawmakers and lobbyists.We’ll also look at what Germany’s ex-chancellor, Angela Merkel, did (or rather, didn’t do) next.French president Emmanuel Macron was back in the European parliament in Strasbourg yesterday — the first time he has addressed the chamber since his election in 2017, writes Mehreen Khan in Strasbourg.Macron cut a markedly different figure from his 2017 pose. Back then it was big on grand EU visions, the Franco-German alliance and a revival of ever closer union after Brexit.Today’s Macron is in the midst of a highly charged re-election campaign, having turned rightward on social issues and battling a pandemic at home. His main political opponents in April’s two-round vote range from the rightwing Valérie Pécresse to extreme-right Eurosceptics Marine Le Pen and Éric Zemmour.After four years, Macron’s promise as Europe’s “great reformer” has not quite materialised. That’s in part because of his uneasy relations with the European parliament after the president of France became instrumental in ditching the Spitzenkandidaten (lead candidates) system that gave the parliament the power to select the president of the European Commission.Macron’s Strasbourg debate was meant to kick-start France’s rotating EU presidency but his domestic campaign was never too far away.He was careful not to push the buttons of his electoral opponents or make too many statements that could risk becoming a liability at home. He gave a classic defence of the rule of law but refrained from directly mentioning Hungary and Poland — countries with which the French far-right has sought to make common cause. Macron largely stuck to safe topics such as security, defence, migration and Europe’s unique “civilisation” — all catnip for his right-leaning supporters.His appearance was partly overshadowed by infighting between MEPs who chose to attack each other instead.Mud-slinging ensued after Yannick Jadot, France’s green presidential candidate and an MEP, used his intervention to criticise Macron’s stance on EU policies such as the green taxonomy. That prompted the socialists and the president of the parliament, Roberta Metsola, to step in to protect the “dignity” of the debate by keeping out domestic politics.One Belgian MEP said Jadot’s criticism “hinders real European progress”. Others fulminated at the lack of “respect” shown towards Macron. Even fellow greens went after their stable mate Jadot.It’s a paradoxical complaint from pro-Europeans who often lament the absence of a true European “public sphere”, only to decry the Europeanisation of national politics. It would have been remiss of MEPs to ignore an election whose result will have sizeable consequences for the direction of future EU policy.As for Macron, he expertly addressed his critics on topics ranging from climate, migration, taxation and foreign affairs. He remained in the chamber for well more than five hours of debate, responding to scores of MEPs and providing the chamber more attention than any EU leader in recent times.His performance was marred by his failure to extend that courtesy to waiting journalists, who were offered no questions in his post-debate press conference.The yield on Germany’s 10-year Bund rose as high as 0.013 per cent yesterday, the highest level since May 2019, reflecting a drop in the price of the debt. In mid-December, the Bund yield had registered about minus 0.4 per cent. (More here)France’s ambition to secure a swift deal on an EU law placing more onerous responsibilities on tech companies risks being thwarted by last-minute demands, writes Javier Espinoza in Brussels.The French EU presidency has stated its goal to secure a deal between governments, the European Commission and MEPs on the Digital Services Act in the coming months (preferably before the presidential elections in April). But judging by yesterday’s debate in Strasbourg and the hundreds of last-minute amendments, officials are starting to doubt that the timeline can be kept.The DSA was supposed to be the first time regulators overhauled rules on the way content and products were being policed online in more than two decades but instead it had become a melting pot of dissonant wishes of EU countries and lawmakers.The European parliament today will vote on its common position on the draft DSA ahead of negotiations with the council and commission, with more than 500 amendments seeking even tougher obligations on big online platforms having been proposed in recent weeks.During yesterday’s debate, several MEPs made the case that the draft rules are not ambitious enough and do not guarantee a safer online environment for users.Adding to the mix, lobby groups representing small businesses, as well as large players such as Amazon and Google, made their last-minute attempt to water down the rules. Consumer groups were in contrast calling for lawmakers to toughen the new legislation or risk missing a once in a lifetime opportunity to make the internet a safer place for users.One hotly debated issue has been whether or not to introduce an outright ban on targeted advertising. Media outlets have also been aggressively pushing to be exempt from new content moderation rules.“There is political will to move quickly with the new rules,” said an EU official with direct knowledge of the discussions. “But the question is whether the European parliament will put roadblocks and prevent us from moving fast.”New demands are likely to emerge as the commission, EU member states and lawmakers head for negotiations on the final text.And despite divergences in the parliament, an internal council document shows countries are also divided on issues such as dark patterns and deep fakes.Siada El Ramly, director-general at lobbying group DOT Europe, said it was time to stop with the political posturing and get moving. “We are not Hollywood. Let’s get on and get the policy right,” she said.Even before Angela Merkel had withdrawn from the world stage, one of the most frequent questions she fielded in her final days as chancellor was what she planned to do next. The mystery of Merkel’s next move remains, but we now know what it won’t be: working for the UN, writes Erika Solomon in Berlin.Merkel turned down an offer from António Guterres, the UN secretary-general, last week to take up the chair of his pet project: a global “public goods” advisory board. The body would focus on regulating and co-ordinating issues that affect populations worldwide, such as the ozone, vaccinations and debris from outer space.Merkel, 67, has kept true to her word and stayed out of the spotlight since handing over the reins to Olaf Scholz.Merkel repeatedly told reporters she would be in no rush to act and had no plans to “immediately accept the next invitation because I’m afraid I have nothing to do and nobody wants me any more”.So far the only thing known of Merkel’s post-politics plan is a memoir that she will be writing with her aide Beate Baumann. Baumann told Der Spiegel the book would “explain [Merkel’s] key political decisions in her own words, and look back on her life’s journey”.After 16 years running Europe’s largest economy, the woman once described as the leader of the democratic world has said she first needs time to think about “what really interests me”.“And then maybe I’ll try to read something, then my eyes will close because I’m tired, then I’ll sleep a bit,” she once joked. “And then we’ll see.”
177  Good morning. We are still thinking about the Fed’s balance sheet and, judging by the responses to Wednesday’s letter, readers are too. It’s a topic we will come back to soon. In the meantime: European value, bank stocks and wildfires.Value stocks are having a good 2022. The Russell value index is up 7 per cent year to date, beating Russell growth by 7 percentage points. That’s a lot in less than three weeks. But Unhedged’s friend Duncan Lamont, who heads up the research team at Schroders, points out that the value breakout is even more extreme in Europe. The MSCI EMU value index has outperformed its growth counterpart by a whopping 11 per cent year to date.Here’s a chart of growth/value relative performance for the two pairs of indices (data from Bloomberg):Value and Europe have underperformed growth and the US for well over a decade, and strategists have been pitching catch-up trades for almost that long. And now both are catching up at once, and fast. Perhaps this is evidence that a lasting factor or style rotation is finally happening?Lamont is quick to point out that three weeks is too short a time to declare a durable trend. But he offers two thoughts about what might be behind this trendlet.First, the European value index is more heavily weighted to financials and energy (25 per cent and 7 per cent of the index, respectively) than the US one (20 per cent and 5 per cent). This means more benefit from recent rate increases and the rebounding oil price.Next, the valuation gap between value and growth had grown in both regions, but in Europe the gap has become extreme. The forward price/earnings ratio of the growth index at the end of last year was about 11, versus 27 for growth. That 16-point gap has expanded from 10 points before the pandemic. Says Lamont: There may be a more general point to make, too. During the pandemic, there has been more lockdowns and less fiscal stimulus in Europe than in the US. Its economies, accordingly, have had a less robust recovery. Maybe what we are seeing is investors anticipating that when the pandemic eases, Europe may have a nice cyclical bounce, previewed in the US already, which will help European value stocks. A trade to watch in 2022. US bank stocks are up 10 per cent over the past month, despite having endured a tough few days recently, and have solidly outperformed the S&P over the past year. They have risen mostly on fundamentals, too: the valuation of the KBW bank index, at about 11 times forward earnings, is right in line with levels of the past few years.Bank profits are widely thought to be sensitive to the slope of the yield curve, on the grounds they fund themselves short and lend long. In fact, however, they are even more sensitive to short-term rates, which are rising fast. Furthermore, credit card loan volumes are continuing their comeback, and business loans are finally joining in. Data from the Fed: In short, it’s tempting to bet that bank stocks will keep the momentum going. But while the big banks that reported this week — the likes of JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup — showed strong revenue trends, the story was higher expenses. JPMorgan led the way. From the FT:And:Things are finally going the banks’ way, but it seems, at least at the largest ones, investors are not going to see the money. In lending businesses, the money is going to technology; in investment banking, to the bankers. Brian Foran, an analyst at Autonomous Research, ruefully noted: “Somewhere there is a report with my name on it saying that banks’ investments in tech might lead to sub-50 efficiency ratios [non-interest expenses as a proportion of revenues] long-term. So far, we haven’t even figured out how to break 60.” It will be interesting to see if the smaller regional banks, which report in the next few weeks, follow the same pattern. It was good to see this article in The Wall Street Journal, about two of the largest US insurers, AIG and Chubb, pulling out of big swathes of the California home insurance market because they consider the wildfire risk uninsurable. There is a complex set of issues here, but the core point is this: insurance pricing sends important messages about the dangers of climate change, and government regulation and subsidisation in fire and flood insurance often stifle those messages:I have written about how climate change has rendered historical modelling obsolete, and made catastrophe modelling necessary, in the case of flooding. The same is true of wildfires. But even if regulations change, some things will still become impossible to insure profitably because of climate change. Chubb and AIG are providing a dose of reality that we need, demonstrating the real social benefit of finance. Expensive houses in California becoming uninsurable will send a much stronger message than another bank’s glossy ESG campaign. No one should have to risk losing everything in a fire. But at some point facts must be faced.A Blackstone-backed landlord promising a free call option on your dream house — what could go wrong? The FT’s Mark Vandevelde digs deep on the rent-to-buy industry.
178  France and the EU on Thursday sought to reassure the US that the Europeans remained committed to Washington-led negotiations with Russia over averting further conflict in Ukraine, after French president Emmanuel Macron called for a distinct EU dialogue with Moscow.Macron on Wednesday used a speech at the European Parliament to urge EU states to conduct their own dialogue with Russia, in remarks that blindsided EU officials.French officials insisted that Macron’s call for an EU dialogue with Russia was not in opposition to the continuing US negotiations and was designed to strengthen rather than undermine Nato unity.“We are in favour of very close co-ordination with the US,” said one of Macron’s advisers. “We find it strengthens the hand of the French and the Germans in their negotiations with Russia.The Americans are talking to the Russians to deal with a disorderly and profoundly dangerous situation.”On Macron’s suggestion of a separate EU dialogue with Russia and his call for a European proposal within weeks to build “a new security and stability order” that would then be discussed among Nato allies, the adviser said: “It’s called co-ordination, reforging European unity and reinforcing the unity of the Nato alliance.” EU diplomats said Macron’s call was the “first time” that Europe-only talks had been mentioned by Paris, while another suggested that France’s push had not been co-ordinated with partners before the speech.In a diplomatic effort that began last week aimed at avoiding a feared Russian attack on Ukraine and discussing wider issues of European security, officials from Moscow held meetings with the US and with the Nato military alliance.While Brussels has chafed at the EU’s lack of official representation at the talks, it has welcomed diplomatic outreach by US officials to ensure that the bloc is consulted. Twenty-one of the EU’s 27 members were also present in their capacity as members of Nato.When asked if the European Commission supported Macron’s proposal, a spokesperson said on Thursday that the EU’s approach to Russia was being formulated “within the framework of the ongoing contacts and co-ordination, both within the EU and between the EU and the transatlantic partners such as the US, Canada, Nato and the OSCE”.Following Macron’s statement, which was applauded in the Strasbourg assembly, the EU’s top diplomat Josep Borrell had a phone call with US secretary of state Antony Blinken and Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg where they agreed on the need for “a strong, clear and united transatlantic front”, according to a readout from Borrell’s team.The EU has agreed “to further strengthen co-ordination with the United States and with Nato”, Borrell noted in the call, in which he also invited Blinken to attend a meeting of EU foreign ministers on Monday to discuss the Ukraine crisis.Stoltenberg said in a separate statement that the call was a “strong signal of unity”, echoing a plea from Blinken earlier on Wednesday to avoid “divisions between and within our countries”.Macron, who has called for the EU to work towards “strategic autonomy” and rely less on the US and Nato for defence and security, said on Wednesday that Europe had to offer Russia its own solution to de-escalate tensions with Moscow in the “coming weeks”.“We should build as Europeans working with other Europeans and with Nato and then propose it for negotiation with Russia,” he said. “It is good that Europeans and the United States co-ordinate, but it is necessary that Europeans conduct their own dialogue.”One EU official said: “We were given zero notice of this crazy idea.I hope [the Americans] realise this will go nowhere.”The proposal “sends a signal of division, which is sad because there really isn’t any in reality. Europe and the US are incredibly synced up on this”, said a second European official. “They will love this in Moscow and that is why it is dangerous.”Sergei Ryabkov, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, also resisted the idea of broader talks on Wednesday and said Moscow would prefer to deal primarily with Washington. “We would prefer to find an understanding and do a deal with the Americans foremost. Bringing in too broad a circle of countries into these process seems counterproductive to us,” Ryabkov said.Both Paris and Berlin are trying to revive four-party negotiations over the war waged by Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine in the so-called “Normandy format” — bringing together Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany — with the support of the US. French officials acknowledge that there are divisions in the EU over how to deal with Moscow, with vulnerable east European and Baltic states close to or bordering Russia generally favouring a harder line than those further south and west. They said Macron was trying to overcome these divisions during France’s current six-month EU presidency.“We must work to have unity among Europeans, and unity in the alliance, and prevent the Russians from playing on our differences,” Macron’s adviser said.
179  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment.

182  French president Emmanuel Macron called on the EU to forge its own plan for “security and stability” with Russia, in a move that risks undermining western solidarity in the face of Kremlin aggression towards Ukraine.In a speech to the European Parliament, Macron called for EU states to “conduct their own dialogue” with Russia rather than support ongoing diplomatic efforts led by the US and Nato — and in sharp contrast to a plea from US secretary of state Antony Blinken for “unity”.Macron said that despite the joint EU-US diplomacy, Europeans had to offer Russia a solution to de-escalate tensions with Moscow in the “coming weeks”.“We should build as Europeans working with other Europeans and with Nato and then propose it for negotiation with Russia,” he told MEPs in Strasbourg on Wednesday. “It is good that Europeans and the United States co-ordinate, but it is necessary that Europeans conduct their own dialogue.”Macron’s intervention is the first example of public dissent between Nato members since the US first warned of a potential Russian attack on Ukraine more than two months ago.It also breaks a united front between the EU and US on Russia forged by what officials have described as unprecedented levels of diplomatic outreach by the US to engage Brussels in the ongoing dialogue with Moscow.Speaking during a visit to Kyiv on Wednesday, Blinken stressed the need for a unified approach ahead of his planned meeting with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Geneva on Friday.“The strength of our diplomacy, our deterrence and any response to Moscow’s aggression demands unity, among allies and partners, as well as within Ukraine,” he warned.Sergei Ryabkov, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, also seemingly sought to drive a wedge between the US and its Nato and European allies on Wednesday, pushing back against broader multinational talks and saying Moscow would prefer to deal primarily with the US.“We would prefer to find an understanding and do a deal with the Americans foremost. Bringing in too broad a circle of countries into these process seems counterproductive to us,” he said.Russia has long sought to sideline the EU in favour of negotiating with individual countries, and Macron’s call for a separate negotiation track will likely pose questions regarding the level of western consensus behind the White House’s efforts to avert war through diplomacy,The EU is struggling to reach agreement on what level of aggression by Russia towards Ukraine should trigger sanctions, amid diverging levels of appetite for sanctioning Moscow among its members.Russia has amassed around 100,000 troops on its border with Ukraine and threatened an unspecified “military-technical response” if security alliance Nato does not roll back its forces and pledge never to admit Ukraine.Blinken, who met with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, said Russia could double “in short order” its 100,000-plus force amassed at various locations close to its border with Ukraine.“That gives President [Vladimir] Putin the capacity also on very short notice to take further aggressive action against Ukraine,” Blinken said. “I strongly, strongly hope we can keep this on a diplomatic and peaceful path, but ultimately this is President Putin’s decision.”Blinken repeated warnings that Russia would face crippling sanctions if it further invaded Ukraine, having annexed Crimea in 2014 and since then fuelled a war in the country’s eastern Donbas region.Ryabkov on Wednesday described the security situation in Europe as “critical” but said Russia would “not attack, strike, invade, quote-unquote, whatever, Ukraine.”Blinken will travel to Berlin on Thursday before meeting with Lavrov. The Geneva meeting follows talks last week between Russia and the US and Nato were described by Moscow as a “dead end” after its security demands, including for Ukraine’s Nato membership bid to be rejected, were ruled out.
183  The interruptions to supply chains during the Covid-19 pandemic have been bad for most, but an opening for some. Specifically, they’ve cleared a line of advance for politicians with latent longings for activist industrial policy to try to bring manufacturing home.In the EU, Japan and particularly President Joe Biden’s US, under various banners (“resilience”, “autonomy”, “national security”) some policymakers have gleefully opened up their tool kits of state subsidies, procurement budgets and domestic content requirements, focusing on products including semiconductors, batteries, rare earths and electric vehicles.With a couple of exceptions, such as some Asian governments subsidising semiconductor companies to set up shop in their country, this hasn’t produced much action as yet. Given the potential for clodhopping protectionist interventionism — creating gluts and inefficiency and reducing diversity of supply — this might be a blessing.While the inertia seems unlikely to last indefinitely, it will endure for longer in some places than others. The EU and Japan seem relatively well inoculated against the intervention bug; the US is more immunocompromised.Political space for state-led restructuring has recently been cleared by blitzes of media messaging. Biden more or less claimed to have saved Christmas, or at least the consumer durables part of it, through a flurry of official interventions late last year, unblocking ports and corralling retailers. Thierry Breton, the EU’s hyperactive internal market commissioner, last year took an exhortatory tour of Europe’s vaccine supply chain and intimated he had personally galvanised production.Some of these claims look a touch flimsy when examined closely. Biden professes to have increased throughput in the infamously clogged west coast ports, including by getting workers to run a 24-hour container-handling operation. In fact, the number of container ships waiting outside port continues to set record highs. Europe, which calls itself the world’s pharmacy, is perfectly capable of running highly efficient medical supply chains as long as governments run sensible procurement policies and don’t stuff them up with blocks on exports.Still, the narrative is now there. What of the action? The US government is already testing its ability to micromanage complex private-sector supply chains. Biden is implementing the domestic-content provisions for car production in the US-Mexico-Canada agreement inherited from the administration of Donald Trump, though that has swiftly run into trouble in the shape of a dispute settlement case brought by the deal’s two other members.Undeterred, the Biden administration also wants tax credits for electric vehicle manufacture conditional on production in the US, with an extra handout if the operation is unionised. The union bit may not survive Congress: there’s a non-union Toyota facility in West Virginia, home of the galactically powerful swing-vote senator Joe Manchin. But despite alarm in Mexico, Canada and Europe, the domestic production part has a good chance of getting through and seems unlikely to lead to optimal productivity.As Mary Lovely of the Peterson Institute think-tank puts it: “The question remains as to whether it can do anything other than just result in very high-priced North American vehicles that are sold only in North America.”Supporters of the Biden administration argue that favouring domestic production will encourage electric vehicle take-up. They may be right — last year’s peerless Super Bowl ad for General Motors starring Will Ferrell targeted exactly that sentiment — but even patriotic Americans won’t think money is no object when dropping more than $35,000 on an electric car.Cynical protectionist calculations may also fall apart in the longer run if the programme comes to be regarded as a costly special-interest handout. The use of ethanol as a green fuel a decade or two ago had similar green tech potential. But it’s unclear that its adoption in the US was really helped by becoming an expensive and environmentally suboptimal boondoggle for Iowa corn farmers.Despite the interventionist instincts of those like Breton, the EU is far less likely to succumb to the temptation of self-sufficiency. Its self-imposed limits are its strength. There’s hardly any centralised EU cash to subsidise reshoring: EU member states have so far scraped together only a few billion to subsidise semiconductor investment compared with $52bn proposed in the US.The state-aid regime constraining handouts has been relaxed for products like semiconductors, but it’s well short of the free-for-all in America. Tesla last year withdrew an application for €1.1bn in state aid from Germany, reportedly because of the restrictive rules attached. And the EU, while not faultless, has shown more respect for trade rules than the US under Trump and Biden. So far, its efforts have mainly been limited to modest public-private initiatives such as the Battery Alliance.Japan, meanwhile, created a catalytic fund for its corporations to examine bringing supply chains back from China, but the need to be invested in China to sell to the Chinese market has restrained Japanese companies from major restructuring.It’s a reasonable contention that the advanced economies need a dose of government intervention to encourage resilience, focused narrowly on excessive dependence on particular inputs. But at least such ideas should be run through institutional policy filters to screen out misguided projects. The EU has such mechanisms, not entirely by design; the US less so. It’s very possible that Europe’s protectionists will be saved from themselves.
184  Ebrahim Raisi, Iran’s president, met Russia’s Vladimir Putin on Wednesday as the Islamic republic seeks to expand relations with Moscow and Beijing to better withstand political and economic pressure from the US.“We would like to have sustainable and comprehensive relations with our friend, Russia,” Raisi said in his meeting with Putin in the Kremlin, based on short videos released on Iranian state media.“We see no restrictions in developing relations. [which] will be strategic,” he added. The videos also showed Putin sending his best regards to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader. Raisi had earlier described the trip as a potential “turning point” in relations. “We have common interests which can help strengthen security in the region and prevent unilateralism [by the US],” he added.Putin thanked Raisi for Iran’s help “fighting terrorism” in Syria and said they would discuss the nuclear deal and Afghanistan.The meeting in Moscow comes as Iranian diplomats negotiate with world powers in Vienna to help resurrect the 2015 nuclear deal, which collapsed after the US abandoned it in 2018.While Iran says it is committed to serious negotiations in Vienna with the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China — as well as indirect talks with the US — it has set tough conditions for Washington.Iran says it will roll back its nuclear advances, made since former US president Donald Trump abandoned the deal and reimposed sanctions, only if the US lifts all sanctions and guarantees no future government will pull out of the agreement.Iranian, European and Russian diplomats have suggested some progress has been made in the talks. There is speculation in Tehran that Russia, which has taken a more prominent role in this round of talks, has urged the Islamic republic to make concessions. Few concrete details of the talks are available.For now, Raisi and his officials have made clear economic progress will not be put on hold while the talks take place.“Iran must export its crude and petrochemical products and minerals in order to develop its infrastructure and import technology so that the economy can grow,” said Majid-Reza Hariri, head of the Iran-China Chamber of Commerce.“We are ready to do business with all countries other than the US and Israel. But if other countries are not willing, we cannot lie down until we die. China is ready to enter into all our markets.”China has been Iran’s top trading partner since 2014 and the main destination for Tehran’s crude exports in recent years. China’s purchase of oil has been vital for Iran’s economic survival and recent growth. Last week, Hossein Amirabdollahian, Iran’s foreign minister, met Wang Yi, his Chinese counterpart, to mark the start of the implementation of a 25-year comprehensive co-operation plan signed last year.Wang reiterated that Beijing was against the US sanctions. “China firmly opposes illegal unilateral sanctions against Iran, political manipulation on human rights and other issues, and gross interference in the internal affairs of Iran and other regional countries,” he said, according to China’s foreign ministry.The two countries’ long-term co-operation ranged from energy, infrastructure, production capacity, science and technology to medical and healthcare, agriculture, fisheries and cyber security, the ministry added.Trade with Russia has also risen in recent months. The value of the two countries’ total trade stood at $1.6bn over nine months ending in late December, up 41 per cent over the corresponding period of the previous year, Iran’s official figures show. Raisi said on Wednesday he hoped it would increase further.While some hardline politicians in Iran have promoted the idea of a long-term agreement with Russia similar to the one with China, the two countries’ close links in Syria have attracted domestic criticism. Iran and Russia allied together to bolster the regime of Bashar al-Assad but Iranian analysts say Moscow later sidelined Iran.Iran’s foreign minister said on Tuesday that Raisi’s visit was vital to Iran’s approach of “look toward east” — rather than west.“There is little doubt that it benefits Iran to have balanced relations with Russia,” said Ahmad Zeidabadi, a reformist analyst. “But the way some authorities defend Putin’s Russia and his policies is a total disgrace and historical shame.”
185  The yield on the 10-year Bund rose as high as 0.013 per cent on Wednesday, the highest level since May 2019, reflecting a drop in the price of the debt. In mid-December, the Bund yield had registered about minus 0.4 per cent.The global rise in yields, led by the US, reflects investor angst that policymakers will need to act quickly to cool intense price growth that has taken hold across big economies. Higher than expected UK inflation figures on Wednesday added to the upward pressure on global bond yields.Underscoring the recent shift in eurozone bond markets, Greece on Wednesday paid the highest borrowing cost on new 10-year debt since March 2019.“You’ve got expectations of tightening everywhere, so the momentum is in favour of higher yields,” said Andrea Iannelli, investment director at Fidelity International. “The eurozone is no exception to that.”The German government’s 10-year borrowing rate had been negative for nearly three years, signifying investors were prepared to pay for the privilege of lending their money to Berlin for periods of a decade or more. But the global debt sell-off at the start of 2022 has been enough to drag the euro area’s most important reference rate above zero.A positive 10-year yield could make the debt more attractive to investors and will have knock-on effects for borrowing costs in other eurozone member states and companies.“It has come to something when a basis point or two starts to look exciting,” said James Athey, a portfolio manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments, referring to moves of a hundredth of a percentage point. “It underlines how bond investors have really been starved for many years.”Eurozone inflation climbed to 5 per cent in December, setting a record since the single currency was created more than two decades ago, and raising doubts over how quickly price pressures will ease this year.At its December meeting, the European Central Bank announced it would continue its asset purchases after its emergency bond-buying programme runs out in March, but at a slower rate than investors had expected.That, in combination with signs that the US and UK are edging towards tighter policy, has pushed German bond yields higher. Markets are now expecting the Bank of England to raise interest rates three times by August, following Wednesday’s data showing inflation at the highest level in 30 years.Carsten Brzeski, head of macro research at ING, described the Bund yield’s shift above zero as “symbolically important” because it “reflects a general change in monetary policy in the US but also in the eurozone with central banks entering the exit lane in response to rising inflation”. Across the Atlantic, the two-year US government bond yield, which is considered to be particularly sensitive to changes in expectations for monetary policy, hit 1 per cent on Tuesday for the first time since February 2020 as markets priced in four rate rises by the Federal Reserve this year. The sell-off in government debt also pointed to investor confidence that the Omicron coronavirus variant will fail to derail a global economic recovery, potentially giving central banks the opportunity to dial back purchases and raise interest rates.Markets are now pricing in two 0.1 percentage point interest rate rises from the ECB by the end of the year, despite the central bank’s insistence that higher borrowing costs in 2022 are not consistent with its guidance. The ECB has committed to maintain “favourable financing conditions” and last year described a rise in eurozone bond yields caused by a spillover from US bond markets as “unwelcome” and pushed back by increasing the pace of its bond purchases. “The rise in bond yields could worsen financing conditions in the eyes of the ECB and they will clearly look into that,” said Brzeski.

186  Turkey and the United Arab Emirates signed a $5bn deal to boost Ankara’s foreign currency reserves in the latest sign of warming ties between the two former arch rivals.The two nations’ central banks announced a swap agreement that they said would be worth 18bn dirhams ($4.9bn) and 64bn lira.Khaled Mohamed Balama, governor of the UAE central bank, said that the agreement “reflects each nation’s desire to enhance bilateral co-operation in financial matters, particularly in the fields of trade and investments between the two countries”.His Turkish counterpart, Sahap Kavcioglu, said that it demonstrated their commitment “to deepen bilateral trade in local currencies in order to advance economic and financial relations between our countries”.Turkey, which has a large foreign debt burden, has suffered a renewed dip in its reserves of foreign currency after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ordered a series of aggressive interest rate cuts in the final months of 2021 despite soaring inflation.The country’s deeply negative real interest rates have put heavy pressure on the Turkish lira, which lost about 45 per cent of its value against the dollar last year. Turkish authorities spent billions of dollars in the final weeks of 2021 in a bid to halt its freefall.The deal — the latest in a succession of swap agreements that Turkey has signed with global central banks — is a borrowing agreement rather than a concrete investment in the country.While it will boost the country’s reported reserve figures, Ibrahim Aksoy, an analyst at HSBC in Istanbul, said he did not expect the deal to have a “significant impact” on the lira because market players followed the level of reserves excluding swap agreements. Once borrowed money — including swaps with other central banks — are stripped out, Turkey’s net foreign currency reserves are deeply negative.Still, Turkish officials will hope that the agreement is a herald of further investment from the Gulf nation as a thaw in their once bitter relationship gathers pace.Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, promised in November that his country would invest $10bn in Turkey when he met Erdogan on his first visit to Ankara in almost a decade.The head of ADQ, an Abu Dhabi state investment vehicle, told the Financial Times earlier this month that the fund was in discussions with Turkey’s sovereign wealth fund about “a couple of opportunities” in the country, including companies within its portfolio.Turkey and the UAE spent much of the past decade competing for influence in the region after backing opposing sides in popular uprisings that rocked the Arab world in 2011. But both countries have begun recalibrating their foreign policy over the past year, driven by the election of Joe Biden as US president and the desire to boost their economies.Sheikh Mohammed has been shifting his focus towards economic diplomacy as the UAE seeks to bolster its post-pandemic recovery. Erdogan, meanwhile, has made overtures to a string of former regional foes as he seeks to attract foreign investment from the Gulf amid economic turmoil at home.Erdogan, who has also been making moves towards Egypt and Israel, has said that he plans to travel to Saudi Arabia next month. If it goes ahead, the trip will be his first visit to the kingdom since the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate at Istanbul in 2018, which plunged relations between the two countries into crisis.
187  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.As is customary halfway through its five-year term, the European parliament yesterday reshuffled its leadership, electing Malta’s centre-right lawmaker Roberta Metsola as its president — along with more than a dozen vice-presidents. We’ll take stock of how the EU institution, which prides itself on being its only directly elected body, has fared so far and why its waning influence may be difficult to restore.Meanwhile, in Brussels, after two days of meetings among EU finance ministers, a few broad areas of consensus on potential reforms to the bloc’s fiscal rules are starting to emerge. But the devil still lurks in the yet-to-be-defined details.And in transparency news, a fresh fight is brewing over what constitutes official communication, as the European Commission is routinely rejecting calls for the release of instant messages exchanged, for instance, between Ursula von der Leyen and the chief executive of Pfizer.The European parliament’s class of 2019 is that dog that never barked, writes Mehreen Khan in Strasbourg.Fears over the troublemaking capacity of a historically fractured parliament, the end of a longstanding left-right grand coalition and the arrival of a sizeable batch of unruly new MEPs are all but a distant memory.For all the early hype, for the last two-and-a-half years the European parliament has failed to flex its muscles on key EU policy areas, ceding more ground to a dominant EU Council.The high-water mark of parliamentary influence came at the start of the new electoral mandate in the summer of 2019, when MEPs ditched three of Ursula von der Leyen’s commissioner candidates — the most spectacular of which was the defenestration of France’s Sylvie Goulard. But MEPs early flexing was not a sign of things to come.The pandemic is partly to blame. Unlike with rival institutions in the council and its member state diplomats (known as Coreper), Covid-19 lockdowns forced MEPs to conduct much of their business online, cancelling plenary sessions and disrupting committee meetings that are the bread and butter of legislative dealmaking.Pandemic-induced institutional weakness has combined with other factors, including the absence of commanding group leaders and standout MEPs, to help consign the EP to a marginal role.The parliament has lost major battles to the council, including a failure to secure a legislative role in the governance of the EU’s historical leap into joint borrowing in the form of the pandemic recovery fund. MEPs have tirelessly banged the drum on the rule of law, but ultimately ended up with an ambiguous conditionality mechanism whose fate is being decided in the EU’s highest court. The parliament’s decision to sue the commission for not wielding the tool against Hungary and Poland has had little impact on von der Leyen’s calculations so far.MEPs are now trying to shake off their midterm blues by reviving some much-needed political co-operation inside the house. The three main groups made up of the centre right, socialists and liberals have agreed a “common statement” laying out their priorities for the next 2.5 years. It coincides with the election of the new parliament president, conservative Roberta Metsola, who will boast a bumper cross-party majority.Manfred Weber, veteran leader of the European People’s party, hopes the midterm will be a fresh start for the class of 2019. He wants strengthened group co-operation and Metsola’s appointment to help reestablish the parliament’s “visibility”. The next 2.5 years will be the true test of the parliament’s institutional heft. MEPs will go toe-to-toe with member states in marathon negotiations over standout legislation such as the Green Deal. Major institutional questions, such as how to appoint the next commission president, will also need to be determined. It might only then be that the legacy of the class of 2019 will be decided.Oil prices surpassed a seven-year high yesterday, threatening to fuel a further rise in global inflation, on bets that demand for crude could outstrip supply later this year. Goldman Sachs expects oil inventories across OECD countries to reach their lowest levels since 2000 by the middle of the year, pushing the price past the $100 mark by 2023. (More here)Emerging from two days of meetings, EU commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis yesterday declared he could spy some early areas of “broad agreement” over reforms to the EU’s budget rules, writes Sam Fleming in Brussels.For his part, Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, described discussions on the topic as “serene”, with a striking convergence of views.There is, however, a big difference between uncovering patches of common ground and the complex job of hammering out a detailed and coherent set of reforms that can command the support of the member states.France’s president Emmanuel Macron, allied with Italy’s Mario Draghi, has set forth a particularly ambitious agenda, seeking to embed incentives for a broad range of public investment into the Stability and Growth Pact. Such innovations have typically been viewed sceptically in the more frugal north of the EU.The position of Christian Lindner, the new German finance minister, will be critical. Describing himself as a “friendly hawk”, the liberal member of the German coalition placed notably heavy emphasis both on the importance of reducing public debt and on fighting inflation.He also observed that the Stability and Growth Pact has proven its flexibility in its current, unchanged form, which is not a point that advocates of far-reaching reform like to emphasise.Meanwhile, the position of the Netherlands — the traditional standard-bearer for frugality — remains unclear. The Netherlands is boosting public investment and has in its new finance minister, Sigrid Kaag, an enthusiast for European engagement. But it is too soon to say what that will mean when it comes to detailed changes to the SGP.So where does Dombrovskis see signs of a consensus?The commission executive vice-president said member states want to simplify the framework, move away from hard-to-measure indicators such as output gaps and take a fresh look at the overly draconian debt rule that requires indebtedness to be reduced by a 20th of the distance from the EU’s 60 per cent objective every year. Debt reduction should be growth-friendly and gradual, and leave room for “high quality” public investments.For his part, Le Maire dismissed as urban myth the idea that he and his German counterpart are on different pages when it comes to the need to tackle public debt. The two ministers “share the same desire to find a new balance” in the EU’s fiscal rules between investment and consolidating government finances, said Le Maire.What remains entirely unclear at this stage of discussions is exactly where this “new balance” actually lies. Striking it will be one of the most politically difficult tasks on the EU’s 2022 agenda.Remember the texts that commission president Ursula von der Leyen exchanged with Pfizer boss Albert Bourla last year when trying to secure doses of its vaccine? The commission would rather you did not, writes Andy Bounds in Brussels.After German magazine Der Spiegel was denied access to them in November, Dutch MEP Sophie in t’Veld asked why they could not be released. Vera Jourova, commissioner for transparency, replied yesterday to say such messages were not covered by document-keeping rules.“Due to their shortlived and ephemeral nature, text and instant messages are not meant to contain important information in relation to policies, activities and decisions of the Commission,” Jourova said. They are deleted after six months unless saved as an email or in another format.But Jourova may not have the last word.The EU ombudsman Emily O’Reilly, who polices the institutions’ compliance with regulations, is compiling a report into the matter after a complaint by Alexander Fanta, a journalist at Netzpolitik.org, a German-language news website. She has already demanded the regulation, produced in 2001, be modernised to cover messages.If O’Reilly calls on the commission to produce the texts it would have to choose whether to comply or ride out a wave of criticism from MEPs and transparency activists. That’s if they have not yet been deleted.
188  The author is president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and served as US ambassador to Nato from 2009 to 2013After a full week of diplomacy with Russia, and with rumblings of war in Ukraine, the central question of the crisis remains: what does President Vladimir Putin really want? Even Russian diplomats who met US, Nato and European officials in Geneva, Brussels and Vienna last week suggested they didn’t know Putin’s bottom line. But they all had the same talking points: accept our demands or face “catastrophic consequences”.To be sure, Moscow’s demands are clear. It wants to end Nato’s eastern enlargement, above all to Ukraine. It wants to ban offensive weapons near Russia’s borders — again, especially in Ukraine. And it wants Nato to withdraw all military forces and infrastructure it deployed to the 14 new members that have joined since 1999.The problem with these demands is that Moscow knows they are non-starters for Nato. The possibility of adding new members is foreseen in Nato’s founding treaty and is a practice that dates to 1952. And the decision on how to provide security for all its members is Nato’s, not Russia’s.At the same time, attacking Ukraine is hardly the best way to achieve Moscow’s demands. It would strengthen Ukrainian public support to align with the west, as when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. It would lead to more material support for Ukraine to defend itself. It would increase the US and Nato military presence on Russia’s borders.For all Russia’s focus on Nato and its past actions, the answer to what Putin wants doesn’t lie in Brussels or Washington. It lies in Moscow. While Putin surely would have preferred it if Nato had not expanded, his real issue is with the collapse in 1991 of the Soviet Union, which he once described as “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century”. This “catastrophe” left Russia surrounded by independent countries, each able to chart its own future.Russia remains the most powerful post-Soviet state. It has a seat on the UN Security Council, the strongest military and the world’s largest nuclear arsenal. Even so, what Putin fears most is the independence of Russia’s neighbours — not because they pose a military threat to the country’s security, but because they pose a political threat to his rule.Putin worries that if any of these states becomes a successful and prosperous democracy, let alone fully integrates with the west, the Russian people will demand the same. To forestall that, Putin has tried to ensure the neighbouring states are run by strongmen dependent on Russia to stay in power.Putin was spooked by the so-called colour revolutions in Georgia and Ukraine in the early 2000s. He reacted fiercely to popular discontent at home in 2011-2012 by ordering a crackdown on widespread public protests.In 2014, when the Maidan protests caused Viktor Yanukovich, the Russian-backed president, to flee Ukraine, Putin annexed Crimea and sponsored an insurgency in the Donbas region that continues to this day. In 2020, Putin backed Alexander Lukashenko’s suppression of peaceful demonstrators protesting against fraudulent elections in Belarus. This month, the Russian president sent troops into Kazakhstan to halt another uprising.As he propped up strongmen abroad, Putin sought to strengthen himself at home by changing the constitution to let him stay in power until at least 2036, assassinating and jailing his opponents, closing independent media outlets and branding those in civil society “foreign agents”. Putin has justified these actions as necessary to defend Russia from a hostile west — exemplified, in his view, by foreigners instigating colour revolutions in its neighbours and Nato moving closer to its borders.The latest crisis must be viewed from this larger perspective. Ukraine isn’t threatening Russia, and neither is Nato, which has so far deployed only a few battalions east that are no match for the Russian forces amassed around Ukraine. Rather, Putin has manufactured this crisis to retake control of Ukraine — either directly, or indirectly by destabilising the government through sabotage, cyber attacks and other forms of hybrid warfare.Putin must not succeed. Ukraine’s independence and its commitment to democracy, however precarious at times, are what stand between security and stability in Europe and the revival of Russian expansionism.Promising an end to Nato enlargement or withdrawing forces from the east will not stop Putin. Only full support of Ukraine can do that, which is why the US and Nato must supply Kyiv with all the weapons and capabilities it needs to defend itself.
189  A cyber attack on Ukraine’s government last week has exposed widespread uncertainty in the EU over a pledge to punish Moscow for further aggression against Kyiv, with member states split over what scale of hostile action should trigger sanctions.The EU, alongside the US and UK, has warned that Russia will face sanctions entailing “massive consequences and severe costs” in the event of an attack on Ukraine. They want to deter a feared assault sparked by the deployment of more than 100,000 troops close to the country’s border.But EU countries do not agree on what scale of attack would trigger a response. Some argue that so-called hybrid attacks — such as deploying cyber weapons or a “false flag” operation sparking a response — may not meet the threshold, according to four officials involved in the discussions.Officials said informal talks last week hosted by France made clear the divergence.“There was no agreement at all on what aggression means, and very big differences between states,” said a person involved in the talks. “Some want all kinds of hybrid actions to be included, others aren’t far away from only full invasion [being enough to trigger sanctions].”“We have reached unity on the need to respond to a Russian attack, but now we lack it on what a Russian attack should be defined as,” the person added. Officials from across the EU are continuing talks on the issue ahead of a summit of foreign ministers on Monday.The cyber attack on Ukraine last week, which took down scores of government websites, has not been formally attributed to Moscow but Kyiv has said that so far evidence points to its being launched from Russia. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly said that they expect Russia to use cyber warfare before and during any potential military assault.The EU’s list of potential sanctions is being drawn up by the European Commission, involving what officials say is unprecedented co-ordination with US officials. But deployment will need approval from the 27 member states.The debate comes as the US seeks to bring Brussels in line with the Biden administration’s approach to deterrence, amid concern that Russian president Vladimir Putin is stepping up possible attack preparations with renewed deployments of troops and arms to sites on Ukraine’s east and south.Officials from some member states, particularly eastern and northern countries geographically closer to Russia, worry that without a defined trigger for sanctions bigger countries such as France or Germany would in effect take a political decision on whether the bloc should respond to any steps taken by Moscow.That has raised concerns that moves short of a full invasion, such as the use of proxy fighters or intentional sabotage inside Ukraine used as a pretext for Russian intervention — as the US warned last week was being planned by Moscow — could be overlooked by some EU states reluctant to impose sanctions.“Defining what ‘when something happens’ means is right now the biggest question,” a second person told the Financial Times. “We don’t have a system for automatic application of sanctions.As it stands right now, it will depend on the political mood.” “That makes the situation very unclear.[and] you can be sure that the Americans won’t just be sitting around waiting,” they added.Victoria Nuland, US undersecretary of state, told the FT last week that the cyber attack was “part of the Russian playbook” and that the US and its allies were ready to inflict “very sharp pain very fast” on Moscow.EU foreign ministers were meeting in France last week as the cyber attack on Ukraine unfolded. Josep Borrell, the EU’s top diplomat, said after the informal meeting that there was agreement that the EU should respond to Russian aggression with “restrictive measures that will be adopted in co-ordination with our partners”.
190  German banks are becoming too complacent about the risk of borrowers defaulting and the potential for interest rates to rise, particularly in the country’s booming mortgage market, the deputy head of its central bank has warned.Claudia Buch, vice-president of the Bundesbank, told the Financial Times that banks had emerged relatively unscathed from the recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic but are overly optimistic about the future.“We think credit risks are underestimated,” said Buch. “The models that banks and market participants are using are based on historical data. These data might underestimate future macro risk, which is an implicit bias.”Buch, a member of Germany’s financial stability committee alongside officials from the finance ministry and the financial watchdog BaFin, added that “we see a shift within the corporate loan portfolios of banks to the relatively weaker firms”.Although the German economy contracted 4.6 per cent in 2020 after the pandemic hit — a record postwar recession — the number of companies going bankrupt has fallen sharply thanks to generous government loan guarantees and wage subsidies for furloughed staff.“All the [risk] indicators we look at, including the credit to GDP gap, are pointing upwards,” said Buch. “We are concerned about mortgages but we are also very concerned about this macro environment, which if you look at recent history looks too benign to be true.”One of the biggest areas of concern is the German property market, where house prices rose 12 per cent and mortgage lending increased 7.2 per cent in the year to September — both reaching multi-decade highs, despite the fallout from the pandemic.Germany’s financial regulators have responded last week by announcing a €22bn increase in the amount of capital they require banks to hold by February 2023 and promising to supervise lending standards more closely.This means German banks will need an extra capital buffer equal to 0.75 per cent of their domestic assets and another equal to 2 per cent of their residential mortgages — both adjusted for riskiness. A more modest version of the policy was proposed in 2019 but then dropped because of the pandemic.The extra capital buffers — which mirror similar plans in the UK, Sweden, Norway and Denmark — are designed to make banks more resilient by allowing them to absorb potential future losses without having to cut the supply of credit to businesses and households.The association of German banks complained that the changes came “at an inopportune time” amid high economic uncertainty and risked “putting a handbrake” on their lending capacity that could push more business to less regulated mortgage providers.But Buch said German banks had increased the excess capital they hold above minimum requirements by about €30bn in the past two years to almost €190bn, meaning only “a very, very small fraction” of them need to raise extra capital now.German interest rates have fallen to record lows in recent years, after the European Central Bank cut its deposit rate to minus 0.5 per cent and bought more than €4.5tn of bonds. Several of the country’s banks are offering 10- or 15-year mortgages at rates below 1 per cent, according to Tatjana Gopp at Baufi24, a German mortgage adviser.The Bundesbank vice-president said banks had increased their “exposure to interest rate risk” as the proportion of new German mortgages with interest rates fixed for at least 10 years had more than doubled since 2010, when the housing market upswing started.“There is a much longer credit maturity on these mortgages outstanding, meaning that if interest rates increase the banks would have higher refinancing costs but their asset values wouldn’t change that much,” she said.The ECB has said it is “very unlikely” to raise interest rates this year, but markets are pricing in a 0.1 percentage point increase in its deposit rate in October.Low interest rates have helped boost German house prices by almost 60 per cent since 2015 and the Bundesbank estimates the market is now 15 to 30 per cent overvalued.Buch said she hoped the new rules would provide “a bit of an incentive” for lenders to “think twice” about the recent trend for some to provide mortgages for the entire value of a property with little or no deposit. If such high-risk mortgages proliferate, regulators could impose new rules limiting the amount banks can lend against a property.“The intention is not really to tame the property price cycle but to make sure that whatever financing there is sound and the borrowers can actually afford it,” she added.
191  However, an important divergence over how to cope with the pandemic has emerged between China and the world’s other big economies — which may grow in significance over the course of 2022. China remains determined to pursue a zero-Covid strategy. By contrast, the US, the EU and most of the large Asian economies are having to learn to live with Covid-19. The government of Xi Jinping points to a much lower death toll as a vindication of China’s strategy: the official Chinese toll is still under 5,000 deaths, compared with over 800,000 in the US. But persisting with this approach involves punishing lockdowns in big Chinese cities, such as Xi’an, as well as extreme restrictions on travel, which have hugely reduced interaction between China and the outside world. The zero-Covid goal may also become harder to achieve if new and more transmissible variants of Covid emerge. The broader danger for the international system, though, is that Covid will widen the existing economic and geopolitical divides between Beijing and the west. That, in turn, could add to strains on the world trade system — as well as increasing the danger of military tensions over Taiwan and the South China Sea.A more immediate threat of conflict is posed by Russia’s build-up of troops on its border with Ukraine. Western intelligence analysts began the year believing that it is more likely than not that Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, will give the order for an attack on Ukraine, probably in early February. Although it is possible that intensive diplomacy between the White House and the Kremlin — with some input from the EU — will defuse the crisis, Russia described last week’s talks in Geneva and Brussels as “unsuccessful”. The scale, aims and impact of any invasion of Ukraine remain unclear. The likeliest scenario seems to be some sort of Russian offensive in the east of the country with the aim of bolstering the separatist movement there, or even annexing part of Ukraine, following the model of the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Broader Russian goals might include causing the government of Ukraine to collapse and be replaced by a new, pro-Kremlin administration. Making the US and Nato look weak and discredited are also longstanding Russian goals. However, even a limited military assault on Ukraine would carry substantial risks for Putin. After the annexation of Crimea, the Russian leader exulted that he had achieved his goal without a shot being fired. But an invasion of eastern Ukraine is likely to be a bloody affair. The US government has also threatened Russia with severe economic sanctions. The threat most feared by the Kremlin would be the exclusion of Russia from Swift, the international money-transfer system. This could have a devastating effect on Russian international trade. But the US might still hesitate to use the Swift weapon because the EU remains very dependent on imports of Russian gas — and energy prices are already rising sharply in Europe, which is likely to cause political grief for its leaders.Europe, in any case, faces a year of political uncertainty. In the past decade Angela Merkel, the former German chancellor, was the dominant political figure in the EU. Her careful, deliberative style helped it weather a series of crises, including Greece’s debt meltdown, Brexit and the Trump presidency. But Merkel has now retired from politics and her replacement Olaf Scholtz has yet to be tested by a serious crisis.In Merkel’s absence, Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, has an opportunity to set the European agenda — particularly given that France will hold the presidency of the EU for the first six months of the year. But Macron faces a tricky re-election battle in April. He is likely to defeat either of the far-right candidates, Marine Le Pen or Eric Zemmour, if they make it to the run-off. A contest against Valérie Pécresse, the standard bearer of the centre-right, could be considerably closer. Whatever the eventual outcome, the French presidential election campaign looks set to be bitter. The far right’s emphasis on issues of identity and immigration is likely to drive debate, in an atmosphere already radicalised by protests against coronavirus restrictions. April or May will also be when elections take place in Hungary, which could put an end to the premiership of Viktor Orban, the self-styled champion of “illiberal democracy” within the EU. Orban’s high-profile opposition to migration and “globalism” — as well as his avowed cultural conservatism — have raised his profile in the US, where has been endorsed by Donald Trump.Trump himself will be looking to the midterm elections of November 2022 to deliver a powerful blow to the Biden administration — and to prepare the ground for a possible comeback in the 2024 presidential election. With inflation rising and the pandemic still not under control, it seems likely that the Democrats will indeed lose control of both houses of Congress in November.Both Trump and Orban have capitalised on fears of illegal migration. That issue is likely to rise up the political agenda again in 2022. The inability of the WEF even to convene in person, for a second year in succession, is an unfortunate symbol of the inability of world leaders to address the world’s most dangerous problemsThe situation on the US southern border remains chaotic, with large numbers of migrants from Central America sparking bitter public debate on the best policy response. The economy of Afghanistan is close to collapse and, with famine looming, millions more refugees are likely to try to leave the country.Conflicts in Africa are also likely to cause mass casualties and economic damage, driving flows of migrants towards Europe. The war in Ethiopia, Africa’s second most populous country, could intensify. Sudan is threatened by political turmoil, too, as civilian demonstrators press for the military to leave power. In normal times, the World Economic Forum would feature numerous sessions on topics such as these, in which business leaders, academics and international officials would thrash over the issues — as part of Davos’s often-mocked commitment to “improving the state of the world”. The inability of the WEF even to convene in person, for a second year in succession, is an unfortunate symbol of the inability of world leaders to address the world’s most dangerous problems.
192  The Moex index fell by 6.5 per cent, taking its losses to about 13 per cent over the past four trading sessions, while Russian government debt continued to slide. The dollar-denominated RTS index fell 7.3 per cent, hitting its lowest level since late 2020.“We are seeing dislocations in the pricing of rock solid fundamental stocks, as certain western investors are exiting Russia at ‘any price’. The pain looks to continue into the days to come,” said Luis Saenz, head of international distribution at Sinara Financial Corporation. The rouble fell by 0.9 per cent on Tuesday to 76.7 to the dollar, close to a nine-month low.Though President Vladimir Putin denies he is planning to attack Ukraine, he has threatened an unspecified “military-technical response” if the west does not meet sweeping Russian security demands.The US and EU have threatened to impose strong sanctions in response to any attack, which could include moves to cut Russian banks off from the global financial system and restricting the oil and gas exports that provide half of the Kremlin’s budget revenue. Talks in Geneva and Brussels to discuss Russia’s grievances with Nato hit a “dead end” last week.“I would be surprised if this turns into a full-fledged conflict, but that’s not what the market seems to think,” said Richard House, head of emerging market debt at Allianz Global Investors. “If it does, financial sanctions would follow pretty quickly.”Shares in giant state-run lender Sberbank, which is often seen as a proxy for the Russian state, fell 8.5 per cent on Tuesday to a three-month low.The volatility sent yields on Russia’s 10-year rouble-denominated bonds, known as OFZs, to their highest level since early 2016, prompting the finance ministry to cancel a weekly rouble bond auction scheduled for Wednesday. Russia’s dollar-denominated bonds have also been under pressure, with one maturing in 2047 trading with a yield of around 4.5 per cent, from about 3.6 per cent at the end of 2021.For foreign holders of Russia’s bonds, the greatest threat was US-imposed sanctions that would prevent trading of existing debt in the secondary market, according to House. This in turn would mean Russian bonds would probably be ejected from indices tracked by hundreds of billions of dollars.“That would be a situation where you have a lot of forced sellers and not many buyers,” he added.The sell-off in Russian assets was likely to continue as long as geopolitical tensions over Ukraine persist and investors dump emerging market assets in countries with high interest rates and inflation, analysts at Alfa-Bank wrote.Elsewhere in emerging markets, Turkish stocks sustained a fresh blow ahead of a central bank meeting later this week. The benchmark Bist 100 stock index dropped 5.1 per cent, with the lira falling about 1.5 per cent against the US dollar.The Turkish central bank, which announces its latest policy decision on Thursday, is expected to keep interest rates on hold despite consumer prices surging 36 per cent in December, compared with the same month in 2020. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has pursued an unorthodox policy of pushing the country’s central bank to cut interest rates despite calls from analysts and economists to raise them to fight high inflation.
193  Independent Italian lawmaker Laura Granato was stunned by the phone call she received this month. “Hello, this is Mr Bunga Bunga,” said the familiar voice on the other end. It was Silvio Berlusconi.Ahead of a crucial presidential election, the 85-year-old media tycoon and former Italian prime minister has attempted a political comeback with a bid to rally cross-party support around his barely disguised self-candidacy for the presidency.With the rightwing League and Brothers of Italy having expressed public support for their former coalition leader, Berlusconi is seeking to convince independents, centrists and rebel members of the populist Five Star Movement.Granato, who was previously affiliated with Five Star, revealed her conversation with Berlusconi during a radio interview, saying the two had talked about vaccines and the Italian justice system. Berlusconi could not be reached for comment.Berlusconi, whose on-off tenure as prime minister lasted from the mid-1990s to 2011 was tainted by sex scandals and corruption allegations, remains a deeply divisive figure in Italian politics.His efforts to orchestrate a comeback have sparked fears among centre-left politicians and political analysts over the future of the national unity government, which has brought right and left together behind Prime Minister Mario Draghi.The worry is that the media tycoon’s de facto candidacy will derail efforts to reach a cross-party agreement over a new president — probably Draghi himself — and complicate the election process, further heightening the risks of a government crisis that could push Italy towards early elections.As for having Berlusconi as president, it “would pose a problem of international credibility of Italian institutions, with extremely serious consequences that would lead to a political earthquake,” deputy Democratic party secretary Peppe Provenzano told the Financial Times.Massimo Giannini, editor-in-chief of Italian daily La Stampa, wrote that a Berlusconi presidency could only materialise in a country “of hilarity and oblivion”, referencing the former prime minister’s record of scandals.Italy’s president is chosen by members of parliament and regional delegates. Candidates must be supported by two-thirds of the electors to win, though the required majority drops to more than half of electors once voting reaches a fourth round.Draghi, who is seen as the frontrunner for the job although no formal nomination procedure exists, has said Italy’s next president should be a unifying figure who will maintain the spirit of dialogue and collaboration of his national unity government.He has suggested that a divisive presidential election would make it tough for him to carry on with passing reforms and taking difficult, often unpopular, decisions to contain the spread of Covid-19.But Berlusconi is convinced this is his last great chance after 25 years of public service, according to lawmakers from his party. “He wants to walk out the door through the front gate,” said one member of Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party, speaking on condition of anonymity.Despite his energetic efforts — which have included publishing pictures of his younger self accompanied by lists of his accomplishments in his family’s daily, Il Giornale — even many of Berlusconi’s allies see his emergence as president unlikely.Gianni Letta, a former MP and government official with Forza Italia and a longtime friend of Berlusconi, said “electors should be inspired by the national interest, not the interest of one [political] camp”. Another political ally, Vittorio Sgarbi, said Berlusconi was sad: “The situation is very difficult.”The media tycoon left government at the height of Italy’s debt crisis, after being placed under pressure by rating agencies and the European Central Bank — led at the time by Draghi.According to Francesco Galietti, founder and chief executive of Policy Sonar, a Rome-based political risk consultancy, Berlusconi’s ties to Vladimir Putin could also haunt the Forza Italia leader, especially given heightened tensions between the EU and Russia.“Berlusconi has an original sin that makes him radioactive, and that is proximity to Russia,” Galietti said. “He was seen as too close to Russia and you don’t recover from that.”Reports on Tuesday suggested Berlusconi was aware that he was struggling to find enough support and could decide to step away from the contest before the formal presidential election process starts on Monday.“Berlusconi knows his limits, where the red line is,” said Galietti.League leader Matteo Salvini has also spoken of “an alternative plan” — suggesting he was rethinking his party’s stance.Analysts say rightwing parties might prefer to see a Draghi presidency that would help maintain market confidence in Italy’s prospects, especially with the next general election looming in 2023. Salvini said: “While I don’t control his destiny, Draghi as prime minister makes me feel safe in terms of reforms implementation.”That solution could also be supported by the centre-left camp, helping to preserve the spirit of national unity — but much might yet depend on whether Berlusconi continues to aim for a political comeback or whether his allies persuade him to step away.
194  US secretary of state Antony Blinken will meet his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Geneva for talks later this week, as the White House continues to seek an end to tensions over Ukraine amid threats of a renewed Russian invasion.The hastily arranged trip by Blinken, who will first meet Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Wednesday and then the foreign ministers of France, Germany and the UK in Berlin on Thursday, comes after talks last week on Russia’s security demands with the US and Nato reached a “dead end”.Blinken’s meeting with Lavrov was arranged during a phone call on Tuesday, a senior US official said, after the White House warned late last week that Russia had planted operatives in Ukraine for a “false-flag” operation that could be used as a pretext for open aggression against Kyiv.Lavrov dismissed as “speculation” accusations Moscow was planning to attack Ukraine, the Russian foreign ministry said in a readout of the two diplomats’ call. Blinken meanwhile urged on Lavrov the need for diplomacy to de-escalate tensions surrounding Russia’s military build-up in and around Ukraine.“It is still too early to tell if the Russian government is genuinely interested in diplomacy.I just can’t judge that now,” the senior US official said of Blinken’s forthcoming trip. But “if there is an opportunity to craft a diplomatic solution here, we certainly will put all of our energy into trying to realise that.”Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, denies he is planning to use force against Ukraine but has massed 100,000 troops at the border and threatened an unspecified “military-technical response” if the US and Nato do not meet Moscow’s demands that the transatlantic military alliance roll back its forces and pledge never to admit Ukraine.Germany’s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock, speaking earlier from Moscow in a joint press conference with Lavrov, similarly warned that time was running out for diplomacy and that Germany and Europe would be forced to act on any threat to EU rules, even if it had an economic cost.“In recent weeks, more than 100,000 Russian soldiers with tanks and armoured vehicles have gathered near Ukraine for no apparent reason,” she said. “It’s hard not to see that as a threat.”The Kremlin on Monday also sent troops to Belarus for joint military exercises that will take place in February on Belarus’s western flank, which borders the EU, and its southern border, which abuts Ukraine.“This is neither an exercise or normal troop movement. It is a show of strength designed to cause or give false pretext for crisis,” the US official said of the joint drills. “We are now at a stage where Russia could at any point launch an attack on Ukraine.”The US and its European allies have said Russia’s demands — which would essentially rewrite Europe’s post-cold war security order — are unacceptable, and have threatened crippling sanctions if Moscow uses force against Ukraine.Though the west remains divided on the specific steps, they would probably go far beyond the sanctions that failed to deter Russia from seizing the Crimean peninsula and fuelling the war in the eastern Ukrainian Donbas border region in 2014.German chancellor Olaf Scholz, speaking in Berlin, said that everything would be on the table if Russia invaded Ukraine, including the contentious Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany. The project has been completed but has yet to receive EU permission to operate.“It is clear that there will be high costs and that everything will have to be discussed if there is a military intervention against Ukraine,” Scholz told reporters after meeting Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary-general.After the EU was sidelined from last week’s talks between Russia and the US and Nato, France and Germany are seeking to revive the four-person Normandy format talks with Russia and Ukraine on the stalled peace process in the Donbas.Lavrov said Russia would welcome US involvement in talks alongside the Normandy format, indicating that the Kremlin saw a possible resolution to the Ukraine crisis as part of a grand bargain on security with the White House.“We have reason to believe that the current administration has a more realistic view on resolving the Ukraine conflict,” Lavrov said after meeting Baerbock.Lavrov repeated Russia’s accusations that Ukraine was attempting to “sabotage” the Minsk treaty and said he hoped the US could force Kyiv to fulfil its obligations to give two Russia-backed, separatist regions special status under Ukraine’s constitution.Ukraine has resisted this step, which it said would give Moscow a veto over its ambitions to join the EU and Nato, and blamed Russia for the talks’ collapse.UK prime minister Boris Johnson warned that Putin must not be “allowed to rewrite the rules” over Ukraine, telling Cabinet ministers during a meeting on Tuesday that Moscow was leading a “disinformation campaign aimed at undermining” Kyiv.Britain has said it is supplying Ukraine with short-range anti-tank missiles, in light of Russia’s “increasingly threatening behaviour”, and that about 100 British military personnel had been deployed to assist with training.
195  The writer is Fritz Stern Chair at the Brookings InstitutionAnnalena Baerbock, Germany’s foreign minister, met her counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Moscow on Tuesday, after a visit to Kyiv the day before. Arguably, a western wind followed her. The US and its European allies held their ground in three rounds of talks with the Russians last week. They were willing to discuss arms control and trust-building measures, they said, but the Kremlin’s key demands were non-starters.Unfortunately, as western capitals ponder whether and how Vladimir Putin might make good on his threat of “military-technical measures” in response to the united allied stance, Europe finds itself in a perfect storm of its own making. It faces a gas price and supply crisis that makes it vulnerable to political blackmail.“Energy trilemma” is a term that describes countries’ ability to provide energy in terms of environmental sustainability, social impact and security. Europe has privileged the first two criteria while neglecting the third. Now it is paying the price.The EU’s “Green Deal” seeks to make Europe carbon-neutral by 2050 and reduce emissions by at least 55 per cent by 2030. These are laudable aims, given the dangers of climate change, and are supported by European public opinion.For years, European countries have been subsidising renewable fuels and switching from coal or nuclear power to relatively cleaner natural gas. The EU’s Third Energy Package of 2009 liberalised gas markets and broke up the monopoly of Gazprom, the Russian state-controlled gas conglomerate, over the European gas market. EU fiscal transfer mechanisms are intended to help weaker European economies through the transition.But a sharp rebound in demand from a pandemic slump, shrinking European gas production and a failure to fully replenish gas storage facilities after last year’s harsh winter, as well as massive demand from China, have conspired to produce months of energy market volatility. Gas prices have soared.Russia, which provides over 40 per cent of EU gas imports, denies restricting supplies to Europe. But Putin taunts the EU for bringing supply volatility on itself. If only German regulators approved the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, Russian gas would again flow abundantly to Europe, Putin suggests. Fatih Birol, the International Energy Agency’s head, said Russia “could increase deliveries by at least one-third” if it chose.On Friday, gas prices jumped again after the Kremlin’s assertion that the week’s talks had failed to address its grievances. Little imagination is required to envisage the explosive effect on Europe’s energy woes of Russia going to war with Ukraine.Berlin’s ruling coalition has trilemma problems of its own. It aims to phase out nuclear power by December 2022, and coal by 2030. Environmental protection rules let small interest groups sue against new wind turbines or power lines. Robert Habeck, the Green economy minister, presented an ambitious climate transition programme last week, but looks likely to lose a fight with the EU, which wants to label gas and nuclear power as green investments.As for energy security, Germany is Gazprom’s main foreign buyer. In 2021, an estimated 50-75 per cent of its gas imports came from Russia. Germany’s gas storage capacity is the largest in the EU, and Gazprom owns many of the underground facilities. Nord Stream 2, once in operation, would consolidate Germany’s energy reliance on Russia and enable the Kremlin to take a crowbar to Europe’s economic cohesion.Yet Putin’s threats and blackmail are dividing Berlin. Baerbock and Habeck insist the option of permanently suspending the pipeline must be on the table to deter the Kremlin. Several senior Social Democrats publicly disagreed last week. Christine Lambrecht, defence minister, even said Nord Stream 2 ought not to be “dragged into this conflict” — this on the day of a US Senate vote on sanctions against the pipeline which the Biden administration had bent over backwards to deflect.Amid these frictions one person has the authority to make a potentially decisive intervention. He is Olaf Scholz, the Social Democratic chancellor, whose statements so far on the crisis have run the gamut from highly cautious to ultra-cautious. Meanwhile we shall find out whether Baerbock got the chance in Moscow to meet Russian civil society as planned. Members of Memorial, the forcibly disbanded civil rights group, or Dmitry Muratov, co-founder of the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta and co-recipient of the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize, could remind Berlin of the meaning of true courage.
196  Malta’s Roberta Metsola of the centre right European People’s Party has been elected as president of the European Parliament, becoming the youngest MEP to hold the post.The 43-year old conservative won a clear majority of votes from MEPs in Strasbourg on Tuesday, making her the first woman to lead the parliament since French politician Nicole Fontaine 20 years ago and only the third ever.Her victory is expected to tighten the EPP’s grip over the parliament after the party retained its position as the largest political group in the 705-seat chamber following Europe-wide elections in 2019. Metsola’s appointment means Malta, the EU’s smallest member state, will occupy one of the EU’s top jobs.Metsola served as vice-president of the parliament since 2020 and will begin a two-and-a-half-year term after succeeding the socialist David Sassoli who had been due to step down this week in a power sharing deal with the EPP. Sassoli died last week after being taken ill in December.Covid-19 measures meant the secret ballot vote was conducted digitally with Metsola, who was first elected as an MEP for Malta’s conservative Nationalist Party in 2013, winning 458 votes out of 690 in a first round vote against two other candidates.“I want people to recapture a sense of belief and enthusiasm for our project,” Metsola said as she acknowledged her victory in a speech on Tuesday.Metsola was the clear favourite to win against rivals from the Greens and the far-left, after a political deal between the parliament’s main three groups to support her candidacy.She has been attacked by political opponents over her stance on abortion, after she voted against a European Parliament report declaring abortion a human right last June.A majority Roman Catholic country, Malta is the only EU member state in which abortion is still illegal.On Tuesday, the mother of four said the European Parliament would support “every woman in our union still fighting for her rights”.“In the next years people across Europe will look to our institution for leadership and direction, while others will continue to test the limits of our democratic values and European principles,” she added. “We must fight back against the anti-EU narrative that takes hold easily and quickly.”Metsola faces the task of reviving the parliament’s influence over Brussels affairs after two years in which the pandemic has reduced its institutional heft at the expense of the EU Council, which is made up of the bloc's 27 member states. Like member states, MEPs have the power to negotiate and approve almost all EU legislation. The parliament will now play a key role presiding over major pieces of legislation including sweeping reforms to the tech sector and a bumper package of green policies.In an attempt to strengthen the parliament’s negotiating position, the EPP, centrists Renew, and centre-left Socialists & Democrats have agreed a common statement laying out their political priorities for the next two-and-a-half years.The Greens, the parliament’s fourth largest grouping, did not join the alliance but some of its members still voted to back Metsola. Damian Boeselager, a German Green MEP, said he supported the Maltese conservative because she has “promised to make parliament the heart of European political debate, and she is willing to work with us to be ambitious in the process”. An earlier version of the story attributed a quote at the end of the story to Daniel Freund, not Damian Boeselager. We apologise for the error
197  Every five years, France’s 35,000 town and village mayors are bombarded with friendly messages and phone calls from complete strangers desperately seeking their help. “It doesn’t stop,” was the weary reaction at the weekend from Henri Labbé, the mayor of Erquy in Brittany.The cause of this periodic neediness? The requirement for French presidential candidates to secure the signatures of at least 500 sponsors. And the sponsors cannot be just anybody: among the 47,000 eligible are senators, members of the National Assembly, regional councillors including those from territories such as the Wallis and Futuna islands in the Pacific — and of course elected mayors, who are the juiciest target for political outsiders because they are often unaffiliated to a political party and account for most of the available sponsors.With the next election due in April, and the support of sponsors needed by March 4, some candidates are already crying foul as they seek to replace Emmanuel Macron in the Elysée Palace.Eric Zemmour, the far-right polemicist who has railed against Islamists and immigrants, has few guaranteed supporters in elected office because his party Reconquête! (Reconquest!) was founded only six weeks ago. He has called the system a “democratic scandal” because he fears he might not reach the threshold.Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the far-left candidate, and Marine Le Pen on the far right are also worried, although they did secure the signatures they needed in previous, unsuccessful campaigns.The mayors themselves are divided as to the merits of the system, which dates back to the first direct presidential election of the Fifth Republic in 1965. Raphael Cognet of the rightwing Les Républicains, who until this month was mayor of Mantes-la-Jolie north-west of Paris, says critics protest too much about a system that actually does its job in filtering out frivolous candidates.“Each presidential election it’s the same old chestnut, with the smaller candidates saying they can’t get enough signatures,” he says. But he adds, “It’s France and we always like to get worked up about these things.” Cognet and other supporters of the parrainage system say it does not stop France fielding a large number of presidential candidates — no less than 11 at the last election in 2017.“In which other country could you have seen three Trotskyite candidates, two from the extreme right and two green candidates mount their campaigns in parallel, as happened in France in 2002?” asked Jean-Jacques Urvoas, a former justice minister, in a column in Le Monde last week.The system is also cunningly designed to ensure that each candidate has national and not merely local support, by requiring sponsors from at least 30 départements with no more than 50 from any one.It does have flaws, however. Jean-Marc Pujol, former mayor of Perpignan in the south-west, says that, because the names of sponsors are published, mayors face political pressure and may be reluctant to sign up for controversial candidates, even if there is merit in doing so for the sake of democratic balance.Labbé, who was elected in Erquy without a party ticket, agrees, saying he is holding back on sponsorship for fear of causing problems in the town hall and in the community.Zemmour grumbles that a candidate such as Anne Hidalgo, the Socialist mayor of Paris, is guaranteed thousands of signatures because her party is well represented in local governments across France — even though she had only about 4 per cent backing in the latest opinion polls, a quarter of his support.For Zemmour, however, help might come from an unlikely source — his rival Valérie Pécresse and her LR party. Based on current polling, Pécresse needs Zemmour to stay in the race and split the far-right vote with Le Pen to give herself a good chance of reaching the second-round runoff against Macron.Small wonder, then, that Pécresse and her supporters are publicly urging LR mayors to offer their signatures to other candidates such as Zemmour without fear of retaliation. In a perverse way, this peculiar French system looks as though it will once again work as intended.
198  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.The long road to implementing last year’s global deal on corporate taxation is only beginning, but the French approach to advancing at least the 15 per cent minimum tax rate is hitting resistance in several member states. With EU finance ministers discussing the plans today, we’ll unpack the issues and why Paris seeks maximum celerity on this ahead of April’s presidential elections.Meanwhile in Strasbourg, the European parliament, which is voting on a new president today, paid tribute last night to David Sassoli, attended by several EU leaders, including France’s Emmanuel Macron and Italy’s Mario Draghi. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, who was headed to Strasbourg by car yesterday, made a U-turn after finding out that her driver had tested positive for Covid-19.In Spain, prime minister Pedro Sánchez received the new German chancellor and fellow centre-left family member Olaf Scholz. But political affinities aside, Madrid still has to wait for Berlin to allow changes to EU’s fiscal rules that would exempt green investments from deficit and debt calculations.And with the French presidency having started with a strong rhetoric on trade, we’re exploring what “reciprocity” means in the context of farming after yesterday’s first agriculture council of the year.Last year’s OECD deal agreeing a framework for corporate taxation was never meant to be the end of the battle, write Sam Fleming in Brussels and James Shotter in Warsaw.The next stage is implementation into national laws, and the process promises to be politically fraught in both Europe and the US. As a reminder, the global deal signed in October contains two “pillars” — one forcing the major multinationals to declare profits and pay more in the countries where they do business, and the second requiring a 15 per cent global minimum effective corporate tax rate.The European Commission late last year put forward a draft directive implementing Pillar 2, which will need approval of governments and the European parliament. Proposals bringing into force Pillar 1 will, on the other hand, only come after a multilateral convention containing the details of the arrangement, expected by the OECD this summer.It falls to France, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency, to drive the process forward. Paris is eager to show as rapid progress as possible on the minimum tax as Emmanuel Macron prepares his expected bid to seek re-election in April.Finance ministers will hold a discussion today during the Ecofin in Brussels over where things stand, and not all capitals like what they see. Some member states — among them Hungary, Poland and Estonia — want to firmly link implementation of the two pillars together, rather than allowing one to run ahead of the other.Their reasons vary, but one motivation is sustaining pressure on the US to drive through both parts of the agreement and not just half of it.Estonia was in any case cautious about the international tax deal given the particularities of its tax system. Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban meanwhile has elections looming this spring, sharpening his appetite for fights with Brussels.The French presidency and the commission both oppose the idea of making implementation of one part of the package legally contingent on the other. “We intend to advance on both pillars as quickly as possible,” said one EU official, who warned that holding progress up for Pillar 1 would endanger plans for implementation by 2023. “We should avoid negative spillovers by allowing a delay in agreeing one pillar to affect progress on the other.”While some EU diplomats profess optimism about the parallel process in the US, the outlook there is increasingly dicey. The minimum tax was attached to the Build Back Better legislative package that was torpedoed late last year. And the Pillar 1 element faces a rocky road as the midterm elections loom later in 2022.European countries that introduced Covid passes increased uptake for vaccines and improved public health and economic performance, potentially helping to avert lockdowns, according to a study by Bruegel. (More here)Will Germany’s new Social Democratic-led government allow the EU’s fiscal rules to become a bit more forgiving? That’s the hope that Sánchez expressed when Scholz came calling yesterday. But the German chancellor made clear his esteem for the Stability and Growth Pact that southern Europe is far less fond of, writes Daniel Dombey in Madrid.Meanwhile in Brussels, Germany’s new finance minister, Christian Lindner who hails from the frugal-minded Free Democratic party, told fellow eurozone ministers that returning to the bloc’s fiscal rules would help control inflation. Germany is open to suggestions on how to improve the framework, but a “real debate” on reforming the rules will only start in June, he said.In Madrid, Scholz struck an evasive tone, lauding the stability pact as a “framework” for European co-operation and avoiding committing to any loosening of the bloc’s deficit and debt rules. With a debt-to-GDP ratio of 120 per cent, Spain is particularly keen to revise the stability pact, which France and Italy have already demanded be revised to favour debt raised for “necessary investments”.Standing next to Scholz, Sánchez said the rules were “too complex and hard to meet in the context of the pandemic”, arguing they needed to be reformed to facilitate investments in the energy transition and digitalisation.Sánchez declared the two leaders were “in tune” and shared ambitions about strengthening the EU, “moving forward social Europe and defending our Social Democratic values and principles”. Ties between the German SPD and Spanish Socialists go back decades — notably to Spain’s transition to democracy, when the German party gave its Spanish counterpart a helping hand.The meeting appeared highly amiable, with Scholz waxing lyrical about Europe walking forward hand in hand, and Sánchez decrying any attempt to divide the EU into rival camps. And neither evinced much sympathy for Novak Djokovic, the unvaccinated tennis player just deported from Australia. “The rules have to be followed,” said Sánchez, striking a slightly different note from his disquisition on the stability pact.Liberté, égalité, fraternité, réciprocité! The French presidency of the EU loves a slogan. And French agriculture minister Julien Denormandie was anxious to ram home his message yesterday after chairing his first council of agriculture ministers this year, writes Andy Bounds in Brussels.Denormandie uttered the phrase at least a dozen times in a post-meeting press conference as he made clear Paris’s priorities for the next six months.The council defined reciprocity as ensuring “that agri-food products imported into Europe abide by the EU’s environmental and health standards, particularly in the sustainable use of phytopharmaceutical products”. Farmers complain about the costs of complying with EU agricultural standards while the bloc accepts imports from countries with less stringent rules. The theme is not new but Denormandie said debate had shifted in France’s favour recently. (The UK was a big opponent). “Reciprocity was a camp — you would be pitting yourself against others who would defend a more liberal approach. That is no longer the case,” he told reporters after the meeting. No minister objected to the idea, he said.Paris wants to use “mirror clauses”, which would allow bans on products produced with lower standards, arguing they would be WTO compliant.However, some member states and commission officials disagree and fear a slew of legal cases. The ministers were also briefed about a 27 per cent annual rise in global food prices in the year ended November 2021. Banning cheap imports might yet prove a hard sell to cash-strapped voters.
199  European countries that introduced Covid passes increased uptake for vaccines and improved public health and economic performance, potentially helping to avert lockdowns, according to a new study.Covid certificates in France, Germany and Italy increased the vaccination rate in those countries by 13, 6.2 and 9.7 percentage points respectively, researchers at Bruegel and the French Council of Economic Analysis said in a paper published on Tuesday. The effect was also “sizeable” among older population groups, they wrote.The certificates also helped stem thousands of hospital admissions and deaths, they estimated, lowering intensive care unit occupancy in France and helping to avoid further lockdowns. In Germany, vaccine uptake was low until more stringent rules on certificates were introduced in November, including compulsory Covid passes in workplaces. In Italy, ICU pressure remained low throughout the study period.The study estimated that, without the policy interventions, by the end of 2021 gross domestic product in France, Germany and Italy would have been €6bn, €1.4bn and €2.1bn lower respectively.Covid certification passes to prove vaccination, recovery from the virus or a recent negative test have been gradually introduced in a number of countries since last year, with the aim of broadening vaccine coverage as much as possible. Previous versions of the certificates, for example in Italy, granted access to all venues with proof of a negative Covid test, though rules have recently been tightened, especially for older citizens, to further reduce the proportion of unvaccinated citizens.Covid-19 vaccine certificates are not technically vaccine mandates, which make vaccination compulsory, as is the case in certain nations such as France and Italy for healthcare workers. The rollout of vaccine mandates and Covid passes and has been controversial, though the study suggests their impact has been positive.“The extensive use of Covid-19 certificates is a measured tool to control the pandemic and avoid outright vaccine mandates or renewed lockdowns,” said Miquel Oliu-Barton, one of the principal investigators on the study, a Bruegel researcher and an associate professor in mathematics and economics at Paris-Dauphine university. “In many countries, it has led to an increased vaccine uptake, and to less severe health outcomes, and economic losses.”The World Health Organization has said vaccine mandates should be used as a “last resort”.He said the researchers had focused the study on those three countries as they had introduced Covid certificates at around the same time, between July and August last year, to regulate entry to public venues. They also have comparable vaccine supply, economies, health systems and demographics.Some countries are tightening the rules: France approved a law on Sunday that will bar unvaccinated individuals from accessing bars, restaurants and other venues. Previously, the unvaccinated citizens could attend such venues with proof of a recent negative test. Italy introduced a similar “super green pass” requiring proof of vaccination this month.Oliu-Barton added the results of the study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, were not necessarily applicable to other countries. Decisions by governments should also weigh additional factors, including supply of Covid tests and vaccines, levels of political trust in their countries and access for marginalised groups so that such schemes did not “threaten social cohesion or exacerbate existing inequities”.“Covid certificates appear to be an attractive, more inclusive alternative to vaccine mandates, focusing on the added benefits of getting vaccinated or tested rather than punitive measures of not doing so,” he added, noting they could play a key role in increasing and maintaining vaccine protection in the face of Omicron.
200  The callers were managers from the auto and aerospace industries. They were all seeking help from his industrial 3D printing business in Germany, SLM, in producing vital parts that were suddenly becoming scarce as the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted international shipping.“I didn’t do a single day away from the office,” says O’Leary, who took to showing off the company’s specialised machines to clients over video calls. His customers’ worries were always the same, he says: “I’ve got a massive problem, I need to de-risk, I need to reshore.”SLM’s customers had hitherto used its technology for niche applications, such as producing gooseneck brackets for planes and brake callipers for performance vehicles.But, despite the increased cost and complexity of 3D printing metal components, they turned to the technology for more commonplace parts — such as hinges that keep regular car seats in place.So, while many other industrial businesses saw their order intake slow to a standstill, revenues at the Lübeck-based company — whose shares had fallen to record lows before the pandemic hit — grew by more than a quarter in 2020.Sales were on track to have increased by a similar amount in 2021. For 2022, O’Leary expects SLM’s sales to grow by 40 per cent.High-profile disruptions to global supply chains in the past couple of years — including the temporary blockage of the Suez Canal, floods and fires in Texas and Japan, as well as ongoing semiconductor production bottlenecks — have led to similarly rosy forecasts for the rest of the so-called “additive manufacturing” sector.Last year, a study by Lux Research estimated that the market for 3D printed parts, which was worth $12bn in 2020, would grow to well over $50bn by the end of the decade.Governments across the world have sought to address how, and where, components are made. In Germany, the recent chronic shortage of semiconductors led to millions fewer cars being produced than customers wanted to order. As a result, it is one of many countries to have pledged to support the “reshoring” of crucial component manufacturing to protect their economies.But, despite such enthusiasm, evidence increasingly points to the fact that businesses like SLM are serving a small market. A survey of European companies conducted by EY in the early spring lockdowns of 2020 found that more than four-fifths were considering bringing their supply chains closer to home. When the same survey was conducted in April last year, however, that view was shared by just 20 per cent of respondents. Similarly, only 15 per cent of the multinational companies surveyed by the Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) said they would relocate production.Their stance was echoed by sports goods group Adidas. Just five years ago, the company launched a scheme to build factories in Germany and the US that would use local materials and advanced manufacturing techniques, such as 3D printing, to produce bespoke trainers for nearby customers.It is an illusion to believe that you can move an industry that has grown over 30 years in Asia, to a very sophisticated industry, to some regionsIt had to all but abandon this plan as the Covid-19 pandemic began. But, after supply chain disruptions cut Adidas’ revenue growth by around €600 million in the three months to the end of September 2021, boss Kasper Rorsted was adamant that he had not changed his view on reshoring manufacturing.“We have approximately 800,000 people deployed in our [suppliers’] factories,” he said in November. “It is an illusion to believe that you can move an industry that has grown over 30 years in Asia, to a very sophisticated industry, to some regions.”Even if that was theoretically possible, Rorsted added, raw materials would still need to be sourced from around the world to produce the parts, making the prospect of reshoring a “total illusion”.“You wouldn’t even be able to find the people [that would need to do the work currently being done in Asia],” he said. Economists in Germany are also unconvinced. “If the EU were to decouple even partially from international supply networks, this would considerably worsen the standard of living for people inside the EU as well as for its trading partners, and should thus be avoided by all means,” warns Alexander Sandkamp. He is one of the authors of a study by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy that suggested that regionalising production would cost Europe hundreds of billions of euros.The recent flood disasters in Germany, which cost the country €40bn, according to insurance group Munich Re, was further proof that “shocks can also occur on our doorstep,” Sandkamp adds.Demand is definitely increasing. But there’s also a reality that this is a technology and a change that is regulated and takes timeEven SLM’s O’Leary is quick to add a caveat to his company’s bullish forecast. “We work primarily with regulated industries,” he says. “So, if you’re in an aerospace supply chain.you don’t just buy a 3D printer and say: ‘OK, well, I’ve decided to move away from my supplier wherever [they are] in the world and I’m going to do this in-house’.”A recent development programme with a major UK aero-engine manufacturer, he adds, took two years to get up and running, due to the time needed to install the necessary machines on-site and get the necessary approvals from Britain’s Civil Aviation Authority.“The demand is definitely increasing,” says O’Leary. “But there’s also a reality in that this is a technology and a change that is regulated and takes time.”
201  Countries with high exposure to the Omicron variant are recording record numbers of child coronavirus hospitalisations, adding to the pressures on healthcare systems, although health experts have stressed that the vast majority of cases were mild.Data from Europe and the US show more child admissions in recent days than at any time during the pandemic, but severe cases are rare in the youngest age groups and Omicron infections generally looked similar to other common respiratory illnesses.Paediatric admissions in France are nearly six times greater than the previous high of August 2021, while case rates among English under-5s are more than three times higher than last winter’s peak. About 80 under-5s are being admitted daily to hospital in England, up from the previous record of 24 last summer. The US under-5s hospitalisation rate has jumped to more than four in 100,000, from 2.5 per 100,000 in December, and is by far the highest rate during the pandemic.Alasdair Munro, a paediatrics specialist at the UK’s National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), said Covid-19 was now for the most part presenting in children as a relatively typical respiratory infection.“Before Omicron, children [with coronavirus] came in with real respiratory distress and pneumonia. The difference is that Omicron is causing much more common respiratory diseases. Cases come in looking like other unwell children and within a day or so — under observation and ruling out other, more serious infections — they look a lot better,” he said, adding that Covid-19 symptoms now often resembled those of viruses such as croup and bronchiolitis.In France, 73-80 per cent of under-18s hospitalised with Covid-19 now have Omicron, according to Santé Publique France. However, Christèle Gras-Le Guen, a paediatric doctor in Nantes, said “there is no Covid crisis that is happening with kids”. But they are waiting to see whether Omicron increases the risk of paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, or PIMS, a rare but dangerous complication that can occur in children who have become very sick with Covid.It can take three to four weeks after infection for children to develop PIMS, making it too early to assess whether the variant would lead to an increase in cases. “We will know more in a few weeks time and are working with paediatric colleagues in the UK to scrutinise their data,” said Gras-Le Guen.France’s campaign to vaccinate 5 to 11-year-olds has started slowly, with 3 per cent of eligible children jabbed because there were not initially many vaccination centres able to take children and paediatricians’ offices needed to be stocked. A requirement for approval from both parents also complicated matters.Alain Fischer, government vaccination strategy adviser, said the measure in France was “unfortunate” because it gave the impression there were undue risks to taking the Covid vaccine.The rise in the number of young children being admitted to UK hospitals partly reflected treatment guidelines that mandate a period of observation in hospital for babies under the age of three months who develop a fever.England is on course for 2,000 to 3,000 paediatric Covid-19 admissions in January, comparable with typical winter admissions for pneumonia and well short of the usual winter peak of 12,500 monthly admissions for bronchiolitis.“The ICUs aren’t overrun for this time of year, which in a normal winter would be absolutely peak season with other viruses,” said Mark Peters, professor of paediatric intensive care at Great Ormond Street Hospital and University College London.Camilla Kingdon, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, noted that few teenagers were being admitted, perhaps reflecting the fact that unlike younger children — for whom the UK government has yet to approve a programme of jabs — more than half of 12 to 15-year-olds have been vaccinated.The NIHR’s Munro cautioned that Omicron could still cause significant complications in children with other underlying health issues, “even if the virus is not higher risk for them than other respiratory viruses”.In the US, the steepest increases in hospitalisation for younger children have been in Georgia, Connecticut, Tennessee, California and Oregon, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.At the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, the number of children hospitalised with Covid-19 hit a pandemic high of 70 to 80 during the Omicron-fuelled peak, which doctors have said was now receding. But a review of paediatric data shows the severity of disease tended to be lower compared with previous Covid waves.“The spectrum of illness reminds us of other seasonal presentation of illnesses that we commonly care for — asthma, croup and bronchiolitis. It is almost as though Covid has replaced some of the usual actors,” said David Rubin, director of the hospital’s PolicyLab. “There is a lower proportion of kids who are requiring intensive care services [in the Omicron wave].”About a quarter of 5 to 11-year-olds have received at least one vaccine dose in the US, according to the CDC, and about half of 12 to 17-year-olds are double vaccinated. But Richard Malley, senior physician in paediatrics at Boston Children’s Hospital, said Omicron was spreading rapidly among unvaccinated children and infants who are too young to get the vaccine.“We have this population of children who are not vaccinated yet and some of them are ineligible for vaccination,” Malley said. “They, of course, are at some risk.”
202  But the need for ceramics manufacturers in Europe to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions is often overlooked when compared with other polluting heavy industries, such as steel and cement making. In part, this is because the sector is so fragmented.Ceramics first emerged in the Palaeolithic period more than 25,000 years ago. The development of high-temperature furnaces has made such materials ubiquitous and, today, the manufacture of these fired, corrosion-resistant materials accounts for 1 per cent of Europe’s industrial carbon emissions.Raw materials — primarily clay — are combined with additives, powders and water for drying and firing in kilns that typically burn above 1,000C. Ceramic manufacturing is therefore difficult to decarbonise because kilns use lots of energy, usually supplied by natural gas. CO2 emissions are also a natural byproduct of the sintering that the raw materials undergo.However, all European manufacturers face the task of achieving a historic transformation in how they work. The EU is mandating a 55 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels by 2030 and aims to reach net zero by 2050. This means that the EU’s ceramics industry — annual turnover €26bn — quickly needs to wean itself off processes that depend on fossil fuels. The UK also aims to become a net zero economy by 2050.Since 1990, producers across Europe have managed to reduce emissions by a third — mainly by switching from coal to natural gas and improving energy efficiency.To cut carbon footprints further, though, ceramic manufacturers need to invest heavily in alternative means to power their furnaces — either hydrogen, electrification or biofuels. They must also consider modifying the raw materials and deploying carbon capture technology to deal with so-called ‘process emissions’.Where climate change meets business, markets and politics. Explore the FT’s coverage here. Are you curious about the FT’s environmental sustainability commitments? Find out more about our science-based targets hereRather than making a big bet on a single technology, Renaud Batier, director-general of Cerame-Unie, the European ceramics trade body, says the best option for fuel depends on a factory’s location in a particular EU member state and its energy policies.However, ceramics is a hugely diverse and dispersed industry: Cerame-Unie divides it into nine sectors, all using different technologies. Sites are often small and located near raw materials. Ceramics companies are mostly classed as small- or medium-sized businesses.That affects the ability to implement change. The scale and financial power of steel manufacturers, such as ArcelorMittal and SSAB, can help drive that sector’s investment in zero-carbon technology. But, in comparison, about 80 per cent of Europe’s ceramics manufacturing is done by more financially-constrained SMEs.“Ceramics companies are much more independent so don’t have the capacity for capital investment in the way that larger companies may have,” says Ian Reaney, professor of ceramics at the University of Sheffield.Stephen Harrison, chief executive of Forterra, the UK’s second-largest brickmaker, adds that consolidation of manufacturing would not be a practical solution to faster decarbonisation.“The benefit of bricks is that they are made locally in most cases and transported short distances to the market,” he says. “A mass consolidation would mean a massive increase in transportation from a small number of manufacturing sites to customers all over the world.”Ceramics companies can also struggle to access government funding for pilot projects and demonstrations of greener technologies. Reasons for this might be because they are too small, or located far from larger industrial clusters eligible for research and development support with hydrogen or carbon capture projects.The sector is really feeling left behind compared with other UK energy-intensive and industrial sectorsLaura Cohen, chief executive of the British Ceramic Confederation, argues that initiatives such as the creation of an industry-wide research hub are needed to tackle these problems.She says: “The sector is really feeling left behind compared with other UK energy-intensive and industrial sectors on practical and tangible help to improve international competitiveness [and] on so many current and future energy and carbon issues.”The fragmentation of European ceramics manufacturing brings other difficulties, too. It means that the sector now accounts for 10 per cent of all industrial sites that fall under the EU emission trading system — even though it is responsible for a much smaller share of carbon emissions created by industry as a whole. “It’s a huge administrative burden for all of these small emitters,” says Batier.The target is completely absurd.It means our industry will disappear if we follow this path.Some ceramics executives argue that the EU’s targeted pace of change in emission reductions is too quick to achieve — especially as the lifespan of a kiln can be as long as four decades.Spain’s Grespania produces 10 million square metres of ceramic tiles a year but chief executive Luis Hernandez is less optimistic about the future, despite strong demand. He says the EU’s 2030 environmental target is “impossible for us to reach” because no cost-competitive alternatives to natural gas currently exist.“The target is completely absurd,” he says. “It means our industry will disappear if we follow this path.” He argues that, even if alternative energy sources such as electrification or hydrogen become viable, the industry will need at least 15 years to transition from that point. Cerame-Unie says it does not envisage any significant increase in the availability of green hydrogen as an alternative fuel for the sector until 2040.These environmental targets add to existing concerns over the competitiveness of European ceramics groups in world markets compared with foreign exporters. EU tableware and tile makers are already protected by anti-dumping duties against Chinese imports and investigations continue into tiles made in Turkey and India. But producers are grappling with the recent surge in energy prices, which typically account for 30 per cent of their cost base, as they face the cost burden of yet higher carbon prices under the EU emissions trading scheme.Ceramics executives say the imposition of a carbon border adjustment measure would help European producers remain competitive against imports that are not subject to such environmental policy burdens. But, they add, more measures are needed to help exports, support the longer-term case for investment in lower-carbon technology, and avoid inadvertently offshoring production and emissions to less regulated parts of the world.“At the moment, you are emptying the coffers of the companies,” says Harrison. “But, if that money [from carbon taxes] was used for innovation, you would inevitably see a quicker route to decarbonisation.”Energy is the world’s indispensable business and Energy Source is its newsletter.

203  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
204  Russia’s efforts to reduce its reliance on the global financial system have made it better prepared to weather the sanctions that the US and Europe have warned would follow a new attack on Ukraine.The relative success of what investors have called Moscow’s “Fortress Russia” strategy is likely to make western threats less of a deterrent, analysts say. Meanwhile, the EU has not weaned itself off Russian gas, making any restrictions on Russian energy exports potentially self-damaging — and leaving the possibility for Moscow to retaliate by limiting supplies.The western sanctions under discussion could go far beyond those passed following Russia’s annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in 2014. They could ape punitive measures used against Iran and North Korea that all but cut the countries off from the global economy.But Russia’s finance ministry, which has stress-tested worst-case scenarios for years and set up a unit working to counter possible measures from the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, says Russia’s economy could withstand even those types of measures.“Obviously, it’s unpleasant, but it’s do-able. I think our financial institutions can handle it [if] these risks emerge,” finance minister Anton Siluanov said last week.The possibility of Russian aggression against Ukraine and subsequent financial retaliation from the US and Europe has increased after talks in Geneva and Brussels to defuse tensions were deemed “unsuccessful” by the Kremlin last week.Russian president Vladimir Putin has deployed more than 100,000 troops along the Ukrainian border and threatened military action unless the west meets a series of security demands.“When Putin asks what do we do if we get punished with sanctions for military actions, his officials can salute and say, ‘Yes, Vladimir Vladimirovich, we know exactly what to do’. And that gives them a sense of confidence that sanctions aren’t anything to worry about,” said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center.Since 2014, Russia has ramped up its foreign currency reserves and sought to start “de-dollarising” its economy.Central bank reserves have soared more than 70 per cent since late 2015 and now surpass $620bn. Dollar reserves made up about 16.4 per cent of total reserves last year, from 22.2 per cent in June 2020, according to data published last week. About a third of the reserves are in euros, 21.7 per cent are in gold and 13.1 per cent are in renminbi.In 2017, Russia gave its coffers another boost by merging its reserve fund with a newly created National Wealth Fund that accumulates surplus oil and gas revenue.Surging oil prices, which have climbed beyond Russia’s budgetary break-even price of $43 per barrel, have boosted the fund to $190bn as of the third quarter of 2021. Russia expects it to grow to $300bn by 2024. Meanwhile, government debt is equivalent to about 20 per cent of GDP and is forecast to fall to 18.5 per cent by the end of 2023, according to credit agency Fitch Ratings.Russia has also learned to lean less on foreign investors. Foreign ownership of Russian government bonds has dropped to 20 per cent after Washington barred US investors from trading in newly issued state debt last year. The measures have reduced foreign investment but also made the country less vulnerable to future external shocks or a sudden sell-off. The finance ministry sold most subsequent issuances following the ban to state-owned banks.Russian companies have learned the lesson of the first sanctions, when many struggled to raise funds to pay off loans from western banks: corporate loans from foreign lenders have slumped from $150bn in March 2014 to $80bn last year.The 2014 sanctions and those sanction-proofing efforts have had a cost: The Russian economy has grown 0.8 per cent annually on average since 2013, compared with 3 per cent for the global economy. The conservative fiscal policy has restricted social spending and infrastructure investment. Real incomes have plummeted in the same time period.Putin declined to spend the National Wealth Fund on pandemic relief, favouring a more limited stimulus than most western countries and a faster easing of Covid-19 restrictions, which epidemiologists say contributed to one of the world’s highest death tolls per capita.The stability of Fortress Russia “is a sort of post-Soviet style stability, where you sacrifice economic growth for the sake of stability”, said Maria Shagina, a visiting fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs.While Russia worked at reducing its dependence on foreign financing, the EU did little to reduce its reliance on Moscow’s energy exports — running the risk that sanctions could backfire.The bloc imports more than 40 per cent of its gas and a quarter of its oil from Russia — leaving it exposed to shocks.“The EU hasn’t learnt from its mistakes since 2014,” said Shagina. “It aimed to diversify from Russia in terms of gas, it aimed to become more resilient and more geopolitical. But we don’t see it.”The west also relies on Russia for other important natural resources such as titanium. This could deter any sanctions against VSMPO-Avisma, the largest supplier of titanium for Boeing’s aircraft.That interdependence may even make it more difficult for the west to pass broader sanctions against Russia’s financial sector. The US and EU are discussing a ban on transacting with major Russian state banks or cutting the country off from the SWIFT global payments system — but could only do so effectively if they stopped buying its exports, Gabuev said.“You have to leave a channel open to pay Russia for oil and gas. [Sanctions] won’t make Putin change his mind, because any damage will be acceptable and the Kremlin thinks it has an answer,” Gabuev said.
205  The British government should fix post-Brexit red tape over customs and trade processes and issue more visas to address labour shortages, according to the British Chambers of Commerce.In a wide-ranging report ahead of the “Brexit day” anniversary on January 31, the trade group, which represents tens of thousands of businesses across the UK, raised concerns about the disruption caused by the departure from the EU’s single market. It called for Britain and the bloc to further streamline new customs and trade processes to reduce the burden of paperwork and prevent delays.The report pointed to the need for agreement on safety markings for industrial goods — where differences will exist with the EU — and a veterinary deal to ease restrictions on the trade of plant and animal products.The group also wants simplified, business-friendly rules on cross-border VAT to help UK companies trade with all countries in the EU.Shevaun Haviland, the BCC director-general who joined from the Cabinet Office last year, expressed concerns over how long the government was taking to fix the problems that Brexit had caused for companies.“At the time of the deal, it was like, ‘We’ve got some things to fix underneath it but we’ll get to that quite quickly afterwards.’ But we haven’t really been quick enough,” she said.Businesses were “getting used to” the new border rules, she added, but these were holding companies back because they were “costly and time-consuming.it’s just adding a lot of noise into the system. It hasn’t gone away.”The BCC said that new border controls on imports from the EU that will come into force this year risk compounding supply chain problems and urged the government to prioritise the flow of goods.The new rules introduced from January 1 had initially caused extra turmoil, with industry sources telling the BCC that about 30 per cent of trucks were being turned back at Calais in the first week of this year, but Haviland said this had stabilised at about 10 per cent.The BCC called on the government to provide further financial help for companies needing to adapt to the rules by bringing back the SME Brexit Support Fund, which was set up to help small businesses handle the confusion and paperwork associated with leaving the EU, and increasing its maximum payments to more than £2,000.Haviland urged the EU and UK to reach an agreement on the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol. “Negotiations need to be finished as soon as possible. businesses just need to know, one way or the other, what is the outcome?” She also pointed to the need to reassess curbs on business travel and UK professional qualifications in the EU.Haviland added that BCC members were concerned about access to skilled workers, with labour shortages proving a “drag on economic growth” in the UK. The group called for extra visas “to try and relieve some of the tension in the system”.“It’s absolutely not asking for uncontrolled immigration,” she said. “We are just saying that in areas like hospitality, construction and manufacturing where there are pinch points, can we just sort out short-term visas, while people get skilled up to take those roles?”She said that companies were also worried about the rising cost of doing business in the UK, given soaring bills for energy, wages, materials and supplies. Businesses would need to increase prices as a result, she added.“The number one concern for businesses is inflation, even above labour shortages.”The BCC wants the government to delay the national insurance increase due to come into effect in April and provide additional help for small businesses to cope with climbing energy costs.“Let’s not lose it now, let’s not kill it. The green shoots are there, let’s see them flower rather than killing them.”The British government said that the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement allows British businesses to “trade freely with Europe”, but they must adapt to new processes, for which they have been offered one-to-one advice through a free-to-use export support service.“Indications since January 1 are that traders and hauliers are adapting very well to the introduction of full customs controls,” a spokesperson said.
206  Germany’s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock sought to revive the four-nation “Normandy” format to de-escalate tensions over Ukraine, as she visited Kyiv en route to Moscow to push for European-led negotiations.The EU, while trying to prevent the possibility of a full-blown Russian invasion, was sidelined from security talks last week between Russia and the US, Nato and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Moscow deemed the talks a “dead end”. Baerbock and her Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, said on Monday they were united in pushing to revive the “Normandy” peace talks format between Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine.The format was established to support implementation of the 2015 Minsk agreements brokered by Germany and France, which aimed to end the proxy separatist war that erupted in Ukraine’s Donbas region after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.“Now is the moment to use.formats such as Normandy. That way we can sit together with Ukraine and Russia at one table to de-escalate this really difficult situation,” Baerbock said.Baerbock warned Russia would pay a “high price” should it attack, and said she was in Kyiv to make it “clear that we are not discussing Ukraine without Ukraine”.Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said US claims that Moscow was planning a “false flag” operation as a pretext to invade Ukraine were “disinformation” but vowed that the Kremlin would “defend the security of the country” if the west did not meet its security demands.Amid the tensions, Belarus on Monday also said it would soon hold joint military exercises with Russia near the Ukraine border, and that Russian forces had already begun arriving in the country ahead of the drills.President Alexander Lukashenko said the exercises, which will be called Allied Resolve, would take place in February on Belarus’s western flank, which borders the EU, and its southern border, which abuts Ukraine.“Today we see what we need in the western and southern region.to conduct solid exercises,” he said in a meeting with top military officials, according to the state press agency, Belta. In Kyiv, Ukraine’s foreign minister Kuleba said he was grateful to Germany for its efforts to return Russia and other parties to the negotiating table.Kuleba said Baerbock and France’s foreign minister would “soon” make another visit to Ukraine, during which the three sides would “in detail discuss the prospects of holding Normandy format talks at the level of foreign ministers”, hoping Russia would agree to further negotiations.But he cautioned that Russia had been “blocking” such efforts.“All that we need to receive is the readiness of Russia in an honest fashion to work in the Normandy format, and in the tripartite contact group,” Kuleba said. The tripartite contact group, which was founded in 2014 and sought to resolve the Donbas conflict through diplomatic channels, included Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE.In Moscow, the foreign ministry released a lengthy statement previewing Baerbock’s visit on Tuesday that accused Germany of “acquiescing to the Kyiv regime’s open sabotage” of the Minsk agreement and called its statement that Russia was a party to the conflict “unacceptable”.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters last week that “hints” about a possible Normandy format heads-of-state meeting “had not gone away” but said Russia had “no understanding” about when one would take place.Lavrov claimed that Ukraine was “under the thumb” of the US, which he said had the responsibility to “finally make Kyiv fulfil the Minsk agreements” aimed at ending the separatist war in Ukraine’s Donbas region.Ukraine claimed it was Moscow that had not met its commitments, a position backed by the US and the EU.Seven US senators including both Democrats and Republicans also travelled to Kyiv on Monday to meet Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky and other government officials.Chris Murphy, Democratic senator from Connecticut, said the lawmakers wanted to send a “bipartisan, unconditional message that the United States, Europe and Ukraine will make sure that Russia is dealt a set of consequential blows to their economy and to their security forces if they were to choose to mount a conventional invasion of Ukraine”.Despite divisions in Congress, Murphy said he expected lawmakers to rally around President Joe Biden’s “efforts to sanction Russia in the event of a further invasion of Ukraine”.
207  If you’re looking for sound and unbiased financial advice on investing in cryptocurrencies, then social media “influencers” should not be your first port of call.In something of an EU first, Spain moved to nip such an encounter in the bud on Monday, with its national securities market commission being given the power to regulate crypto advertising. The measures, which take effect in a month’s time, require influencers and their sponsors to pre-notify authorities of some posts and to warn of crypto’s risks or face fines. Singapore also placed new restrictions on crypto advertising on Monday.Spain’s new powers come after the watchdog clashed in November with footballing legend Andrés Iniesta over his paid promotion, lacking the usual risk warnings, of Binance, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange.In the US, a class-action lawsuit filed this month claims reality-TV star Kim Kardashian and other celebrities, including boxer Floyd Mayweather and former NBA player Paul Pierce, helped inflate the price of one cryptocurrency as part of a scheme that enriched its backers at the expense of ordinary investors.It alleges the backers of EthereumMax used the inrush of cash from Kardashian’s followers to sell a significant amount of the tokens at a profit, pocketing their gains before the price cratered.EthereumMax disputes the allegations, but the case highlights the worrying trend of retail investors turning to non-traditional sources of advice for their cryptocurrency investments, where the providers are often being paid large sums for promoting a particular digital asset.Social media influencers were infamously taken in by the Fyre Festival fraud in 2017 and Alphaville was immediately reminded of this when it viewed the recent Cryptoland video, a cartoon promoting a Fijian island that was set to be made into a paradise for crypto backers.On first viewing, the video comes across as a spoof, full of in-jokes and highlighting how crypto investments can represent another incarnation of Ponzi schemes. But, as Alphaville points out, Cryptoland featured 60 parcels of land that you can “buy” via NFTs and build mansions on, on the real island of Nananu-i-cake.The video has been widely derided on the internet and The Guardian reports the project appears to have run aground, with the contract to buy the island for $12m falling through.While regulation is necessary and inevitable, in Cryptoland’s case, social media itself appears to have been an effective watchdog, alerting prospective investors to what could have been trouble in paradise.1.

208  Petro Poroshenko, Ukraine’s former president, flew back to Kyiv on Monday to face treason charges which he claims are part of a politically motivated witch-hunt orchestrated by his successor Volodymyr Zelensky.The charges were announced late last year as Poroshenko travelled abroad for the holiday period and involve coal purchases from Russian-backed breakaway eastern regions while Poroshenko was president from 2014 to 2019.Along with dozens of other criminal probes into Poroshenko under Zelensky’s presidency, the cases have alarmed Ukraine’s western backers who fear domestic political instability at a time when the country faces a threat from an estimated 100,000 Russian troops amassed along its borders.“All political leaders in Ukraine need to unite against Russian aggression right now. So important at this time not to lose sight of this or be distracted by polarising domestic politics,” Melinda Simmons, the UK’s ambassador to Kyiv, tweeted on Monday.Appearing at court on Monday Poroshenko, who is now an opposition leader and MP, described the case as a “red line” and “farce organised by Zelensky”.The judge in the hearing was expected either to set bail for Poroshenko, order him to be held or release him.Since defeating Poroshenko by a landslide in a 2019 presidential runoff, Zelensky has repeatedly suggested his rival would face criminal charges for alleged wrongdoings but he has not in past weeks commented on the current case.Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky’s chief of staff, in comments to Interfax-Ukraine news agency on Monday criticised Poroshenko for exhibiting “disrespect for the basic procedural rules” by leaving the country late last year when he was summoned by investigators.“This behaviour of a particular politician largely explains the reasons why the transformation of Ukraine into a modern and rule-of-law state has dragged on so long since the 1990s,” Podolyak added.If convicted Poroshenko, a confectionery and media magnate, faces up to 15 years in prison. In a ruling issued while Poroshenko was abroad, a court ordered his assets to be frozen.Zelensky has pledged to crack down on the country’s oligarchs, including through recently adopted “de-oligarchisation” legislation, which prohibits them from funding political parties and requires all contact with public servants to be reported.Speaking to the Financial Times before his return from Poland, Poroshenko offered to work with Zelensky in the interests of national unity while expressing concern that politically motivated criminal cases against him could destabilise the country. That, in turn, he said, would make Ukraine more vulnerable to an invasion by Russia, which annexed Crimea in 2014 and fomented a proxy separatist war in eastern regions.“Instead of joining forces, as our foreign partners are doing, the Ukrainian government is irresponsibly destroying national unity instead of building it,” said Poroshenko, leader of the opposition European Solidarity party.“I and my political force are ready to provide our backs to Zelensky,” he said. “I am returning to Ukraine not to fight with Zelensky, I am returning to Ukraine to defend Ukraine.”
209  The writer is EU commissioner for financial services, financial stability and capital markets unionI grew up on a farm in Ireland, one of eight siblings. It’s where I first learnt about money. We sold produce to our local community and, as children, we handled cash and gave back change. We had an awareness of the money coming in and how it was used for the bills that needed to be paid. It was basic financial education in a very practical sense. Today, the world is different. Myriad complex investment products are now at our fingertips and on our smartphones. We have a younger generation dabbling in crypto, some of whom are taking big risks on a device that fits in their pockets.It is because the world has changed that we need to talk about money and financial literacy. People should understand how the financial system works, how it affects them and how they can make the financial decisions that are right for them. We should empower people so they know how to navigate their finances. The earlier in life that we build up financial awareness, the better. Financial literacy education gives young people the foundations for future prosperity — and can help economically disadvantaged people out of deprivation. Join the FT Flic campaign to promote financial literacy in the UK and around the worldDonate to the Financial Literacy & Inclusion Campaign hereThis is especially important in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has widened the gap between the financially resilient and the financially fragile. One in three EU households are unable to meet unexpected financial shocks in regular times, let alone in a pandemic. Sudden drops in income and unexpected expenses have put extra strain on many, while others have been able to save, but do not know how to make the most out of their savings. Of course financial literacy alone will not solve such problems — it must go hand in hand with a well-regulated financial system, fair advice and good consumer protection — but it is a key part of the puzzle.Across the EU, there are already great initiatives to improve financial literacy and more than half of EU countries have some form of national strategy in place. But the level of financial literacy across the bloc varies widely, and overall it remains much too low, especially among women, young people and older people. That’s why the European Commission has been working with the OECD’s International Network on Financial Education to step up financial literacy in the EU. Last week we published a new financial competence framework for adults in the EU. This joint project details the skills and knowledge that we all need when it comes to finance, especially in light of changes driven by technology and sustainability.Public and private organisations can build on the framework to launch new initiatives. Education authorities could use it to draw up school curriculums, for example, teachers to design educational courses and businesses to provide training for staff or customers.In the EU, education is the responsibility of national governments and the commission needs their support to succeed. We envisage these governments will use the framework to build on their existing work or develop new policies and programmes.The commission’s work with the OECD does not stop here. We will work together to make sure the framework is widely used and monitor its implementation. We are also beginning work on a financial competence framework designed specifically for children and young people, which we hope to publish next year.But this is not just a European issue. By linking with the OECD, we have been able to learn from their work in Europe and further afield. We can learn from what others are doing. Finance is changing, and it’s changing fast. I want to help make sure that people are empowered to know the impact of the decisions they’re taking in our evolving financial system.
210  French presidential candidate Éric Zemmour was convicted of hate speech by a Paris court on Monday for saying young illegal immigrants to France were murderers, rapists and thieves who should “be sent back”.The court ordered that the far-right author and former journalist pay a fine of €10,000 for “inciting racial hatred”. He would face 100 days in prison if he did not pay, the court ordered.His lawyer Olivier Pardo said outside the courtroom that Zemmour would appeal against the decision.Zemmour made the comments in 2020 during a television debate on Facing the News, which aired on the Vivendi-owned CNews channel. Zemmour rose to prominence on the show before resigning in the autumn to run for election. He was reacting to a terrorism-related knife attack allegedly carried out by a young Pakistani man who migrated to France as a so-called “unaccompanied minor”.“They do not belong here.They are thieves. They are murderers. They are rapists. That is all they are,” he said in an exchange with the host. “We must send them back. They should not even come!” Zemmour did not attend the court hearing but in a statement he called the verdict “stupid and ideological”, suggesting it was a politically motivated attempt to silence him. “The truth is that these ‘unaccompanied minors’, who are often nothing of the sort, are here illegally and have a propensity to commit infractions or crimes,” he said, adding that French people had to be able to debate the issue without fearing a court case.Zemmour’s electoral programme espouses the goal of “immigration zero” and calls for France to cut the number of grounds for people to enter the country — making it more difficult for people to join family members, study or seek asylum.More than a dozen advocacy groups and local governments had joined the legal case as civil complainants to argue that their members and constituents had been stigmatised by Zemmour’s comments.Jérôme Karsenti, a lawyer for anti-racism group Maison des Potes, welcomed the verdict. “The court has sent a strong signal that should inform the public debate during the presidential campaign,” he said. “Freedom of speech does not mean you can say whatever you want, and racism is not an opinion.” After rising from nowhere to second place in opinion polls in October, Zemmour has since fallen to fourth with roughly 13 per cent of voting intentions for the first round. President Emmanuel Macron is on 25 per cent, far-right candidate Marine Le Pen 17 per cent and the centre-right candidate Valérie Pécresse 16 per cent.Zemmour, who comes from an Algerian and Jewish family who came to France before his birth, has repeatedly run foul of France’s laws against inciting racial or religious hatred and has been accused in 16 such legal cases over the years, according to his lawyer. He has a separate case pending for playing down the French government’s role in deporting Jews during the Holocaust, which will be decided later this week. He has prevailed in most of these cases, often using a free speech defence, and argues he is being targeted for politically incorrect views.
211  Are Europeans doomed to spend the 21st century being pushed around by outside powers? In Brussels, they like to argue that the collective power of the EU is the only way of saving the old continent from that ignominious fate. Although no single European country can stand toe-to-toe with America or China, the EU collectively ranks as one of the world’s three largest economies.But the idea that the EU’s economic weight can be easily converted into geopolitical power is undergoing a brutal reality check. The Ukraine crisis has seen the EU sidelined. Meanwhile China has imposed unofficial economic sanctions on Lithuania, an EU member — and Brussels is struggling to find an appropriate response.If things go badly for the EU over the coming weeks and months, talk of a “geopolitical” Europe will sound increasingly ridiculous. But it is also possible that the current crises — in particular the Lithuanian challenge — will lead to a leap forward in the EU’s ability to defend its interests in the global arena.The crisis over Ukraine is a matter of war and peace on the European continent, so some EU officials feel humiliated that they did not take part directly in recent negotiations. Yet it should not be a huge surprise that Brussels was sidelined. The EU is not a military power and may never be. And Ukraine is not an EU member.Lithuania, by contrast, is one of the EU27. It is also involved in a trade dispute — and trade is one of the few areas where the EU is already a global heavyweight. So the Europeans have both an opportunity and an obligation to get their act together.The Lithuanian government has been singled out for punishment by China for upgrading its relationship with Taiwan, a self-governing democratic island that Beijing insists is a rebel province. Lithuania had earlier pulled out of the 17+1, a talking shop set up by Beijing.In response, Beijing has applied methods that Gabrielius Landsbergis, the Lithuanian foreign minister, compares to the “Spanish Inquisition”. (In a possible tribute to Monty Python, Lansbergis adds that “nobody had expected” the Spanish Inquisition.)China is not just blocking all trade with Lithuania. It is also blocking all products containing components made in Lithuania, causing a huge headache for foreign investors in the country.Beijing has chosen a clever tactic. German investors in Lithuania are believed to be urging the government to back down, while polls suggest that Lithuanian public opinion has turned against the Taiwan gambit.But China’s policy also contains risks that Beijing may not have fully reckoned with. By targeting the EU’s supply chain, the Chinese are taking aim at the integrity of the European single market, which is central to the EU’s economy and strategic aspirations. As Janka Oertel of the European Council on Foreign Relations puts it: “By Europeanising the problem, China has turned this into a test for the entire EU.”This is not just a theoretical issue. Some Europeans fear that the next country in China’s sights will be the Czech Republic, whose government and politicians have also been friendly towards Taiwan. Czech factories play a central role in the EU supply chain, so targeting Czech-made components could create havoc inside the single market.Some European politicians are privately irritated that the Lithuanians acted without consulting the rest of the EU. But the Lithuanians have not broken with the EU’s “one China” policy. And support for democracy and the protection of small nations are meant to be core European values.EU officials have pledged support and solidarity with Lithuania. A case will probably be taken out against China at the World Trade Organization, but could take years to come to fruition. So instead, the French, who currently hold the EU presidency, are looking at accelerating the adoption of anti-coercion legislation. This would allow the EU to retaliate against coercive trade measures, from China or any other nation, with a range of measures that could include blocks on investment and tariffs.The beauty of these instruments, as far as Brussels is concerned, is that they are trade measures. Unlike pure foreign policy questions, which require unanimity, decisions on trade can be taken by majority vote. That would mean that China’s friends within the EU — notably Hungary and Greece — would not be able to prevent the adoption of anti-coercion legislation or its deployment.Reinhard Bütikofer, an influential member of the European Parliament who has been personally sanctioned by China, believes that the Lithuania crisis may therefore lead to a leap forward in Europe’s ability to project power. As he puts it: “The interconnection between trade and foreign policy all of a sudden allows us to use trade policy for a more effective pursuit of foreign policy.”But the EU’s legislative processes is tortuous, making it unlikely that anti-coercion instruments can be agreed before the summer. By then Lithuania may have been forced to back down.In their own interests, the Europeans need to stop that happening. If China successfully bullies Lithuania while the EU watches impotently from the sidelines, that lesson will be noted — not just in Beijing, but in Moscow and Washington, too.
212  Spain is imposing restrictions on influencers’ promotion of cryptocurrencies as European authorities struggle to get to grips with the unregulated sector.In an apparent first for the EU, Spain’s national securities market commission has been given the power to regulate crypto advertising.The measures, set out in the country’s official journal on Monday, take effect in a month’s time. They require influencers and their sponsors to pre-notify authorities of some posts and to warn of crypto’s risks or face fines.“We are very excited about how this will bring some order to how crypto is promoted, not just through traditional media but also through influencers,” Rodrigo Buenaventura, the watchdog’s head, said in an interview with the Financial Times.“If influencers weren’t covered there would be a backdoor to avoid regulation. This is new terrain, for us and for them, and there will be moments of friction but that always happens when you bring in rules for something that wasn’t regulated before.” The new powers for the Spanish watchdog come after its November clash on Twitter with Spanish footballing legend Andrés Iniesta over his paid promotion of Binance, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, when the commission told the World Cup winner it was his responsibility to inform followers of crypto’s risks.Proposed EU-wide regulations on the sector are not yet agreed and do not attempt to harmonise rules for advertisers such as influencers.As a result, Madrid and other European capitals are seeking to at least regulate promotion of crypto products. France late last year gave a unit supervised by its finance ministry the role of investigating online crypto advertising.A French reality TV star was fined €20,000 in July for “misleading commercial practices” after posting a Bitcoin trading site advertisement on Snapchat.“Like Spain has now done, other countries are deciding not just to wait a couple of years for the EU regulation to decide everything but to take on areas like publicity,” said Buenaventura.Under the new Spanish rules, influencers will have to disclose if they are remunerated for promoting crypto, whether monetarily or otherwise.If so, the watchdog will require their posts to include prominent “clear, balanced, impartial and non-misleading” statements about the risks of investment in crypto and a warning that crypto-investment is not regulated, potentially unsuited for retail investors and could lead to loss of all the assets invested.Influencers or outlets with more than 100,000 followers in Spain will have to notify the watchdog of the content of their crypto promotions with at least 10 days of notice. Fines for non-compliance could reach €300,000.The new Spanish publicity rules apply to crypto groups themselves and to PR companies they hire, as well as to influencers.A European Commission official said Brussels had “no principled objection” to member states regulating ahead of the EU crypto regime — dubbed Mica — coming into force, as long as national and EU-level rules are compatible. “Depending on the specific situation, once Mica enters into force rules may have to be adjusted,” the official added.In parallel, the UK Treasury is studying a proposal to tighten rules on crypto advertising. The new British regulations would probably require crypto adverts to receive prior approval from a company authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority, with possible fines for serious breaches.
213  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.Some European governments, including in France and Greece, are introducing further measures this week aimed at forcing people to get vaccinated. But the new coalition government in Berlin is getting cold feet on a full-blown vaccine mandate. We’ll have a look at the sharply contrasting approaches being taken in different member states.Meanwhile, in Brussels, the new finance ministers of Germany and the Netherlands are making their debut at the eurogroup later today. We’ll explore the issues on the table.On the Russia front, Sweden has become the latest country to beef up its eastern flank to counter an increased Russian military presence and Ukraine is reeling from a cyber attack it is attributing to Moscow. We’ll unpack the latest and what the chances are for sanctions.And with just a week left before the first round of the Italian presidential election, the FT has this explainer on what it will mean if Mario Draghi gets the job.Different measures are being introduced, adopted or discussed in several EU countries this week, as governments seek to cajole the last holdouts to get vaccinated and boosted, write Eleni Varvitsioti in Athens, Leila Abboud in Paris and Erika Solomon in Berlin.As of today, a fine of 100 euros a month will be imposed on unvaccinated Greeks over the age of 60. Official statistics show that nine out of 10 Covid-related deaths occur over the age of 60 and that seven in 10 of those hospitalised are from that age group — and in most cases, they are unvaccinated. The fee will be imposed by Greek tax authorities directly on those who haven’t been inoculated, and the funds collected will be given to hospitals fighting the pandemic.The measure mirrors a similar push in Italy, where the government as of next month plans to impose fines on people aged over 50 who refuse to get the jab.In France, after public outrage over president Emmanuel Macron’s choice of words when laying out plans to make life difficult for the unvaccinated, the government yesterday finalised a law to allow access to public venues only to people who are vaccinated or have recently recovered from Covid-19. Negative tests — now part of the pass sanitaire — will no longer be allowed for adults, although 12-15-year-olds can still use them. The French government has also raised fines for fake vaccination passports.Austria, the first developed country to announce it would implement mandatory vaccinations for all adults, is expecting legal challenges to delay its implementation until spring. In Germany, where similar plans were announced in December, the government is at odds over which model to follow, with a debate in the Bundestag scheduled to start on January 26.The ruling Social Democrats have vowed to pass a law through parliament by the end of March. Their coalition partners, the liberal Free Democrats, cite concerns over civil liberties and have asked whether the mandate should be limited to the unvaccinated over a certain age. Some are also concerned that Germany does not really have a mechanism in place to effectively impose vaccine requirements, as it has no national vaccine registry.In Belgium, a much more limited vaccine mandate, which only affects healthcare workers, has yet to come into force. The Belgian government is finalising a law announced in November — which will give the roughly 50,000 unvaccinated healthcare workers time until the end of March to get immunised or risk losing their job.At the other end of the spectrum, in Bulgaria — the EU country with the lowest vaccination rate — lawmakers cannot even agree over the possible introduction of Covid-19 passes to enter the parliament and other official buildings.The eurogroup holds its first meeting of 2022 today with an array of new recruits sitting around the table. Among the ministers under the most intense scrutiny will be Germany’s new finance minister Christian Lindner and Sigrid Kaag from the new Dutch coalition government, writes Sam Fleming in Brussels.The meeting will feature a debate on the euro area’s economic performance relative to its international peers, an examination of the minimalist enforcement of euro area’s fiscal rules, and draft recommendations on appropriate policy settings for 2022.The meeting could throw up early indications about how the frugal approach to fiscal policy will evolve under the new German and Dutch coalitions — a key question given the review of the Stability and Growth Pact.France and Italy are in particular pushing for ambitious reforms to incentivise investment by stripping out certain categories of public spending, and to rewrite debt rules to avoid the imposition of overly draconian fiscal consolidation plans. The frugal countries would have to soften their traditionally hostile stance to such innovations if Paris and Rome are to get their way.Another topic to watch is the evolving mood in finance ministries in the face of the surge in inflation, which is running at 5 per cent in the euro area.This subject isn’t listed on the formal agenda. But the fear with tensions rising over the Russian troops on the Ukrainian border is that energy prices — which are the key driver of euro area inflation — could rise higher, further compressing household incomes.The biggest euro area economies have offered an array of support schemes and tax cuts to ease the cost of power price surge, but with energy prices rising at the fastest pace since 1980 across the OECD they face demands for further action.Despite the acceleration in inflation, many economists argue there are greater risks of overheating over in the US than in the euro area, where output has only just regained its pre-crisis level. But that doesn’t mean ministers can watch events across the Atlantic with detached equanimity.As Erik Nielsen, economic adviser at UniCredit, notes, the European Central Bank is likely to be much less aggressive in normalising monetary policy than the Federal Reserve, but there is still a risk that rising US yields translate into an “unwarranted tightening of financial conditions” in Europe, creating difficult choices for the ECB.EU finance ministers have declared themselves broadly satisfied with the bloc’s response to the Covid-19 crisis. But they remain in very choppy waters as the new year gets under way.Sweden has sent hundreds of troops to Gotland island over the weekend, after reports of increased Russian naval activity in the Baltic Sea. Russia’s deployment of more than 100,000 troops to the Ukrainian border has led Sweden and Finland, both militarily non-aligned, to stress that they retained the option to apply for Nato membership. (More here)In Kyiv, they have one prime suspect: investigators there say the evidence suggests Russia was behind a crippling cyber attack that took down dozens of its government websites on Friday. The consequence of such a conclusion could be large, writes Henry Foy in Brussels.In response to Russia deploying more than 100,000 troops close to its border with Ukraine, the US, EU and other western allies pledged to inflict “massive consequences” on Moscow in the event of “any further aggression” against Ukraine — a promise designed to deter the Kremlin from any nefarious plans it may have to hurt Kyiv.But both the sanctions themselves and the definition of “aggression” have not been publicly clarified. That, some fear, leaves wriggle room for capitals reluctant to hurt Russia in ways that could also hurt their own economies.A full-on invasion would be impossible to deny, but warfare through proxies or a hybrid attack with disputed provenance could be overlooked by more dovish countries who signed up for the sanctions package hoping that it was a promise that would never need to be honoured.The US, who will ultimately call in that promise, is yet to make it official. Victoria Nuland, US under-secretary of state for policy, told the FT that the cyber attack was a “tried and true part of the Russian playbook” and said the west was focused on “inflicting very sharp pain very fast if Russia makes this move in any form”.Washington has also accused Russia of deploying specialist troops trained in urban warfare and using explosives inside Ukraine that will stage a “false flag” operation to give it a pretext for military action.The EU is yet to weigh in on potential Russian involvement in the cyber attack, though did “strongly condemn” the fact it took place. That’s not surprising. Berlin is divided over including Nord Stream 2 as a sanctions target; France took longer than most to accept the US arguments that Russia could be planning an invasion; and Italy has said it thinks sanctions are of little use in stopping the Kremlin.But as the hackers said in a message posted on Ukrainian government websites: “Fear and expect the worst.”.and later this week
214  Nord Stream 2, Russia’s gas pipeline across the Baltic Sea, has already driven a wedge between Germany and the US and sown discord in Europe. Now, as fears mount that Russia will attack Ukraine, it has become a bone of contention inside the German government itself.Germany’s coalition partners are split on the pipeline, which its critics say will hugely increase Europe’s reliance on Russian natural gas, with the left-of-centre Social Democrats largely backing it and the Greens opposed.Green foreign minister Annalena Baerbock, who will make her first official trip as foreign minister to Kyiv on Monday and Moscow on Tuesday, has indicated that Nord Stream 2, which is complete but has yet to be certified, cannot go ahead if Russia invades its western neighbour.The Social Democrats, who have traditionally favoured entente with Moscow, are more ambivalent, insisting on the importance of Russian gas for German industry. SPD chancellor Olaf Scholz has refused to publicly entertain sanctions against the project.The divisions “are weakening Germany and the EU”, said Stefan Meister, an expert on eastern Europe at the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP). “We are seeing that the German government has no consolidated position and is. still looking for a Russia policy,” he said.The split was underscored again this week when two senior SPD politicians went out of their way to try to ringfence Nord Stream 2 from the Russia-Ukraine crisis.Defence minister Christine Lambrecht said the pipeline “shouldn’t be dragged into this conflict”. And Kevin Kühnert, SPD general secretary, said international disputes were being deliberately encouraged “in order to bury projects that have always been a thorn in the side of some people” — an apparent dig at the Greens.The contrast with the rhetoric coming from Baerbock could not be clearer.She has repeatedly made reference to an agreement between the US and Germany in July last year which said Berlin would impose energy sanctions on Moscow “should Russia attempt to use energy as a weapon or commit further aggressive acts against Ukraine”.Some have suggested that Moscow is already weaponising its gas exports. Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency, said last week that Russia was throttling gas supplies to Europe at a time of “heightened geopolitical tensions”. He said it was holding back at least one-third of the gas it could send to Europe while depleting the storage facilities it controls on the continent to bolster the impression of tight supplies. Russia has repeatedly denied any manipulation of supplies.At least both the Greens and SPD have agreed on one thing — that the negotiations held last week between Russia and the west were necessary to try to avert war. The US, Nato and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe all held talks with Russian officials in the past few days in an attempt to deter Moscow from escalating the conflict with Ukraine.But the Russian response was dismissive, with officials describing the talks as a “dead end”. Meanwhile, some of the roughly 100,000 Russian troops deployed at locations close to the country’s border with Ukraine conducted live-fire exercises last week, and on Friday Kyiv said it was the target of a “massive cyber attack” that disabled about 70 government websites.The Russia-Ukraine imbroglio is the first big crisis that Scholz, a pragmatist who says he wants to emulate Angela Merkel’s cautious, middle-of-the-road policies, has faced as chancellor.In his public statements, he has been ultra-cautious, emphasising the need for a peaceful resolution of the conflict and warning against any attempt to change Europe’s borders by force.But he has also firmly resisted pressure from some in US president Joe Biden’s administration to state explicitly that NS2, which is awaiting approval by the German regulator and the European Commission, will be stopped if Russia sends troops into Ukraine.US officials say Berlin is being nudged in the right direction. Victoria Nuland, undersecretary of state, said last week that the German government had taken “significant steps” to “slow their consideration of implementation of the pipeline”.But in public at least, Scholz has scrupulously avoided threatening sanctions against NS2, insisting repeatedly that it is a “private-sector initiative” that has nothing to do with the Ukraine crisis.That marks a subtle but important shift away from the line adopted by Merkel, who admitted in 2018 that NS2 was “not just an economic project”, and that political factors also had to be taken into consideration — not least the need to preserve Ukraine’s status as a transit country for Russian gas.Yet not all Social Democrats agree with Scholz’s cautious approach. Michael Roth, a former deputy foreign minister who is now head of the Bundestag’s influential foreign affairs committee, said on Friday that Germany should send a clear signal to Moscow that it would withhold approval of NS2 in the event of aggression against Ukraine.Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, was always threatening to turn off the energy tap, he said. “But you can’t blackmail us,” he told Der Spiegel. “Should Russia continue its military escalation towards Ukraine, all options should be on the table.”
215  Italy will this month choose a new president to replace Sergio Mattarella, whose seven-year term ends on February 3. All eyes are on whether Mario Draghi, the former European Central Bank president installed as prime minister last year, will become president, leaving his job vacant at a sensitive time.Italy is in the early stages of implementing a major EU-funded reform program to boost its long-term growth prospects, after years of stagnation and the Covid pandemic. Some fear that Draghi’s ascent to Italy’s presidency would trigger the collapse of the current fragile national unity government and force early elections, jeopardising the reforms on which the flow of EU money depends. Others feel that as president Draghi could have a mature and stabilising influence over Italy’s notoriously turbulent politics for years to come.Here is all you need to know about the presidential election:How are Italy’s presidents elected?Italian presidential candidates are never explicitly nominated, nor are they chosen directly by the public. Instead, in a process with echoes of Papal elections, around 1,000 electors — Parliament members and regional representatives — choose a president through multiple rounds of secret ballots.In these votes electors can write the names of virtually anyone they see fit for the job — from mainstream politicians to pop stars, celebrities or ordinary citizens. During the first three rounds of voting, when results are publicly read aloud, a candidate is elected if supported by two-thirds of electors. For subsequent voting rounds the bar is lowered and a candidate wins with a simple majority.As voting progresses, electors’ support typically coalesces around a few individuals, aided by long, draining backroom negotiations before and during the votes. But the process can be painfully slow: in 1971, Italy’s president was elected after 23 rounds of voting over more than two weeks.Is Draghi favoured to win?Italian presidential elections are notoriously unpredictable: in 2013, the expected election of former European Commission president Romano Prodi was thwarted by secret mass defections from members of his own coalition.But with his unrivalled public stature, Draghi, 74, is a serious contender. The US-educated economist and banker — who ran Italy’s central bank before heading the ECB — was appointed prime minister last February, after the last government collapsed in partisan squabbling. With backing from across Italy’s political spectrum, Draghi led the drafting of an ambitious economic and social reform program that won the promise of around €200bn in EU funding.With his rational, no-nonsense approach to Italy’s policy challenges, Draghi enjoys the confidence of the Italian and international business community, while opinion polls say a majority of Italians think he has the perfect characteristics to be president.But others are also in contention. Former prime minister and media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi, leader of the centrist Forza Italia, has made little secret of his own ambition and has also courted support from the League and Brothers of Italy, parties further to the right. The rival Five Star movement, the largest party in Parliament, has suggested the next president should be a woman.Some centre-left politicians are advocating Mattarella’s re-election so that Draghi can remain prime minister and push on with reforms until elections due in 2023, with the unstated implication that he could be made president afterwards. Mattarella, 80, has previously indicated he wishes to retire, but may be persuaded to reconsider.Who would replace Draghi as prime minister?Electing an incumbent prime minister as president would be unprecedented in Italian history, and Draghi’s first task in his new role would be to try to appoint a successor who can secure parliamentary support.The current coalition, which spans the Italian political spectrum, could potentially support another technocrat to serve as prime minister until 2023. Possible candidates could include finance minister, Daniele Franco, who spent his career at the central bank, or Vittorio Colao, the former Vodafone chief.However, parties may find it politically difficult to support painful economic and social reforms without Draghi at the helm of day-to-day affairs, potentially resulting in a lame-duck government unable to get much done, as parties jostle ahead of the next polls.Though Italy’s largest parties are not keen for early elections, their failure to agree on a successor to Draghi could also precipitate early polls, bringing policymaking to a halt.Could Draghi push policy reforms as president?Italian presidents do not run the country’s daily affairs — but nor is their role merely ceremonial. Of late, Italian presidents have made increasingly active, and sometimes surprising, use of their formal powers to appoint prime ministers and approve or veto cabinet ministers. Mattarella notably vetoed the appointment of a Eurosceptic economist as finance minister in 2018. The president must also approve laws passed by Parliament before they take effect.As president, Draghi would not have formal powers over the next government’s policy agenda. But Giovanni Orsina, director of LUISS University’s school of government, said his stature would give him a continuing influence over the reform process.“Draghi as president of the republic would guarantee a fairly long period of top-down supervision of the implementation of reforms and the spending of European funds,” Orsina said. “The country would gain a person capable of acting as an institutional umbrella, able to reassure the EU and international observers from above.”
216  Albania’s prime minister has appealed to western Balkan leaders to reject overtures from outside powers and keep the faith in their EU membership dream.Edi Rama said Albania would “never give up on Europe and on the EU, whatever the shape of the EU in the future” while aiming a dig at the bloc’s politicians for being too influenced by nationalist pressures.Speaking to the Financial Times, he conceded it was frustrating to wait. But as Russia, China and Turkey all court the region, Rama said such suitors, which he did not name, were inappropriate. “The others can bring money, investments, maybe even caviar, but they won’t be able to bring what you need to build a functioning free country,” he said.The remarks came as Bosnia to the north faced its most serious political crisis since the civil war ended 25 years ago, triggered by a rise in secessionist talk by the hardline leader of the Bosnian Serb entity.Rama said he worried about rising nationalism in Bosnia but that nationalism in the EU was now a bigger obstacle to the ambitions of those in the region to join the 27-member bloc.The EU had not “recovered” from the 2015 refugee crisis, he said, when more than 1m people sought asylum in Europe, mainly fleeing the Syrian war. Since then the EU had been “driven from fear and not from aspirations”, and governments “which are not extreme in themselves” are “influenced by the extremes”.When Albania began its accession process nearly two decades ago the key was to move away from Balkan nationalism, but “today, our problem is not Balkan nationalisms, it’s EU nationalisms. What’s keeping us from [joining the EU]. is the influence of EU nationalisms on the political life of the important EU countries.”Of the “western Balkan six”, Albania along with Serbia, Montenegro and North Macedonia are candidates to join the EU, while Kosovo and Bosnia are potential candidates. The region has big problems with corruption and commitment to the rule of law, but as Rama implied, the political calculations of EU members have also played a part in the delays in the 18 years since the block pledged to let them in once they had fulfilled the criteria.“Albanians have their own disappointments with Brussels, but this doesn’t change the conviction that we have to be there,” he said. “We’ve consumed all the love stories before, and the marriages,” he added in an implicit reference to the ties first with Russia and then China that Albania had in the communist era. “We’re looking for a new marriage, not for old ones. But of course, this kind of marriage is difficult.”Rama, in his third term, has been promoting the idea of a common regional market that all six countries agreed to in November 2020. In a bid to accelerate the process Albania, along with Serbia and North Macedonia, signed up to implement some of its provisions. “If we do this in the Balkans, this will be the best deterrent against craziness and if we don’t do it, nobody will do it for us.”He conceded the other three were reluctant. “Bosnians, because they cannot decide on anything, apparently, Montenegrins because they’re still under the illusion they can enter the EU next year, and every next year becomes the next year.Kosovo because of problems with Serbia, which I think can be addressed better when people sit down and talk.”As for Albania, which has in the past 30 years undergone a painful transition to rebuild its economy after the end of its strict communist regime, he said “it can be a place where people can enjoy life. Never 100 per cent disciplined, where everything will work like a Swiss watch or a German whatever, but never boring.”
217  Ukraine said it had evidence that a cyber attack against government websites on Friday was likely to have been carried out by Russia, amid fears that Moscow was planning military action after security talks with the US and Nato failed.“At the moment we can say that all evidence points to Russia being behind the attack,” Ukraine’s digital transformation ministry said in a statement on Sunday. “Moscow continues to wage hybrid war and is actively growing its information and cyber space capabilities.”Kyiv said the investigation was ongoing and did not formally attribute the attack to Russia.Jake Sullivan, US national security adviser, also stopped short of blaming Moscow on Sunday, but said: “It would not surprise me one bit if it ends up being attributed to Russia.”Separately, Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council said over the weekend that it suspected a hacking group tied to Belarusian intelligence had perpetrated the attack — suggesting Russia could have used its ally to create plausible deniability of its own involvement.Belarus’s authoritarian government, which has spearheaded a rapprochement with Russia after mass protests in the summer of 2020, has not commented on the allegations.Ukraine’s western allies have warned that cyber attacks could be a prelude to further military aggression after Moscow amassed 100,000 troops near the border in recent months.The cyber attack, which took down about 70 government websites, came as the White House warned Russia was positioning operatives in eastern Ukraine as part of a “false-flag operation” to create a “pretext for invasion”.The US and EU have vowed to impose “crippling” sanctions against Russia on a far greater scale than after the annexation of Crimea if it renewed its aggression against Ukraine. Russia seized control of the Ukrainian peninsula in 2014 and has since fomented a separatist war against Kyiv’s central government in the eastern Donbas region.Russia has denied it is planning to invade Ukraine but warned of an unspecified “military-technical response” if the US does not meet Vladimir Putin’s demands to roll back Nato’s eastward expansion and pledge never to admit former Soviet countries, including Ukraine.Western officials have refused to give ground on the demands while attempting to reach a compromise on issues such as arms control and military deployments.Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesperson, told CNN that the failure of the talks in Geneva, Brussels and Vienna was “disturbing”, as Moscow and Nato remained on “totally different tracks”.Peskov also refused to rule out that Moscow “would not deploy any offensive weapons on Ukraine’s territory”.Though a cyber attack could meet the threshold for imposing sanctions, western officials have not directly implicated Russia in the attack, while pointing to Moscow’s long history of electronic warfare operations.Victoria Nuland, US under-secretary of state for policy, told the Financial Times that the cyber attack was a “tried and true part of the Russian playbook” and said the west was focused on “inflicting very sharp pain very fast if Russia makes this move in any form”.On Sunday, Sullivan added that if the recent cyber attacks were proven to have been from Russia, more sanctions could be on the table. “Of course, if it turns out that Russia is pummeling Ukraine with cyber attacks, and if that continues over the period ahead, we will work with our allies on the appropriate response,” he told CBS News.The attack, which defaced the websites of Ukraine’s cabinet and several ministries, was intended to look like ransomware, but also left “destructive” malware “designed to render targeted devices inoperable”, Microsoft said in a blog post on Saturday.Microsoft did not identify the actors behind the attack or their intent, but said the incident had probably affected more victims than currently known and warned it represented “an elevated risk to any government agency, non-profit or enterprise located or with systems in Ukraine”.
218  More than a fifth of new cars sold across 18 European markets, including the UK, were powered exclusively by batteries, according to data compiled for the Financial Times by independent auto analyst Matthias Schmidt, while diesel cars, including diesel hybrids, accounted for less than 19 per cent of sales.Thanks to generous government subsidies in Germany and elsewhere, as well as strict regulations introduced in 2020 that force EU manufacturers to sell more low-emissions vehicles, electric sales have been rising steadily.The trend accelerated in the final quarter last year, as Tesla proved to be better able than rivals to adapt to bottlenecks in semiconductor supply chains by delivering a record 309,000 electric cars.European carmakers also pushed sales of electric vehicles in December to reduce their fleet-wide carbon footprint and avoid fines from Brussels, after prioritising the production of the most profitable models — mainly heavily polluting SUVs — during the supply chain crisis.As a result, 176,000 battery electric vehicles were sold in western Europe during that month — an all-time record — and more than 6 per cent higher than the number sold in December 2020. By comparison, nearly 160,000 diesels were sold in the last month of 2021.Sales of diesel cars have been in steady decline since Volkswagen was found to have cheated emissions tests for diesel engines installed in 11m vehicles. At the time, diesel models accounted for well above half the vehicles delivered in the 18 European countries surveyed. “The diesel death march has been playing on repeat since September 2015 when ‘Dieselgate’ was first unveiled — causing VW to draw up the first plans of the ID.3 within 30 days of the scandal coming to light,” said Schmidt, referring to Volkswagen’s flagship electric vehicle, which has been on sale since 2020.Volkswagen itself maintained its position as the leading electric vehicle producer in western Europe last year, selling more than 310,000 battery-powered models in the region in 2021, out of 3.5m in total.While a number of new electric models enticed new customers, bans for older diesel vehicles in some cities and increased taxes for diesel in key markets had further harmed sales of diesel cars, Schmidt added.The resale value of diesel vehicles in Germany — Europe’s largest car market — is also uncertain, as the new coalition government has signalled its intention to revisit tax credits for the fuel, which currently makes diesel roughly 14 cents per litre cheaper than premium petrol.Where climate change meets business, markets and politics. Explore the FT’s coverage here.Are you curious about the FT’s environmental sustainability commitments? Find out more about our science-based targets hereLetter in response to this article:Cut red tape for utilities, grid and charger operators / From Jean Bernard Lévy, President, Eurelectric, Brussels, Belgium
219  Sweden has sent hundreds of troops to reinforce a crucial island in the Baltic Sea as its defence minister warned that the Scandinavian country should not be naive and could be attacked.An emergency contingency unit of Sweden’s armed forces landed on Gotland on Friday and Saturday by plane and passenger ferry, bringing troops and equipment to an island many have compared to an aircraft carrier in the middle of the Baltic Sea.The deployment comes amid rising jitters in Nordic and Baltic countries about Russia’s intentions on its border with Ukraine, and how that could spill over to neighbouring countries. Swedish media noted at the weekend increased Russian naval activity in the Baltic Sea as troops were sent to Gotland.“It is clear there is a risk. An attack against Sweden cannot be ruled out.It’s important to show we are not naive. Sweden will not be caught napping if something happens. It is important to send signals that we take this situation seriously,” defence minister Peter Hultqvist told radio station Ekot on Saturday.Russia’s deployment of more than 100,000 troops to the Ukrainian border and its harsh diplomatic rhetoric has led Sweden and Finland, both militarily non-aligned, to stress that they retained the option to apply for Nato membership.A majority in Sweden’s parliament is in favour of membership of the military alliance, but the ruling centre-left Social Democrats are not and without their support Sweden is unlikely to join.Experts said that Sweden, which had no permanent military presence on Gotland from 2005 until 2016 as it decreased defence spending after the cold war, was forced to act so visibly owing to the relative weakness of its armed forces.It took similar action in August 2020 sending over armoured vehicles alongside holidaymakers’ campervans on the ferry to the popular tourist island as Russia held a number of military exercises in the region.Sweden has increased its defence spending significantly in recent years after a series of embarrassments including not being able to scramble jets as Russia simulated an attack on Stockholm as it was the Easter weekend, and searching unsuccessfully for a suspected Russian submarine in the archipelago outside the Swedish capital.The three Baltic countries, which are members of Nato, had long urged Sweden to take the security of Gotland more seriously, and Swedish forces — together with a large contingent of US troops — held their biggest exercise for decades in 2017 including an attack on Gotland, which one US general called “an unsinkable aircraft carrier”.Even as the extra troops arrived at the weekend, defence chiefs on Gotland tried to soothe the nerves of local residents. “I sleep rather well at night, and the risk of armed conflict is low,” said Mattias Ardin, head of the Gotland regiment.Swedish media reported that a large unidentified drone had flown over Stockholm on Saturday, including over the royal palace. It came after police reported on Friday unidentified drones flying over at least one and possibly as many as four nuclear power plants. Police, who informed Sweden’s armed forces, said they viewed the possibly connected sightings at the nuclear plants as “extremely serious”.
220  Barely had talks ended between Russian and western delegates last week before what one US official called the “drumbeat of war” began to resound. Ukraine was hit by a cyber attack paralysing at least 10 government websites. Though the attack has not been definitively tied to Moscow, the US warned it saw signs of Russian actors preparing “false flag” operations in Ukraine that could be used to justify a Russian intervention. Europe faces the real prospect of escalation, ranging from semi-covert and hybrid efforts by Moscow to destabilise Ukraine to all-out invasion.It would be hard then to avoid the conclusion that Vladimir Putin set up last week’s talks to fail, as a pretext for armed intervention he was bent on launching all along. The Kremlin will have known its hopes of a “Yalta”-style carve-up of Europe into zones of interest were futile. The US and Nato could never agree to rule out expansion of the alliance. But it was a significant concession for the US and its allies to engage at all over Russia’s security “concerns”. President Joe Biden has braved criticism for being prepared to talk to an aggressor who had already invaded and annexed part of a neighbouring country and was poised to attack again.Washington, moreover, engaged in good faith. The US offered potential areas for compromise including arms control, limits on military exercises, and re-establishing military communications channels. Progress on these could have helped to rebuild mutual confidence and pave the way for talks on trickier areas of discord.Some western officials fear that a Russian president who once weighed risks with care has become ever more deluded, heeding only a narrow circle who feed his prejudices. Putin’s personalised rule lacks the checks and balances even of the late Soviet period. Appeals to reason may, then, be futile.Yet renewed military action against Ukraine would be a riskier step than any Putin has taken in 22 years as Russia’s paramount leader. It would trigger western sanctions that could do much greater damage than those imposed after Russia annexed Crimea and fomented the Donbas conflict in 2014. The president is under pressure at home after years of falling real incomes. While the Kremlin may feel it has successfully withstood punitive US and EU measures in recent years, these have constrained growth and sorely needed foreign investment.Putin may believe, too, that he can repeat his “small war” of 2014, when he complicated Ukraine’s hopes of western integration, seized territory, and sent his poll ratings soaring — at what the Kremlin saw as an acceptable cost. Even today, Ukraine’s now much better trained and equipped army may be no match for the air power and heavy weaponry Russia could deploy. The lesson of eight years ago, however, was that even Ukraine’s Russophone easternmost regions did not fall easily into Russia’s lap. Ukrainians further west would mount an even more fierce and dogged resistance. The narrative of Russian body bags coming home from a Slavic “brother” nation, on top of an economic hit, could become difficult for the Kremlin to control.Above all, Russia’s aggression in 2014 did more to cement a Ukrainian sense of identity and sovereignty than any event since the second world war. It swung a previously sceptical majority in favour of joining Nato. New interference by Russia would entrench Ukrainian anger for generations. There may, sadly, be no one left in Moscow able to tell this to Russia’s president. Rather than going down in history as a modern-day “gatherer of Russian lands”, however, Putin might instead go down as the leader who finally lost Ukraine.Letter in response to this article:Why Ukraine says actions by Moscow violate a treaty / From Bate C Toms, Chair, British-Ukrainian Chamber of Commerce, Kyiv, Ukraine
221  In Jean Renoir’s 1937 film La Grande Illusion, German first world war commander Rauffenstein invites his prisoner Boeldieu, a captured fellow officer and aristocrat from the French side, to dine with him. They bond over the discovery that they used to frequent the same establishments in Paris. Partly elegiac, partly satirical, the film remains a landmark commentary on European history.It also serves to debunk an old criticism of the European project: that it could never succeed because there was no sense of common belonging or purpose between Europe’s different nations. In fact, Europe has always been criss-crossed with social, political and personal ties, often stronger than national ones.As Renoir illustrated, members of the same social class have more in common with each other across borders than they do across classes in the same nation (the film’s working-class characters, too, fraternise over food and shared destinies). At various times in history, European commonality has equalled or surpassed national fellow-feeling in institutions ranging from royalty and the church to the communist movement, football, and artistic and intellectual activity.Today, too, a European public sphere is visibly coming into being. “There’s more and more of a trans-European debate,” observes Christian Odendahl, chief economist at the Centre for European Reform, a London-headquartered think-tank with offshoots in Brussels and Berlin. “There are still national bubbles but a sense that we’re all in this debate together.” Growing interest in other countries’ politics flows from an awareness of interdependence — Odendahl says it started with the eurozone crisis — and even if it happens mostly at the level of elites, it is “passed on” by them to the national debate.“There is definitely a European economics,” says Beatrice Weder di Mauro, president of the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a network of economists. It serves a community of “people deeply interested in. how to make the European project stick and grow and deepen”. The CEPR’s VoxEU online platform has been the go-to place for economists sharing ideas about European policy questions.This intellectual ferment is not confined to the policy wonks. A crowdfunded effort is under way to launch a European Review of Books (disclosure: I donated), echoing the New York and London incarnations of that genre of cultural publication.Nor is it always driven by privileged classes with a vested interest in legitimising the institutions in which they work. The most profound exchange of ideas recently has been about what European identity means for Europeans with roots in places that suffered European colonialism. Writers such as Johnny Pitts and Hans Kundnani are widening our understanding in ways that are critical, provocative and a source of a much richer pan-European fellow-feeling in the future.Brexit is the glaring anomaly in this picture. Ironically enough, the UK referendum on Europe has accelerated the emergence of a European public sphere. It spurred the CER to set up offices elsewhere, while the CEPR is moving its headquarters from London to Paris, partly thanks to an offer of public funding. Presumably the French government sees the value of bringing together people “who want to think about how to manage Europe”, in Weder di Mauro’s words.Does this matter? It is early days. But the risk is that, just as a robust European public sphere emerges that many in the UK pronounced impossible, Britain’s links with it weaken. Domestic preoccupations, as well as the government’s desired global orientation, could well crowd out European matters beyond Brexit-related questions from Britain’s national conversation. To many, the Channel already feels wider.Against this, there are efforts to maintain and strengthen ties. The Europaeum, a group of top European universities set up explicitly to increase their interconnectedness and promote thinking about Europe, includes Oxford and St Andrews. And English rules supreme as the language of Europe’s debates. But even in this heyday of remote connectivity, where conversations take place and who convenes them still matters.La Grande Illusion illustrated something else. Rauffenstein and Boeldieu had a lot in common, but none of that prevented them from meeting as enemies in a devastating war. A strong sense of European commonality is no guarantee of pursuing common interests. But without even that, we would surely be doomed. We should be glad the sceptics are wrong to say it’s impossible.
222  The head of Illumina, the world’s largest gene sequencing company, has warned that EU attempts to block its $8bn acquisition of cancer-test maker Grail will cost lives and have a chilling effect on biotech investment.“We can get this test out around the world more quickly and affordably than Grail can on its own,” Francis deSouza told the Financial Times.“There is no question that us acquiring and integrating Grail will save many, many lives. And if we are forced to spin it out, you know, those lives will not be saved.”Illumina, which has a $63bn market capitalisation, is a US-based provider of DNA sequencing technology that is a critical component in the type of multi-cancer early detection tests developed by Grail. US and EU regulators have expressed concerns that Illumina could withhold access to its technology from potential competitors of Grail, limiting competition in the testing market.DeSouza denied Illumina had any incentive to do this as it earned most of its revenue through sales of its DNA sequencing technology.He said he was shocked at Brussels’ probe as Grail — a company backed by Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates — had no activities in the EU and did not operate in the same market as Illumina. Co-ordination between the European Commission and the US Federal Trade Commission, which launched a lawsuit last year aimed at blocking the deal, was unprecedented, he said.“I did get asked if this is like the Facebook-Instagram deal and this is nothing like that deal, which is a horizontal merger. They are two social media companies in the same market,” he said.“We’re a small company. They’re [regulators] looking to make precedent on a small company that they can then use against, you know, bigger companies.”The EU’s probe into Illumina’s acquisition of Grail is a test case for regulators seeking to see how much they can expand their powers to capture so-called killer acquisitions — a process whereby large market participants use their strong position to buy out rivals before they become serious contenders, undermining competition.Grail’s competitors argue that the deal would leave them unable to compete on fair terms. Illumina denies that the deal represents a killer acquisition as Illumina and Grail are not rivals.The probe follows a series of acquisitions led by Big Tech — including Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp and Instagram or Google’s acquisition of Fitbit. It comes at a time where European and US regulators are increasingly working in parallel on their scrutiny of potentially problematic transactions.“This is happening more,” said Arman Oruc, a partner in the antitrust and competition practice at Goodwin, a law firm.“For the FTC it can be more of a convenience that they work shoulder to shoulder with their colleagues in Brussels, and that way they don’t need to do as much work to stop the transaction from happening.”Vijay Kumar, analyst at Evercore ISI, said Illumina had taken an aggressive stance against Brussels, most notably by closing the transaction in August before it received clearance from EU or US authorities. The EU has said Illumina could face a fine of up to 10 per cent of global revenues after ordering it to keep Grail separate.“The company has made a strategic bet on Grail given the size of potential market opportunity — in tens of billions and this has become a very important case for regulators,” Kumar said.DeSouza said he was confident Illumina would prevail in a case launched against the commission at the General Court of the European Union, which argues it has no jurisdiction to investigate the Grail deal. A loss in the case could disrupt global businesses, he said.“If everybody started doing what the European Commission is doing, you know if China thought, hey, we can assert jurisdiction between the merger of any two companies anywhere in the world.then as a business it would be very hard to do any kind of merger because you would need an approval from all 200 countries around the world.”DeSouza said there was a risk that a victory for Brussels would encourage similar interventions in other deals and disrupt the established investment model for biotech companies.“Venture capitalists know to invest in that model, expecting liquidity through an acquisition. And if you take that away, I think it could impact investment into the space,” he said.Brussels defended its stance in court last month in Luxembourg. Nicholas Khan, of the European Commission Legal Service, told judges it was right for Brussels to take on the case after a referral from the French.
223  Zbigniew Ziobro did not mince his words when he asked Poland’s top court to rule on whether the EU’s new conditionality mechanism was compatible with the country’s constitution.“I do not have the slightest doubt that it.is blatantly at odds,” Poland’s hawkish justice minister said, arguing that the EU rules — making access to funding from Brussels conditional on adherence to the rule of law — could be used to “blackmail” Poland.Besides the punchbag of Brussels, there was a second, implicit butt of Ziobro’s criticism. Poland could have blocked the mechanism in December 2020 by vetoing the EU budget. But in the end, Poland’s prime minister — and Ziobro’s great rival — Mateusz Morawiecki did not do so.Ziobro’s double-edged salvo was emblematic of the hardline stance he has staked out during Poland’s half-decade battle with Brussels over the rule of law. But it was also an example of how relations with the EU are part of a battle over the future of the Polish right between rival groups in the conservative-nationalist ruling coalition.For now, Poland’s right remains dominated by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who co-founded Law and Justice (PiS) — the largest party in the ruling coalition — and is widely regarded as the country’s most powerful politician. But a younger generation of politicians, with Ziobro and Morawiecki among them, is jockeying for position ahead of both parliamentary elections, due by 2023 at the latest, and the day when Kaczynski’s hegemony eventually ends.“The retirement of Kaczynski will be the beginning of division on the right. and I can’t imagine Morawiecki and Ziobro on the same boat without him,” said Wojciech Szacki, a political expert at Polityka Insight. “They have different ideas, different visions, different backgrounds, different goals, so basically there will be no peace between them.”Morawiecki is a relative moderate. The multilingual former banker entered frontline politics via the ministries of development and finance before being installed as prime minister by Kaczynski in 2017, in part to improve relations with the EU after the bruising premiership of Beata Szydlo.Ziobro, by contrast, is a hardliner. He served as justice minister in Kaczynski’s first government in the mid-2000s, before being expelled from PiS for questioning its direction. He then founded his own party, United Poland, which has adopted uncompromising positions on everything from LGBT rights to climate policy. After a period in the wilderness, the party became one of PiS’s two junior coalition partners ahead of its return to power in 2015.United Poland has just 19 MPs in Poland’s 460-seat lower house, and opinion polls rarely give it more than a few per cent support. But since PiS’s second junior coalition partner — Jaroslaw Gowin’s Agreement — left the government in August, depriving it of its formal majority and forcing it to cobble together majorities on a vote-by-vote basis, the votes of United Poland have taken on outsized importance.Ziobro and his allies have taken aim at other EU policies accepted by Morawiecki, including the bloc’s ambitious climate goals. One of the most explicit attacks came in December, when Janusz Kowalski, a United Poland MP, called for Konrad Szymanski, Europe minister and an ally of Morawiecki, to resign, criticising several aspects of Poland’s relationship with the EU.Allies of Morawiecki say he has his own reservations about some of the EU’s actions towards Poland. But they say he still hopes to resolve the long-running feud over the rule of law that has prompted Brussels to delay approving billions of euros in funding, and argue that Ziobro’s manoeuvring and attacks on the EU undermine his efforts to do so.“The prime minister is.very keen to find a compromise. But there are some red lines that even he couldn’t agree to,” said one person close to the government. “And there is of course huge internal pressure, especially from the ministry of justice, not to help the negotiations.”Ziobro’s supporters bristle at such suggestions, and argue instead that Poland’s mistake was not taking a harder line with Brussels.“More and more politicians from PiS see that we were right in this argument with Morawiecki. That we should have fought harder with the EU, that Ziobro won that argument,” said Kowalski.“There was meant to be money, and there isn’t; everything was meant to be great, and it isn’t. And people are asking why? Who was right, who was not? To put it briefly, we were right.”The simmering tensions have prompted renewed speculation over the coalition’s durability. However, analysts are sceptical that a divorce before the 2023 elections would help either party. PiS would be well short of a parliamentary majority without its junior coalition partner. And if United Poland ran alone, it is not clear that it would clear the 5 per cent threshold for representation in parliament.“The thing that keeps United Poland on board is the thought that a scenario outside an alliance with PiS is not a rosy one,” said Aleks Szczerbiak, professor of politics at the UK’s University of Sussex. “[Gowin’s departure] strengthens them.But on the other hand it’s a warning of what could happen [if they fall out with PiS].”In the longer term, however, many observers think that United Poland has broader ambitions. “I think that Ziobro has never given up on the idea of creating a party that is capable of an independent life outside PiS,” said Szacki. “He is preparing the ground for an even more anti-European movement once Kaczynski retires, and the right has to start over.”
224  A senior US official said a large-scale cyber attack against Ukraine on Friday was a “tried and true part of the Russian playbook”, as Washington ramped up warnings that Moscow was setting the stage for a possible invasion of its neighbour.In an interview with the Financial Times, Victoria Nuland, the US under-secretary of state for political affairs, stopped short of blaming Russia for the cyber attack, which targeted dozens of Ukrainian government websites. But she said the episode was part of a familiar and disturbing pattern of actions from Moscow.“I’m not ready to share anything on attribution at the moment. I would simply say that this is a tried and true part of the Russian playbook, as you know, all around the world,” Nuland said.“In the past, Russian operatives have done this to destabilise governments, to test their own capabilities, to undercut the sense of confidence of governments that they have gripes with. So anything is possible here,” she added.Nuland’s comments came on a day in which the White House stepped up its warnings that Russia was preparing for a military offensive in Ukraine. These included a claim that Moscow was seeking to create a pretext for war by positioning operatives in eastern Ukraine to conduct a “false-flag operation” that would carry out “acts of sabotage against Russia’s own proxy forces”.The allegations came at the end of a week of talks between the US, Nato and Russian officials to defuse the crisis, which were dismissed as “unsuccessful” by Moscow, raising fears that an invasion could now be more likely.The US has said that if Russia attacked Ukraine, it would face massive retaliation from America and its allies in Europe, including economic and financial sanctions on a far greater scale than during Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea.Biden administration officials have said the US was already ready to roll out those sanctions if needed, and their scope would depend on the nature of Russia’s aggression.“I’m not going to preview 18 different scenarios.I would simply say that our commitment and the conversation that we have with our allies is around inflicting very sharp pain very fast, if Russia makes this move in any form,” Nuland said.However she added that from the US perspective, the door to a diplomatic solution was still open, and Washington was working on written responses to Russian officials.“We want to keep talking,” Nuland said. “We believe that it needs to be done on the basis of reciprocity — namely, they’re going to have grievances but we have concerns, too.”The US has so far offered to discuss arms control and limits on military exercises in the region but rebuffed Russian requests to pull back troops from certain countries or bar them from joining the Nato alliance.“We believe that we can de-escalate and we can make some progress on some of these things through diplomacy,” Nuland said. “We hope and expect that with some of the ideas that we put on the table, Moscow will stay at the table, but that’s Putin’s choice.”“All we’ve done so far is hear each other out,” she added. “We haven’t begun the kinds of conversations that we would have to have to try to reach agreements, particularly if they want these agreements to have binding force. So we would need more time.”Nuland, who was a senior state department official responsible for Europe during Barack Obama’s presidency, sought to brush off concerns that some European countries would resist more aggressive sanctions because of economic and political concerns, saying the talks with allies were “very rich and very full” and the US had “a very good picture of what we can do”.“Remember that this is an aggression in Europe, and this is changing the map of Europe. So you know, none of us wants to ask for our citizens or our companies to make sacrifices, but sometimes national and international security requires that,” she said.Nuland said the US was, however, trying to “understand” European countries’ exposures to sanctions, to “build that package that shares the burden as equally as we can and that people are ready to implement”. She also suggested that the US and European sanctions measures may not be “identical”.“Sometimes there are things that Europe can do that are harder for us and sometimes it’s the other way around,” she said.
225  But what if there is no war? For investors with a high-risk appetite that are willing to overlook geopolitical tensions and concerns over the way Moscow governs, the research might be better deployed on deep-value Russian equities.One outcome of the Kremlin’s economic and social control over its big companies is high dividend payouts. Since 2016, it has been Russian state policy to force key companies to pay out at least half of their profits in dividends. This has proved helpful in raising the cash to meet pension and military-industrial development costs. For investors, that means there are quite a few deep-value Russian equities with high dividend yield. According to Renaissance Capital, the consensus forecast for the dividend yield on MSCI Russia Index companies over the next 12 months is currently at 11 per cent. That is the largest such estimated yield among all countries in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.This may be counterintuitive to those who formed their understanding of Russian asset management based on the 1990s model of crime bosses turned goon-enabled oligarchs. Or on the longer history of Russian corporate misgovernance. Note the old Russian proverbs: “Blat (corruption) is stronger than Stalin” or “In the west they make money from profits. In Russia we make money from costs.”President Vladimir Putin knows more of those jokes than you do. From the Kremlin’s perspective, every dollar a corporate insider siphons from company cash flow into property on the Côte d’Azur is a dollar lost. And, while Moscow does not care what some non-government organisation thinks about western-style press freedom, it is interested in imposing international accounting standards on public companies. Especially legacy resource companies with partial state ownership.This may seem contrary to the usual classical liberal reasoning, which is that state-owned enterprises will be less investor-responsive than sweat-of-the-brow private sector entities, but go back to that proverb about Russians making money from costs. Cash paid in dividends is cash that has not been diverted by crooked managers.And, according to one study co-authored by an interior ministry (MVD) academician, “in Russia, when information asymmetry is higher, the dividend payments will be lower”. In this context, “information asymmetry” means that company insiders do not pass the truth to either the public or the state. That makes for bad decisions at the centre.It would be better if there were a free press to analyse that information, and there is not. Enterprising financial publications such as VTimes have been shut down.There are, though, oversight “organs” such as the MVD and the Accounts Chamber. And local institutional and retail investors are growing in influence. International investors have in effect transferred oversight “technology” to Russia, which helps reinforce the internal transparency the Kremlin has sought since tsarist times.The high dividend-increased corporate transparency regime was first codified by the finance ministry under former prime minister Dmitry Medvedev, who arguably was not the most convincing leader for anti-corruption campaigns. The current prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, made his bones by his digital transformation of the Russian tax service.While Mishustin makes all the expected noises about “sovereignty” and “Made in Russia”, he supports the finance ministry’s corporate governance push, and has concentrated on reducing the stultifying complexity and opacity of the central administration.His efforts can, and have, been described as “Foolproofing Putinism”. And they have been accompanied by political repression and an aggressive foreign policy. The corporate governance efforts, however, have the effect of serving not only “Putinism”, but the interests of foreign portfolio investors in Russia’s resource extraction industries such as oil, gas and fertilisers, as well as the country’s capable metallurgical sector.There are, of course, still big risks with investing in Russian companies. The companies that put on what might be described as the acceptable face of Russian capitalism tend to be the ones that interact most with the outside world. Others are more opaque. There are also major problems with the Russian state’s high-handed approach to the law, and its mistreatment of companies that offend it for some reason. You never quite know what lies round the corner. The Mishustin administration is also lagging behind in introducing 5G wireless, which is essential to Russia’s diversification beyond resource exploitation and its attractiveness as an investment centre.Even so, investors targeting dividend yield in some of the biggest Russian companies will find their interests may be aligned with those of Putin and his finance ministry.
226  The US has accused Russia of planning covert operations, including sabotage, in eastern Ukraine to create a “pretext for invasion”, after diplomatic efforts to defuse the crisis faltered and government websites were hit by a major cyber attack.The White House said it had information indicating that Russia had “pre-positioned” a group of operatives to conduct a “false-flag” operation in eastern Ukraine. “The operatives are trained in urban warfare and in using explosives to carry out acts of sabotage against Russia’s own proxy-forces,” said Jen Psaki, White House press secretary.The claims and the cyber attack on Ukraine government websites follows tense negotiations this week between the US, Nato and western allies and Russia. The US and Nato hoped the talks would deter Russian president Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine. Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in 2014.However, senior Russian officials this week dismissed the rounds of talks with Nato and the US, calling them a “dead end”.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied that Moscow was preparing to create a pretext for invasion of eastern Ukraine, saying western media reports were based on “unfounded” information, Tass news agency said.So-called false-flag operations are designed to hide the true source of a provocative act. Psaki said such “sabotage activities” and “information operations” had the aim of accusing “Ukraine of preparing an imminent attack against Russian forces”.Ukraine’s army defence intelligence service also warned that Russian special services were “preparing provocations” against Russia’s own military to justify military aggression against its neighbour.The American allegations came as the Ukrainian government struggled to combat what said was a “massive cyber attack”, which took down about 70 government websites. Targets included the ministerial cabinet, a number of ministries, the state treasury and the Diia electronic public services platform, where vaccination certificates and electronic passports are stored.“Ukrainians! All your personal data has been uploaded to the public network,” read a message posted on the foreign ministry’s website. “All information about you has become public, fear and expect the worst.”Ukraine’s Centre for Strategic Communications, a government agency set up to counter Russia’s aggression, accused Moscow of being behind the cyber attacks while noting that investigators had yet to formally draw such a conclusion.“This is not the first or even the second time that Ukrainian internet resources have been attacked since the beginning of Russia’s military aggression,” the agency said. Ukrainian officials recently warned that cyber attacks and other efforts to destabilise the country would be a prelude to further aggression.Comments at the end of the hackers’ message referred to Ukrainian insurgent fighters during the second world war and appeared to chastise Ukraine for ethnic clashes and atrocities. Poland and Ukraine have accused each other of committing atrocities during the period in the region.Julianne Smith, the US ambassador to Nato, said proof of a Russian cyber attack would “certainly” be classed as an example of renewed aggression against Ukraine, which could trigger western sanctions against Moscow.“We are monitoring everything that Russia is going to be doing towards Ukraine,” she said.Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary-general, said he “strongly” condemned the cyber attacks.Josep Borrell, Brussels’ top diplomat, said the EU’s political and security committee and cyber units would discuss how to help Kyiv.“We are going to mobilise all our resources to help Ukraine to tackle this cyber attack. Sadly, we knew it could happen,” Borrell said at an EU foreign ministers’ meeting in France.
227  The UK and EU on Friday agreed to intensify talks to try to reach a compromise on contentious post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland that have soured relations between the two sides.UK foreign secretary Liz Truss and European Brexit commissioner Maros Sefcovic issued a joint statement praising the “cordial atmosphere” after their first face to face talks at her grace and favour mansion at Chevening in Kent.The tone was very different to last year. Lord David Frost, the UK Brexit negotiator who resigned in December, often focused on differences between the two sides and made regular threats to suspend the Northern Ireland protocol, the part of Britain’s withdrawal agreement with the EU that governs trade between Great Britain and the region.The UK is demanding a sweeping overhaul of the protocol on the grounds it is impeding the flow of goods to Northern Ireland as well as causing political unrest in the region.Truss and Sefcovic said UK and EU officials would hold “intensified talks” next week, with the British foreign secretary and European Brexit commissioner then meeting on January 24.“What I want is a negotiated solution, I think there is a deal to be done,” said Truss, who assumed responsibility for UK negotiations with the EU on the Northern Ireland protocol after Frost’s resignation. “We have had constructive talks.”Truss has previously said she could trigger Article 16 of the protocol to suspend several of its provisions, but she has also placed more emphasis than Frost on reaching a compromise with the EU.“Clearly, if we don’t make sufficient progress, we will have to look at the alternatives but my absolute desire is to get a deal that works for people,” she added.People close to the talks between Truss and Sefcovic said officials did not engage in technical level discussions on the substantial issues at stake. Sefcovic said on Twitter: “Now it’s time to start taking issues off the table.”Under the UK withdrawal agreement, Northern Ireland stayed in the EU single market for goods to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and preserve the peace process enshrined in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.The Northern Ireland protocol instead placed a border in the Irish Sea, and requires customs and regulatory checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.To try to strike a compromise on the protocol, the European Commission in October proposed to cut up to 80 per cent of checks on animal and plant-based products, and halve the customs paperwork.But the UK has said it should be as easy to send something from Liverpool to Belfast as Liverpool to Birmingham.EU officials said the current talks involving Truss and Sefcovic represented a step forward after the process had stalled under Frost.Simon Coveney, Ireland’s foreign minister, called for a compromise to be reached on the Northern Ireland protocol soon, well ahead of the dissolution of the region’s devolved assembly in March and elections scheduled for May 5.“My understanding is that both sides really simply outlined their positions,” he told RTÉ radio. “There wasn’t any real progress on trying to find landing zones at this stage, but I don’t think that was the purpose of this meeting.”He added: “We would like to have, if possible, these issues resolved by the end of February.”
228  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
229  The German economy shrank as much as 1 per cent in the final three months of last year, as the latest coronavirus restrictions and supply chain bottlenecks kept output below pre-pandemic levels.The Federal Statistical Office on Friday published initial estimates showing Europe’s largest economy managed growth of 2.7 per cent last year, despite fourth-quarter output falling between 0.5 and 1 per cent from the previous quarter.The figures mark a rebound from 2020, when German gross domestic product shrank 4.6 per cent in a record postwar recession caused by the Covid-19 crisis. But the country is lagging behind other big economies, including the US, France and UK, which have rebounded above pre-pandemic levels of output.Georg Thiel, president of Destatis, the German statistics agency, said the country’s GDP remained 2 per cent below pre-pandemic levels. “Despite the ongoing pandemic situation and increasing supply and material bottlenecks, the German economy was able to recover after the slump in the previous year, although economic output has not yet reached the pre-crisis level.”Growth would have been lower without the extra contribution from the licence fees earned by the German vaccine developer BioNTech, which boosted overall GDP by 0.5 percentage points last year, according to Destatis.Germany’s vast manufacturing sector has been hamstrung for months by supply chain delays and shortages of materials such as semiconductors. Its larger services sector is also being hampered by new restrictions to contain a record surge in coronavirus infections.“The final quarter of 2021 was probably weak given necessary restrictions in contact-intense services and production difficulties in manufacturing due to persistent supply bottlenecks,” the German finance ministry said in a statement.Economists expect the German economy to rebound strongly later this year once coronavirus restrictions are lifted and supply bottlenecks ease. But they worry that if the problems persist, the country could slide into recession — defined as two consecutive quarters of falling GDP.Carsten Brzeski, head of macro research at ING, said: “The annual numbers mask a contraction in the economy in the final quarter of 2021, emphasising the high risk for the economy to fall into an outright recession at the turn of the year.”The Bundesbank last month cut its German growth forecasts but said it still expected the economy to rebound above pre-pandemic levels of GDP in the coming months with growth of 4.2 per cent in 2022, boosted by a “boom in private consumption”, as well as higher exports and business investment.“From early summer onwards, we expect a strong economic recovery again with the seasonal waning of corona,” said Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank. “This is also supported by the fact that manufacturing’s order books are fuller than at any time since statistics began in the early 1960s.”Destatis said output in the country’s manufacturing sector last year remained 6 per cent below 2019 levels, while the shortfall in the sports, culture and entertainment sector was 9.9 per cent.This was partly offset by a rebound in the public sector, which was boosted by increased government spending, as the country’s budget deficit increased slightly to €153.9bn last year, the second highest since the country’s reunification more than 30 years ago.
230  The author is a former US assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairsIn the face of the Kremlin’s military pressure on Ukraine, the US and European allies held firm this week in three rounds of discussions with Russia. As Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary-general, and US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman put it, Nato and the US are willing to discuss military transparency and arms control measures such as reciprocal limits on missiles and military exercises.But they didn’t yield to the Kremlin’s principal demands. There will be no promise to end Nato enlargement, no cut-off of military co-operation with Ukraine and no reductions of US troop levels in Nato members such as Poland.The US and Europe showed consistency of principle, steadiness and solidarity. But the western allies made no apparent progress in getting the Kremlin to stand down from its threats of new aggression. Now what?Initial Russian reaction to the talks has been chilly. Sergei Ryabkov, deputy foreign minister, warned that there was no basis for new meetings with the US. The Russian military build-up against Ukraine continues. And the Kremlin is hinting at escalation. Ryabkov refused to rule out deployment of Russian military assets to Cuba or Venezuela. According to media reports from Stockholm, Russia is sending naval units to the Baltic Sea and the Swedish military is increasing patrols there.We shouldn’t be surprised. Vladimir Putin initiated this crisis out of nothing, seeking leverage through intimidation and counting on European disunity and US distraction after the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. It is too much to expect that one week of allied unity would cause him to back down.The US and Europe have prepared powerful countermeasures, should Russia launch fresh attacks on Ukraine: new military equipment to Ukraine, US and other deployments to Nato’s eastern flank countries, broader sanctions and other economic measures. But the US has also indicated that it will hold back on these steps until and unless the Kremlin acts. This offers Putin an opportunity to continue to apply pressure, looking to wear down western resistance to the Kremlin’s demands. Moscow could launch cyber attacks or limited military actions against Ukraine, testing Nato and US resolve and Ukrainian resilience. The next weeks could see a ramp-up of Kremlin threats and even aggression.The US and Europe are nevertheless well placed to prevail in this stand-off if they keep up their determination and strength under pressure. As during the cold war, the Kremlin has the tactical advantage of being able to threaten and bluster at will. But, as we also learned in the cold war, domestic tyranny keeps Russia economically weak, politically brittle and ultimately unable to sustain a prolonged confrontation with the US and Europe. At home, Putin has all the guns. But Russian society does not seem enthusiastic about a long war against Ukraine. Launching one would be a risky roll of the dice for Putin. If the Kremlin does so, or otherwise provokes the west sufficiently, it is likely to generate sustained counterpressure that will end badly for it.The US and Europe need to keep framing the issues the right way: resist the temptation to respond to threats with concessions, and maintain a willingness to discuss European security in a way that benefits all, not just Moscow.One Kremlin trap to avoid is to talk about Nato as if its enlargement is aggression for which Moscow must be compensated. There was no US promise not to enlarge Nato. By contrast, there was a formal Russian commitment to respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity, the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, violated when the Kremlin seized Ukrainian territory in 2014.Nato’s enlargement occurred in parallel with the development of a Nato-Russia entente in the era of Boris Yeltsin and the Clinton administration. From the outset, the US and Nato have been ready to discuss Russia’s military security as Nato took in new members and honoured commitments limiting its deployments in Europe.Putin hates the core meaning of Nato and EU enlargement: the collapse of the Iron Curtain and the Soviet Union, and in their place a united Europe, with 100m Europeans between Germany and Russia free to join their western European brethren. Ukrainians saw the advances in liberty and prosperity to their west and, understandably, want some of that for themselves.Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov gave away the game when he called the nations liberated by the fall of communism in 1989 and the end of the Soviet Union in 1991 not liberated, sovereign countries but orphaned or masterless “territories”. Putin wants the empire back. He wants to reverse the end of the cold war and reclaim Moscow’s sphere of domination.The US and Europe should have no part of this. They should be patient, determined and respond firmly to provocations. Then the Kremlin just might find a way to move from ultimatums to a more productive discussion of European security, perhaps re-establishing arms control, transparency and stabilisation measures that the Kremlin has ignored, violated or denigrated in recent years. There is a way ahead, but the coming weeks could be rough.
231  The eurozone’s economic powerhouse is stuttering. Courtesy of the FT’s Frankfurt bureau chief Martin Arnold this morning:Meanwhile, inflation for the year to December came in at 5.3 per cent. Unlike the UK, the US, and euro area counterparts such as France, Germany’s GDP remains below its pre-pandemic levels. That’s despite the country, in terms of pandemic-related health outcomes, faring better than the other three.Economists agree that most of the blame for its lacklustre performance lies with supply chain bottlenecks. Germany’s manufacturing prowess means that an awful lot of value added comes from its automotive industry, for instance, which has been hit particularly hard by the chip shortage.Economists, however, are less united on what comes next.Take ING Bank’s Carsten Brzeski, who is positive that — after a dismal first quarter characterised by supply chain snags, high energy prices and an Omicron wave — we’ll see a strong rebound in output as the weather warms:Andrew Kenningham of research outfit Capital Economics is less convinced the source of the economy’s troubles will dissipate any time soon:Our own view is that the bottlenecks which are hindering German growth, and triggering inflation, will take a long time to clear.Take the impact of the chips shortage on used car prices.Some chipmakers began to report excess stock towards the back end of last year, so the picture might — on the face of it — look rosier now than it did a few months ago. But cars require dozens of different sorts of semiconductor chips, not all of which may be readily available just yet. Carmakers are compensating by offering new vehicles that lack some of the features they usually offer. Customers, desperate for a car they’ve been waiting upwards of a year for, might take them. But they might not. Even if chips do become readily available, or customers settle for a vehicle short of a mod con or two, there are substantial backlogs. Order books will take a couple of quarters to fulfil, leaving those who are not on the waiting list having to settle for a used vehicle.Anyone hoping for a good deal on an old Five Series will almost certainly be waiting a while yet.Of course, automobiles are not the entire German economy. Weak consumption also weighed on growth. Once the Omicron wave passes, we will no doubt see higher spending on services. That will lift the mood. Still, manufacturing matters far more here for elsewhere — both for output, and even more so for growth.The real risk is that, if we get towards the back end of this year and bottlenecks (and therefore price pressures) endure, then companies are going to come under a lot of pressure to pass on the costs to their customers and pay their employees more. In the process, higher inflation risks becoming entrenched, denting the country’s longer term prospects.For now, the workers of the eurozone — including in Germany — have not seen the sort of pay growth that their counterparts on the other side of the Atlantic have. Indeed, negotiated salaries (an important part of the wage bargaining process here) have yet to be impacted by inflation at all.The relationship between labour and capital in Germany is relatively harmonious and collaborative. Unions’ preference for benefits that offer a better work-life balance over higher pay has kept a lid on wage growth too.The longer the supply chain snags remain an issue, the lower the chance this trend holds. And the greater the likelihood that this once short-term shock begins to have deeper ramifications.
232  European gas prices jumped on Friday after the breakdown in security talks between Russia and the US deepened concerns about supplies.Russia said on Thursday that this week’s talks with the US and Nato had failed to address its security grievances, casting doubt over the prospect of a western diplomatic push to defuse Moscow’s threat of military action against Ukraine.The news pushed the benchmark European gas contract almost 25 per cent higher over the last two sessions to reach €90 per megawatt hour. Traders fear these geopolitical tensions will constrain Russia’s gas exports to the continent, just at the time when inventories have shrunk to the lowest level on record for the time of year.The latest rally in gas prices comes after a volatile period in energy markets that has lasted for months. Continental European and UK gas prices surged to record levels last year, driven in part by Russia restricting exports to long-term contracts. In the past, additional spot sales were more readily available.The International Energy Agency, the OECD-funded watchdog, this week accused Moscow of effectively using tight supplies to its advantage at a time of rising geopolitical tensions, saying it had reduced exports by 25 per cent year on year in the fourth quarter of 2021.Gas prices had pulled back from record levels at the end of December as warmer weather in Asia allowed European traders to source huge volumes of seaborne liquefied natural gas.But with tensions between Russia and the west showing little sign of easing, gas prices have headed higher again. A temporary outage at a large Norwegian gasfield has added to market nerves.“While [our] data shows western Europe could be in for a record-breaking month in terms of [liquefied natural gas] deliveries in January, continued low pipeline supply from Russia and a partial outage at Norway’s Troll gasfield — which is the largest in the North Sea — have sent European prices sharply higher once more,” said Tom Marzec-Manser, an analyst at consultancy ICIS.Russia has repeatedly denied restricting sales but has also indicated it wants customers to commit to more long-term deals. It has also linked increased exports to the approval of the politically controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany.The pipeline, which runs through the Baltic Sea, would allow Russia to largely bypass Ukraine, which the US and eastern European countries fear would weaken Kyiv.Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and has threatened the country further by deploying 100,000 troops along the border. Moscow says the troops are there for military exercises but has said it could respond with force if its demands for a ban on Nato enlargement are not met.Ukraine said on Friday it had been the target of a “massive cyber attack” after at least 10 government websites ceased functioning, including those linked to energy, foreign and veterans affairs.Margrethe Vestager, European commissioner for competition, said on Thursday she was looking into Gazprom’s market behaviour as a “priority”, signalling Brussels may be ready to open a formal probe into the state-owned Russian gas giant.“It is indeed thought-provoking that a company in view of increasing demand limits supply,” Vestager said. “That is quite rare behaviour in the market place.”Traders said gas demand would also likely rise in the coming weeks after France’s EDF revised down its planned nuclear power output on Friday, which should lead to more gas being burnt for power generation.The state-backed nuclear giant’s shares fell almost 25 per cent on Friday after it issued a profit warning following demands from the French government to sell discounted power to help shield consumers from the energy crisis.
233  Turkish and Armenian officials have met in Moscow for the first round of talks aimed at normalising relations and reopening a border between the two countries that has been closed for almost three decades.Both nations hailed the “positive and constructive atmosphere” after a meeting in the Russian capital between Turkey’s envoy Serdar Kilic, a former ambassador to the US, and Ruben Rubinyan, deputy speaker of the Armenian parliament.They said they had agreed “to continue negotiations without preconditions aiming at full normalisation”.The normalisation drive, the first since a previous peace effort collapsed in 2009, is not seeking to address the fraught issue of the Armenian genocide of 1915, which remains a source of deep acrimony and mistrust between the neighbouring nations.Instead, the historic foes were prioritising a more practical, pared back approach, analysts said, with a focus on boosting trade and transport links as well as appointing diplomatic representatives.The 300km Turkish-Armenian border was briefly open in the early 1990s when Armenia, a former member of the Soviet Union, declared independence after the collapse of the federation.But Turkey closed the frontier in 1993 in protest at Yerevan’s takeover of an area near Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly ethnic Armenian region that is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan.The fresh negotiations come at a time when president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has suffered growing regional isolation in recent years, is in the midst of a diplomatic push to improve relations with a string of former foes, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, as his country reels from an economic crisis.But the most significant driver of the detente, analysts said, was the surprise gains made by Azerbaijan, a close ally of Turkey and arch foe of Armenia, in the conflict that erupted in Nagorno-Karabakh in September 2020. Russia-brokered ceasefire terms, agreed in November that same year, handed Baku most of the land it had lost to Armenia in the 1990s.This has reduced the incentive for Azerbaijan to disrupt the negotiations, as it did in 2009 when a previous Turkish-Armenian peace deal was abandoned.“The situation is dramatically different from the previous round of engagement,” said Richard Giragosian, director of the Regional Studies Center, a Yerevan think-tank. “Azerbaijan is much less the obstacle because of greater self-confidence because of their victory in the war.”While Giragosian described the aim of the latest talks as “bare minimum” normalisation, he added that, if successful, they could become the foundation for “a generation-long process of reconciliation”, which could address the deep wounds left by the deaths of up to 1.5m Armenians during the first world war in modern-day Turkey as the Ottoman Empire was crumbling.Turkey rejects the term genocide. It denies that the deaths were caused by a state-orchestrated campaign and argues that many Turks also lost their lives in the huge upheaval and violence that marred the era.Ahead of Friday’s talks, international observers had been cheered by signs of goodwill from both sides, which included the launch of direct charter flights between Istanbul and Yerevan. Armenia has given permission for a road and rail link to be built through its southern region to enable Azerbaijan to reach its exclave of Nakhchivan.Nigar Goksel, Turkey project director at the conflict prevention organisation International Crisis Group, described the direct talks as “a very significant development”, but cautioned that they could falter.She said that nationalists on both sides could spoil the talks. She also warned that Armenian prime minister Nikol Pashinyan, who won elections last summer despite overseeing the defeat in Nagorno-Karabakh, was eager to move fast, but Turkey was more cautious. “They don’t want a rushed process,” she said. “That could be one of the discrepancies between the two sides.”This article has been amended since publication to make it clear that Turkey closed its border with Armenia in response to Yerevan’s takeover of an area near Nagorno-Karabakh, not Nagorno-Karabakh itself.
234  EDF shares slid more than 20 per cent on Friday after the French energy group warned that a state move to limit the impact of soaring power prices on consumers would cost it up to €8.4bn, and extended outages at several nuclear plants.The government, which has pledged a 4 per cent cap on rises in household electricity bills this year despite an unprecedented surge in wholesale energy prices, said on Thursday that EDF would have to increase the volume of nuclear power it sells to rival suppliers at a price far below the market rate.Shares in the company, which also scrapped its debt and profit guidance for 2022, fell as much as 23 per cent in early trading on Friday.The group could now have to raise capital to counter the blow, analysts said.EDF, which has been trying to reduce its high debt and free up funds for investments in renewable energy as well as prepare for a new phase of French nuclear reactor commissions, said it would “consider appropriate measures to strengthen its balance sheet structure and any measure to protect its interests”.France had been spared some of the price jumps seen elsewhere in Europe as gas costs soar, due in part to its supply of nuclear energy provided by EDF, although the government has brought in help for some low-income households. Cuts to an electricity tax have already cost the state about €8bn.To soften the blow to the company, the set price at which it sells to rivals will be increased slightly to €46.2 per megawatt-hour from the current €42. But the group said the government measures could hit earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation by €7.7bn-€8.4bn based on market prices in December and January, the utility said.Barbara Pompili, environment minister, told LCI TV that the government stood ready to help EDF withstand the blow, although she did not give details.Analysts at Bernstein, however, said the “political intervention is certainly diametrically opposite to the government’s medium-term goals of steering the company to calmer waters”.Governments across Europe have examined ways to keep price rises in check or shield consumers from higher bills, with many wary of the political fallout from soaring energy prices. Spain announced clawbacks on energy companies’ profits last year, although it later eased some of those measures.In France, which will hold a presidential election in April, President Emmanuel Macron faced street protests in 2018 when he attempted to introduce a fuel tax to dissuade people from using diesel cars.The backlash later morphed into a broader series of gripes against the government as part of the “gilets jaunes” or “yellow vests” movement.Adding to EDF’s woes, the group said late on Thursday that it was lowering its 2022 nuclear power output forecast to 300-330 terawatt-hours from 330-360TWh. It said it had found welding faults at its Penly 1 reactor that echoed similar problems at four other reactors, and was extending an outage period at all five.It gave no financial estimate for that hit, but analysts said it could cost the group several billion euros more.EDF’s nuclear prospects had seemed to be improving after Macron indicated late last year that France would launch new reactors as part of efforts to produce low-carbon energy.Letter in response to this article:French energy price cap ignores EDF’s ‘minorities’ / From Padmesh Shukla, London SM2, UK
235  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.While Poland may be stealing the limelight with its rule of law disputes with Brussels, another eastern European country, Romania, has also started challenging the supremacy of EU law. In an interview with Europe Express, justice commissioner Didier Reynders lays out the issues and what consequences Bucharest can expect.Meanwhile, in Vienna, the last session of talks with Russia concluded on a rather gloomy note yesterday, with Moscow characterising the whole endeavour as a “dead end”. Here is the FT’s take on the week of diplomacy that managed to avert an immediate conflict, but left some fearing the worst is yet to come.And in energy crisis news, the Netherlands is reluctantly pumping emergency gas supplies for the EU, including top customer Germany, despite the government’s plans to retire Europe’s biggest gasfield in the coming years.Romania’s constitutional court is following in the footsteps of its counterpart in Poland when it comes to challenging the supremacy of EU law, according to justice commissioner Didier Reynders, write Valentina Pop and Sam Fleming in Brussels.Last year, first in a May ruling, followed by a second one in December, the European Court of Justice said that judges in Romania should put EU law above national legislation, including rulings of the national constitutional court, when they are in breach of the EU treaty.Romania’s constitutional court has countered both rulings, arguing that judges should put Romanian law first.The Bucharest-based court’s decisions mirrored what Poland’s and Germany’s constitutional courts have also said on the supremacy of EU law. But while Poland’s legal action was triggered by the country’s prime minister (who is not backing down over myriad legal disputes), the commission buried the hatchet with Germany after Berlin sent reassurances that it fully supports the supremacy of EU law.Romania’s government, according to Reynders, falls somewhere in between. “We have received a reaction from the Romanian government saying, ‘No, we want to have full respect of [EU law] primacy.but in the framework of the Romanian constitution.’ So, it’s not exactly the answer that we have received from the German government, without any conditions.”Reynders said he may initiate legal action against Romania, given the country’s top court’s “real, permanent and persistent position to go against the EU law or the binding character of the ECJ decisions”. While not as advanced in its resistance to ECJ rulings, Romania could follow Poland and be fined millions of euros if it refuses to implement the verdicts of the Luxembourg-based court.One such demand is to abolish a special prosecutorial unit for judges, which “could be perceived as seeking to establish an instrument of pressure and intimidation with regard to judges”, according to the ECJ. Reynders said the Romanian justice minister promised that the special unit would be abolished as part of a broader reform, which has yet to be approved by the country’s parliament.But Reynders said that was a stalling tactic he had encountered in discussions with Hungarian counterparts. “First, you need to implement [the ECJ rulings], in Romania, stop with the special section. Then, if you want to put into place a new system, we’ll verify.”While some similarities can be found between Warsaw and Bucharest, one big difference remains: Romania has started receiving funds under the bloc’s NextGenerationEU €800bn recovery package. And unlike Poland, it is under the jurisdiction of a pan-European prosecutor’s office (coincidentally led by a Romanian prosecutor, Laura Kovesi), which can bring people to court for embezzling or defrauding EU money.Are challenges to the supremacy of EU law justified?

The Netherlands and Germany are beginning to find out, as ties between the age-old allies have come under strain over Berlin’s requests for emergency Dutch gas supplies, writes Mehreen Khan in Brussels.Stef Blok, the Netherlands’ outgoing economy minister, wrote last month to his German counterpart Robert Habeck warning that German requests for additional gas supplies from the Groningen gasfield were a cause of “serious worry”. The Netherlands has committed to shutting down Groningen, Europe’s largest gasfield, over concerns of earthquakes and mini-tremors caused by decades of underground pumping.But the field will have to keep producing well beyond forecasts this year, in part because of rising demand from Germany and Europe’s energy crisis. Germany alone will need about an additional 1.1bn cubic metres of gas from Groningen this year, according to reports.Blok warned Berlin that Germany should aim to keep its appetite for gas to a “minimum” as Groningen is gradually taken off the grid. The Netherlands is weaning itself off gas as part of its green transition and opting for an energy strategy that is the polar opposite of Berlin’s, choosing to bet big on nuclear power.Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte raised the sticky issue of German gas demand during his first visit to see new chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin. “We want to get rid of gas production,” Rutte said at a joint press conference.But the Dutchman opted for a more diplomatic tone than Blok, adding that the Netherlands was aware of “German wishes” for more imports.As with many EU countries, the Dutch are queasy about Germany’s growing reliance on Russian gas, including the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, to fulfil its energy needs over the next decades. But a natural corollary of less Russian gas in Europe is higher demand from other sources — led by Groningen.Beyond Meat has become one of the most shorted companies in the US as investors fret over weaker sales and scepticism grows over the plant-based meat boom. Short-positions on Beyond Meat shares have increased 40 per cent since late October, when the California-based company issued a revenue warning. (More here)
236  Russia did not even wait until the third and final round of this week’s diplomatic talks with the west had concluded before dismissing the entire exercise as a “dead end”.As delegates to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe met in Vienna on Thursday to discuss ways to avert a potential new Russian attack on Ukraine, hopeful of a breakthrough, senior Moscow officials were already writing it off.“I don’t see any grounds to sit down in the next few days, get together again and start these same discussions,” said Sergei Ryabkov, Russia’s deputy foreign minister. “I don’t know exactly what happened in the OSCE,” he added, dismissively. “It seems everything is quite predictable there too.”It was the reaction that western governments and negotiators had feared, but strongly expected, as Russian president Vladimir Putin considers how to respond.“The drumbeat of war is sounding loudly,” warned Michael Carpenter, US ambassador to the OSCE, after the talks ended on Thursday. “We have to take this very seriously. We have to prepare for the eventuality that there could be an escalation.”Desperate to avoid a possible Russian assault on Ukraine, the US, Nato and European countries billed this week as the chance to extend a diplomatic olive branch to Moscow that offered the Kremlin a possible way out from increasingly belligerent rhetoric about threats to European security.But over five days of direct talks, which began with an informal private dinner on the shore of Lake Geneva on Sunday, western officials noted precious few areas of compromise from the Moscow delegations or interest in engaging with their suggestions for more detailed negotiations.“I don’t think this negotiation track is serious [for Russia],” said a senior European diplomat. “Nobody understands if they have started the actual process of negotiations or not. There’s real doubt.”Wendy Sherman, deputy US secretary of state, had dined with Ryabkov in Geneva before both led their respective delegations in formal bilateral talks in the Swiss city on Monday.On Wednesday, after heading the US delegation to the summit between Russia and Nato members, she admitted to hearing the same talking points from Russian officials as if the eight hours of talks two days previously had not happened.“There’s progress that can be made and everyone, Russia most of all, will have to decide whether they really care about security, in which case they should engage, or whether this was all a pretext,” Sherman said after those Nato talks.That fear of failed diplomacy as a pretext for conflict had grown all week. As officials talked, some of the roughly 100,000 Russian troops deployed at locations close to its border with Ukraine conducted live-fire exercises. Putin has warned that Moscow could respond militarily if the west did not meet his requests.Moscow sent its delegations to Geneva, Brussels and Vienna with clear demands. But it also knew that its two main requests were impossible for the US and Nato to agree to: a ban on Ukraine and Georgia joining the alliance and a demand for Nato to scale back its military deployments to the level of 1997, before newly independent states of the former communist bloc joined the alliance.The US and Nato, ruling these out but acknowledging Russia’s security concerns regarding western military deployments, instead offered potential compromise areas: talks on arms control, missile deployments and re-establishing diplomatic channels to reduce tensions. The ploy appeared to have failed.Alexander Lukashevich, Russia’s ambassador to the OSCE, dismissed the offer as a “senseless exchange of positions”, warning that dismissing Russia’s demands “was fraught with the inevitable deterioration of the security situation of all states, without exception.”Ryabkov, speaking to Russian television, said military officials had been advising Putin on options if the crisis were to intensify and that new military drills could begin soon.Andrew Weiss of the Carnegie Endowment for Peace said the west’s diplomatic efforts this week had succeeded in complicating Russia’s potential military preparations by offering an alternative — an approach he called “the best the west can do”.Yet Russia consistently rejected calls from the US and Nato to reduce its force on the Ukrainian border, denying it was a threat to Kyiv and stating its legal right to move troops wherever it liked within its territory.As the diplomatic blitz subsides, the officials who spent the week on the other side of the negotiating table from the Russians are left waiting on the Kremlin. “Nobody knows Putin’s next move,” Weiss said. “And we’ll all find out at the same time.”
237  Brussels is poised to withhold more than €100m from Poland to cover unpaid fines imposed by the EU’s top court, the justice commissioner has warned, as he responds to “waves” of problems in the country’s judicial system.Didier Reynders told the Financial Times on Thursday that the commission will shortly send a letter to Warsaw demanding payment of €69m in accumulated daily fines that Poland has racked up between early November and the start of this week.If Warsaw does not comply within a 60-day period the commission will withhold the fines from EU payments due to be disbursed to Poland, with interest payments to be imposed on top, he said.“We are busy with the five waves for Covid, and I don’t know how many waves on the rule of law in Poland,” Reynders said in an interview. “We continue to try to manage the waves one after the other.”Separately, the commission has also been preparing to withhold about €50m of fines related to a separate legal dispute involving Poland and the Czech Republic.Poland is in a long-running confrontation with Brussels over moves by the country’s conservative nationalist ruling party to gain powers over its judiciary, including via a disciplinary chamber with the power to punish judges.Warsaw was last October ordered to pay daily fines of €1m because it failed to comply with interim measures imposed by the European Court of Justice demanding it suspend key aspects of the disciplinary regime.The stand-off over judicial independence has soured relations between the commission and the EU’s fifth-largest member state. It has also held up Brussels’ approval of Poland’s plan to spend €36bn in grants and loans from the bloc’s €800bn post-pandemic recovery package.European officials have said Poland should scrap the disciplinary chamber, change its rules and reinstate dismissed judges as conditions for approving Warsaw’s request for pandemic recovery funding, but negotiations foundered late last year.Reynders said the letter asking for payment of €69m would come within “hours or days”. He added: “We have seen there was no implementation of the interim measures, so we will ask [them] to pay.”If Warsaw does not comply daily fines will continue to accumulate, triggering further payment demands from Brussels. A Polish official declined to comment.Warsaw has also accrued about €50m of fines after it failed to comply with an ECJ ruling to suspend operations at a lignite mine, which has been subject to complaints from the Czech Republic.The Czech environment minister said on Thursday that a draft agreement drawn up in September was acceptable to her government. However, Polish media reported that the Polish government could seek adjustments to the draft deal.Reynders noted some positive moves from Poland on rule of law, including regarding a change to the retirement system of judges, but made clear that the overall trend in the country was not encouraging.“There are again and again some negative signals coming from Poland,” Reynders said. He pointed to new disciplinary procedures against a judge and a request by Zbigniew Ziobro, the Polish justice minister, who has asked the country’s constitutional tribunal to rule on a Brussels measure that allows the EU to withhold funding for rule-of-law breaches.Regarding recent threats by Ziobro to stop Polish payments into the EU budget because of the dispute, Reynders said: “The European Union is paying more to Poland than we are receiving. So, in the end, it’s a very strange game.”
238  About half an hour into Touriste, an action movie set in the Central African Republic, the head of the army briefs the country’s president about an imminent rebel attack.Benjamin Wagba, who plays the army chief, speaks for only 23 seconds. But the role changed his life. “It was such an experience!” he says of appearing in the biggest film ever produced in his country. Still, when I ask him to tell me more about the character he played, he turns skittish. “In the film, I was, I was.really, really, I’m touched,” he stammers, smiling broadly. “But, I don’t know, it’s just very complicated for me.”Here is what Wagba does not — cannot — say: Touriste is a Russian propaganda movie that glorifies the deeds of the Wagner Group, the real-world private military organisation whose mercenaries have fought in Ukraine, the Middle East and Africa. Western analysts and academics believe Wagner is an unofficial foreign policy tool of the Kremlin, its soldiers deploying to regions where Russia wants to extend its influence, defend existing interests or antagonise the west. The Kremlin denies this and does not acknowledge the existence of Wagner.As Moscow has taken an increasingly aggressive stance towards Ukraine, the film — a YouTube version of which has 7.6 million views — offers a bizarre, mind-bending window into Russia’s shape-shifting influence in the world. The film rights are owned by Aurum, a company founded by the businessman Evgeny Prigozhin, whom the US and the EU accuse of financing Wagner. Prigozhin, a catering magnate and ally of President Vladimir Putin who is sometimes known as “Putin’s chef”, has long denied any connection to the group.Touriste portrays Russian mercenaries as selfless heroes saving a poor African country. Its plot at times hews closely to reality (Russian fighters agree to train the CAR army and then battle alongside them against brutal rebel groups) while at others conveniently distorting it (the rebels alone are depicted doing things — indiscriminate killing, torture, bullying the UN — that the mercenaries themselves are accused of by the EU and human rights groups).The existence of the film is all the more strange because it tells a story of military intervention that, officially, Russia and the CAR fiercely deny. When I interview the CAR prime minister Henri-Marie Dondra in his Bangui office, surrounded by a dozen aides and two camera crews, he tells me that there are no mercenaries in his country. “You are the one who is talking about private companies,” he says. “I have not seen any private companies with which the country has signed a contract.”In late September 2021, I spend a week in the capital, Bangui. Diplomats, opposition politicians and foreign officials tell me the mercenaries have been waging a brutal campaign across the country alongside the CAR army, focusing on gaining control of its many diamond- and gold-rich areas and targeting the ethnic Fulani and Muslim population. I talk to some of Wagner’s alleged victims in the city’s Muslim quarter: men and women who’ve fled rape, torture and killings in every corner of the country. The most common refrain I hear about the mercenaries is: “They have no rules.” The accusations are well known, their presence is obvious but as one young activist put it, “There’s really a kind of grey fog around them.”Wagba says he can’t talk about what he calls “the politics” of Touriste. Instead, as we sit on the terrace of a Bangui hotel, he tells me about the experience of making the film. He marvelled at the wardrobe department — “hundreds of military uniforms!” — and the scale of the production. “We only saw one camera in my scene; it was only after, when we saw the film, that we realised how many they had.”Talking about the craft he has practised for two-thirds of his 45 years, Wagba is like a Shakespearean stage actor. Expressive and voluble, his voice is a rough growl that sometimes runs high and lonesome. Of his first role, at 15, playing a witch in a play by the CAR’s most celebrated writer, Etienne Goyemide, he says: “A baptism — a baptism of fire.” Each syllable lands like a hammer blow. “I was so young! I had no idea what I was getting into. But anywhere you go in Bangui, you ask, who is Benjamin Wagba? They will say, he’s a witch!”On whether he has ever had a job outside acting: “Never, never, never!” He laughs like I am a lunatic and I feel like I might genuinely be one. “I can do theatre well, I do it well, well, super well.I also do cinema well, so well. Other than that, I don’t do anything.”But he shrinks again when we get nearer the plot of Touriste. “The politics behind it, I tell you, I am really careful about that.I don’t think about that,” he says. “I think only about how the movie elevated me, [and how] it was given to the population.”Touriste was in a way given to the CAR, a landlocked, impoverished country that has been enmeshed in civil war for almost two decades. Last May, the film’s Russian producers held a massive premiere at the national stadium in Bangui, attended by government ministers, 10,000 viewers, a representative of the Russian culture ministry and a number of men linked to Wagner. The movie, mainly shot in Russian, was dubbed into the local language, Sango.It is essentially a 1980s-style action flick. The plot is typical of the patriotic fare churned out by parts of Russia’s film industry during Putin’s rule. A young Russian police officer signs up to fly to the CAR to train soldiers amid a bloody civil war. (The movie’s title derives from his call sign, Tourist). This much is based in reality. In 2018, Russia signed an agreement with the CAR to send unarmed instructors to train the local army, which has been fighting a rebellion since 2013. Officially, the governments say that 1,135 military instructors are now in the country. But analysts, diplomats, UN and humanitarian sources say there are actually up to 3,000 combat-ready mercenaries.The movie takes place ahead of elections in December 2020 and depicts Russian instructors being asked to take up arms by a government overwhelmed in the face of a rebel assault on Bangui. Again, this is something that happened ahead of the real-world elections of December 2020, according to diplomats, foreign officials, security sources and opposition figures in Bangui. But it is also denied by both governments.At one point in the movie, the Russians lay landmines, which the US has accused Wagner of doing in Libya. A Russian soldier tells a villager to keep children away — something real-world mercenaries have been specifically criticised for not doing. The movie depicts the 12,000-troop UN peacekeeping mission as feckless and useless; the French as conniving neocolonialists. (These criticisms were also made in propaganda that Facebook removed in December 2020 and linked to Prigozhin, who is under US sanctions for meddling in the 2016 presidential election through the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm.)The level of warped verisimilitude — the winking nods to Wagner, the trollish side-eye the film casts on reality — is discombobulating. This is a war movie, filmed during an actual war. Scenes were shot at Berengo Palace, the Russian instructors’ real headquarters. A key moment takes place on the terrace of a Lebanese café where I saw a Russian mercenary buy a shawarma. The president, Faustin-Archange Touadéra, is played by one of his relatives.Does this convey the surreality of this movie? Does it adequately illustrate the funhouse mirror world of Bangui in the time of Wagner? There is a Voldemort quality to the Russian presence in the capital. They’re spoken of in hushed tones, particularly among humanitarians and diplomats, who drop their voices on the word — Russians — as though it might be cursed. At the same time, the mercenaries are everywhere I go in the city, recognisable by their flagless camo uniforms and the masks that hide the bottom half of their faces.One day I meet a Koran teacher from Bambari who says Russian fighters had arrested him at morning prayers with 40 others, held him for a month, tortured him and stole his life savings. That same afternoon, I see a mercenary chat amiably with a saleswoman at an electronics store and then buy an oscillating pedestal fan. One morning a foreign official tells me the mercenaries were increasingly consolidating control around CAR’s mining areas. That night, I see the head of Lobaye Invest — a Wagner-linked mining company sanctioned by the US — drinking a glass of wine at the swanky M Bar and Restaurant. On the day I interview a woman who says she feared she might have HIV after being raped by three Russian fighters, I run into mercenaries at Bangui’s artisanal craft market, aggressively haggling over leather purses and kitschy handicrafts.In December 2021, the EU sanctioned Wagner, three related entities and eight people, including Valery Zakharov, a former Russian state security agent who has served as an adviser to the CAR’s president. Wagner is “responsible for serious human rights abuses in Ukraine, Syria, Libya, the Central African Republic (CAR), Sudan and Mozambique, which include torture and extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and killings”, the EU said. This followed a report by UN-appointed experts last March that accused Wagner mercenaries of gross human rights abuses in the CAR.When the FT sent Prigozhin’s catering company questions about Wagner’s operations in the CAR, it forwarded the request to Alexander Ivanov, head of Russia’s “Officers Union for International Security”, which sent the military instructors to the CAR. Ivanov said in a written response that they operate “in accordance with the bilateral agreements between” the countries and were not involved in any fighting or commercial activity. Russia’s foreign ministry echoed the sentiments in a statement to the FT. Ivanov added, “The information contained in the latest UN reports on gross violations of human rights attributed to Russian instructors does not correspond to reality.”The mercenaries’ entire presence is wrapped in layers of irony. The CAR government doesn’t acknowledge their existence, the Kremlin doesn’t acknowledge their existence, the people purportedly behind Wagner don’t acknowledge their existence. And then there’s the movie.Like Wagba, Mac Armel Degoto got a call one day from a friend about auditions for a movie. He was cast as François Bozizé, the former president leading the rebels to overthrow the government —the movie’s bad guy. “The Russians.they are pushing you to perfection,” he tells me. “I don’t even look like Bozizé, but they made me become Bozizé.”The 35-year-old only spent a day on set, filming two short scenes. He was paid 20,000 CFA — about $35 — plus transport, an amount that still stings. But “for me, it was terrific. It’s what I always imagined”, he says. It was “a crazy thing.I was acting in a professional production, a real movie”.Degoto joined the CAR’s first rap collective, Bongos Rap, at the age of 15. He still goes by his hip-hop sobriquet, Monsieur Melodie. He’s acted in a few productions, including two short films for the social security administration. Touriste was something else entirely. “The premiere was amazing. It was huge, it was such a great joy,” he says. “Kids come up to me in the market and say, ‘Bozizé, Bozizé, Bozizé, why don’t you give us some money?’ I say sure, I’m a star, but I’m a star who walks on two feet, who doesn’t have a car or even a motorcycle.”I wonder whether he was scared to play Bozizé, CAR’s former dictator who has become a national villain for many. “No. I don’t really care about the political side. All I know is that I was playing a big role in a big movie and what impact that could have on my professional life.”“My mom is worried,” he smiles wanly. “She asks me to avoid public places because there are people that really hate what I did.They will come up to me and say, ‘You are Bozizé.’ They say, ‘We know where you live, so watch out, we will find you.’”Wagba gets it from the other side; Bozizé partisans threaten him. But he has risked his life for his craft before. Just before filming Touriste, he spent two months touring the country with a humorous sketch-show meant to educate people about the CAR’s Special Criminal Court. This entailed travelling into rebel territory to inform civilians and armed rebels about what they should do if their human rights were violated by the army or by mercenaries and how they themselves might be held accountable if they commit atrocities. “Almost everyone was hostile,” he says dryly. The reaction often involved a gun being pointed in his face.Both Wagba and Degoto say that the constant threats meant they questioned whether making Touriste was ultimately worth it. The arc of my conversations with them mirrored the way that many Central Africans I met described their impression of the mercenaries. Initially, there was unbridled hope, then awe at their professionalism, followed by disappointment and, finally, horror.Touriste played in Russia at 11.40pm on the state-controlled NTV network. It received little promotion and even less attention from audiences. The more I thought about it, the more the film seemed to have yet another layer of meaning. It was a metaphor for Russia’s presence in the CAR: something that meant relatively little to the Kremlin and its allies in terms of effort and investment but was everything to the Central Africans swept up in it.On my sixth day in Bangui I go to the stadium where the premiere had been held four months before. Scores of faded Touriste posters are plastered on one section of the bleachers, along with a handful of peeling stickers that read “With the Support of Evgeny Prigozhin” in Sango above a heart-shaped Russian flag.There is no cinema in Bangui, and the film had made a real splash. I noticed a number of people wearing Touriste T-shirts around town. Thousands had been handed out at the premiere. One young activist told me that in the weeks after, she saw children in the market playing Touriste the way they might play cops and robbers.A few law students are studying in an upper section of the stadium, and I ask whether they’d seen the movie. Mustapha, a lanky 23-year-old, says he came to the premiere but walked out after 15 minutes, appalled by the violence. “They called so many people to come, so many young people,” he says. “You wouldn’t show it to your children, so why us? Why should we accept it?”Mustapha, like many of the Muslims I spoke to, had relatives who’d been victims. His brother had been killed by mercenaries, he says, while travelling from Birau in the far north. He knew of Wagner’s reputation in other parts of the world. “In Syria, in Libya, where those men go in, there is no peace.” While the movie sickened him, he thought it was effective as propaganda. “So many people clapped!” he says. “We see them killing our brothers and we accept it. We clap for it!”Still, as tales of atrocities have reached Bangui over the past year, the shine seemed to be fading. The movie itself even seemed to have done some damage to Russia’s reputation. Carl Michael Kikobet, vice-president of the country’s National Youth Council, had initially welcomed Moscow’s help. Then he saw Touriste.“Now I refuse to even give my appreciation for the partnership with Russia,” he says, fingering a pendant in the shape of the CAR around his neck. “That movie portrayed our national army as cowards. It humiliated them.”If the film in some ways failed as propaganda in the CAR, it’s not clear it succeeded back home either, says Jack Margolin, a programme director at Washington-based conflict analysis firm C4ADS. Margolin has a side interest in the Wagner subculture, which includes mercenary influencers and a number of other films. “It’s not clear who [it’s] made for,” he says. “Touriste in particular is pretty inaccessible to a general Russian audience, given the level of detail it contains regarding the conflict in the CAR.”The movie may have been a flop, but the producers made another. While I was in Bangui, a source saw a Russian crew filming at the defence ministry. The walls had been adorned with the flag of Mozambique, where Wagner was soundly defeated in a fight against jihadists in 2019. As the source put it, “It’s very confusing why they’d make a movie about a battle they lost.” In late December, the film in question, Granit, premiered on NTV, according to the Moscow Times.Two months after I left Bangui, a friend sent me pictures of a new sculpture that had been erected near the stadium. It showed Russian and CAR soldiers defending a cowering woman and two small children. Similar monuments to Wagner have cropped up in Syria and Ukraine.The other statues are mostly a single soldier with a child hugging his legs, but the Bangui version was more elaborate. When Margolin saw the statue, he noticed something else. The figures seemed to be based on Touriste. I took a closer look. One of the Russian soldiers looks just like a secondary character in the film. One of the CAR soldiers is a dead ringer for the main female character, who was played by the niece of an opposition leader. The statue was unveiled by the president himself.Neil Munshi is the FT’s west Africa correspondent. 
239  It is news to no one that UK business — big business at least — has had a difficult few years in terms of the zeitgeist.You can argue whether the vote to leave the EU — when business almost universally pointed in one direction and the decision went the other — was symptom or cause. In all likelihood both.But the acrimony since hasn’t helped. The pandemic prompted a crisis-time rallying-round that improved the standing of large corporations in polling, along with other national institutions. But that is a distant memory.A government trying to push through tax rises has concluded in recent months that the most painless way to do that is on business. The energy crisis could mean windfall taxes on oil and gas producers. Big housebuilders are on the hook for the cladding crisis. When a combination of Brexit and Covid created serious labour shortages, it was business that was standing in the way of a higher-wage, higher productivity economy — at least according to the government.Perhaps, then, it’s no surprise that a readout of the public’s view isn’t exactly glowing. Research from Hanbury Strategy and Stack Data Strategy, published this week, found that 56 per cent of those asked thought business was “out of touch”. When choosing what best described British businesses, the 2,000 respondents went for statements like “trying their best in a difficult time” and “care only about making money” in four times the numbers that sentiments like “share my values” or “making the world a better place” received.The prescription from Hanbury, founded by former Vote Leave communications director Paul Stephenson, is to focus more on the basics, like producing better goods and services for customers and looking after employees. Talking more about those would better reflect the public’s priorities, the research said, as opposed to environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues.There is a decent tinge of anti-wokery sentiment to the findings. But still, this sounds like a challenge to companies and what my colleague Rob Armstrong calls the ESG industrial complex alike. If the professionalisation and financialisation of what amounts to asking companies to do the right thing has resulted in something that doesn’t very obviously include treating your staff well, then everyone has a problem. See Terry Smith’s criticism of Unilever this week: purpose-driven mayonnaise isn’t a ridiculous idea but it is basically meant to result in a product that is more interesting or relevant to customers, or more likely to motivate and retain staff.It’s not that the public is only concerned about things that affect them right now; the strong interest in issues around climate change in the Hanbury results shows that. But the results point to a known failing within ESG: that the social part of it gets overlooked and that within that, investors aren’t asking the right questions. Responsible investment campaigner ShareAction found that investors are more likely to vote for environmental or governance resolutions than social ones.The group is pushing for better information from companies about their workforce. Its latest data, released this week, received responses from only 173 companies of the 1,000 asked globally. The FTSE 100 does better with half sending back at least some numbers. Last year, the average completion rate was about 60 per cent of what is a detailed survey.The charitable interpretation is that companies are too busy treating their employees well to fill in endless forms (and mounting requests for disclosure is one of the top complaints about the ESG machine). This isn’t entirely baseless: about half the blue-chip index are accredited Living Wage employers, and only about 55 per cent of them contribute to the ShareAction disclosure initiative.But which questions companies choose to answer is also revealing. The best response rates in the past were on governance issues like board responsibilities and policy statements, unlikely to capture the public imagination. The spirit of openness doesn’t extend as much to the nitty gritty of pay, conditions or safety. Staff turnover appears a closely guarded secret, says ShareAction’s Rosie Mackenzie. And in other areas, like who works in the supply chain and where, companies simply aren’t collecting the basic data, she says.Businesses should know more and talk more about their people. And ESG investing, done properly, should be part and parcel of that.
240  Europe’s biggest companies have struggled to keep up in the pandemic. Just 10 of the 100 biggest winners in terms of market capitalisation growth over the past two years — and only one of the top 10 — hails from the EU. Even when the UK and Switzerland are included, the number only rises to 14.This is not just a Covid phenomenon, rather it is part of a shocking and long-term decline. In 2000, the enterprise value of large listed companies in Europe was almost on a par with US rivals. By late 2021, US groups were worth more than twice their European counterparts — $46tn vs $21tn — according to McKinsey research. Large technology firms such as Alphabet, Meta, Apple, Amazon, Tesla and Microsoft contributed almost half of the gap in market capitalisation.Some industries where Europe dominated in 2000 — telecoms and insurance — have grown slowly. But the continent’s entrepreneurs have struggled to achieve scale. More than 40 companies now worth more than $100bn have been set up in the past 50 years. Just one was based in Europe.Americans like to boast of a superior culture and lighter regulations. But barriers have made it harder for European companies to achieve real scale and compete globally. Foremost is access to capital. Mature US capital markets mean companies can sell large quantities of debt and equity, while European companies have to rely more on bank loans, which hurt them during and after the financial crisis.Brussels has talked for years about capital markets union, which would standardise rules, making it easier for companies to tap investors from across the bloc. Progress remains slow and Brexit has split rather than united markets. This must change.European tech groups spend much less on research and development than big US ones, making it more likely that they fall behind on revolutionary technologies. Despite the single market, they face language and regulatory barriers when they leave their home countries. Nationalist sentiment has sometimes prevented vital cross-border consolidation. The continent’s economy has also expanded more slowly than that of China or the US. All these factors are a drag on growth and a deterrent to investors.As the EU seeks to encourage corporate growth, it will face a tricky balancing act. Many Americans now believe that big tech companies have had too much freedom to buy potential rivals. The EU has rightly been more protective of competition, and it should be careful not to lose that sense of scepticism entirely in the interest of creating continental champions. Similarly, overly prescriptive standards and rigid labour laws have constrained growth in some sectors; but unfettered capitalism has a very ugly side, so a reformed approach needs careful consideration to be sustainable.Change may be coming. After years of lagging behind the US and Asia, European start-ups are finally attracting more venture and growth capital funding. Investment leapt 142 per cent last year, to $93bn, outpacing the rest of the world, according to CBInsights. There has been a visible boom in entrepreneurship in many European cities, and a record 63 companies crossed the $1bn valuation threshold in 2021, though that still trailed the US’s 304. Stock market listings and sales of European start-ups also hit all-time highs.The EU and the UK have a new chance to build future global champions. To capitalise on it, they must find ways to strengthen public markets, make cross-border expansion easier and carefully reform rules on competition, employment and governance.
241  Russia has said talks with the US and Nato in Geneva and Brussels have failed to address its security grievances, casting doubt over whether a western diplomatic push will defuse Moscow’s threat of military action against Ukraine.Dmitry Peskov, spokesperson of Russian president Vladimir Putin, said this week’s talks had been “unsuccessful” despite “positive elements” on issues Moscow did not consider central to its demands. “That’s bad,” he added.He said Russia would have the “political will” to continue talks if the west was willing to negotiate on rolling back Nato’s expansion.Sergei Ryabkov, deputy foreign minister and Russia’s lead negotiator in the talks with the US this week, said discussions outlining Moscow’s grievances had run into a “dead end” because the US and its allies were only willing to consider issues such as arms control and force deployments, rather than the Kremlin’s main requests.“I don’t see any grounds to sit down [again] in the next few days,” he told television channel RTVI.The gloomy comments weighed on Russian and Ukrainian assets, with falls across bond, currency and equity markets.The Russian rouble fell nearly 3 per cent to trade close to a nine-month low of Rbs76.5 against the US dollar. Russia’s 10-year government bond fell by about 1.8 per cent to hit its lowest price since March 2020, pushing the yield higher than 9 per cent, while the Moex, Russia’s benchmark stock index, slid 4.1 per cent in the worst day since April 2020The Ukrainian hryvnia also sank to its weakest level against the dollar since April after a 0.5 per cent fall.Russia has massed about 100,000 troops on Ukraine’s border in recent months and threatened “the most unpredictable and grave consequences for European security” if Putin’s push for security guarantees from the US does not succeed.In opening comments to talks with Russia at the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, Zbigniew Rau, Poland’s foreign minister and chair of the security group, warned that “the risk of war in the OSCE area is greater than ever before in the last 30 years”, citing the Ukraine crisis.In response to Ryabkov’s comments, Michael Carpenter, US ambassador to the OSCE, said: “If the Russians walk away from these talks, it will be clear that they were never serious about diplomacy. If they are interested in these topics.then they are going to find that we are ready to engage.”He added: “But we are not going to renegotiate core principles.those are sacrosanct.”The OSCE meeting with Moscow was the final stage of a three-part diplomatic effort to engage with the Kremlin and avoid renewed military aggression against Ukraine by Russia after the 2014 annexation of Crimea. It followed bilateral talks with the US in Geneva on Monday and a Nato-Russia summit in Brussels on Wednesday.Russia is demanding pledges from Nato to halt the alliance’s eastward expansion, to commit to never admitting Ukraine and Georgia and to limit troop deployments in former eastern bloc countries. The demands are deemed unacceptable by western capitals.Fresh Russian troop movements on the border with Ukraine on Wednesday were “part of the pressure” exerted by Moscow to achieve its aims, Josep Borrell, the EU’s chief diplomat, said at an informal meeting of the EU’s foreign ministers in Brest, France.He said EU diplomats would use the Brest meeting to “work out the position of the European Union, decide how we are to face the crisis”.Russia has denied it is planning to invade Ukraine but has warned of a “military-technical response” if the talks fail.“If we don’t hear constructive response to our proposals within reasonable timeframe & aggressive behaviour towards Russia continues, we’ll have to take necessary measures to ensure strategic balance and eliminate unacceptable threats to our national security,” said Russia’s OSCE ambassador Alexander Lukashevich, according to the Russian mission’s Twitter account.
242  France has lifted most of its restrictions on vaccinated travellers from the UK, which will pave the way for tourists to return starting on Friday.The French prime minister’s office said strict curbs on travel introduced in mid-December were no longer needed since their aim had been to slow the spread of the more transmissible Omicron variant — at the time more prevalent in the UK than France but now dominant in both.“The general spread of this variant in both countries today led the government to make these adjustments,” it said.All travellers coming from the UK will still be required to show a negative Covid-19 test that is less than 24 hours old.But vaccinated people will be able to enter France for any reason without registering or quarantining. Unvaccinated people must have an essential reason for their trip, register their location with authorities and isolate themselves for 10 days.As in many countries globally, the Omicron variant, which is extremely contagious but often causes less severe illness, has pushed infections to record levels in the UK and France in recent weeks. Britain appears to have passed its peak in terms of new daily infections, while France has not yet even if its explosive rate of growth has slowed.France on Wednesday reported about 280,000 new infections based on a seven-day moving average, more than five times the levels of only a month ago before the Omicron effect hit. Its case incidence stood at 420 cases per 100,000 people, while Britain’s was 235 per 100,000 people.Hospitalisations have also been rising, but the government has bet that the health system will be able to withstand the pressure. Nearly 24,000 people are currently hospitalised with Covid-19 in France, up 13 per cent from a week ago.The easing of travel restrictions with Britain will come as welcome news to France’s travel industry, especially the Alpine ski resorts that were hit hard by the loss of British tourists during the Christmas holidays.Some 15 per cent of the skiers in French resorts come from the UK, Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne, minister for tourism and small business, told TV5 Monde.“Hopefully this morning’s decision will allow the resorts to make up the [revenue] gap,” he said. The government has spent €38bn to support the tourism sector since the pandemic began two years ago.
243  Investor worries over the prospect of Russian military action against Ukraine mounted on Thursday, triggering sharp falls in both countries’ government bonds and currencies.The Russian rouble fell nearly 3 per cent to trade close to a nine-month low of Rbs76.5 to the dollar after President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman said talks with the US and Nato in Geneva and Brussels had been “unsuccessful” at addressing Moscow’s security demands. Russia’s benchmark Moex stock index, meanwhile, slid 4.1 per cent in its worst day since April 2020.The Ukrainian hryvnia hit its weakest level against the dollar since April after a 0.5 per cent fall.Both currencies, along with Russian and Ukrainian debt prices, have retreated in recent months as Russia massed about 100,000 troops on Ukraine’s border and threatened “grave consequences” if its push for security guarantees from the US did not succeed. But moves accelerated on Thursday following the apparent breakdown of talks, with Russia’s deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov saying discussions had hit a “dead end”.“The market has been overweight Ukraine risk — overly sanguine in my view, which made for a brutal wake-up call over the past few days to the risks of escalation in the east,” said Tim Ash of BlueBay Asset Management.Russia’s 10-year government bond fell by about 1.8 per cent to hit its lowest price since March 2020, pushing the yield higher than 9 per cent. Ukraine’s foreign currency debt was hit even harder, with a dollar-denominated bond maturing in September 2032 dropping by 5 per cent to trade at less than 83 cents on the dollar, also the lowest since the early stages of the pandemic.“These are quite substantial moves,” said Sergey Goncharov, a portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management. “Markets were becoming more comfortable with the situation. Now they are becoming uncomfortable again and starting to price in the doomsday scenario.”Buying Ukrainian debt has been a “popular trade” for foreign fund managers in recent years, Goncharov said, leaving the bonds vulnerable to a wave of selling amid the recent escalation of tensions with Russia.
244  The new Brexit year has dawned with a faint whiff of disappointment hanging over the project, particularly from those who believed that leaving the EU would provide the springboard for a reboot of the British economy.Lord David Frost’s resignation, citing the failure to grasp the opportunities of Brexit, precipitated a raft of articles bemoaning the lack of daring from Downing Street about the deregulatory agenda that many ardent Brexiters believe holds the key to a brighter future.Outside the hardcore of political Brexiters, the wider public also has a sense that Brexit hasn’t quite delivered the promised benefits, with nearly 60 per cent telling the Ipsos Mori political barometer that they felt the government was making a “bad job” of the EU exit. (That includes people who think Brexit has been too hard and those, like Lord Frost, who think it hasn’t been hard enough.)At the same time the apparently intractable stand-off over Northern Ireland rumbles on — negotiations start up again in earnest today — adding to the impression that the Brexit agenda is permanently stuck in the mud.The difficulty facing the government is one of expectation management because, despite the impatience of Brexiters, when it comes to deregulation any benefits will inevitably take a long time to feed through to the real-world economy.The government has also not helped its own case that a substantive dividend is realisable by trivialising the deregulation agenda with briefings to the pro-Brexit press about the return of Churchill’s favourite pint-sized Champagne bottles. This is hardly a strategy for being taken seriously.Remainers may complain that the pot of deregulatory gold is always just out of reach at the end of the rainbow, but the truth is that Britain is still in the very early stages of its post-Brexit journey, with Covid-19 adding to a sense of interminable delay at the departure gate.Indeed, as Joël Reland, of the UK in a Changing Europe think-tank observes, when it comes to tackling the stock of existing regulation, any drive to reduce current ‘red tape’ can often have the perverse consequence of increasing costs and bureaucracy, at least in the short term.Reland, the author of the UKICE’s divergence tracker which recently published its second edition, gives the example of a new regime for medical devices — which is currently in gestation — that will create a new, British bureaucracy, even if it is lighter-touch.“If you want your regulatory regime to govern medical devices, you still have to make that UK regime, with its bureaucratic processes, the requirement for companies to re-register products and for the UK regulator to become competent at doing what the EU regulator did before,” he said.This is why the UK chemical industry is currently urging the government to think of a less onerous way to duplicate the EU’s Reach chemical regime, which it estimates will cost the industry £1bn. And as we have seen with industry’s complaints about the decision to create a UK equivalent to the EU’s CE mark — the UKCA mark — deregulation and divergence also lead to the creation of a dual standards regime.Complying with two regimes can cost and frustrate business more than it sets them free. As does the lack of capacity in so-called ‘notified bodies’ that issue certificates of conformity to industry. That too will take time and money to build up.Public opinion can also be another obstacle to divergence. So while promises to “slash Brussels red tape” might draw a cheer, the public also rightly expects the kind of properly enforced regulation that, for example, prevents apartment blocks being covered in highly flammable cladding. Witness also the government’s hasty retreat last year from the suggestion it might look to change the rules bequeathed by the EU’s working time directive.Fear of public opinion is also why the government is sometimes surprisingly shy about areas where it is actually engaged in post-Brexit deregulation — as in the case of hazardous chemical regulation that we reported on in some detail in December.And yet as Reland and others have observed the hopes for a deregulatory dividend from Brexit are not without foundation, particularly on future industries where the regulatory framework is still to be set — for example artificial intelligence, gene editing and new areas of financial services like fintech and cryptocurrency.But here too, patience and strategy will be required, because the asymmetries between the go-it-alone UK and the global regulatory weathermakers — the EU, the US and to a lesser extent China — is a permanent feature of post-Brexit Britain.That is why you get differing opinions about how far the UK will profit from its non-EU status on these future areas of regulation.Take artificial intelligence, an area where the UK is already ahead and potentially well-placed to prosper and attract greater investment relative to the EU, according to TechUK, the industry lobby group.The EU published its AI regulatory framework last April, and the UK followed suit in October with its National AI Strategy promising a “progressive regulatory and business environment” to make the UK an AI innovation hub.The industry is upbeat about the possibilities, but Reland is more cautious, noting that the UK regime — even if it is lighter touch and more enabling than a conservative and prescriptive EU regime — will always have to work alongside Brussels.His view is that the so-called “Brussels effect” — where the gravitational pull of the EU market forces others to follow EU regulations — will still impact the UK, even if it looks to be more permissive for AI developers.This is because EU rules will require that the underlying technology for an AI product developed in the UK but sold in the EU — he gives the example of a credit-scoring system — will have to conform to Brussels’ rule book.He argues that “to a greater or lesser extent” the UK’s regulatory architecture will have to be built around norms set by the EU, or risk the demand for UK-developed AI products to “dry up”.Not everyone in the industry is so sure. While Brussels will have its AI legislation out before the UK, it is likely to be more prescriptive — for example on areas such as facial recognition — which groups like TechUK believe will encourage high-end developers to come to the UK.TechUK points to the level of investment in the UK — some £13.5bn poured into more than 1,400 UK private technology firms between January and June 2021, which is more than Germany, France and Israel combined — as early proof of concept.Their belief is that high-end R&D can be done in the UK, often with US partners, and any products sold into the EU will have functions that are deemed illegal in the European Union removed or disabled prior to export.It is not clear which version of the future will come to fruition. There will undoubtedly be some dividends, but as Reland says, they will be tempered by the Brussels Effect and will have to be netted off against the costs of leaving the EU single market, estimated as a 4 per cent long-run hit to UK gross domestic product by the Office for Budget Responsibility.Remainers are often rightly criticised for overstating the immediate impacts of Brexit — warning of an exodus from the City; rising unemployment; collapsing trade — but equally Brexiters have also both overstated, and then mysteriously trivialised, the divergence dividend.If the government really wants to shift the gloomy narrative currently growing up around Brexit, it should try to engage the public seriously about the potential and challenges that lie ahead. There is more to Brexit than pint bottlesDespite the hullabaloo over Downing Street parties, it is the threat of inflation and a looming cost of living crisis that really haunts Boris Johnson’s premiership as we head into the second half of this election cycle.One idea mooted recently, reportedly with the support of Lord David Frost, was that the UK should cut import tariffs on all but the most sensitive products in order to help British shoppers and boost the economy.But would it? To the point about needing to engage with the real world, this is a retread of a Brexiter idea that did the rounds in 2017 thanks to a paper by Patrick Minford of the Economists for Free Trade group asserting that unilateral free trade could boost UK GDP by 4 per cent.The idea was debunked at the time by the vast majority of economists and trade experts and dismissed as a “dangerous fantasy” by the FT’s own Martin Wolf. It is somewhat depressing, to put it mildly, that the idea is being reheated in some more fevered Brexiter imaginations.As Michael Gasiorek, professor of economics and director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory (UKTPO) at the University of Sussex, observes, such a move would make very little overall difference to UK prices because most of the country’s imports already enter duty free (see chart). A few years ago the UKTPO produced a report with the Resolution Foundation which modelled the impact of unilateral tariff liberalisation and concluded that across those goods affected by the tariff-cuts, prices would fall by just 1 per cent.More broadly, adds Gasiorek, when faced with an economic issue the best policies are ones that address that problem as directly as possible — in this case a cost of living crisis driven by rising energy prices, a supply chain crunch and the increased costs of importing from the EU because of Brexit.As he concludes: “Reducing all import tariffs does not address these problems and is not the appropriate policy here.” And, finally, three unmissable Brexit storiesThe impact of Brexit on the City is a topic we have covered in this briefing before. This week my colleagues in the financial services team took a forensic look at the consequences of the UK’s departure from the EU. “Rather than experiencing a big bang shift.the City is enduring a slow puncture,” they write.In the 2016 referendum campaign the Common Agriculture Policy was regularly touted by supporters of the UK’s departure from the EU as an example of Brussels’ financial mismanagement. But a damning parliamentary report this week said the government had failed to establish how the £2.4bn of annual payments that will replace the CAP subsidies to British farmers will provide value for money. Read more on the report’s findings.In September 2019, the Austrian parliament approved an amendment to the nationality act. Those eligible — people persecuted under the Nazi regime and their direct descendants — could apply for citizenship once it came into effect on September 1, 2020. “I had never imagined becoming Austrian, until Brexit,” writes Sarah Ebner as she describes the mixed emotions associated with becoming the owner of a new European passport.
245  Spain’s addiction to temporary jobs is, says its government, what makes the country a “distant planet” from the rest of the EU.About a quarter of the workforce relies on such employment contracts, far more than in any other member state. Young people and women are principally affected.So when Yolanda Díaz, the country’s communist deputy prime minister, reached a long-sought accord with business and unions on labour rules last month — focusing on measures to curb uses of temporary contracts — the government was not alone in hailing the breakthrough on a hugely contentious and consequential issue.“On a symbolic level, we’ve barely seen anything like this since the transition to democracy: a communist minister has struck a deal with business and labour,” said Máriam Martínez-Bascuñán, a political scientist at the Autonomous University of Madrid.Now comes the hard part: getting parliament to pass the measure into law and making real improvements to Spain’s dysfunctional labour market.The changes — a component of the reforms Spain has promised in return for €70bn of grants from the EU’s coronavirus recovery fund — need to be backed by parliament by February 7. Failure to ratify the reforms could affect future funds from Brussels.But so far the votes are not there. The opposition People’s party says it will oppose the measure, which has already provisionally taken effect, while the nationalist and regional parties on which the minority leftwing government depends have yet to be won round.Meanwhile, the real challenge awaits: mending Spain’s labour market, the country’s biggest economic black spot. At twice the EU average, Spain’s unemployment rate of 14 per cent is the highest in the bloc.“The situation in parliament shows where Spain is right now,” Martínez-Bascuñán said. “The far right is on the rise, so the PP won’t support the reform for fear of seeming too centrist and the bloc that backs the government remains fragile even though it’s pushed a lot of legislation through.”The reform’s roots lie in the coalition deal between the Socialists and Díaz’s smaller, radical left Podemos grouping two years ago. The parties agreed to scrap changes made by the conservative government in 2012 that reduced redundancy payments and gave precedence to company-specific negotiations on wages and conditions, rather than to sector-wide talks.Many economists say the 2012 measures helped businesses bounce back from the financial crisis, enabling an export-led recovery, but the left argues that they exacerbated economic inequalities.For years, the coalition partners feuded over how to rewrite the rules, with the Socialists keen to keep business on-side. Spain’s central bank urged the government to retain the measures to avoid damaging the country’s competitiveness.During the pandemic the planned changes to labour rules were subsumed into the recovery agenda agreed with the EU. Because Brussels required the changes to be negotiated with business and labour organisations, the CEOE, Spain’s employers’ federation, played a decisive role in the talks. It signed up to the reform last month, despite dissent within its ranks from groups such as carmakers, agro-industry and business organisations from Madrid and Catalonia, the country’s main economic powerhouses.The CEOE’s leadership says the deal “consolidates the current labour model”. The accord places limits on temporary contracts, 17m of which were concluded last year, compared with just 2m fixed-term contracts. But it allows their use for training, temporary replacements and work limited to fewer than 90 days.The CEOE adds that, while sector-wide talks will now set wage accords with unions, negotiations on conditions, which it considers more important, will stay business-specific.Mariano Rajoy, Spain’s previous conservative prime minister, has come up with a simpler analysis, telling the ABC newspaper the government pact has “left the [previous] labour reform where it was”.But the PP’s current leadership indicated it would vote against any changes to measures that it said had brought millions of jobs to Spain over the past decade.The government also depicts the changes as a paradigm shift. “The previous model was based on precariousness and wage depreciation,” said an official. “This reform will recover workers’ rights without hurting business.”Officials express confidence they will win enough support from Spain’s smaller parties to pass the measures into law. But they are reluctant to reopen a lengthily negotiated text that has already been ticked off Spain’s list of commitments to the EU.“It’s true that in large part this measure maintains the PP’s labour reform, while focusing on cutting down on temporary contracts, which if it works will be very positive,” said Alicia Coronil, chief economist at Singular Bank, a Madrid-based private bank.Coronil said the 2012 reform helped Spain to add half a million jobs a year before the pandemic and probably reduced job losses during it.But she said the pandemic “also showed how exposed the Spanish economy is — with companies that are often too small to expand and employment policies that are inadequate. What’s most important is to address those issues.”
246  A German court has sentenced a former Syrian intelligence officer to life in prison for crimes against humanity, in the world’s first criminal case over state-sponsored torture in Syria.The landmark trial could set a precedent for more cases in countries which, like Germany, have adopted the principle of universal jurisdiction. Universal jurisdiction allows a country or organisation to try a person accused of crimes against international law, regardless of where that crime was committed.Anwar Raslan was the head of the General Intelligence Unit’s detention facility known as Branch 251 until he defected from Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s government in 2012. Also called the “Al-Khatib Branch”, it was notorious among opposition activists as a site of torture.As a result of his oversight of that facility, the judge in the Koblenz court found Raslan guilty as a co-perpetrator of thousands of cases of torture, as well as 27 murders and cases of sexual assault.“For the first time, a higher-ranking member of the Syrian regime has been convicted of crimes against humanity,” said Patrick Kroker, a lawyer from the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights, which represented some of the plaintiffs. “The verdict today is only a first step in addressing the crimes in Syria — but this first step is often the most difficult.”Raslan pleaded not guilty in court, and is likely to appeal his sentence, which his co-defendant, Eyad al-Gharib, has already done.Raslan, in his late 50s, sought asylum in Germany in 2014. His trial, as well as that of al-Gharib who was found guilty of facilitating torture last year, has been divisive among opponents of the Syrian regime. Some are concerned that the prosecution could deter others from defecting and coming forward about regime crimes.One former detainee who testified against Raslan, and asked not to be identified for his safety, described mixed emotions upon learning of Thursday’s verdict. The middle-aged man, a doctor, was tortured and detained in Branch 251 for 40 days, and kept in solitary confinement for 30 of them.“I felt so happy we who were arrested and tortured accomplished something that reaches punishment in a fair trial,” he said. “But my father is still missing [after detention.] My wife’s relative is still missing. I have dozens of friends and cousins still missing, and justice still seems far away.”Torture and forced disappearances have been common among all sides of the conflict, but human rights activists say the abuse in government prisons, long predating the 2011 uprising, was systemic. Since Syria’s 11-year war began, more than 500,000 people have died in the fighting, during which Assad used chemical weapons and barrel bombs. He remains firmly in power, controlling most of the country.The detainee criticised the fact countries such as the UK and Denmark were seeking to deport asylum seekers back to Syria at the same time European courts were trying regime figures in court.“We see this normalisation happening at the same time western courts, with their legal standards, find even low-level regime officers like Raslan guilty of war crimes,” he said.For human rights defenders, most avenues to pursue charges for potential war crimes by Assad’s government are blocked. Syria is not a member of the International Criminal Court. Meanwhile, Russia and China have blocked efforts to refer Syria to the court through the UN Security Council.Eric Witte, a senior policy officer at Open Society Justice Initiative, which represented five plaintiffs, said the Raslan trial could be used as a precedent for states with universal jurisdiction to create a court by treaty for Syrian war crimes.“We think this is legally feasible and it should be politically feasible,” he said. “It’s really up to states to determine their level of commitment to justice for the atrocities in Syria.”But even if such a court was established, it would be difficult to find suspects to try. Most of Assad’s top-level officials only visit countries that back his government, such as Russia and Iran.As part of the Raslan trial, Germany’s war crimes unit investigated how the Syrian security and detention system worked, identifying chains of command and facilities allegedly behind systematic use of torture.This evidence, said Witte, could be used in other cases. Already, another trial in Frankfurt is set to start against a Syrian doctor employed in a state detention centre and accused of torture. The plaintiff from Raslan’s trial said he hoped he would live to see more trials: “We want our suffering to have had meaning.”
247  The year has begun dramatically for France’s leading art fairs, Fiac and Paris Photo. Just before the Christmas holidays, and with no warning, their respective October and November slots in the Grand Palais and the Grand Palais Éphémère, its temporary replacement during renovation work, were put up for tender by France’s cultural body, the Réunion des Musées Nationaux-Grand Palais (RMN-GP). According to the tender, the move was prompted by an unnamed third party expressing an interest in a seven-year contract, reportedly worth at least €20m. Chris Dercon, president of RMN-GP, has said: “There is a need to rethink shows, to be ambitious, curious and open.”Michel Filzi, chief executive of RX France, which owns Fiac and Paris Photo, said in a January 4 letter to exhibitors that the situation had “very worrying consequences” for the future of the fairs. The RMN-GP decision was made “without any consultation with us, its occupant and historical partner for decades”, the letter said, adding that “summary [legal] proceedings have been initiated”. The original decision date of January 10 has been extended — a spokesperson for RMN-GP says that the future occupant of the coveted slots will be announced “at the end of January”.Regarding the “mystery third party”, Filzi writes that this must be a well-resourced “professional with the necessary experience to organise art fairs of this level”. MCH Group, owner of Art Basel and Masterpiece, and the Frieze fairs, which both fit such a bill, declined to comment, though my money is on the organisers of the Swiss fair.Elsewhere the art fair landscape remains unsettled. Victoria Siddall, who stepped down from the day-to-day running of the Frieze events last year, is leaving her role in March as a strategy-focused director after 18 years of working for the fair. She remains on the Frieze board in a non-executive capacity and will act as an adviser, including to the fair’s new edition in Seoul this September. She has not revealed any roles elsewhere.Meanwhile, Frieze in Los Angeles is still due to run February 17-20, though many other events have fallen off the winter calendar as Covid-19 continues to disrupt travel and mass gatherings. Tefaf Maastricht has postponed its March fair indefinitely, while the India Art Fair and the London Art Fair have moved their start-of-year showings to April, The Winter Show has become a Spring outing, and Brafa in Belgium has moved its January date to June. New York’s Outsider Art Fair has more optimistically delayed by just a month and will now run March 3-6.Alternative events continue to gain ground and happily London Gallery Weekend (LGW) — a pooled effort from about 140 of the city’s contemporary art specialists — gets its second outing between May 13 and 15. The dates are earlier than last year, to avoid the extended holiday for the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee, and now coincide with the planned outings of Photo London and Eye of the Collector fairs in town.What began as a Covid-19-driven occasion still has relevance in a more eventful art world. “We had all been so international in our focus previously,” says Sarah Rustin of Thaddaeus Ropac gallery and a co-director of LGW, working alongside its founder Jeremy Epstein. “LGW has provided the impetus to refocus on just how much potential there is locally.”As well as championing the London community, this year’s event has partnered with the Art Fund, a charity that supports museums across the UK. This includes sponsoring about 20 curators to travel to the event from outside London and the development of a focus group to benefit the country’s many — and often struggling — institutions.Additional programming, relating to the LGW shows but organised separately, is also on the slate, including talks and performances. “We were in some ways more hampered by the restrictions last year but can be more ambitious this time,” Rustin says.Bonhams has bought leading Nordic auction house Bukowskis for an undisclosed sum from Sweden’s wealthy Lundin family. The move is a further sign of consolidation in the middle market after Gurr Johns group, which owns Dreweatts and Bloomsbury, bought Forum Auctions at the end of last year.Bukowskis holds the record for the priciest Swedish artwork at auction: Anders Zorn’s “Sunday Morning” (1891), which sold for the equivalent of £2.9m last year. Bonhams chief executive Bruno Vinciguerra says that the acquisition will help his group in its strategy “to operate from the global to the hyperlocal”. He says that the combination will give Bukowskis a more international platform while plugging its loyal clients and salerooms in Stockholm and Helsinki into the Bonhams business. Digital sales are also part of the play — Bonhams’ share of business done online grew from 12 per cent in 2019 to nearly 40 per cent last year, while Bukowskis now makes around half of its sales in this way, Vinciguerra says.While Bonhams, which has been owned by the private equity group Epiris since 2018, has had a sprinkle of seven-figure sales, both businesses specialise in what Vinciguerra calls the “core market” of items valued between £2,000 and £1m. “This is where we want to extend our position,” he says, hinting at further acquisitions soon.London’s high-end department store Selfridges throws itself into the trippy geometry of Op Art this week with an exhibition of work by the French-Hungarian Victor Vasarely (1906-97). The Oxford Street store’s windows will be wrapped in a Vasarely design from January 13 while 50 of his works will be on view inside, with most available to buy (£40,000-£400,000).A separate suite of 12 non-fungible tokens of Vasarely’s work, in editions of 100, will also be released during the exhibition’s run, priced from £2,000 to above £100,000. Funds raised will go to the Fondation Vasarely, including to its museum in Aix-en-Provence.Clothing designer Paco Rabanne joins the fray and incorporates Vasarely’s patterns into its spring/summer 2022 collection, while Selfridges’ corner shop has Vasarely-themed gifts, from candles to surfboards. 
248  Goedemorgen and welcome to Europe Express.The Netherlands’ new cabinet will be introducing themselves to their EU counterparts over the coming weeks, but Covid-19 may stop new liberal finance chief Sigrid Kaag making it to Brussels for Monday’s eurogroup. We profile Kaag and whether she can overturn years of Dutch resistance to the EU’s economic integration.Speaking of glass ceilings, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen tells the Financial Times she is hopeful that Berlin’s new government will drop longstanding opposition against rules to boost female representation in corporate boardrooms.In Spain, Madrid’s firebrand conservative leader Isabel Díaz Ayuso has launched a lawsuit against the socialist government of Pedro Sánchez over a decision to prioritise four regions in the first disbursements of EU recovery funds.And while Westminster is consumed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s “bring your own booze” lockdown “work event”, Brexit negotiator Liz Truss is taking her EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic away from the commotion to a Kent estate for a two-day stay to iron out their differences.The Netherlands’ new finance minister has started life in her job in circumstances that are quintessentially 2022: in quarantine and with police security guarding her home, writes Mehreen Khan in Brussels.Sigrid Kaag, former leader of the Dutch liberal Democrats (D66), was the only minister not present at Netherlands’ cabinet inauguration this week, having tested positive for Covid-19 days prior. Instead, her swearing in ceremony was conducted over videocall.In another sign of our times, additional police security and surveillance cameras were yesterday installed around Kaag’s home after a man brandishing a burning torch threatened her residence last week. It is the latest case of intimidation and violence aimed at Dutch ministers during the pandemic.As the country’s first female finance minister and an avowed internationalist, as well as being pro-European, Kaag has attracted plenty of opprobrium from her political opponents on the far-right, who often rail against her “cosmopolitan elitism”.The 60-year-old polyglot, who is married to a Palestinian and has mixed-race children, has also spoken powerfully about racism in the Netherlands — making her a hate figure for anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders.But Kaag’s political adversaries could not stop her from leading D66 to a surprise surge in elections last March, reversing years of stagnant support to become the second-largest party in the country behind Mark Rutte’s rightwing VVD. Kaag celebrated the electoral triumph by dancing on the tables — literally.The finance ministry berth is a switch for the former UN diplomat, who served as trade minister and then foreign minister in the last government. She will take over the finance job from hawkish Christian Democrat Wopke Hoekstra, who made his name in Brussels leading an alliance of smaller northern countries to stifle French plans for fiscal federalism.Kaag’s instincts are likely to be less hostile on topics such as revamping budgetary rules, joint EU borrowing and fiscal risk-sharing. Her presence around the eurogroup table should help rebuild trust with southern capitals that often found themselves in Hoekstra’s line of fire. In a subtle act of trolling, Hoekstra becomes the Netherlands’ new chief diplomat as foreign minister.It remains an open question how far Kaag can lead an intellectual revolution in the Dutch finance ministry, overturning its hard-wired ordoliberalism and deep-seated suspicion of ever closer economic union. Tellingly, the new coalition agreement made only vague statements about the future of the Stability and Growth Pact and the EU’s pandemic recovery fund.Kaag may be forced to miss her maiden eurogroup meeting in Brussels next Monday, as her quarantine is only due to end the day before. Even if she makes it, her fellow ministers and the rest of Brussels will probably have to wait a while longer before the Netherlands reveals its hand on the future of the eurozone.The cost of nickel, which is used in batteries for electric vehicles, rose by as much as 4 per cent yesterday to a 10-year high of $22,745 a tonne. The metal has gained 12 per cent over the past month on the back of rising EV demand and falling global stock levels. (Read more)The EU’s €800bn coronavirus recovery fund, an epochal bid to transform the bloc’s economy, is headed for the courts in Spain, writes Daniel Dombey in Madrid.The region of Madrid, Spain’s economic powerhouse, announced yesterday it had begun a lawsuit against the national government for handing out funds to four regions “without any explanation” as to why others were not included.The Supreme Court suit is the latest clash between Isabel Díaz Ayuso, the conservative leader of the greater Madrid region, and Pedro Sánchez, Spain’s Socialist prime minister. They have previously tussled over coronavirus restrictions. That fight ended with Díaz Ayuso’s emphatic re-election in a snap poll last May.Madrid is now complaining about what it says is the unfair use of €9m in recovery funds to subsidise Navarre, Valencia, Extremadura and the Basque country — the first three of which are all Socialist-led.The issue may matter more than the relatively small sums involved suggest. Spain’s regions will play a huge role in deciding the fate of the once-in-a-generation opportunity represented by the recovery fund. The country’s regions are on course to be big winners from the fund, receiving some €21bn of Spain’s €70bn in grants.The Madrid action underlines Díaz Ayuso’s status as perhaps Sánchez’s fiercest foe within the opposition People’s party. That’s not necessarily good news for party leader Pablo Casado, who has spent much of the last few months squabbling with Díaz Ayuso over control of the PP’s Madrid machinery, and who has slid down the polls as the feud has worn on.Chevening House in the Kent countryside will be the setting for UK foreign secretary Liz Truss’s latest round of Brexit talks with her European Commission counterpart Maros Sefcovic today, writes Andy Bounds in Brussels.It is the first in-person meeting between the two after Lord Frost, the combative former Brexit minister, quit before Christmas with a broadside against the government’s Covid and tax policies.The two will try to find common ground over post-Brexit trade frictions between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, with Truss hoping the ambience of her 17th century “grace and favour” estate south of London will charm Sefcovic into further concessions.The commission says proposals made in October will cut customs checks in half and other food and animal checks by 80 per cent, but London says that is not enough. “I will be putting forward practical, reasonable solutions starting from these fundamental principles, with a view to agreeing a plan for intensive negotiations,” Truss said.Talks will be spread across three sessions with plenty of time for walks in the grounds. Tonight, the delegations will dine on a pan-British feast of Scottish smoked salmon, Welsh lamb and Kent apple pie. Perhaps the Northern Irish contribution is being saved for a famous Ulster fry breakfast.Officials briefed on the talks believe the UK’s proposals are similar to those already tabled — and rejected — by the EU, including a self-certification system that would exempt goods destined for Northern Ireland only from checks.Truss will also attempt to move the debate on to a bright new future on foreign policy and research co-operation. But Sefcovic, a burly Slovak who has more than a decade of mastering the minutiae of Brussels behind him, is likely to bring the discussion back to sausages and supermarket supplies.
249  “I’m a different animal,” says Rocco Commisso. “I hope they respect a different animal. And if they don’t respect that, screw them.”The American billionaire and owner of ACF Fiorentina, a famous but underachieving Italian football club, is reflecting on his relationship with the team’s supporters, players, other club owners, the media, the whole damn world.It’s a crisp, bright November afternoon in Florence, and we’re eating spaghetti in a private room on the top floor of the five-star Westin Excelsior hotel. Floor-to-ceiling windows provide panoramic views over the historic city that gave birth to the Renaissance. The landscape is punctuated by red-tiled roofs and the scarlet dome of the Duomo.It’s a fitting backdrop for a master of the universe turned modern-day prince of Florence. Yet when I ask Commisso, 72, if he’s enjoying owning the club he acquired in 2019 for €170m, all he has are gripes.Like the time in May when he held a press conference which descended into a slanging match with journalists. In a fit of pique, he offered to sell the club to any local who could stump up €335m within 10 days. There were no takers. “[If you] don’t have the money,” he snorts, “you should shut up.”Then there are the government officials resisting his plans to build a new stadium: “All the bullshit bureaucracy, it’s driving me crazy.” Or the players’ agents who demand multimillion-euro fees for their work: “What the hell do they do?”He will concede that “the fans love me, up to a point”. That point, he tells me, is the extent to which “I win and I spend money”.Having made his fortune in the US, Commisso could have acquired a football club anywhere in the world. The reason he bought one in Italy has to do with his roots. The son of a carpenter, he was born in Calabria, the region that forms the toe on the boot of Italy. The family escaped poverty when he was 12, moving to America and settling in the Bronx, New York. As a budding athlete, Commisso earned a full scholarship and played football for Columbia University.He worked his way up in business through jobs at Pfizer and Chase Manhattan Bank (now JPMorgan Chase). Then, in 1995, he founded a cable telecommunications company, Mediacom. Today Commisso is, according to Forbes, the 352nd richest person on the planet with an estimated wealth of $7.2bn.Commisso is accustomed to dictating terms. As we meet, he declares he will approve every word in this article before publication. That is against FT policy, I explain. Commisso retorts in his gruff New York accent: “Then I’ve got to be careful what I say.” After several hours of forthright conversation, during which he periodically chews on nicotine tablets, it’s unclear to me exactly when Commisso is taking care over his words.It’s why I believe him when he offers his reasons for buying Fiorentina. Over recent years, wealthy individuals, investment funds, even nations have bought top European football clubs. For some owners, teams are trophy assets. Others expect to make profits by, for instance, bagging a share of the sport’s multibillion-euro broadcasting rights. Commisso insists his purposes are more altruistic. “I’m investing in my country,” he explains. “I’m returning to give something back to my country that gave me soccer. I’m returning to the game of soccer that got me to where I am.”Instead of receiving a warm welcome as “part of the money that’s trying to resuscitate Italian soccer”, Commisso feels a lack of regard. He shows me his phone, scrolling through the dozens of articles written about the club daily, complaining that few defend his ownership. Commisso is sensitive to derogatory characterisations of Italian-Americans, particularly incensed at the columnist in La Gazzetta dello Sport, the venerable Italian sports paper, who wrote that “Don Rocco, more than from a great Coppola or Scorsese gangster movie, seems to come out of an Italian police B-movie.”“What upsets me is that there’s not an appreciation, OK?” he says. “All the stuff that’s been done to make, in the short time that I’ve been here, Fiorentina a success.” The team currently lies sixth in Italy’s top division Serie A, which is its best showing in years, but well short of the game’s summit.It’s hard to sympathise with a billionaire who loudly complains of voluntarily entering an industry stacked against him, no matter his net worth. But Commisso’s travails are also a result of being a football romantic who still sees the sport through the prism of a bygone age. A football club owner used to be the benefactor of a beloved institution, with teams filled by locals representing their communities. Today the sport is awash in cash and features an international cast of millionaire players. Success can be bought and, nowadays, supporters blame owners for not buying it.Commisso says he’s not a “stupid American” who will endlessly sink his cash into the club. His plan is to invest enough to make Fiorentina, which has won just two Italian Serie A league titles in its 95-year history, “self-sufficient”, generating enough revenue to spend on better players and compete with Italy and Europe’s best teams. To that end, he has already spent a “pretty serious” chunk of his fortune, pumping €80m into the club to cover its losses as the pandemic ravaged the sport’s finances, and an additional €90m to build a new training centre. “Now we’re at €340m, capiche?” he says, adding in his initial outlay.Commisso casts himself as a victim of the avarice that infects the world’s favourite sport. He says some view him as a zio d’America, which translates literally as “rich uncle”, but he describes as “the guy that left with a carton box to go to the US and come back loaded with money”. But he thinks that means many want to leech off his wealth. Two days spent with Commisso in Florence earlier this season provide a rare insight into the desires and disappointments of a billionaire who should have the resources to do whatever he wants but who finds obstacles constantly blocking his path. To anybody unwilling to afford him due respect, he has a warning: “They’re not going to screw with me that easily.”In his telling, Commisso is a product of his parents’ sacrifices. His father fought in the second world war and was held for five years by British forces. As a former prisoner of war, he later got preferential treatment to enter the US, to which he set sail in search of work. That left Commisso’s mother behind in Calabria to feed four children “with $1 a day, not even. You had to make do. But I never felt poor.” The entire family eventually resettled in New York, where Commisso worked jobs to pay his way through high school. But it was football that paid for his Ivy League education. In Italy, he learnt to play with balls made of rags on cement pitches, and when he got to Columbia, he thrived on the turf, steering the university’s team to its first-ever undefeated season. He was even invited to trials for the 1972 US Olympic football team, but arrived badly out of shape. “We used to smoke in the locker room,” he explains.His big break in business came as chief financial officer of Cablevision Industries, a cable company that was acquired by Time Warner for more than $3bn in 1996. Commisso says he made $5m from the deal. He could have retired early. Instead, he “decided to put it all at risk” to found Mediacom, which focused on bringing the incipient internet to rural and underserved communities across the US. The company’s first cable system was in Ridgecrest, California, a location “in the middle of nowhere”, says Commisso. “You know what Death Valley is? That’s where the system is. If you go to the map, you see Ridgecrest and the next thing is death.”Commisso’s success with Mediacom came from being mindful of costs and studiously avoiding competition. Its biggest markets are places like Des Moines, Iowa, and Springfield, Missouri — small population centres that bigger cable companies have tended to ignore. As internet demand skyrocketed, Commisso became a billionaire. He fully owns and runs Mediacom.He has been unable to implement a similarly savvy business model in football. For years he wanted to buy a top Italian club but, with only 20 clubs in Serie A, they are scarce assets. In 2018, he thought he had agreed a $610m deal to acquire the legendary AC Milan, seven-time European champions, only for its then owner, a Chinese entrepreneur called Yonghong Li, to back out of the sale at the last minute.A year later, Fiorentina became available. It is a far less successful but still much-loved team, known for its distinctive purple shirts (its nickname is “the Viola”) and for legendary former players such as Roberto Baggio, a talented playmaker known as “the divine ponytail”, and the Argentine goal machine Gabriel Batistuta. Commisso agreed to a takeover with its owners, the Della Valle family which controls the luxury goods maker Tod’s, within weeks. At the time, he heralded the deal as the “quickest closing in soccer history”. But a fellow Serie A club owner says, “He ran into this thing like he was running into a fire.[He] did not do the diligence.”As first reported by the New York Times, Commisso found that just before Fiorentina was sold the club’s outgoing executives had signed an unusual set of agreements. These contracts gave a football agent named Abdilgafar Fali Ramadani permission to find alternative buyers for five members of Fiorentina’s squad in return for a commission.If Fiorentina rejected any of the deals Ramadani negotiated, he would still receive a penalty fee. This was an odd provision: the agent was set to be paid whether or not any players were sold. Ramadani’s agency, Lian Sports, did not respond to requests for comment.Since taking over, Commisso has sought to ensure he isn’t stung by other agents. In May, having fired four first team coaches in 17 turbulent months, he hired Gennaro Gattuso, a famous former AC Milan player and up-and-coming manager. But 23 days later, Gattuso departed. When I ask why, a club press officer intervenes, saying that circumstances are protected by confidentiality agreements. I suggest that it’s up to Commisso to decide how much he can say. Commisso agrees, saying he will “be careful”.This is Commisso’s version of events: Gattuso joined Fiorentina, then immediately demanded the club “buy certain players at a certain price” who are also represented by his agent, Jorge Mendes, a powerful figure who boasts many star clients including Cristiano Ronaldo.Commisso saw Gattuso’s demand as an expensive ruse designed to benefit Mendes and disable the club from making independent transfer decisions. “That’s not my style,” says Commisso. “That’s not my history.I’m not gonna let anybody take advantage of me.” A person close to Gestifute, the agency led by Mendes which represents Gattuso, rejected Commisso’s story, describing it as “unreal” and “disrespectful”.These run-ins suggest Commisso, who also owns the New York Cosmos football club in the US, misunderstood where power lies in the modern European game. Most clubs spend around 70 to 80 per cent of their revenues on footballers’ wages. According to Fifa, international football’s governing body, global spending on player transfer fees in 2019 was around £5.5bn, while fees paid to agents organising moves totalled about £550m.The booming trade is unregulated and Commisso backs proposed reforms from Fifa, bitterly opposed by the likes of Mendes, to cap commissions to just 10 per cent of a transfer fee, while also ending “dual representation”, so an agent can no longer be paid by multiple parties in a transfer. But these changes may not be enacted in time to help Commisso settle a dispute with Fiorentina’s current star, Dusan Vlahovic, a Serbian striker who leads the standings for most goals scored in Serie A this season and is attracting attention from rival teams such as Arsenal of the English Premier League.The 1995 Bosman ruling that revolutionised the rules on players moving clubs means that, when Vlahovic’s playing contract runs out in 2023, he is able to leave for free, giving him a strong hand to negotiate better terms with Fiorentina now or any club he moves to next.Commisso resists my repeated probing over Vlahovic because “we are under active considerations as to what to do” and it’s unclear when “you’re going to write your stupid article”. But subsequently the reasons for his tetchiness become clear. People briefed on the talks reveal that Vlahovic’s agency, the Belgrade-based International Sports Office, wants an €8m fee just to renew the player’s contract with Fiorentina, while also receiving fees worth 10 per cent of any future transfer fee from both Fiorentina and a buying club.Given that Commisso believes Vlahovic is worth up to €75m on the transfer market, a sum close to what Fiorentina earns in revenues every year, he is in no mood to let the middlemen siphon off tens of millions of euros for themselves. (A person close to International Sports Office said these terms were “in line with the industry specific standards”.)Commisso has urged Vlahovic not to act in his narrow financial interests, saying: “He developed here. And he should give recognition, whatever happens, to the club that got him to where he is.”And though people close to the talks say Fiorentina has offered Vlahovic a salary worth €5m a season, more than any player in the club’s history, it has become the latest battle in which Commisso insists he simply won’t be “screwed by players”. Regardless of what happens, he does finally admit to one mistake: underestimating the challenge of operating within football. “The more I live here, with this crazy sport, the more I realise how screwed up it is,” he says.The day after our long lunch in Florence, a taxi takes me 30 minutes east of the city centre to Bagno a Ripoli, a verdant suburb filled with olive groves and vineyards. I meet Commisso at the entrance of a construction site. This is Viola Park which, when completed, will be Fiorentina’s new training centre and home to its men’s, women’s and youth teams.As well as a mini-stadium that seats 4,500 people, the finished complex will house gyms, a swimming pool, a boarding school for young players, even a chapel. The aim is to create a state-of-the-art facility that proves attractive to new players, retains existing stars and transforms fledgling prospects into first team regulars. Commisso says it will be the first time that the club has owned property, its first physical asset beyond the players.He puts a fatherly arm around my shoulder and shows me around, but grows irate when his eyes fall on an 18th-century villa situated in the middle of the site. When he acquired the land, this three-storey structure was occupied by squatters. But local regulations to protect historic buildings also mean it cannot be bulldozed and nothing that is taller can be built alongside it.So instead of creating one massive complex, Commisso’s architects designed a sprawling campus with a series of low-rise buildings with huge basement floors. When the builders started digging, they kept finding Roman-era ruins. Regulations required that the ancient walls be excavated and protected. “We got walls in America too,” says Commisso. The delays and alterations led to more than €20m in additional costs.Still, work is finally progressing and Commisso looks ecstatic as he tours the grounds. He greets every construction worker. “They work for a living,” says Commisso. “And they need jobs with the Covid. Right? That’s my pleasure. When I come over here, they’re all my friends because they realise I’m giving work.[The city officials] don’t give a shit about whether people work or not.”At least this is one place where Commisso is getting his way. The club plays its home matches at the Artemio Franchi Stadium, a 40,000-seater ground built in 1930 and designed by the Italian architect Pier Luigi Nervi. It is considered a masterpiece of its era, featuring enormous spiral staircases and a 230-foot tall “Tower of Marathon” that overlooks the pitch. Or as Commisso calls the stadium, “the shittiest thing that’s ever been invented”. He wants to renovate the now crumbling ground to gain more ticketing and hospitality revenues that could benefit the club in the long term. Those efforts have been blocked by local authorities that own the stadium and are seeking to protect its architectural heritage. “What history does it have?” says Commisso. “That they won two championships in 90 years?”The impasse is, he believes, preventing Fiorentina from competing against the world’s best teams. According to the consultancy Deloitte, the club made €84.4m in overall revenues last season. Juventus — Italy’s biggest club, which does own its stadium — made €397.9m. “In order to compete with the top 20 teams [in Europe], we got to get, one way or another, to the same revenue levels,” says Commisso. “How do we get there? Through the stadium revenues.”Commisso’s predicament is shared by others. New club owners willing to fund rebuilds in cities such as Milan and Rome have also been delayed by local political wrangling. One legacy of the construction involved in Italy hosting the 1990 World Cup is that most of the country’s top clubs pay rent to play in dilapidated, government-owned stadiums. Grounds are rarely full, partly because sometimes-violent “ultra” fan-groups put families off from attending matches.The issue is symbolic of Italian football’s slide. Three decades ago, its top clubs hosted the world’s greatest players and coaches, helping them to dominate European football. But the quality and appeal of Serie A has steadily fallen behind the likes of England, Spain and Germany, where the best sides play in new glass and steel structures, in front of packed houses, while also earning more from television rights deals.“It’s a very bureaucratic country,” says a fellow Italian-American entrepreneur who has known Commisso for decades. “If you’re used to doing business in the United States of America, where things are organised and happen quickly, Italy is a bit of a shocker.”“I’m not doing it for the money,” says Commisso when I ask him why he bothers. “Why do I need another 100 million, you follow me? I’m gonna lose money.” He points to the vast expanse of the half-built Viola Park and says it will “leave a mark”. If the House of Medici were patrons of Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, leaving Florence with the Uffizi, then Commisso wants his legacy to be a footballing renaissance centred around a sparkling training centre and perhaps eventually a gleaming stadium.“This is important for Florence, because it’s gonna be around for 100 to 200 years, OK? And when they say who left it behind, it’s me.” But, I ask, what if, centuries from now, the city’s officials seek to block developers from renovating his buildings? “I’ll be alright with it then,” he says with a cackle.“Football is bullshit,” says Commisso in the bowels of the Artemio Franchi. It’s an hour before Fiorentina faces Sampdoria, a crucial match in the team’s effort at achieving a top six finish in Serie A and, with it, qualification for next season’s lucrative European competitions. But its owner is not done putting the football world to rights. “A player does well? He wants more money. I mean, you got 20-year-old kids that are making millions of euros. You know what I made in my first job? $10,500 a year. $200 a week.”The mood is tense. In the team’s previous game against Empoli, Fiorentina conceded two goals in the closing minutes to spoil a winning position into a losing one. Commisso declares he won’t step out on to the pitch to greet the fans before tonight’s match. Last time he did that, the team lost. And he’s self-admittedly a superstitious man.On a TV screen, Commisso watches a news report about the latest financial scandal rocking Italian football, which over the decades has been regularly shaken by club bankruptcies and bribery affairs involving players and referees. Days earlier, the offices of Juventus were raided by the country’s financial police in relation to a probe into the club’s transfer dealings. (Juventus denies any wrongdoing.)The sight of its chairman Andrea Agnelli, scion of the Italian industrialist family that owns Juventus, triggers Commisso. Juventus is listed on the Milan stock exchange. The club’s share price fell by around a third in the days after news of the investigation broke. Commisso says if the same events played out at a US-listed company, the shareholders who had suffered losses would “sue the motherfuckers, excuse my language”.One of the Fiorentina owner’s many sore points is a belief that few opponents are playing fair. He accuses top Italian clubs of failing to satisfy the league’s limits on debt and player spending, sometimes sidestepping these complex rules by being allowed to defer wages or tax payments. “This has got to be fixed within the Italian system,” he says. “You got to fix all this bullshit.”Football has, according to his fellow Italian-American entrepreneur, turned Commisso “a little bitter”. “He probably thought he would be like Caesar returning to Rome, the conquering hero.You expect to be welcomed because you’re trying to help your mother country and instead people are giving you a hard time, being critical and he’s going: ‘What the fuck do I need this for?’”This person adds that one issue is that Commisso is “not part of the Italian establishment. The top of the establishment is Juventus. The Agnellis. He’s the opposite of that. If you spent a minute with anyone from Turin and then someone from Calabria, it’s like oil and water, no matter how much money he has. And I don’t mean there aren’t polished people from the south. But he’s not a polished Italian.”Commisso says he is proud of what differentiates him from rival owners. And not just Juventus. AC Milan is owned by the $38.2bn hedge fund Elliott Management, and controlled by Gordon Singer, son of the hedge fund’s founder Paul. Inter Milan is owned by Chinese conglomerate Suning and run by 30-year-old Steven Zhang, son of Zhang Jindong, Suning’s billionaire founder.“There are jealousies too, right,” Commisso says. “Because who else has done what I’ve done? Want me to list them? Not the Agnellis. The grandfather, maybe, not the grandchildren. Not Gordon at Milan. Not that kid at Suning. It’s other people’s money. OK? And then we go down the list [of club owners in Italy], there’s nobody, nobody like me here.”A few minutes before kick-off, Commisso puts on a Covid mask and steps out into the directors’ box. The stadium is only half full. Those in the stands below applaud and shout, “Rocco! Rocco!” He waves, accepts selfie requests and pinches the cheeks of kids sitting nearby.The game starts badly when, within minutes, Sampdoria takes the lead. Fiorentina quickly equalises. Then the star man Vlahovic heads the team into a lead they don’t relinquish. When the striker is taken off as a substitute with a few minutes to go, Fiorentina’s owner stands to applaud.As the final whistle blows, I approach Commisso for one last word. He clasps either side of my face, pulls my head towards his, then bellows: “I gotta be with the fans.” With that he whisks down to the pitch to meet his public. He’s spent a lifetime, and a fortune, to earn the fleeting adoration only football can provide.
250  The author is a senior political scientist at the Rand CorporationMonday’s US-Russia talks over the Ukraine crisis resolved little. Yet they did lay bare the core disagreement driving the most dangerous tensions in Europe in recent memory: the question of Ukraine’s aspirations to Nato membership.After the meeting, Sergei Ryabkov, Russia’s chief negotiator, said it was essential that Ukraine “never, never, ever becomes a member of Nato”. Wendy Sherman, US deputy secretary of state, countered: “We will not allow anyone to slam closed Nato’s open door policy, which has always been central to the Nato alliance.”The difference appears irreconcilable. After all, Nato’s founding document leaves open the option of inviting new members “in a position to.contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area”. For Nato, Russia’s demand as formulated is a non-starter.But Nato has not invited Ukraine to join, and the allies have no intention of doing so. If it can defuse this crisis, the alliance should describe its actual policy, rather than continuing to joust with Moscow over abstract principles.The dispute over Ukraine has a long vintage. As early as 1997, former Russian foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov told his counterparts that Nato’s admission of Ukraine would cross a “red line”. When Ukraine and Georgia’s membership bids began to seem more plausible in the 2000s, Russia’s opposition became more vocal. This created a vicious cycle. The louder Moscow protested, the more determined western capitals became to deny Russia what was seen as a veto over alliance decision-making. The issue was no longer the merits of Kyiv and Tbilisi’s bids for membership, but the perception that Russia could determine alliance policy.Events reached a peak at Nato’s Bucharest summit in 2008. The George W Bush administration had been pushing hard to grant Ukraine and Georgia Membership Action Plans (MAPs), road maps to eventual accession. Germany and France believed that Ukraine and Georgia were not ready, but all allies wanted to avoid being seen as bowing to Russian pressure.In an unusual compromise, allied leaders stated in a summit communiqué that Ukraine and Georgia “will become” Nato members — without saying when — but denied them MAPs. After the summit, it became clear that this declaration was the worst of all worlds. It provided no increased security to Ukraine and Georgia, but reinforced Moscow’s view that Nato was set on incorporating them.Since Bucharest, the assertion that the two former Soviet republics “will become” members has calcified into Nato dogma, largely because Russia continues to reject it so stridently. Leaders reiterate it at every summit. But the reality is that Nato has no plan to offer membership to Ukraine or Georgia — or even grant them a MAP.Nato cannot and should not accept being told what to do by Russia. But Moscow’s inflammatory rhetoric should not distract from the fact that Nato is not prepared to offer Ukraine membership. If doing so could avert a war, why not find some way to say out loud what any Nato official would say behind closed doors: that Ukraine’s membership in Nato is not being considered?Some object that such a step would violate the principle of a state’s “right freely to choose its own security arrangements”. Yet even if Russia were not massing a huge force on Ukraine’s borders, it is disingenuous for Nato to insist on this principle while remaining unwilling to grant Kyiv its choice. Continuing to do so amid the present tensions does nothing to help Ukraine, and could make things worse.Regardless, Nato would not be acting contrary to this principle if it were to declare that, while Ukraine is free to pursue membership, the alliance is not offering it membership at present. That is a factually accurate statement.Such a declaration of restraint would not be unprecedented. In December 1996, Nato allies declared they had “no intention, no plan and no reason to deploy nuclear weapons on the territory of new members” — the so-called “three no’s”. This declaration was made before any of the new members joined the alliance. If it was acceptable for Nato to make such a commitment to self-restraint 25 years ago, it should be acceptable today.A statement that the alliance has no intention to offer Ukraine membership at present should only be made in return for a tangible drawdown of Russian forces on the border. It concedes nothing to declare that Nato is not planning to do something it has no intention of doing anyway. If acknowledging this reality averts a conflict that might destroy Ukraine and destabilise Europe, that seems like a small price to pay.
251  Europe needs to stand up to China’s “illegal” pressure on Lithuania and foreign companies operating there or risk damage to the international trade system, according to the Baltic country’s foreign minister.Gabrielius Landsbergis told the Financial Times that China had escalated its conflict over Lithuania’s ties with Taiwan to include harassment of European companies which use Lithuanian-made components. He will tell EU foreign ministers about the harassment at a meeting on Thursday and Friday, he said.“Now there has to be a very clear answer from Europe. Europe has to say it’s not the way to treat the single market. It’s a test for the rules-based international trade order. Europe has to stand up,” Landsbergis added.Lithuania is at the centre of a geopolitical row after Vilnius allowed Taiwan to open a representative office in its own name, rather than the usual evasion of calling it after its capital city, Taipei.China reacted furiously, recalling its ambassador and downgrading the status of Lithuania’s embassy in Beijing, stopping Lithuanian goods at its borders, and warning European companies such as German car part maker Continental not to use components from the Baltic country. China demands that governments deny Taiwan any treatment suggesting sovereignty. Beijing opposes any use of the country’s official moniker, Republic of China, or its geographic name Taiwan, which it sees as an attempt by Taipei to pursue de jure independence.Landsbergis and other Lithuanian officials insist that Vilnius has abided by Beijing’s policy but that it is free to establish commercial and cultural ties with Taiwan.“Lithuania did nothing wrong, it did nothing illegal, we did not break any international obligations. It’s actually vice versa. What is being done to our companies, the name of our embassy being changed unilaterally, what is now being done to European companies, all this is most likely illegal,” the Lithuanian foreign minister said.Taiwan has sought to soften the blow of Beijing’s ire by establishing a $1bn credit fund for Lithuanian-Taiwanese projects and a $200m investment fund in the Baltic country and purchasing 120 containers that were blocked at China’s ports.Lithuania’s own position was muddied last week when president Gitanas Nauseda said it had been a “mistake” to name the office after Taiwan rather than Taipei. Landsbergis said that the government was “in the process of aligning” positions with the president as both saw “the whole situation in a similar manner”, although he did not give any details.Landsbergis said China’s “unprecedented” harassment of other countries’ companies showed the “urgent need to develop anti-coercion instruments” in Europe and elsewhere.“It’s a test for the EU but it’s also a test for the west. We felt responsible as a western society after the second world war to introduce a rules-based order for trade. It worked. Now we’re seeing it’s being tested,” he added.Lithuania is facing pressure not just from China; Belarus and Russia threaten on its eastern borders. Landsbergis called Moscow a “geopolitical disrupter” and said the ripples from its actions at the Ukrainian frontier had affected Lithuania and its neighbours.Vilnius is worried about any concessions that could be made to Russia as well as about the possibility that Moscow could move its troops from Ukraine to Belarus, which is closer to Lithuania, he said.“A very serious answer needs to be sent to Putin,” Landsbergis said, stressing that he believed Nato would reinforce security in the Baltics if the situation escalates.
252  Manufacturing businesses in Northern Ireland have made “significant” strides towards adjusting to new trading arrangements that were imposed after Brexit, according to the region’s trade body.A survey by Manufacturing NI found that less than a quarter of its members were struggling with the so-called Northern Ireland protocol, which governs trade in the region. This compared with more than 40 per cent six months ago.The findings, which will be published on Friday, will add weight to demands from the region’s business for the EU and the UK to settle their differences over the deal that left Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market for goods, creating a trade border in the Irish Sea.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, said while the responses showed that manufacturers were “overcoming issues”, there was also “more work required” to make the deal work for everyone.Talks resumed on Thursday between the UK and EU over the deal which the British government has warned places an “unsustainable” burden on businesses.It is the first meeting in person between Liz Truss, the UK foreign secretary, and the EU’s Brexit commissioner Maros Sefcovic since Truss took over responsibility for the talks following the resignation of Lord David Frost as the UK’s chief negotiator late last year.Truss will host Sefcovic at her grace-and-favour residence in Chevening, Kent, with a working dinner on Thursday night.The UK is demanding that the EU radically reshape the protocol by reducing the amount of checks required on goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. London argues it is hurting business and destabilising the region’s politics.Northern Ireland’s mainly Protestant unionist parties, who want to remain part of the UK, have unanimously rejected the protocol. In contrast, the nationalist Sinn Féin party, which is traditionally backed by Catholics and seeks a united Ireland, has said the protocol was “here to stay”.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, which heads the region’s power-sharing executive, has demanded a timeline for enforcing the UK’s protocol demands.Trade groups have said that Northern Ireland has the potential to benefit from having dual access to both the UK and EU markets.Officials on both sides admit that significant differences remain over how to implement the deal, which has soured wider EU-UK relations since the Brexit agreements came into force in January 2021.Simon Coveney, Irish foreign minister, hailed a “good and friendly” first meeting with Truss last week. But he told the FT bluntly in December that it was now time for concessions.Kelly added that the survey showed his members were increasingly grasping opportunities presented by the region’s unique position straddling the EU and UK, and were picking up more business in GB and in the EU.The number of companies reporting negative impacts on sales to Great Britain fell from one-third to one-fifth since July; while the number reporting problems with EU suppliers also fell sharply over the same period.But Kelly noted there were “still problems” within the new trading arrangements and a “strong desire” for the two sides to make the rules simpler for the benefit of both business and the wider Northern Ireland economy.The European Commission claims that recent economic data showing Northern Ireland’s economy outperforming the rest of the UK proves the protocol can work. It has tabled proposals it said would cut customs red tape by half and food and animal checks by 80 per cent, but the UK disputes this.The biggest negative impact so far has been on fresh food supplies, since these are subject to more rigorous checks than machine parts. Sefcovic has said companies should adapt by sourcing more goods from the island of Ireland.
253  Ursula von der Leyen told the Financial Times she is ready to work with France to push for the proposed directive during the six-month period of Paris holding the rotating EU presidency. She added that she is hopeful of Berlin dropping its previous opposition now that a new coalition government has been formed. Von der Leyen said lawmakers should aim to settle the directive in the first half of the year if possible, and a deal could “definitely” be done at some point in 2022. “It’s time to move forward with this file,” she said. “It’s been sitting on the shelf for ten years now, but in these ten years there has been a lot of movement and learning.”The commission first proposed the directive on gender balance in boardrooms in 2012, but it has been stuck in the council of ministers because of opposition from a number of European countries including Germany and some Nordic and Baltic states. They argue that the matter should be dealt with at a national rather than EU-wide level. Germany has its own domestic system, having set boardroom gender quotas for supervisory boards half a decade ago and broadening the regime to cover management boards last year. Norway was the first European country to introduce boardroom quotas in 2008. If Germany shifts position it will bolster the directive’s prospects of receiving enough voting weight in the EU’s council of ministers. It already has cross-party support in the Parliament.The proposed directive sets a target for 40 per cent of non-executive directors in listed companies to be women, with the possibility of a lower 33 per cent objective for single-tier management systems. Under the rules, the target should be achieved via transparent selection procedures, and companies that fail to meet their targets would have to explain the reasons and report on the steps they will take. The directive does not set out sanctions, leaving these to member states, and it will not apply to small and medium-sized, or unlisted, companies. The rules would affect a wide range of member states, given that only eight have so far adopted mandatory national gender quotas for listed companies, among them France, Germany and Italy. France currently has the strongest female representation in the boardrooms of the biggest listed companies’ at 45 per cent, according to the European Institute for Gender Equality, against a 30 per cent average for the EU as a whole. An EU diplomat said it was safe to assume that Berlin is now taking a “fresh look” at its position following the formation of the coalition between the Social Democrats, the Greens and liberals.I have learnt that, to have a critical threshold of women on boards, you need a legal [framework] nudging companies in the right directionA German government spokesperson said: “The balanced representation of women and men in boardrooms is an important concern for the German government. The EU Commission’s proposal for a directive is currently being examined by the ministries and a joint position of the German government is being reached.”Von der Leyen is set to meet European parliamentary lawmakers on Thursday morning. She said she had discussed the topic when she met with Emmanuel Macron, French president, and that Paris was “willing and determined” to embark on the initiative. Von der Leyen said the evidence was “overwhelming” that companies with boardroom diversity were more successful and introducing legal requirements accelerated the pace of progress towards more gender-balanced representation. She recalled that, as a young woman studying medicine, she had expected progress to happen naturally, but she later changed her view on the need for legal mandates. “I have learnt that, to have a critical threshold of women on boards, you need a legal [framework] nudging companies in the right direction,” said Von der Leyen. “If we look at the EU overall.and at the challenges ahead of us, we need all the width of talents we have, and of course for that we need to open up for women in leadership positions.”
254  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
255  Nato has offered Moscow further talks on arms control in a bid to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, but the Kremlin has so far not accepted.Speaking after nearly four hours of talks with Russian officials in Brussels, Nato’s secretary-general Jen Stoltenberg said the alliance was prepared to discuss limits on missile deployment and military exercises as well as measures to improve transparency and communications.Russian negotiators needed more time to consider the offer, but had not rejected it, Stoltenberg said.“Our differences will not be easy to bridge,” he said, adding that allies were “clear-eyed about the prospects for progress”.Wednesday’s meeting was the first gathering of the Nato-Russia Council for two years and was the second of three sets of talks this week intended to dissuade Russia from attacking Ukraine. Moscow has amassed 100,000 troops along Ukraine’s borders and has threatened military action if its demands to redraw European security arrangements are not met.These include bans on further Nato expansion and on Nato military activities in states that joined the alliance after the end of the cold war.Russia’s deputy foreign minister Alexander Grushko and deputy defence minister Alexander Fomin reiterated those demands on Wednesday. They were unanimously rejected by Nato representatives. Wendy Sherman, US deputy secretary of state, said they were “simply non-starters”.Sherman said she had not heard anything substantively new from the Russian side on Wednesday, following lengthy bilateral US-Russian discussions in Geneva at the start of the week where she laid out “several preliminary ideas” for arms control, limits on military exercises and improved communications.“These are all beginning meetings around an incredibly complex set of issues,” she said. But she insisted: “We are not dragging our feet.”Grushko told reporters that Russia and Nato had “no positive agenda” and said Moscow would continue to oppose the alliance’s further expansion, which he said “seriously harms our security and creates unacceptable risks for it”.The Russian negotiators told Nato of “the most unpredictable and grave consequences for European security” if the situation were to develop in a way not to Moscow’s liking, Grushko said.“Russia doesn’t want things to turn out like that and the measures we are proposing today [.] could radically turn the situation around,” he added.Moscow had repeatedly suggested ways to de-escalate conflict, but Nato had ignored them, Fomin said in a statement, without specifying any proposals.Stoltenberg said Nato allies were “ready to meet again with Russia to have discussions in greater detail, to put concrete proposals on the table and to seek constructive outcomes”.He said they wanted to explore ways to increase transparency around military exercises, prevent dangerous incidents and reduce space and cyber threats, as well as reciprocal limits on the deployment of intermediate range missiles.He added that the alliance wanted to discuss with Moscow ways of improving communication and said Nato members proposed opening reciprocal representative offices and re-establishing military dialogue. Last year, Russia closed its mission to Nato and the alliance’s office in Moscow after Nato expelled eight diplomats in the mission for being “undeclared intelligence officers”.Western powers have called on Moscow to de-escalate its aggressive military posture against Ukraine in return for more detailed negotiations on European security arrangements.Sherman said “it was hard to have dialogue, to have diplomacy that is conducive to success, when you have 100,000 troops, live-fire exercises and disinformation”. But she suggested a pullback of Russian forces was not a precondition for further dialogue.Talks between Russian and western powers will move to Vienna on Thursday for discussion among representatives of the 57-member Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.Sherman said Russian president Vladimir Putin would soon after have a choice to make.“There is progress to be made,” she said. “Russia will have to decide whether this is really about security and whether they are willing to engage or whether this is just a pretext. They may not even know yet.”
256  Aux armes, citoyens. Two years ago, the EU — under the guidance of Ursula von der Leyen’s self-labelled “geopolitical Commission” — adopted the ambitious but vague goal of developing European “strategic autonomy” on a global level.Although invoked almost daily in Brussels, the concept has remained aspirational, even abstract. Meanwhile, the EU faces real and specific menaces, with China blocking Lithuania’s exports and Russia threatening to invade Ukraine. This would be a good time to turn the EU’s undoubted clout in trade policy to strategic ends to resist pressure from hostile governments.Enter, to the sound of bugles and the thundering of horses’ hooves, a cavalry charge led by Emmanuel Macron. The French president is leading the council of EU member states for the next six months — assuming he is re-elected in April — and will aim to overcome EU disunity and France’s own vulnerabilities to build European geopolitical power.In theory, it’s just what the EU needs — leadership from a big member state with its own renowned military, intelligence and diplomatic capability. For the council presidency, Macron has adopted a rallying cry — “relance, puissance, appartenance” (“recovery, power, belonging”) — with more than a whiff of revolutionary zeal. He also has a personal motive to build European strategic power independent of its traditional allies, following last September’s humiliation of being ambushed by the Australia-UK-US (Aukus) security pact and its deal on nuclear submarines.With excellent timing, the EU is creating a new trade weapon, a legal “anti-coercion” instrument, which France wants to fast-track. The tool will allow rapid retaliation with trade, investment and financial measures against illegitimate pressure from foreign governments. In the future, it will hopefully deter the likes of China from bullying EU states such as Lithuania.But multiple vulnerabilities hamper France’s ability to lead the repurposing of EU trade policy for strategic ends.The first is foreign policy disunity within the EU towards China, Russia and the US. Macron is frequently at odds with some member states in the eastern half of Europe, in particular over his previous emollience towards President Vladimir Putin. Given Russia’s belligerence over Ukraine, and the Russia-linked mercenaries sent despite French objections to Mali, where France is winding down a peacekeeping force, that looks to have been a bad bet.Similarly, despite being critical of Chinese trade policy, Macron in 2020 unwisely succumbed to German persuasion to support the EU’s bilateral investment agreement with China. The deal, now mercifully suspended, caused dismay across the EU and within Joe Biden’s incoming administration in the US for making Europe look weak.Indeed, Macron’s sceptical attitude to the US suggests he is overly animated by French interests, particularly the Aukus episode. Given Biden’s foreign policy vacillations and the possibility of another Donald Trump presidency, he is right about the risks from reflexive Atlanticism. But other European countries such as the Baltic states are not confident the EU, with its limited trade and financial sanctions instruments, can take over. The US is Russia’s main interlocutor in this week’s talks in Geneva on European security: the EU institutions are not invited. Support from other member states for France’s fury over the Aukus deal was slow and muted.Second, France is often too politically vulnerable domestically to wield trade as an effective strategic weapon. A slightly childish but symbolically unequivocal way to punish Australia over Aukus would have been to complete the EU’s nearly finished bilateral trade deal with New Zealand, a country that bans nuclear submarines from its ports, while blocking a parallel Australian agreement. But both countries are beef exporters, France’s presidential election is coming up and the country’s cattle farmers are notoriously noisy. Paris has elected to delay both deals until it’s someone else’s problem.Notably, the “strategic autonomy” slogan started life as “open strategic autonomy”, but France last year argued vehemently for dropping even an abstract reference to free trade. There is concern among other member states that the anti-coercion tool that France strongly backs will end up being used for protectionist rather than strategic purposes.Finally, to realise its ambitions for the EU, France needs Germany on board. Macron may have been soft on Russia and China but Germany has hitherto proved mushy to the point of liquefaction. German industry has criticised Lithuania’s defiance towards Beijing and is lobbying against decoupling from China. Earlier this week, Philippe Léglise-Costa, France’s ambassador to the EU, sounded distinctly lukewarm about a confrontation over Lithuania. He told a Brussels seminar that, while member states should show solidarity with Vilnius, the EU should pursue any violations of trade law through the usual channels at the World Trade Organization and seek a negotiated solution.French cavalry charges have historically been magnificent to watch, but in an EU context they are more often heralded than executed. The case for centralising some strategic power in the EU is strong. But Macron’s ability to deliver will require more European unity and French domestic resilience than are currently on display.
257  The head of the International Energy Agency has accused Russia of throttling gas supplies to Europe at a time of “heightened geopolitical tensions”, implying that Moscow has manufactured an energy crisis for political ends.Fatih Birol said on Wednesday that the IEA believed Russia was holding back at least one-third of the gas it could send to Europe, while depleting Russian-controlled storage facilities on the continent to bolster the impression of tight supplies.“We believe there are strong elements of tightness in the European gas market due to Russia’s behaviour,” Birol said. “I would note that today’s low Russian gas flows to Europe coincide with heightened geopolitical tensions over Ukraine.”Birol added: “Russia could increase deliveries to Europe by at least one-third — this is the key message.”The comments from Birol are his most pointed yet on Russia’s role in the energy crisis. They come as households in Europe expect steep increases in energy bills after wholesale gas and electricity prices hit record levels.Russia has stationed about 100,000 troops close to the Ukrainian border, leading the US and its allies to warn of tough sanctions on Moscow if President Vladimir Putin invades Ukraine.Moscow is holding talks with Nato and the US this week over European security.Russia has insisted that it has fulfilled its long-term gas supply contracts to Europe, but has been accused by policymakers and analysts of holding back supplies by restricting spot sales. Birol said Russian gas exports to Europe were down by 25 per cent year on year in the last three months of 2021.Gazprom, Russia’s state-backed gas company, wants to win approval for the start up of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany, which has been built as an alternative to transit routes through Ukraine.The US has long been concerned that Russia will use the pipeline as a way to put pressure on Kyiv.US officials warned Moscow that it would pay a heavy cost economically, including on energy, if it invaded Ukraine.“While Europe does need Russian natural gas, Russia also depends on European consumers,” a senior Biden administration official told reporters on Wednesday.“If Putin weaponises energy supply, he’s very likely to stiffen the resolve of Europe to find more reliable supplies from elsewhere. And that would further degrade Russia’s growth potential and its ability to exert influence.”The White House on Wednesday backed legislation introduced by senior Democrats in the US Senate to impose hefty economic, financial and trade sanctions on Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine, including targeting Russian banks, financial transactions, sovereign debt and the oil and gas sector, as well as the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov rejected the IEA’s claims and accused Birol of trying to “politicise the issue”.“There’s no trace of Ukraine in this,” Peskov said. “Russia is strictly fulfilling its obligations. Russia is ready to supply as much gas as people are willing to buy, but no more,” he told the Financial Times. Gazprom did not immediately comment.The IEA, which is funded by the OECD, was formed to bolster energy security after the Arab oil embargoes of the 1970s. Birol said European countries, including the UK, needed to prepare for future crises by securing additional gas storage to help loosen any country’s influence over the market at times of stress.He singled out Gazprom’s role in reducing the volume of stored gas in the EU.“The current storage deficit in the EU is largely due to Gazprom,” Birol said, pointing out storage is at about 50 per cent of capacity compared with 70 per cent normally in January.“The low levels of storage in the company’s EU-based facilities account for half of the EU deficit even though Gazprom storage only accounts for 10 per cent of the EU’s total storage capacity,” he added.Letter in response to this article:Europe’s energy crisis should not be blamed on Gazprom / From Professor Jonathan, Stern Distinguished Research Fellow, Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, EU Speaker for the EU-Russia Gas Advisory Council 2011-15
258  The writer is assistant professor of Japanese history at Columbia UniversityUntil recently, I was hopeful that the travel bans introduced last year in response to the Covid pandemic would be quickly reversed. But since the discovery of the Omicron variant, the prospects for international travel look increasingly uncertain.To understand a future of successive virus strains, it helps to look to the past. Two hundred years ago, the cordon sanitaire was the world’s first international travel bubble. This network of permanent quarantine stations was designed to protect Europe from infectious diseases circulating in Africa and Asia. Every traveller entering from these continents had to quarantine for up to a month at designated ports along the Mediterranean coastline, either waiting onboard ship in harbour or in a purpose-built lazaretto (quarantine hotel).Many 19th-century quarantine protocols seem exotic to us. As Alex Chase-Levenson’s book, The Yellow Flag, makes clear, in place of hand sanitiser, coins, letters and even people were dipped in vinegar to cleanse them of plague. At one point it was common for travellers to be “fumigated” — stripped naked and locked in a room with burning herbs until they came close to asphyxiation. Still, the history of Europe’s cordon sanitaire offers useful lessons.The first is an alarming one: the quarantine protocol lasted for more than 50 years from the late 18th century, with rules growing ever stricter and more elaborate. That bodes ominously. The second is that the cordon had the effect of carving the world into distinct zones, depending on how well countries were perceived to be managing public health. Ironically, this time it’s more likely that Europe will be branded the diseased zone and Asia the clean one. While most western countries have taken only token measures to slow its spread, those in Asia-Pacific have proved far more successful in suppressing virus strains. China, which has the world’s strictest quarantine controls, has barely reopened its borders. When Omicron was first discovered, Japan — which had just started to reopen after suppressing the Delta variant — slammed the gates shut again.Third, 19th-century quarantine rules were non-negotiable and mandatory: whether in a private suite or crammed into a communal cell, no one could buy their way out. Unlike now, there were no stricter requirements for non-citizens. Compared to these double-standards, the strictures of the lazarettos look positively enlightened.A fourth lesson is more encouraging. European governments co-operated closely in enforcing the cordon sanitaire. The boards of health in different port cities co-ordinated with each other and diplomatic consuls inspected quarantine facilities regularly. Even at the height of the Napoleonic War, the British navy loaned ships to serve as floating lazarettos for French troops returning from Egypt. The cordon arguably helped create the world’s first international public health organisation.Now, the world lacks this kind of co-operation. The World Health Organization plays a valuable role in pooling scientific research but has no enforcement powers, so its guidelines are toothless and its longstanding policy against travel bans widely ignored. Efforts to establish travel bubbles have been conducted largely on a bilateral basis, with East Asian governments particularly reticent to open up travel corridors. But if even Britain and Napoleonic France could unite to fight bubonic plague, surely Japan and China can look past their own disagreements?Standardising quarantine protocols might help to create a common Covid-free zone encompassing large parts of East Asia and the Pacific. It could also lead the way to a fairer quarantine policy that doesn’t discriminate on the basis of nationality. In the face of a virus that will continue to mutate aggressively, it might just be the least bad option.
259  My father’s aged brown passport is still in good condition. “Deutsches Reich” it says on the front, alongside a swastika-bearing eagle. Inside, there is a large red letter J, while the word “Israel” has been inserted between my father’s first name, Heinz, and surname, Ebner. This is, to be clear, the passport of a Jew.It was used when Heinz (later Henry), aged two, left Vienna in 1939. He arrived in the UK with his parents, Berthold and Margarethe, a fortnight before war broke out, settling in rural Norfolk. Berthold had spent 14 horrific months in two Nazi camps, Buchenwald and Dachau, for refusing to show propaganda films at the cinemas the family owned. Most of the relations they left behind were murdered.Last week, I received a brand new European passport. It’s burgundy — unlike the new British ones — and bears the word “Reisepass”, along with the Austrian eagle. I now have that highly prized right, European citizenship — and mixed feelings about it. Is this my reward for my father having to flee his birthplace?In September 2019, the Austrian parliament approved an amendment to the nationality act. Those eligible — people persecuted under the Nazi regime and their direct descendants — could apply for citizenship once it came into effect, September 1 2020.I had never imagined becoming Austrian, until Brexit. My father, then in his 80s, was keen to help, particularly so his grandchildren could gain EU citizenship.Unsurprisingly, our family’s experience is not unique. Of the 17,000 who had applied for Austrian citizenship through the amendment by September 2021, 3,000 were British. According to the Association of Jewish Refugees, this is the joint highest number, alongside those from Israel.The amendment appears to reflect a change in attitudes. For decades, Austrian society was dominated by the sense that, rather than welcoming the Germans after the Anschluss (annexation) in 1938, Austria was the first “victim” of Nazism. While Germany openly acknowledged and apologised for its centrality in what had occurred, Austria was reluctant to admit any culpability.The small — but growing — Jewish community had been pushing for the change for years. The existing law, as Benjamin Nägele, general secretary of the Jewish Community of Vienna, says, “had many flaws”, including the right to citizenship being restricted to descendants of male survivors. It was Sebastian Kurz, then chancellor (he quit after allegations of corruption), who made the difference, talking of reconciliation and forgiveness. He is just 35, and part of a new generation. “Kurz was pushing for it very strongly,” says Ruvi Ziegler, an associate professor in international refugee law at Reading university. “He is young and grew up in a different time.”Nägele points out that the coalition government’s amendment passed unanimously, reflecting “a change of mindset within political society”. He adds: “It’s an injustice finally made right, a historic decision, and an emotional one. This new generation was willing and able to ask and answer difficult questions.” That mindset is illustrated also by last year’s introduction of a national strategy for combating anti-Semitism. Meanwhile, in November 2021, a public memorial containing the names of the more than 64,440 Austrian Jews killed in the Holocaust went on display in Vienna.Ziegler, who is researching the post-Brexit reacquisition of European citizenship by British Jews, is intrigued that Austria’s political shift is not echoed elsewhere. “There’s a degree that Austria is coming very belatedly to terms with its past,” he explains, “but it’s happening at the same time as Poland is doing the reverse, shutting down any suggestion of involvement with the Nazi era. This is Austria specific, not a general trend.”My father and his parents were given the opportunity to return to Vienna after the war, but chose not to. My grandparents felt it would be better for my father to grow up in Britain: I hope they would be proud to see their three Jewish grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.My father died in October 2020, before regaining his Austrian citizenship, but he had told me it was as if things had come full circle. “It’s a kind of restitution,” he explained. I think that means we should accept our new European passports as our right, and all they might offer us.
260  US technology stocks rose on Tuesday after a sell-off in the $22tn Treasury bond market finally ran out of steam, as Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell made assurances that the central bank would act to curb inflation before it gets out of control.In an appearance before the Senate banking committee on Tuesday, Powell said high inflation had taken a “toll” and the central bank would act to prevent it from “becoming entrenched”.But Powell also reaffirmed that the central bank expected inflation to peak in the middle of the year, suggesting a dramatic increase in interest rates may not be necessary.That disrupted a recent sell-off in Treasuries which began last week and accelerated alongside minutes revealed last week from the Fed’s December meeting that signalled a more hawkish tone at the central bank.The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note dipped 0.02 percentage points to 1.74 per cent, after trading above 1.8 per cent on Monday. The yield on the two-year Treasury note, which closely tracks interest rate expectations, was roughly steady at 0.89 per cent. Earlier in the trading day it briefly rose to 0.94 per cent, its highest level since February 2020.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index rallied 1.4 per cent, its biggest rise in three weeks. The index had briefly dropped into correction territory on Monday before recovering to end the session roughly unchanged.The broad-based S&P 500 stock index rose 0.9 per cent, while its information technology sub-index gained 1.2 per cent.In Asia, equities followed Wall Street higher as tech shares rebounded in the wake of the Fed chair’s comments. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Tech index rose 4.3 per cent, while China’s CSI 300 index of Shanghai and Shenzhen-listed shares gained 1 per cent and Japan’s Topix rose 1.6 per cent.Tech stocks, and especially high-growth tech stocks, are particularly sensitive to inflation and the prospect of higher interest rates. Their valuations, which are often based on profits not expected for many years or even decades, have been propped up by low interest rates. The sudden jump in rates has in turn knocked much of the sector.“I think the market was comforted by (Powell) saying that he will act if he needs to, but he also confirmed his view that the Fed expects inflation to peak mid-year. So that is, on balance, a fairly benign perspective,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco.Markets have struggled to establish a direction in recent days as traders debated whether inflation had crested and how aggressively the Fed would act to reverse it. Tuesday’s move lower in yields may not last, some investors said.Following a better than expected drop in the US unemployment rate last week, and ahead of monthly consumer price figures due on Wednesday, traders now expect the Fed to lift rates by a quarter-point in March.“Its all about the Fed now and nothing else really matters,” said Hani Redha, portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments.The central bank has begun to wind down its pandemic-era stimulus policies. It has reduced the $120bn monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities that were started in March 2020, and is preparing to reduce its $9tn balance sheet. Powell on Tuesday said the US economy no longer “needs or wants” these “highly accommodative” policies.Economists polled by Bloomberg expect Wednesday’s inflation report to show US consumer prices rose 0.4 per cent in December, and 7 per cent year over year.Europe’s regional Stoxx 600 share index added 0.8 per cent, having fallen 1.5 per cent on Monday, in its worst daily performance since November.
261  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.The German Greens have certainly lost the first round in defining the EU’s rule book of what constitutes a green investment — and the final round, though delayed by another week, seems unlikely to be a win either, as gas and nuclear are there to stay. We’ll explore how this battle was lost and where things are likely to go from here.On the Russia-Ukraine front, another round of talks takes place today at the Nato headquarters in Brussels — and the US seems very keen to make a point of debriefing all possible EU counterparts who have not been included in the discussions.And with the new coalition government in the Netherlands having been sworn in on Monday, we look at their spending plans and what independent bodies are calculating it will translate to in terms of budget deficit and debt.Brussels’ tortured negotiations over its green labelling rules will be extended by another week, prolonging the recriminations that have surrounded the so-called “taxonomy on sustainable finance”, writes Mehreen Khan in Brussels.The European Commission’s consultation over its draft taxonomy rules was due to end today but has been prolonged to January 21, allowing a group of independent experts and member states more time to provide their feedback on the controversial treatment of nuclear energy and gas.A leaked copy of the draft, first reported by the FT, sparked uproar from environmental campaigners and some member states for including nuclear power and natural gas under the green label. The taxonomy is designed to help guide private capital to truly sustainable economic activity to stamp out “greenwashing”. Germany’s green economy minister Robert Habeck was one of the earliest critics of the draft, using a press conference yesterday to repeat his opposition. “We wouldn’t have needed the second delegated act. The first act was good, it didn’t require the inclusion of nuclear and gas,” he said.The taxonomy is proving to be an early test of the new coalition’s unity and the Greens’ resolve. The Greens’ coalition partner, the liberal FDP, celebrated the commission’s text, calling gas a vital transitional energy for a country that is weaning itself off nuclear power.Officials have told Europe Express that Berlin may abstain during a member state vote on the taxonomy due in the coming months. The abstention will have little impact on the approval of the legislation, which has the support of a supermajority of member states.But strains over the taxonomy could be a foreshadowing of broader splits between the traffic light trio on related EU topics.Chief among them is the debate on how to reform the EU’s budget rules — where the Greens have pushed for a softer position on the treatment of debt and deficit limits. That’s in contrast to the hawkish FDP who run the finance ministry. The FT reports today on how commission officials are trying to heal rifts between frugal northerners and the south over the upcoming reform of the Stability and Growth Pact.And before MEPs and member states have their say on the taxonomy, it will first have to pass through the college of commissioners. Johannes Hahn, EU budget and human resources commissioner, told Europe Express he has “strong reservations” about the safety, security and economics of nuclear power.Austria and Luxembourg have said they will sue the commission over the rules in protest at the inclusion of nuclear power. Hahn, an Austrian, echoed Vienna’s opposition and warned the taxonomy opens the door for “nuclear operations to continue well beyond 2050, which in my view is no longer a transition”.Inflation in the world’s rich economies has hit a 25-year high, fuelling concerns about the rising cost of living and increasing pressure on central banks to raise interest rates. The annual pace of consumer price growth in the OECD group of developed nations hit 5.8 per cent in November according to data released yesterday, up from just 1.2 per cent in the same month the previous year and the highest rate since May 1996. (More here)Talks between Russia and western allies to avert further Russian aggression against Ukraine move to Brussels today, with a meeting of the Nato-Russia Council, the first time this group has met since 2019, writes Ben Hall in Brussels.The discussion at Nato’s headquarters on the outskirts of the Belgian capital is the second in a sequence of three meetings this week intended to de-escalate tensions and address Russia’s security concerns.With some leaders fretting about the lack of an EU voice in potentially critical deliberations about Europe’s security, US officials are busting every sinew to inform and consult with their partners — and to make sure their outreach efforts are recognised.Wendy Sherman, US deputy secretary of state, flew from Geneva to Brussels before dawn yesterday to brief Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg, followed by Nato ambassadors about the eight hours of talks she held the previous day with her Russian counterpart Sergei Ryabkov in the Swiss city. She then addressed a meeting of envoys from the EU’s 27 member states.The White House even issued a lengthy list of occasions when US officials consulted European partners during the past three months in relation to the Ukraine crisis.Moscow may be trying to undermine western unity by snubbing the EU, but Julianne Smith, the US ambassador to Nato, said Washington’s efforts had forged “widespread consensus” within the alliance.“Not a single ally is willing to budge or negotiate anything when it comes to Nato’s open door policy,” she said, referring to Moscow’s top demand for a ban on further Nato expansion. “I feel quite good about it,” she said.After Monday’s leg, Ryabkov said Russia could walk away from talks if the west continued to reject its red lines.The Nato-Russia Council begins at 10am Brussels time, with Stoltenberg scheduled to hold a press conference at 13:30. Before she leads the US delegation at the Nato talks, Sherman will also meet Stefano Sannino, secretary-general of the EU’s diplomatic service.The Netherlands’ new but remarkably familiar four-party coalition government was formally inaugurated this week, marking a decisive shift in the country’s approach to public spending, writes Mehreen Khan.After years of fiscal probity, the new Dutch government has promised to spend big on housing, education, defence and climate — reversing liberal prime minister Mark Rutte’s longstanding support for market forces and a small state.The shift towards looser fiscal policy was confirmed yesterday by the Netherlands’ independent bureau for economic policy (CPB) which crunched the numbers on the government’s spending plans.According to the CPB’s projections, the Netherlands’ debt-to-GDP ratio will rise to 56 per cent by 2025 — skirting below the EU’s 60 per cent ceiling. That’s compared to a baseline of 54 per cent without the promised spending blitz. The budget deficit will deteriorate from 0.7 per cent to 2.7 per cent of GDP in 2025 — also just within the EU’s 3 per cent limit.The numbers are relatively modest when compared to the Netherlands’ EU neighbours but striking when contrasted to decades of Dutch frugality.To hammer home the point, the CPB notes that over the long run, the country’s debt burden will climb by up to 65 percentage points by 2060 — handily illustrated in this alarmist chart below where a bright pink bar is quite literally falling off the edge of the page (below).Dutch largesse will be cheered on in southern EU capitals, but probably shouldn’t be confused for a broader Dutch U-turn on the importance of fiscal responsibility.The fact that the big spending government is choosing to stay strictly within the EU’s debt and deficit limits means the new coalition will still be flying the flag for frugality in Brussels for years to come.
262  There were two reasons for France’s defence industry to celebrate when the United Arab Emirates agreed to buy 80 Rafale fighters from Dassault Aviation last month.First, it was sweet revenge for the humiliation last autumn when Australia walked away from a submarine deal in favour of an alliance with the US. There must have been a frisson of satisfaction in Paris when Abu Dhabi, days after agreeing to buy the French fighter, suspended talks with the US on the purchase of Lockheed Martin’s F-35.Second, the UAE’s order — worth an estimated €14bn — will guarantee production of the Rafale through to 2031, as well as work for more than 400 French companies in the supply chain.It will also help fund France’s investment in future upgrades to the Rafale, which is now expected to be in service through the 2050s.Yet, while the deal has a lot going for it from a French perspective, it risks destabilising Europe’s efforts at defence collaboration. For it strengthens Dassault’s hand in the still-troublesome negotiations with Airbus’s German-based defence division over Europe’s proposed Future Combat Air System (FCAS).The last time Dassault — and by extension the French defence ministry — felt it wasn’t getting what it needed from a European fighter programme, it walked away. The result was Dassault’s Rafale.Launched in 2017 by former German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Emmanuel Macron, FCAS was an overtly political project. It showed both countries’ determination to bolster Europe’s sovereign military capability after Britain’s exit from the EU. In 2019, Spain joined the programme.The problems began when politicians handed it to industry. From the start, it was marked by squabbling over technology sharing and leadership of the most critical parts of the programme. The fighting was exacerbated by fundamentally different ideas of what collaboration meant.“French collaboration is making sure you get the most effective output,” generally under French leadership, says one European defence executive. “In Germany, it is partly about the best athlete, but also about industrial workshare.”The project also forced together two bitter rivals — Dassault and Airbus Defence and Space. But last year it seemed Europe’s political ambitions had gained the upper hand. A deal on basic principles was struck and industrial agreements were reached on six of the project’s seven pillars, spanning manned and unmanned aircraft, space and terrestrial communications, cutting-edge stealth technologies, artificial intelligence and more.But divisions remain on the seventh pillar — the next-generation fighter jet itself — and there is no sign of imminent compromise.Both sides have logical reasons for digging in their heels. Dassault, standard bearer of France’s sovereignty in combat aircraft, argues it needs to develop and manage the crucial flight-control system itself, for example. But Germany understandably expects its industry to have access to the technology, having pledged billions for the project.It is in this context that the UAE’s Rafale deal could tilt the balance, argues Francis Tusa, consultant and editor of Defence Analysis newsletter. “It has changed the equation,” he says. “France no longer needs Germany. The profits they get from the UAE deal will finance upgrades to Rafale.”“The days for the project are numbered unless the Germans understand where they are in the pecking order,” Tusa adds. “They are not equals in industrial capability.”Meanwhile, the new German government’s plans to codify into law the country’s tougher restrictions on arms exports — potentially limiting them to just Nato and the EU — is adding to tensions. Such constraints on exports “would be a deal killer”, said one French defence executive.It would be a significant blow to Europe’s defence ambitions if France chose to walk away again from a European fighter. It would be a failure, too, for Macron, who has prioritised collaboration during France’s presidency of the EU. But presidential elections are looming in April and the Dassault family does not just control a key French defence company. It owns the politically influential Le Figaro newspaper.Ultimately, while only politicians on both sides can resolve the stand off, that may have to wait until France goes to the polls. But the longer the stalemate continues, the greater the risk for Europe that its latest test case of co-operation begins to fall apart.
263  Just days after they arrived, Russian troops are said to be preparing to withdraw from Kazakhstan, as President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev declared that an “attempted coup d’état” had been averted. Russian military withdrawals are not always what they seem; on the borders of Ukraine, Moscow’s soldiers left a lot of equipment in place despite supposedly being ordered back to their bases last spring. Either way, the violent unrest of recent days, in which at least 164 people have reportedly been killed and almost 8,000 arrested, signals lasting shifts in the central Asian republic, and the broader ex-Soviet space.Most important are the signs of a more co-ordinated, Moscow-led pushback against anti-government uprisings. In Georgia in 2003, and in Ukraine in 2004 and 2014, these led to pro-democracy and pro-western governments taking power. In Belarus in 2020 and now in Kazakhstan, however, the Kremlin has helped to prop up authoritarian leaders who faced uprisings, backing brutal crackdowns — verbally and financially in the former and militarily in the latter.President Vladimir Putin this week drew a line in the sand, vowing that a Moscow-led security alliance would protect allies from “colour revolutions” which he blamed, as ever, on western meddling. The emergence of the Collective Security Treaty Organization — a six-strong grouping of ex-Soviet republics — as the enforcement arm of this policy is a key development from the Kazakh unrest. This is the first time the bloc has played such a role since its creation in the 1990s. It has previously rejected requests for security help from Kyrgyzstan and Armenia, suggesting their problems were internal matters.The reliance of the Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko and of Kazakhstan’s Tokayev on Russian support to cling on to power dilutes both countries’ sovereignty. It bolsters Putin’s key objective of rebuilding Russia’s sphere of influence. But it creates risks too, for them and for Moscow.Using violence and mass arrests can deter future protests and strand organisers in jail. But failure to address underlying causes of unrest — in Kazakhstan, gaping socio-economic inequalities that have developed despite an overall post-Soviet rise in living standards — only drives it below ground. From there it may bubble up, potentially with more force, in the future. As ruling regimes become more hardline, so they become more brittle.Kazakhstan also provides a cautionary tale that “managed successions” are tricky to pull off. Nursultan Nazarbayev, 81, the ex-Soviet apparatchik who ran the republic for three decades, anointed Tokayev as his successor in 2019 but remained head of the security council and Elbasy, or “leader of the nation”. It remains unclear whether, as some suggest, an elite power struggle underlay the protests. But when they escalated, Tokayev quickly distanced himself, publicly, from Nazarbayev. He removed the ex-president from the security council and detained a key ally, secret police chief Karim Massimov, on suspicion of treason. Nazarbayev’s whereabouts are unclear, though a spokesman has said he is still in the capital, Nur-Sultan.Putin himself seemed to consider a Nazarbayev-style manoeuvre, before changing Russia’s constitution to allow him to remain president until 2036. Even then, however, he will one day have to find an exit. If his authoritarian peers are already having to rely on arrests, intimidation and military help to preserve their own regimes, Kremlin hopes of a peaceful continuation of the Putin system once its creator moves on look ever more of a stretch.
264  Stripping out certain categories of public debt from national budgets would damage transparency and overcomplicate EU rules on countries’ borrowing limits, a senior Brussels policymaker has warned amid a fierce debate in European capitals over how to overhaul the current regime.Johannes Hahn, the EU’s human resources and budget commissioner, said he was opposed to carving out climate spending and other strategic expenditures from the EU’s public debt calculations, insisting that member states must focus on reducing their indebtedness.“I am not supporting any ideas [to] exclude certain kinds of debts, qualifying them as good ones, sustainable ones, green ones etc. At the end of the day, debt is debt,” Hahn told the Financial Times, calling instead for member states to face regular “stress tests” of their public finances.European Commission officials are working on bridging a rift between northern and southern member states as part of a consultation on overhauling the EU’s Stability and Growth Pact rules. The rules, which are designed to ensure fiscal discipline, were suspended during the pandemic. Euro area finance ministers are due to discuss the topic in Brussels on Monday.French president Emmanuel Macron, who holds the EU’s rotating presidency, and Italian prime minister Mario Draghi last month argued that “key spending for the future” should be incentivised under a revised set of rules.EU economics commissioner Paolo Gentiloni has also said he supports “renewed and reviewed” budget rules to incentivise green and digital spending. Executive vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis, who with Gentiloni is overseeing the consultation, has insisted that member states will still need to offer “credible” plans to cut their debt even if they get extra leeway for green investments.In contrast, Hahn, who is Austria’s commissioner and a member of the centre-right European People’s party, reflects the traditional view in frugal northern states such as the Netherlands, Nordics, and Baltics. There, fiscal conservatives are wary of allowing swaths of public spending to be incentivised under a so-called “golden rule” principle.Hahn, who is in charge of the EU’s human resources and its seven-year budget, signalled he was open to changes to the pact that would ensure a “country-specific, tailor-made road map” to public debt reduction. But he warned that countries should not assume that favourable borrowing costs would last forever.“The commission has to be tough in monitoring, checking and taking remedial action in case the road map is not respected,” he said. “In terms of transparency, it is obvious that we should have a clear picture of the situation of each member state.” Hahn’s stance is an early sign of the tussles between fiscally conservative commissioners and more reform-minded ones. Brussels aims to put forward its SGP reform proposals this summer.The current rules do not permit states to routinely disregard broad categories of green or other strategic spending when assessing compliance with EU targets. Capitals and the commission are debating whether rigorous definitions can be found for public spending projects and categories that might benefit from more favourable treatment.French officials say they want to incentivise growth-enhancing investment in strategic areas, such as the green and digital transitions.Pascal Canfin, a French MEP from Macron’s En Marche party, said a compromise could involve placing a cap on the green spending exempt from debt and deficit calculations.Canfin said an annual limit of 1 per cent of a country’s gross domestic product was a suitable figure to help plug the “green investment gap” needed to meet the EU’s ambitious target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.He said the commission should be allowed to select green spending projects submitted by member states that can be exempted from the SGP every year.“We need a cap that is politically acceptable for all countries on what spending gets special treatment,” Canfin told the FT. “If we inject 1 per cent of GDP per year it makes a clear difference and can start a virtuous investment cycle.” Letter in response to this article:Brussels mantra hinders essential investment / From James Hanshaw, Zurich, Switzerland
265  The writer is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a think-tankWhen Sweden’s Navy tried to hunt down a suspected enemy submarine in the Stockholm archipelago eight years ago, its efforts were ridiculed by Russian media and officials, who trolled their armed forces chief and accused him of pursuing a “phantom” vessel. Since then, hostile states including Russia, China and Iran have increased their use of disinformation and online propaganda to amplify anti-vax sentiment and foment political tensions in Europe and the US. Concerned about the potential for this to undermine democracy, Sweden has just launched an agency for psychological defence. Other countries would do well to follow its example.Mikael Tofvesson, head of the new agency’s operative division, says aggressors are increasingly trying to sow division by targeting areas of public concern such as crime, Covid vaccinations, the government’s response to the pandemic, and immigration. “These are low-intensity campaigns that are constantly in operation, and when a specific issue is in the news the activity increases,” he tells me.As many countries have found, the pandemic has spawned a new breed of disinformation, which has spread as rampantly as the virus. This is not only from usual suspects but also from new actors, who are copying Moscow and Beijing’s methods. Private sector organisations are using a commercial offering known as “disinformation as a service” to conduct malign influence operations against their competitors.The results are alarmingly obvious. Disputes about Covid-19 and the vaccines to fight it are already dividing populations. And just as the minority of people who refuse vaccines undermine wider efforts to stamp out the virus, a minority of citizens can ruin their countries’ resilience against adversaries by believing the damaging falsehoods spread by the other side. The rumour unleashed by Russia’s KGB in the 1980s that the US army created HIV — which is still in circulation now — shows the lasting harm of an eye-catching campaign. The Covid pandemic has been fuelled by the fact many people believe anti-vax disinformation and distrust messaging from their own governments. Just imagine the effect that incendiary disinformation could have on the current stand-off between Russia and Nato.Public trust in the government is the Achilles heel of western democracies seeking to defend themselves against innovative adversaries. Disinformation aimed at weakening public confidence in its military forces or political leadership can have a potent destabilising effect. The US’s deep social and ideological divisions may be rooted in its domestic political history, but Moscow’s disinformation campaign ahead of the 2016 presidential election helped to sow doubt about America’s democratic institutions.The Swedish Psychological Defence Agency will monitor malign influence by exposing both the aggressors and their methods. I believe it should go further, by launching information counter-strikes against the offending country’s ruling elite. In future, Nato and its allies could respond to disinformation campaigns by revealing some of the overseas properties owned by senior officials in the hostile country.But as with Covid, the most important task in psychological defence is to inoculate the population against believing false information — a job that Sweden’s new agency will also handle. This involves teaching the public how to verify information. A citizenry able to distinguish truth from falsehoods is vital, not just from a national security perspective but for protection from more everyday threats such as quack cures peddled on the internet.Other countries, too, should show they’re serious about fighting the disinformation virus and immunising against it. Otherwise it will undermine our societies and render even the most sophisticated military defences useless.
266  The World Health Organization said countries were “a way off” from treating coronavirus as endemic as a top official warned that more than half of the European population could be infected with Omicron within the next two months.Hans Kluge, the WHO’s regional director for Europe, said that “because of the unprecedented scale of transmission” Europe was now seeing rising rates of hospitalisation.“It is challenging health systems and service delivery in many countries where Omicron has spread at speed and threatens to overwhelm many more,” he said.Many European countries have registered record caseloads in recent weeks, although hospitalisations have been lower than in previous waves because of the impact of vaccines and prior infection.He added that, if cases continued to spread at the current rate, more than half of the European population would be infected with Omicron in the next six to eight weeks.Catherine Smallwood, senior emergencies officer at WHO Europe, said that while coronavirus might become endemic “in due course”, making that change in 2022 was “a little bit difficult”.She was speaking after Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez on Monday called for a change in approach that would accept that coronavirus had become endemic.“We are heading towards an endemic illness rather than the pandemic it’s been up to now,” Sánchez told Spain’s Cadena Ser radio. “We have to respond to this situation with new tools that are linked more closely to vaccination, to protection through masks, to institutional co-operation, the contribution of science and international solidarity.”But Smallwood said there needed to be “stable circulation of the virus at predictable levels and potentially known and predictable waves of epidemic transmission” before Covid could be treated as endemic.“What we’re seeing at the moment is nowhere near that,” she said.The move to endemic status depended largely on widespread vaccination on a globally equitable basis, but Smallwood said the world was “still a way off that” as well. About half of the WHO’s member states missed the 40 per cent Covid immunisation target for 2021, the health body has said.“Part of that is because of the virus continuing to evolve and Omicron having specific partial immune [evasion],” Smallwood said. “It causes epidemics and it causes a very rapid increase in the circulation of the virus. So we can’t call that an endemic state of disease.”Treating the virus as endemic, she added, would require evidence of stable rates of transmission so that countries do not have to rely on measures such as lockdowns and other restrictions to maintain stability.“We really need to hold back on behaving as if it is endemic before the virus itself is behaving as if it is endemic,” she said.In the two years since coronavirus was identified in Europe, governments have become increasingly aware of the political costs associated with any coronavirus-related restrictions.In Spain, that discontent was highlighted by the re-election victory last year of Isabel Díaz Ayuso, leader of the Madrid region, who had repeatedly pushed back against government attempts to impose more curbs. The country’s courts have also ruled against the emergency powers wielded by the government in 2020 and 2021, further reducing the tools at its disposal.“The situation is not what it was a year ago,” said Sánchez. “We know the virus better.as we wait for what studies say about Omicron, which, while more contagious, appears to be milder.”Spain says it has fully vaccinated more than 90 per cent of people aged 12 and older. But although its booster campaign has inoculated 70 per cent of those aged over 50, it has so far only covered 23 per cent of 40- to 49-year-olds and has yet to start for younger age groups.
267  Tackling sin stocks by targeting investors has been tried for tobacco and oil. What are the odds when it comes to gambling?Three industry veterans have decided to try their luck and are lobbying asset managers to put pressure on betting companies to change their ways.Fintan Drury, former chair of Paddy Power, has teamed up with co-founder Stewart Kenny and Ian Armitage, who was managing director of Mercury Private Equity, Paddy Power’s first institutional investor to form Stop Gambling Harm, targeting fund managers in the UK and Ireland.The men, who are no longer involved with Paddy Power — now part of Flutter — or gambling in any form, deny they are just trying to ease their consciences after profiting from the industry.“Legislators have shown themselves to be slow. It’s the institutional owners who have the power,” Drury said.While only in the early stages of talking to fund managers, Drury is confident the initiative will succeed because gambling will eventually become as toxic as tobacco for investors. Faced with the “inevitable” prospect of class action suits, “it’s in the owners’ own self-interest [to act]”, he said.“I’d like to think we’re out of business in a year’s time,” Drury added.Ireland, with a big horseracing industry and huge sports fan base, already had a pervasive gambling culture, with bookmakers on many high streets. But the problem has metastasised with online gambling. Ireland’s gamblers rack up some of the biggest losses per capita in the world and the government is in the process of overhauling decades-old gambling regulations. It promises that a long-delayed regulatory body will finally be in place in 2023.“It is long past the time when the state should have addressed this issue,” said Aphra Kerr and John O’Brennan, professors at Maynooth University, and Lucía Vázquez Mendoza, a researcher at Dublin City University, in a report. The gambling industry in Ireland was estimated in 2019 to be worth nearly €5bn — or as much as €8bn if the national lottery is included.In terms of regulation, the academics concluded that Ireland “now lags further behind other EU states than at any time in recent decades” and that “a coercive, rather than a persuasive approach, is more likely to reduce gambling harms”.Eoin Coyne, who has not placed a bet in eight years, could not agree more. He started betting on greyhound racing when he was 14, moving on to horses, soccer, hurling, Gaelic football and rugby, plus online poker.At the height of his addiction he would blow his week’s wages and once gambled away the deposit on a rental property. “I had no money and no space for anything else,” said Coyne, 33. “What I’d like to see is the focus on responsibility being on gambling companies.it’s a David and Goliath fight for an ordinary person with a gambling problem.”Advertising is one area where Stop Gambling Harm wants tougher rules. It also wants obligatory separation between sports bets and online casino gambling so that companies cannot try to lure players to roulette games while they are waiting for the soccer result to come in. Ireland has some 30,000 people with a gambling problem, according to official data.Stop Gambling Harm also wants tighter controls for under-25s and mandatory limits on how much players can spend. Ireland’s government says the independent regulator it plans to establish will have “powers to regulate advertising, gambling websites and apps”.“I think it’s an interesting strategy,” said Barry Grant, project manager at Extern Problem Gambling, an advocacy and counselling group, referring to the lobby campaign. “No industry can ever be trusted to regulate itself.”According to H2 Gambling Capital, which tracks betting worldwide, Ireland ranked third in per-capita losses in 2016. Data for 2020 show it fell to 14th but the consultancy said that the picture was distorted by the pandemic and without this Ireland would probably have ranked eighth to 10th.Companies say they are proactively addressing the problem. Conor Grant, Flutter UK and Ireland chief executive, said his group was “leading considerable change” in Ireland and plans to become the first operator to introduce mandatory spending limits for under-25s, as well as investing €3ma year by 2023 in addiction research, education and treatment.Covid-19 has fuelled a rise in online gambling and an increase in women players in a male-dominated customer base.The number of gamblers betting with Flutter, one of the world’s largest online gambling companies whose other brands include Sky Betting and Gaming, and Betfair, increased by nearly a fifth in the UK and Ireland in the third quarter of 2021. Total revenues grew 12 per cent.Coyne, who now works at a multinational medical devices company, worries that his “football crazy” seven-year-old son, will eventually start to notice the betting shop advertisements on hoardings around the pitch and on players’ shirts, two areas where the rules may soon be tightened in the UK.For Oisín McConville, 46, a former Gaelic football star from Northern Ireland, which has the highest prevalence of problem gambling in the UK, having to pull on a club shirt adorned with the logo of a new sponsor — a bookmaker — shortly after he emerged from his addiction treatment in 2006 was “demoralising”.Drury denies Stop Gambling Harm was set up to “salve our consciences” after the three men’s successful careers in a controversial industry. But he admitted: “We weren’t alive enough to the impact phone gambling and internet gambling could have on society.”McConville does not blame the bookmakers for his painful 15 year-long addiction. “But I look back now and think, in any other industry would this be allowed to happen?”
268  David Sassoli, president of the European parliament, has died at the age of 65. He was admitted to hospital in his native Italy on December 26 after a “dysfunction of his immune system”, his spokesperson said, and passed away at 1.15am on Tuesday morning.The Italian Democrat was elected in 2019 and was due to step down next week under a power-sharing deal with the centre-right European People’s party that divided the five-year presidential term between two parliamentary groupings.Politicians across the political spectrum paid tribute to the former journalist and centre-left MEP.Ursula von der Leyen, the centre-right president of the European Commission, wrote on Twitter in Italian: “I am deeply saddened by the death of a great European and Italian.“Sassoli was a passionate journalist, an extraordinary president of the European parliament and above all a dear friend.“My thoughts go out to his family. Rest in peace, dear David.”Frans Timmermans, European Commission vice-president, wrote: “David Sassoli, EP president and dear friend, has died. I’m at a loss for words. His kindness was an inspiration to all who knew him. My heartfelt sympathies to his family and all his loved ones. Addio amico mio.”The European parliament is the only directly elected EU body but its powers are dwarfed by those of the commission, which proposes most legislation, and the council of member states who have the final say. MEPs amend legislation, however, and have a role in setting the budget and approving top appointments.Sassoli continued to demand a greater role for the parliament and succeeded in getting a budget increase for its priorities such as vaccines for developing countries and the new European public prosecutor’s office.The parliament has also pushed the bloc towards ambitious climate targets and generally supports a greater role for Brussels in developing areas such as justice, health and defence.Sassoli recently launched legal action against the commission for failing to halt funding to Poland for alleged breaches of judges’ independence.Sassoli beat Sergei Stanishev, a former Bulgarian prime minister, and several other candidates to the job. He is likely to be succeeded by Roberta Metsola, a Maltese MEP selected by the EPP as its candidate for president.“I am heartbroken. Europe has lost a leader, I have a lost a friend, democracy has lost a champion,” she wrote on Twitter. “David Sassoli dedicated his life to making the world a better, fairer place.”Mario Draghi, Italy’s prime minister, expressed his condolences in a written statement, saying Sassoli was “a man of the institutions, a profound pro-European”, whose untimely and sudden was “shocking”.Born in Florence in 1956, Sassoli joined Italian national broadcaster RAI in 1992. He became a household name presenting the main evening news and was the broadcaster’s deputy director.He entered politics in 2009, joining the Democratic party, formed from the two principal parties of the left. He was elected to the European parliament the same year.During the coronavirus pandemic, he developed hybrid sessions with remote voting and temporarily scrapped the monthly commute for sessions in Strasbourg.Sassoli is survived by his wife Alessandra, and two children.
269  Russian troops will withdraw from Kazakhstan, the country’s president said, following a week of violent protests in which citizens demanded social and political change in the central Asian republic.Kazakhstan’s president Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who requested help from Russia last week after claiming the protests were a “coup d’état”, said on Tuesday that the Moscow-led military mission was complete and the contingent would leave the country within 10 days.His comments came amid signs that the worst unrest in Kazakhstan’s modern history was beginning to calm. Witnesses in Almaty, the country’s largest city, said that cafés were reopening and families were going out for walks, while Tokayev said the situation was stabilising.In his first move to rejig the government he sacked last week, Tokayev named Alikhan Smailov, an official from the previous regime, as the prime minister with the approval of parliament.The protests began as peaceful demonstrations against fuel price rises and the longtime rule of Nursultan Nazarbayev, the 81-year-old former president who stepped aside as the head of Kazakhstan’s security council last week when the violence began.Russia sent a peacekeeping mission from the Collective Security Treaty Organization bloc, consisting of 2,030 troops and 250 units of military equipment, to Kazakhstan to help quell what Tokayev called a terrorist threat with foreign influence.“The main mission of the CSTO peacekeeping forces has been successfully completed,” Tokayev said in an address to the country’s parliament. “In two days, a gradual withdrawal of the united CSTO peacekeeping contingent will begin. The process of the contingent withdrawal will take no more than 10 days.” On Monday, Vladimir Putin said that the Russian-led forces were securing critical infrastructure to “normalise the situation” and help “restore order to the country”, in comments that showed Moscow’s willingness to back allies in former Soviet states against street protests.Kazakhstan’s own special forces focused on Almaty, where the most violent clashes left more than 100 people dead.At least 164 people have been killed, including three children, and almost 8,000 people arrested in Kazakhstan, according to the country’s authorities.“One has to understand, when we made that decision, we were risking losing control of Almaty, which would have been given up to the terrorists for grilling. Having lost Almaty, we would have lost the capital and then the whole country,” Tokayev said, notably avoiding mentioning the capital, which was renamed from Astana to Nur-Sultan in 2019 to honour Nazarbayev.The name of the capital has been a source of debate in the past days, as protesters across the country demanded a break from the Nazarbayev era. Until last Wednesday, Nazarbayev still held effective power as head of the country’s security council, despite resigning from the presidency in 2019 after almost three decades in power.Analysts said that the appointment of Smailov, who served as finance minister and deputy foreign minister before becoming deputy prime minister under Tokayev, indicated the limited human resource to staff official positions, with little immediate changes in the country’s top echelons.“There are no others in Kazakhstan, they are all Nazarbayev people, just like Tokayev himself,” said Temur Umarov, a central Asia expert at Carnegie Endowment in Moscow. “We will be seeing a lot more of Nazarbayev’s people in important roles in the future. But they will be the ones Tokayev considers professionals, who are not financially linked to the Nazarbayev family and did not actively fawn under Nazarbayev.” Tokayev fired the previous prime minister Askar Mamin and his cabinet last week, conceding to the demands of protesters. He then appointed Smailov as acting prime minister while the dismissed government continued to function until further changes were made.
270  EU competition officials are preparing to block a $2bn merger between two of the world’s biggest shipbuilders in South Korea, the first time since 2019 that Brussels has decided to veto a corporate tie-up.Officials told the Financial Times that a proposed merger between Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering and Hyundai Heavy Industries would be stopped as anti-competitive. The decision is likely to be announced this week, said three people familiar with the matter.The European Commission declined to comment.The veto will be the first by the EU’s competition authorities since Brussels prevented a tie-up between India’s Tata Steel and Germany’s Thyssenkrupp more than two years ago over concerns it would drive up prices for consumers. The latest decision comes as energy prices have soared in Europe this winter, with freight costs for liquefied natural gas in Asia rising to record levels of more than $300,000 per day on surging global demand. The two South Korean companies dominate the market for making ships that carry super-chilled LNG.One EU official said blocking the merger would help protect European consumers from paying higher prices for LNG, which emits less carbon dioxide than coal but is still a source of greenhouse gas emissions.Ships carrying LNG to Asia have been rerouted to Europe, where consumers are willing to pay a premium for the fuel to generate electricity. The EU is the world’s third-largest importer of LNG.The proposed tie-up was first announced by Hyundai Heavy in 2019. Brussels had demanded that the companies provide remedies to limit concerns about preserving competition.The South Korean shipbuilders are significant suppliers to EU companies and represent about 30 per cent of global demand for cargo vessels, according to the commission.The two companies won new orders for 45 large LNG vessels out of the total of 75 last year, together commanding 60 per cent of the global market, according to industry tracker Clarksons Research.The merger has been approved by regulators in Singapore, China and Kazakhstan, but it needs the green light from the EU, Japan and South Korea for the deal to be completed.To address competition concerns, Hyundai Heavy had proposed not raising LNG vessel prices for the time being and transferring some technology to smaller domestic shipyards, according to industry officials.But the offer fell short, said the officials, adding that Hyundai Heavy had not made a formal proposal to address the EU’s request for other remedies.Hyundai Heavy said the EU should approve the merger unconditionally. “It is impossible to evaluate market dominance by just market share alone in the shipbuilding market and the market structure makes it difficult for a certain company to monopolise it,” the company said.Daewoo Shipbuilding declined to comment.
271  Google is making a last-ditch effort to change the EU’s incoming laws on Big Tech with a flurry of advertising, emails and targeted social media posts aimed at politicians and officials in Brussels.As EU policymakers put the finishing touches to the Digital Markets Act (DMA), executives at Google’s headquarters in Silicon Valley are stepping up their efforts to water down parts of the legislation that they fear may have a severe impact on their business.“Top executives in California have known about the DMA all along but they are only waking up now,” said one Google insider.The campaign includes direct lobbying by Google, but also by several trade associations that the search engine giant funds.Kim van Sparrentak, a Dutch MEP, said she had noticed a marked escalation in lobbying in recent weeks, with the message that curbing Google would harm small businesses.She said she had been invited to discuss her views with Google, at a time of her choosing, and had been invited to an event organised by the company on the benefits of digital marketing to small businesses.She was also lobbied by the Connected Commerce Council, whose partners include Google and Amazon, with a letter signed by small business owners saying: “Please don’t make it harder for my business.”Other MEPs and officials said their Twitter feeds had recently been filled with adverts from tech lobby groups on issues that Google particularly cares about. “My feed is on overdrive,” said one EU diplomat.One campaign against a proposed ban on targeted advertising, which appeared on Twitter and in the trade press, was led by IAB Europe.“I’m being targeted with a nearly unrecognisable ad aimed at EU officials promoting false info and solely referring to studies of IAB,” Alderik Oosthoek, a policy adviser at the European Parliament, wrote on Twitter.The DMA, which has made smooth progress so far through the EU parliament and is likely to come into force at the beginning of 2023, aims to curb the power of big tech “gatekeepers” — companies such as Google whose platforms dominate the online economy. Last week Germany’s competition watchdog formally defined Google as a “gatekeeper”, opening it up to more stringent domestic oversight.Google is concerned that the legislation will prevent it from promoting businesses that it owns, such as its travel and hospitality comparison services, on its search results pages, a practice known as “self-preferencing”.This could force Google to “change the design of general search pages fundamentally”, said Thomas Hoppner, at the law firm Hausfeld.The sense of urgency at Google has been compounded by a significant legal defeat late last year when the General Court in Luxembourg upheld a €2.42bn antitrust fine against the company for promoting its own shopping comparison service above its rivals in search results.In the weeks after the judgment, Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google’s parent company Alphabet, discussed the case and upcoming tech regulations with Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s digital and competition chief, in a virtual meeting.Separately, Kent Walker, Alphabet’s head of global affairs, held similar meetings with other high-level regulators, including Vera Jourova, the EU’s vice-president.Thomas Vinje, legal counsel at FairSearch, said the court ruling and DMA were a threat to Google because “its very business model depends upon disadvantaging competitors and advantaging its own services in its search results”.While it made some tweaks after the initial 2017 fine, Google has yet to implement any further changes to its search pages in light of the Luxembourg ruling, which it is expected to appeal against.Separately, Google is concerned about a proposed EU ban on targeted advertising being pushed by one bloc of MEPs, though the common position currently falls short of a full ban.“The MEPs’ position on targeted ads is crazy,” said one person close to Google, adding that such a ban would lead to more pop-up windows asking for consent.According to the EU’s transparency register, Google invested about €6m in lobbying-related activities in 2020 and it has roughly eight in-house lobbyists in Brussels, as well as retaining external lawyers and consultants. Last year, it was forced to apologise to Thierry Breton, the EU commissioner who is also responsible for digital regulation, after it emerged Google was orchestrating a plan to “push back” against him.The intense lobbying may not have its intended effect. “They are the bad guys at the moment,” said a parliamentary assistant involved in the DMA discussions. “Everything coming from them is a bit awkward and hard to justify why we would include it in the legislation.”Andreas Schwab, the MEP leading the DMA debate in parliament and a prominent longtime critic of Google, said the company’s efforts were “a little too late” to have a major impact.“I get a sense they are worried,” said Schwab, who met Google’s Walker a few weeks ago. “And they should be.”Google said: “We think people in Europe should be able to enjoy the best services that Google can build. It’s clear some of the proposals in the DMA and DSA [Digital Services Act] affect us directly and will have an impact on how we innovate our products in Europe. We care about getting the balance right, and we know our users and customers care too. Like many others, we’ve engaged openly and constructively with policymakers throughout the legislative process to put across our point of view.”Letter in response to this article:EU lawmakers must resist Big Tech’s blandishments / From Ursula Pachl, Deputy Director General, European Consumer Organisation (BEUC), Brussels, Belgium
272  As inflation threatens living standards across the developed world, governments are stepping in to lessen the blow for some of the lowest-paid workers — but their actions will only partially protect those most in need.Several European countries plan inflation-busting increases in their minimum wage in the year ahead.In Germany, successive increases will lift the minimum wage almost 10 per cent to €10.45 over the year to July and the new ruling coalition has pledged to raise it further to €12. In Portugal, Poland, the Czech Republic and Romania, the statutory wage floor rose 6 per cent or more from January. France, whose hourly minimum is already one of the highest among rich economies, will continue to uprate it in line with prices (inflation in December was at 3.4 per cent). In the UK, the statutory wage floor will rise 6.6 per cent in April.Meanwhile, the EU is planning draft legislation meant to ensure that minimum wages — where they apply — are high enough to be “adequate”, or at least 60 per cent of national median earnings.It is a striking reversal of the policies pursued on the eve of the 2008 financial crisis, when EU leaders issued an ill-timed call for wage restraint to prevent price pressures mounting.“This wouldn’t have happened a few years ago,” said Stefano Scarpetta, director of the OECD’s Employment, Labour and Social Affairs directorate. “This time, we are putting a lot of money into the economy and there is a concern it should go to those at the bottom end.”The trouble is, governments are relying too much on a single tool — minimum wages — which will protect only some of those who are vulnerable.Market forces are providing a tailwind, with labour shortages in some low-paying sectors forcing employers to compete for workers fiercely for the first time in years. In the US, although Joe Biden has not won support for his ambition to nearly double the federal minimum wage, salaries have risen fastest for those on the bottom rungs of the labour market — outpacing inflation over the past six months for the third of workers with the lowest earnings.But economists warn that action is needed on a much broader front to protect households from a painful cost of living crunch.A minimum wage was a good way to set a social norm, but “not a very targeted measure to fight poverty”, Scarpetta argued. Many of those receiving it live with a higher-earning partner and when the pay floor rises workers can often lose benefits or pay higher taxes as a result.A higher wage floor can also lead employers to hire people on shorter hours or less secure terms — for example, the liberal use of zero-hours contracts in the UK’s hospitality sector — and only affects those close to the bottom of the earnings distribution.“It only helps those who have the lowest pay. It’s not going to help create a middle class,” said Patrick Belser, senior economist at the International Labour Organization. Workers’ share of income would only rise in countries that also had effective collective bargaining arrangements, he said.Laurence Boone, chief economist at the OECD, argued that “traditionally, policies to address inequality have focused on skills and on wage-setting — minimum wages, collective bargaining”. But now, governments needed to look more closely at other issues, in particular competition policy, she said.New OECD research has found that as much as a third of overall wage inequality is due to gaps in the wages different companies pay for workers with similar skills. Workers are often unable to move even when better pay is on offer elsewhere because of restrictions imposed by their employers, such as non-compete contractual clauses.To remedy this would mean a legislative clampdown — as the US and UK governments have pledged to do — and requiring competition authorities to look at the effects of mergers on workers, as well as consumers.Stagnating living standards were “not the fault of the minimum wage”, Belser said. “It’s the absence of other policies.”
273  Talks will resume this week between the British government and the European Union over how to resolve the long-running dispute over trading arrangements for Northern Ireland that soured the first year of post-Brexit relations.Liz Truss, UK foreign secretary, will attempt to cut the Gordian knot left by her predecessor, Lord David Frost, who resigned late last year just as London began retreating from some of its stiffest demands.Truss has struck a warmer tone than Frost in initial contacts and has invited Maros Sefcovic, the EU’s Brexit commissioner, to meet at her grace-and-favour mansion in Chevening, Kent, on Thursday night, promising “constructive proposals” to break the deadlock.But officials on both sides concede that on the substance of how to manage the new trade border in the Irish Sea, they remain far apart. The Financial Times looks at the prospects for a deal.Like her predecessor, Truss maintains that the Brexit deal that the UK agreed in 2019 for Northern Ireland is “not sustainable” and needs radical reshaping.The Northern Ireland protocol left the region in the EU single market for goods to avoid bringing back a hard trade border on the island of Ireland, but this necessitated the creation of a trade border in the Irish Sea.The British government says this trade border unnecessarily divides the UK’s own internal market and is causing a hit to traders in Great Britain, who now face high levels of bureaucracy to send goods from the mainland to Northern Ireland.Truss took a tough line in a newspaper article published over the weekend, writing that the UK wants to see “no checks or documentation for goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland”.London also wants the EU to change a section of the protocol that requires any UK government subsidy decision that could impact on the region’s goods market to be cleared in Brussels by the European Commission.In addition, the UK wants to eliminate any requirement for businesses in Northern Ireland to notify the EU when goods are leaving the EU single market, which is required under EU law.Lastly, the UK is looking to remove the EU’s top court, the European Court of Justice, as the “final arbiter” of future disputes over the protocol. In its place, London wants to have an arbitration mechanism, with the ECJ ruling only on matters of EU law.If Brussels does not address these concerns, Truss says she reserves the right to trigger the Article 16 safeguarding clause in the protocol, which would temporarily suspend parts of the deal while solutions are found.She is under pressure from Conservative MPs and unionist politicians in Northern Ireland not to compromise with Brussels.EU officials have welcomed the warmer tone from Truss, but also cautioned that this will not be enough to secure a breakthrough. “We will not be seduced by a night in a country house,” said one official close to the talks.Truss’s decision to lay out her demands in a newspaper article has also irked EU countries, with patience with the UK running thin in national capitals wanting to focus on the EU’s ambitious green agenda and Covid recovery.“The government’s habit of speaking with Brussels through the national press shows with Truss.not much has changed,” said one diplomat.On the substance of the UK demands for radically reduced checks, Brussels argues that there are limits to how far it can go. If Northern Ireland is to remain in the single market for goods, then the EU must have some oversight.“If something is coming to the EU single market.we have to have an overview,” Sefcovic said before Christmas.The commission has paused legal action against the UK for failing to implement parts of the protocol while talks continue. The EU has also unilaterally moved to introduce legal changes to ensure that the protocol does not disrupt medicine supplies, and last October proposed some measures that it claimed could reduce customs checks by “50 per cent” and checks on agrifoods by “80 per cent”. However, the UK government disputes that assessment and says the EU offer falls far short of what is necessary to make the protocol work.Sefcovic has avoided putting a deadline on the talks but the EU wants a comprehensive deal as soon as possible, ideally before election campaigning begins in Northern Ireland in March.The EU-UK talks resume as the political situation in Northern Ireland becomes increasingly fractious ahead of elections on May 5 for the region’s power-sharing government, which are being seen as a referendum on the protocol.The Democratic Unionist Party, which supports Northern Ireland’s place within the UK, is battling to retain leadership of the devolved regional government and has threatened to pull out its ministers unless London swiftly secures a deal to remove the Irish Sea border.The DUP, which feels it has been duped by the Westminster government before, is looking to maintain pressure on Truss amid fears that the UK government could reach a deal that falls short of its demands.Meanwhile, Dublin has urged London and Brussels to ensure that the protocol talks do not drag on past February, and Northern Ireland’s business community is demanding that both the EU and the UK bury their political differences and find flexibilities in the interests of Northern Ireland.Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said the business community was “under no illusions” about the challenges facing negotiators in the next couple of months.“This is perhaps our last and best chance at reaching an agreement between the EU and UK to allow Northern Ireland businesses to be competitive and keep choice and affordability for our households,” he added.There are three paths open to Truss, all difficult to navigate.If she triggers Article 16, EU member states have made clear they will retaliate swiftly, including the possible suspension of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which allows tariff- and quota-free trade between the UK and its largest market.If Truss accepts some goods checks and ultimate ECJ oversight, the commission might allow more leeway for the UK to police the deal on its behalf.But if she accepts this, Truss risks blowback from the caucus of more than 80 Brexiter Conservative MPs who on Sunday tweeted support for her tough opening gambit as an “unambiguous” statement of intent.Alternatively, faced with such invidious choices, she could decide simply to keep talking, stringing out the current tensions and forcing the EU to make the first aggressive move, such as restarting the legal action against the UK that it suspended last year.
274  Russia warned that it would walk away from diplomatic efforts to end the crisis over Ukraine if the west continued to ignore demands over security guarantees, but agreed to extend talks into this week.There was no breakthrough in Geneva after almost eight hours of discussions between Wendy Sherman, US deputy secretary of state, and Sergei Ryabkov, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, in which the American side presented new ideas on arms control.But there was also no breakdown in talks that Russia has warned could lead to military action if its red lines were not respected. With 100,000 Russian troops massed along its border with Ukraine, fears of conflict have intensified.The US and Nato ruled out Moscow’s top demand for a ban on Nato enlargement. Sherman said Russia still had a choice between diplomacy and escalation, with the outcome in the balance.“If Russia walks away from the diplomatic path, it may well be quite apparent that they were never serious about pursuing diplomacy at all,” she said.Ryabkov said Moscow would “judge any further steps and the prospects of all this work and make appropriate decisions based on the results of events that are still to come”, regarding whether it was worth continuing talks.Moscow began the day warning that it would walk away from the talks if the west continued to ignore its demands over Nato expansion.Russian officials will hold talks with Nato in Brussels on Wednesday and with the 57-member Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe on Thursday in Vienna. Sherman said she would “have further conversations with the Russian government and decide on the best way forward” later in the week.She described the talks as “serious, straightforward business, candid discussion”.However, Ryabkov made no promise of de-escalation and said military movements inside Russia “would continue, because this is what is absolutely required to maintain the necessary level of operative readiness of our armed forces in a situation where the security environment of Russia has changed dramatically for the worse”.Russia denies that it is planning to invade Ukraine and says its deployment of troops and equipment close to the borders is an exercise.“Return the troops to barracks or tell us what exercises are ongoing and what their purpose is,” Sherman said. “If Russia stays at the table and takes concrete steps to de-escalate tensions, we believe we can achieve progress.”Sherman said she had presented proposals for new arms-control talks on missile placement and new missile systems, and for limits on the size and scope of military exercises. There was no discussion of US troop levels in Europe, which was “not on the agenda for today”, she added.The proposals could include a replacement for the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which the US withdrew from in 2019 following Russian violations.But Sherman said the talks constituted an exchange of ideas rather than detailed negotiations, which “cannot be completed in a matter of days or weeks”.Moscow last month published several demands to reshape European security, including a ban on further enlargement of Nato and on Nato military activities in former communist bloc members. It has since issued increasingly belligerent threats if its red lines are not met.Ryabkov said that Russia “cannot retreat” from its demand for a promise that “Ukraine and Georgia will never, ever become members of Nato”.“We are fed up with loose talk. Half promises, misinterpretations.We do not trust the other side, so to say,” he said. “We need ironclad, waterproof, bulletproof.guarantees. Not safeguards. Guarantees.”Ryabkov reiterated his threat that European security would suffer if no deals were reached: “After every mistake, every miscalculation.the security of countries to the west of Russia suffers.”The US has threatened to impose bruising economic, financial and trade sanctions on Russia if it invades Ukraine, saying that those measures would eclipse the punishments imposed after the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Sherman repeated that warning on Monday.
275  The crisis over Ukraine has implications for the security of the whole of Europe. But, much to its chagrin, the EU is not a direct participant in the diplomatic talks that are currently taking place. A week of diplomacy began with direct discussions between the US and Russia. It will continue with talks between Russia and Nato and then a dialogue at the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.As the crisis has built, EU leaders have become increasingly vocal in expressing their discontent at their exclusion from the diplomatic top table. In a letter to European foreign ministers Josep Borrell, the EU’s chief diplomat, even suggested that “our main goal should be to ensure EU involvement in the process”.This is a strangely self-centred approach. The main goal of this week’s diplomacy should be to deter Russian aggression and to prevent conflict. Inserting the EU into the discussion should be a secondary objective. Rather than complaining in public about their own irrelevance, European leaders — both in Brussels and in national capitals — should work harder in private to fix the problems that have pushed the EU to the sidelines of talks.In an ideal world, the EU would indeed be a strong and influential voice in talks with Russia. The problem is that the EU currently lacks the military clout and diplomatic unity that would compel the Kremlin to pay attention.The Russians, the Ukrainians, and even the eastern members of the EU, all understand that US power remains the biggest potential deterrent to Russian aggression. The defence budget of the US is more than three times bigger than the collective defence spending of the EU’s 27 members. The EU’s efforts to branch out into security remain limited to relatively small missions and initiatives.In the past, the EU could blame opposition from Washington or London for the failure to develop a distinctive European role in defence and security. But the UK has now left the EU and the Biden administration would probably welcome a collective EU effort on defence. The problem clearly lies within the EU itself.The bloc is politically divided. Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are naturally wary of Moscow and want a hawkish approach. But there have always been voices in the German establishment, particularly in German business, calling for rapprochement with Russia. Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, also made a unilateral effort to reset relations with Russia, though it met with predictable failure.To its credit, the EU did manage to agree on strong sanctions over Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. The European single market is an important strategic, as well as an economic, asset. But in the current crisis it is notable that it has been left to the Biden administration to threaten the Kremlin with “devastating” economic consequences. Europe has been much quieter on the subject of future sanctions.Forming an EU consensus is always difficult. It may be even harder, in the event of a Russian assault on Ukraine, given the dependence of many EU countries — in particular Germany — on Russian gas. The EU has also long struggled to form a common approach to the crucial topic of energy security.The current weakness of the EU on the Ukraine crisis is indeed regrettable. This is a perilous moment for Europeans and their security. A stronger and more united EU voice would help the west to deter Russia. It would be unfortunate if it required a severe security crisis — such as a Russian attack on Ukraine — to create the unity and urgency that the EU so badly needs.Letters in response to this article:Recalling the Brussels brush-off given to Ukraine / From Lord Patten of Barnes, House of Lords, London SW1, UKRecalling Stalin’s quip about papal divisions / From Gregory Shenkman, London SW7, UK
276  The writer is a member of the board of Vontobel AGAs the world grapples with the fast-spreading Omicron variant and its potentially devastating consequences, a major policy dilemma revolves around how governments might nudge the unvaccinated or partially vaccinated to join the ranks of those who are fully protected.Policies proposed range from fines (in Greece), and Covid passes to access public venues (in France and Switzerland), to nationwide mandatory vaccination (in Austria). Vaccination mandates in particular rankle liberals and libertarians alike and raise challenging ethical questions, while arguably entrenching the position of the unvaccinated.One answer to the dilemma, which opponents of mandatory vaccination may find more palatable, can be found by examining how insurance markets price risk. Private insurance prices its members’ behaviour by assessing risk on an individual basis. Inexperienced drivers pay a higher premium than those with a no-claims history. Private medical insurance provides incentives for people to make healthy life choices to drive down their premiums. Travel insurance is more expensive for those engaging in riskier activities.By contrast universal healthcare systems make no such differentiation: cyclists, ski racers, smokers, young drivers, Covid-vaccinated, partially vaccinated and unvaccinated, all enjoy the same access to the healthcare system.Some have argued that equal access needs to be maintained in the face of a threat as serious as Covid and that choosing not to be vaccinated is equivalent to choosing to smoke, or participating in extreme sports. Most such “risk” behaviours are too insignificant to have a systemic impact and, in any event, most of us engage in some lower risk and some higher risk behaviours, so the balance of the collective is maintained.Yet the impact of Covid (and, in particular, that of the unvaccinated or partially vaccinated on infection rates) has the ability to overwhelm the healthcare system’s capacity to cope, or, at the very least, its ability to deliver acceptable levels of care to all patients. This is what makes it fundamentally different from the other “risk” behaviours.In the UK, while over 70 per cent of the population has been vaccinated fully, the overwhelming majority of those needing the most specialist hospital care have been vaccinated partially or not at all. Even with relatively low rates of hospitalisation and ICU bed occupancy compared with the same period last year — and arguably before the full impact of the recent surge has been felt — this has filled the stretched capacity of the NHS, leading to longer waiting lists and cancelled or postponed surgery. To many who have been vaccinated and suffered hardship as a result of lockdowns, this is no longer acceptable.One way to nudge the unvaccinated to get a jab is to require that those who remain unvaccinated by choice pay for the cost of their own medical care, in case of Covid-induced hospitalisation — a policy that Singapore introduced last year. Some will argue that such a requirement would hit the less well-off or ethnic minorities, who are disproportionally unvaccinated, while giving a free pass to wealthier individuals. To counter that, I would propose a charge philosophically similar to that applied to speeding fines: as a percentage of (in this case annual) income.While it may be politically unpalatable, this system should be put in place, at least while Covid variants produce such starkly different outcomes in individuals depending on whether they are vaccinated or not — and until antiviral pills have proven to be a cost-effective alternative to vaccination for preventing hospitalisation.Private insurance markets have shown the way. Universal healthcare coverage should, exceptionally, follow suit in this case as an ethically superior alternative to introducing vaccine mandate and a complement to Covid passes.Letter in response to this article:Requiring the unvaxxed to pay for care is inequitable / From Stefan Rask, Givrins, Switzerland
277  God created war so that Americans might learn some geography, quipped Mark Twain. Geographically challenged Europeans also have good reason to look up Ukraine on the map. Russia has warned the US and Nato to make concessions or face a worsening security situation in Europe.Markets are so far unfazed by the threat of war. If there is a conflict — perhaps a partial Russian invasion of Ukraine — the focus would be on energy. But prices would be affected far more widely via inflationary pressure.Natural gas prices in Europe already reflect a squeeze on local inventories. A quintupling of natural gas prices on the continent and in the UK has pushed up electricity prices too. Energy has surged out of its usual trading ranges. It would go higher still if Russia invaded Ukraine and stopped exporting gas.Energy price rises would put pressure on retail suppliers, such as Centrica, and big consumers, for example chemical makers. It would benefit explorers such as UK-listed Serica Energy, whose shares have already more than doubled over one year. Europe might even have to fall back on coal, says Bjarne Schieldrop at SEB in Oslo.The US is unlikely to intervene militarily if Russia invades its smaller neighbour. Instead, America would tighten sanctions, Cutting off the US banking lines of Russia would wreak collateral damage on US banks and corporations they deal with. Russia’s economy is shambolic but it has considerable wealth, reflected in $630bn of foreign exchange and gold reserves, the highest since at least 2007.Ukraine’s sovereign bonds have performed poorly. Its US dollar 7.4 per cent coupon 10-year bond has dropped since October. The yield spread to its US Treasury equivalent has widened 200 basis points since mid-October.Companies operating in Ukraine such as Ferrexpo are also at risk. The market worth of the London-listed iron ore miner’s shares has fallen in line with the commodity, leaving it valued at £1.8bn. An invasion would drive shares down further.At present, there is more jaw-jaw than war-war. Expect big price moves if peace talks fail and tanks start rolling.
278  Russia is under siege. The country’s enemies have advanced to its borders. A hostile Nato alliance now threatens to incorporate Ukraine — which is historically and spiritually part of Russia. It has fallen to Vladimir Putin — as heir to Peter the Great, Alexander I and Joseph Stalin — to lead the fight back from the Kremlin.This, broadly speaking, is the story that the Russian government is peddling, at the beginning of a week of crucial talks with the west. Russia has massed troops on its border with Ukraine. It threatens to invade its western neighbour, but claims this is a defensive reaction to Nato expansion. Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, explains that for Putin “Ukraine is the last stand”.But the Kremlin narrative is nonsense. There is no risk that Nato will attack Russia. The reason that so many countries joined the alliance in the 1990s is because they fear Russian aggression. There is currently no realistic prospect of Ukraine joining Nato.As a result, any concessions that the west could offer in this week’s talks — on troop deployments or alliance expansion — would not ultimately solve Putin’s security problem. That is because the real threats to Russia’s leader are domestic.This time last year, demonstrations took place across Russia in support of opposition leader Alexei Navalny. His video investigations had highlighted the opulent lifestyle of Putin and his cronies. The Kremlin claims with increasing vehemence that all its domestic opponents are “foreign agents”. In fact, they are mainly ordinary Russians who dislike the government and know that phoney elections offer no hope for change. After a failed effort to murder Navalny, the Kremlin imprisoned him. Moscow denies involvement in the attempted killing of Navalny, but he remains a bigger threat to Putin than Nato ever will be.By presenting himself as the embodiment of Russian nationalism, Putin has conflated threats to his own rule with threats to the nation. But Putin’s personal security and Russia’s national security are not the same thing.There is, however, a link between Putin’s domestic problems and his external aggression. A war could create a wave of nationalist support for the Russian leader. More fundamentally, the only kind of government that Putin can tolerate on Russia’s borders is a corrupt autocracy that mirrors the Kremlin’s own regime. A genuine democracy would offer an alternative model that might encourage opposition in Russia. A free country would also be likely to flee the Kremlin’s embrace and align with the west.For that reason, it is not in America’s power to grant Russia the stable “sphere of influence” that Putin demands. The corrupt autocracies that the Kremlin prefers on its periphery are inherently unstable because of the social resistance they arouse. It was a popular revolt that overthrew a corrupt, pro-Russian government in Ukraine in 2013-14.Inconveniently for the Kremlin, it has had to dispatch troops to help suppress unrest in neighbouring Kazakhstan — on the very eve of US-Russia talks. Kazakhstan is a country in which the average income is around $570 a month, but where the family of Nursultan Nazarbayev, who ruled the country from 1991 until 2019, has acquired foreign properties worth at least $785m.The turmoil in Kazakhstan may be linked to infighting within ruling circles. But these kinds of problems are inherent to corrupt autocracies. If wealth is divided up as part of a spoils system, any hint of a change in leadership creates instability. That dilemma may also feel familiar to Putin.Kazakhstan is not the only part of Russia’s near abroad that is in turmoil. Ever since a stolen election in Belarus in 2020, Alexander Lukashenko, the resident dictator, has been viciously repressing the domestic opposition. The Kremlin is now having to prop up the Kazakh and Belarusian governments — while threatening to invade Ukraine.These problems are worth remembering, amid all the talk of the strength of Russia’s position going into this week’s talks. In reality, modern Russia is dangerously close to replicating the situation of the Soviet Union — which kept its neighbours “friendly” by invading or intimidating them.A short, victorious war might provide a temporary boost to Putin. But invading Ukraine in 2022 will not ultimately ensure the survival of the Putin system, any more than invading Czechoslovakia in 1968 ensured the survival of the Soviet Union. Indeed, in the long term, an attack on Ukraine would actually worsen Russia’s security dilemma and weaken Putin’s domestic situation. If the war dragged on, Russian casualties would mount. A conflict would also drain the economy and increase the country’s isolation.A Russian attack on Ukraine would also give Nato a renewed sense of purpose, and might prompt the very alliance expansion that Russia is complaining about. Finland and Sweden are debating joining Nato, because they are alarmed by Moscow’s increasingly threatening language and behaviour.Even if Russia were able to install a puppet regime in Kyiv, the memory of Moscow’s aggression would give a historic boost to Ukrainian nationalism, cementing the emotional division between Russia and Ukraine that Putin regards as an abomination. All in all, it would be a strange sort of victory for the Kremlin.
279  Compliments of the season, and welcome to the first Trade Secrets of 2022. First of all, our format is changing as of today. Instead of a four-day-a-week newsletter I’ll be writing a comprehensive briefing on Mondays and a midweek opinion column. The content will be similar to before but the views even more trenchant. Today’s main piece looks ahead to the rest of the year and concludes that, whatever your idea of normality is, we’re probably not going back to it.My last set of year-ahead predictions, in 2020, had such a high hit rate I’ve been reluctant to repeat the exercise in case the massive role of good luck on that occasion became too obvious. In any case, globalisation since the pandemic hasn’t mainly been framed by a set of neat processes (trade deals, dispute settlement cases) with clear observable outcomes. So instead of spuriously precise forecasts, here’s what I’m keeping an eye on in 2022.The following chart — pulled from the excellent Big Read yesterday on the supply chain crisis by Harry Dempsey — highlights how far freight shipping rates have risen during the pandemic. In the decade prior to coronavirus, shipping cargo in containers was so cheap that the industry, plagued by excess capacity, struggled to make a profit, according to the piece. Some carriers went bust and the market consolidated such that the world’s leading nine carriers now control 83 per cent of tonnage.As this chart shows — and has been noted previously by this newsletter — there are signs that shipping rates have fallen recently, at least on the more popular routes. However, there lingers an expectation that the world will have to learn to live with lofty freight rates and this feeds into the economic debate about inflation, given the link between shipping costs and the final price of goods.The New York Federal Reserve has designed a new index of pressures on global supply chains.Shipping industry experts tell the FT the supply chain disruptions are likely to persist this year.The former EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom optimistically suggests that the EU (which we note borders the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans) should join the trans-Pacific CPTPP.Noah Barkin, of the German Marshall Fund think-tank, describes how German industry has mobilised to defend its close trade relationship with China in the face of scepticism within the new government in Berlin.France’s official programme for its six-month presidency of the EU Council of member states emphasises the need to create an anti-coercion tool to deter bullying by other trading powers.
280  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
281  Russia’s president Vladimir Putin vowed that a Moscow-led security bloc would protect allies from “colour revolutions” in its neighbourhood after sending troops to quell unrest in Kazakhstan last week.He said that the Russian-led forces were securing critical infrastructure to “normalise the situation” and help “restore order to the country”.Putin’s remarks, his first public comments since the unrest began, underscored Moscow’s willingness to back allies in former Soviet states against street protests, which the Russian leader blamed on external meddling.“Of course, we understand that the events in Kazakhstan aren’t the first and will be far from the last attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of our states,” Putin said.He claimed that protesters had used “Maidan technologies”, a reference to a 2014 uprising that toppled a pro-Russian president in Ukraine, and cited other pro-democracy movements that ousted Moscow-aligned rulers in Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan in the 2000s.“We won’t let anyone destabilise the situation in our home and won’t allow the so-called colour revolution scenario to play out,” Putin said.At least 164 people were killed, including three children, and almost 8,000 people have been arrested in Kazakhstan, according to the country’s authorities.The protests began as peaceful demonstrations against fuel price rises and the longtime rule of Nursultan Nazarbayev, the 81-year-old “father of the nation” and former president who stepped aside as head of Kazakhstan’s security council when the violence began.Authorities have blamed the violence on “terrorists” who number as many as 20,000, though they have provided little evidence to support this claim.Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, Kazakhstan’s president, described the unrest as “an attempted coup d’état” co-ordinated by a “single centre”.He said the peacekeeping mission from the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization bloc, which included 2,030 troops and 250 units of military equipment, would shortly end, and vowed to provide “additional evidence” of the “terrorist” activities.Putin praised Tokayev for his “bravery” and expressed confidence Kazakhstan would quickly “restore order”.Putin claimed that “destructive internal and external forces” had taken advantage of the protests to deploy “well-organised groups of militants under their control” that had “obviously trained at terrorist camps abroad”. The demonstrations prompted the Kazakh government to resign last week.He said that unnamed foreign forces had used the internet and social media — which Kazakhstan shut off for extended periods during the unrest — to create a pretext for “terrorist attacks” by organising the protests.
282  Russia has warned the US and Nato to make concessions or face a worsening security situation in Europe, as it downplayed the potential for progress in talks between Moscow and Washington aimed at averting an invasion of Ukraine.Russian and US officials are meeting on Monday in Geneva for high-stakes negotiations on Ukraine and wider European defence. The talks were prompted by Russia’s deployment of about 100,000 troops close to its border with Ukraine and its warnings of military action if the west ignores demands for new guarantees that would reshape Europe’s security architecture.Sergei Ryabkov, Russia’s deputy foreign minister and lead negotiator in Geneva, said Russia would not yield on its demand for Nato to never make Ukraine a member, a pledge the US and the military alliance has already ruled out.“Now the other side must show flexibility. If they are unable to do this, then they will face a worsening situation in their own security,” he told Russian state news agency Ria. “I have rather pessimistic forecasts in this regard, but we will persistently explain that without solving this key task, a productive dialogue will not work.”The talks are the first in a series of diplomatic meetings this week aimed at de-escalating the situation in Ukraine. Nato’s secretary-general has told the Financial Times that the alliance hopes for “co-operation” from Moscow but is prepared for possible conflict.Ryabkov leads a delegation that will spend Monday locked in talks with a US delegation led by Wendy Sherman, deputy secretary of state.“The US will listen to Russia’s concerns and share our own, but we have been clear we will not discuss European security without our allies and partners,” Sherman said as the talks began.US officials, while ruling out any agreements that would end Nato’s “open door” membership policy or reduce the alliance’s ability to defend its members, have said it could be instead open to possible talks on not deploying missile systems in Ukraine.But Ryabkov said Moscow would not settle for this as an alternative.“I’ll tell you this, in response they will hear: ‘We are ready to discuss only the non-expansion of Nato, the non-accession of Ukraine, Georgia and other countries to the alliance’,” he said. “We will not make any concessions. This is completely ruled out.”Bilateral talks in Geneva will be followed by talks in Brussels on Wednesday between Russia and the 30 members of Nato.Ryabkov said those talks also did not look promising for potential progress.“They want to. [discuss] on their own terms, with an agenda that suits them, with an emphasis on the so-called de-escalation, the so-called ‘Russian aggression’ in Ukraine,” Ryabkov added. “This is unacceptable to us.”
283  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.A week of diplomacy is formally kicking off in Geneva today, with Russia hoping to extract concessions from the US and Nato regarding Ukraine, while the west plays down expectations of a breakthrough. We’ll unpack what last night’s preliminary US-Russia talks have generated and what to watch for in the coming days.Meanwhile, on the Covid-19 front, with travel plans still disrupted by pandemic restrictions, airlines continue to fly near empty planes — so-called ghost flights — to keep their coveted slots at major airports in Europe. We’ll explore the arguments of environmentalists and opposition politicians and what the EU transport commissioner has to say about it.A week of intense diplomatic efforts aimed at avoiding a Russian attack on Ukraine got under way last night with a private dinner between the Kremlin and the White House’s chief negotiators, writes Henry Foy in Geneva.In an apartment overlooking Lake Geneva, Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov held what he described as more than two hours of “difficult but businesslike” talks with US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman. (Read more here)The formal talks begin today, with negotiations between the US and Russian delegations over demands by Moscow to rewrite the European security architecture. Ignore them, president Vladimir Putin has warned, and Russia may take military action. It has stationed 100,000 troops close to the border with Ukraine as threatening leverage.The problem is that many of the demands — including a ban on Ukraine joining Nato, an effective halt on the western military alliance’s eastern expansion, and restrictions on major military deployments in countries that were in Moscow’s orbit during the cold war — have already been dismissed by the US and Nato as completely unacceptable.US secretary of state Antony Blinken put it bluntly yesterday: “We’ll see if there are grounds for progress [but] it’s very hard to see that happening when there’s an ongoing escalation, when Russia has a gun to the head of Ukraine.”Instead, western negotiators hope that Moscow can be placated with negotiations on arms control, a scaling back of missile deployments and potential pledges on what weapons the US cannot place in Ukraine. Few expect any breakthrough.After the bilateral showdown in Switzerland, the Russians head to Brussels.But not for talks with the EU: on Wednesday they will meet Nato’s 30 members. Thursday is another talking shop hosted by the even-larger group, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in Vienna.Absent all these talks are EU representatives. Successfully cut out of the negotiations by Moscow, Brussels has in recent days demanded a seat at the table in future rounds. But the prognosis for this does not look good.In an interview with the FT, Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said that the alliance is “prepared for the worst” and its deterrence is “credible and strong” were the risk of a conflict with Russia to materialise. When asked about the US promise that there would be no discussions on Europe without Europe present, he was concise: Europe will of course be present — through the dozens of Nato members based on the continent.Wednesday will provide a neat symbol of the gulf between the EU’s desired influence on defence and security issues and the reality, thanks to a quirk of the bloc’s meeting calendar.That day, EU defence ministers will be in Brest, on the French coast, discussing, among other issues, Paris’s desire for more ‘strategic autonomy’, and a greater role for the bloc in military matters now handled by Nato.Meanwhile back in Brussels, Stoltenberg and the alliance will be sparring with Russia over the future of the missile systems and troop deployments that keep the continent secure.Climate policies are likely to keep energy prices higher and might force the European Central Bank to withdraw its stimulus more quickly than planned, said Isabel Schnabel, the ECB executive responsible for market operations. The ECB last month announced “step-by-step” reduction in its asset purchases, but other central banks — including the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England — are tightening policy more quickly. (More here)Green campaigners and some EU governments are blaming Brussels for near empty “ghost flights” that are forced to fly during the pandemic, writes Mehreen Khan in Brussels.German carrier Lufthansa last week said it would run 18,000 near empty flights during the winter season in order to keep lucrative landing slots at major airports. That’s a result of EU-wide rules which require carriers to use at least 50 per cent of their landing slots or risk losing them (down from 80 per cent in normal times). But the phenomenon of ghost flights, which include 3,000 run by Brussels Airlines (owned by Lufthansa) has drawn ire from the likes of climate activist Greta Thunberg and Belgium’s transport minister, who think the rules are contributing to needless greenhouse gas emissions (here’s the FT’s story on their complaints).Belgian environmentalist group Inter Environnement Wallonie has calculated that the 18,000 ghost flights will emit 700,000 tonnes of CO2 and destroy another 2m sq m of Arctic ice.EU transport commissioner Adina Valean has responded to the criticism and made clear the rules aren’t going anywhere fast. Valean told Europe Express the 50 per cent threshold provides “flexibility” to carriers not to run empty flights, gives certainty to airports who could otherwise sell the slots to other carriers, and offers consumers regular routes.“Unused slots represent a loss for the airport, for other airlines and for the travelling public and the economy as a whole because it means that an airline is blocking a slot which would have otherwise been used by another airline,” Valean told Europe Express.The European Commission has the power to decide the slot threshold for this winter and the summer season, under emergency legislation passed during the first phase of the pandemic. Brussels has also provided a “safety valve” for airlines who can stop flights altogether during travel restrictions and not lose their slots.Valean said that so far only Lufthansa has raised objections to the commissioner. She added that many low-cost airlines had managed to “quickly adapt” to pandemic-era travelling — highlighting a split between large carriers and cheaper airlines about the rulesand later this week
284  The country’s 10-year bond yield traded at minus 0.03 per cent on Monday, after climbing last week to its highest level since May 2019, as a global drop in government debt prices spread to the most important reference point in European markets. Midway through last month, the gauge stood as low as minus 0.4 per cent.The rapid pick-up in yields, led by the US, reflects growing confidence among investors that the Omicron variant will fail to derail the global economic recovery, potentially enabling central banks to dial back purchases and bump up interest rates.“European Central Bank demand has been so important to the negative-yield story,” said Mike Riddell, a portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors. “It makes sense that a reduction in purchases would lead to a rise.”Taking the lead from Bunds, Italy’s 10-year bond yield also rose to an 18-month high of 1.34 per cent on Monday, following last week’s data showing eurozone inflation hit a new record of 5 per cent in December.Germany’s 10-year yields first cracked below zero in 2016 after the ECB cut interest rates to under 0 per cent to tackle its last big challenge: the Greek debt crisis. The once unthinkable shift in yields in to negative territory meant that investors were effectively willing to pay Berlin for the privilege of lending the country money, even for a decade. Yields later picked up somewhat, but renewed ECB stimulus in the face of an economic slowdown crammed them back below zero in 2019. The outbreak of Covid meant they stayed there. At its December meeting, the ECB announced it would continue its asset purchases after its emergency bond-buying programme runs out in March, but at a slower rate than investors had expected. That, in combination with signs that the US is edging towards tighter policy, has pushed this reference rate back up towards the threshold.Some economists worry that Germany could be dragged in to a recession — two consecutive quarters of negative growth — due to restrictions imposed to contain the spread of Omicron.Yet most believe this will delay but not end the rebound in Europe’s largest economy and still expect Germany to produce strong growth this year, supported by high levels of public spending under the new government before stricter fiscal rules snap back next year.Sven Jari Stehn, chief European economist at Goldman Sachs, said this upbeat outlook meant he expected German 10-year bond yields to reach 0.3 per cent by the end of this year. “The joint increase in European bond yields and equity prices since the global monetary policy shifts in mid-December suggests that the rise in Bund yields is primarily due to improving growth sentiment,” he said.Germany suspended its limit on budget deficits in response to the pandemic, but its historic aversion to loose fiscal policy has kept Bunds in short supply in recent years while the ECB has snapped up an ever larger share of the market. But the creation of the EU’s €800bn recovery fund — with backing from Berlin — raises the prospect of Brussels’ own debt becoming a benchmark asset to rival Bunds. Meanwhile, incoming chancellor Olaf Scholz has signalled a greater openness to borrowing than his predecessor Angela Merkel — albeit within the constraints of a constitutional limit on budget deficits.Some investors think these shifts could help to alleviate the shortage of German debt relative to that of freer-spending governments such as Italy’s.“You had the [EU] recovery package, then a change of government in Germany,” said Ludovic Colin, a bond portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management. “They haven’t become Italy overnight, but they maybe became a tiny bit more Italian. “If fiscal policy is now going to help create growth and potentially inflation, the long-term need for the ECB to keep rates at [minus 0.5 per cent] could disappear,” he added,Still, some analysts are sceptical about a sudden sea change for German yields. Camille de Courcel, head of strategy for G10 rates Europe at BNP Paribas, said ECB purchases would still exceed Germany’s €54bn of expected net bond issuance by €17bn this year, even if they are €88bn lower than last year. “We expect the sell-off to continue in to the end of the year, albeit in a limited fashion,” she said.Markets are now pricing in an interest rate rise from the ECB this year, an unlikely prospect given the squeeze on living standards caused by high inflation, according to Rabobank strategist Richard McGuire.“It’s going to be tough for German yields to escape the gravitational pull of negative territory,” he said. “We have clients telling us that if they hit zero it’s time to buy. A positive risk-free rate in the eurozone would be a big change, but I find it hard to believe this is a regime shift.”
285  Five years ago president François Hollande stunned France by renouncing a re-election bid — a first in the history of the Fifth Republic and a sign of his Socialist party’s deep unpopularity. Just three months before the next presidential vote, the once mighty French left seems no closer to reaching the Elysée Palace.Surveys suggests none of the leftwing candidates will qualify for the runoff. Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris who is the Socialist party candidate, is given only about 4 per cent of first-round voting intentions in recent opinion polls. Yannick Jadot of the Greens, who are in alliance with the Socialists in local governments across France, is at about 7 per cent. The far-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who abandoned the Socialist party in 2008 and went on to found La France Insoumise (France Unbowed), stands out with 10 per cent of first-round voting intentions.Long gone are the days when the Socialist François Mitterrand won the presidential election and ended the left’s postwar political drought in 1981. Four decades on, his old party is struggling to make itself heard, its supporters are in despair, and the left has splintered.“The Socialist party was for a time hegemonic on the French left, and that has come to an end,” said Vincent Martigny, politics professor at the University of Nice. “The left is in a paradoxical situation. A majority of leftwing voters think more or less the same on most issues — the environment, the fight for equality, the fight against racism, support for Europe — but their leaders are very divided.”The four candidates between the centre and the far-right dominate the field ahead of the election in April: the incumbent Emmanuel Macron, who was economy minister under Hollande and campaigned as “neither right nor left” to win in 2017 by grabbing support from both the Socialists and the centre-right; Valérie Pécresse, who recently beat her Gaullist rivals in a primary and was nominated by Les Républicains; far-right leader Marine Le Pen; and Eric Zemmour, the anti-immigration polemicist.This pattern suggests that the left’s problem is not just ideological confusion or a lack of leadership, but a shift to the right by French voters.“There has been a disintegration of French Socialism,” said Luc Rouban, a political scientist at Sciences Po. “But the other factor is the electorate.” On issues such as law and order and immigration, “in the last 10 years, there has been a slide to the right”.After more than four years in the wilderness since Macron replaced Hollande in the Elysée Palace, leftwingers have been casting around for a path to power.Hidalgo, realising she had no chance of winning when her support was so low and there were no less than six others from the left and the far left vying for the presidency this year, joined calls for a broad “popular primary” open to all voters agreeing with a set of principles to choose a unity candidate to avert “the death of the left”.Given the success of Green-left alliances in 2020 local elections — they won control of big cities such as Marseille and Bordeaux as well as holding Paris — it was an obvious solution. But she was swiftly rebuffed by Mélenchon, Jadot and the communist party candidate Fabien Roussel, who is polling at 3 per cent.In recent weeks would-be saviours of the left have pressed their cases. They include Arnaud Montebourg, a former economy minister in Hollande’s government, who then launched a honey-making business and is running as an independent, and Christiane Taubira, a politician from French Guiana who was justice minister in the same administration and has said she too will stand in the election if she wins the left’s primary and will “put all my efforts into a last chance for unity”.This parade of candidates “is becoming comic”, according to Virginie Martin, political analyst at Kedge Business School.Martin said the French left had suffered from a lack of leadership and a reluctance to do the hard work of day-to-day politics in recent years. By contrast, Pécresse from the rightwing LR has been running the Ile-de-France region, which includes the capital, with powers in the areas of public transport and education.The Socialists complain they have been knocked out by Macron in the 2017 election, “but you can’t be knocked out for five years. There’s something not serious about all this,” Martin said.Ironically this further decline of the French left coincides with a pandemic that has prompted even conservative governments around the world to adopt the Keynesian solutions long favoured by the left, including huge state spending financed by debt, to sustain businesses and jobs.Yet the French left is so divided on so many issues — the EU and national sovereignty; the role of business in society; and the conflict between multiculturalism and France’s strictly secular republic — that it has been unable to take advantage of this global ideological shift.“There’s such a gulf between Mélenchon and the rest,” said Martin, who thinks it unlikely but not impossible for the left to reach an agreement and present a united front in April. “You never know. Presidential elections in France are full of crazy and unpredictable things.”Others, including Rouban, see no sign that the left will unite behind one person or that the 70-year-old Mélenchon will abandon a campaign that is set to be his last.In December, to the surprise of many commentators in France, the previously divided LR eventually succeeded in overcoming its internal differences to choose Pécresse as its candidate. The left is a long way from achieving the same goal.“Even if the right was late in creating unity, it was still three or four months before the election,” said Martigny of the University of Nice. “Time is playing against the left.”
286  When the Covid-19 lockdown caused Manhattan to freeze in place in 2020, The Mansion — the local diner in the Yorkville district where I live — erected a gigantic loudspeaker system in the street, through which it played the iconic song “New York, New York” at full blast each night. Cheering residents in the surrounding block leaned out of their doors and windows to sing along. When restrictions eased, each night we danced outside The Mansion — six feet apart.Today, that loudspeaker is gone and the restaurant is fully open, with indoor dining and an outdoor space. But The Mansion remains one of the happiest spots in my neighbourhood: at dawn, it is filled with NYPD officers coming off their night shift, sitting next to young mothers with babies who have woken early; at lunch it bustles with pensioners sipping soup and swapping gossip; in the early evening, there are harried professionals who do not want to cook at home; and late at night there are hordes of teenagers eating chicken nuggets and drinking milkshakes. Is the food tasty? Not particularly. But the stodgy pancakes, fries, bagels, burgers and spinach pie scream “I love New York — for better or worse!” It makes my soul sing, even without the music.What, after my home, is my place of refuge in London? The answer is Dulwich Park, just five minutes’ walk from my front door. When we first came here 37 years ago, we used to take our two young sons and then our daughter to the park. Nowadays, it is where we go with their children.The park is where I enjoy brisk walks and quiet reflection. It is where I marvel at the blooming rhododendrons and azaleas of the American Garden in spring. This legacy of the Victorians opened in 1890. Restored to its original layout, it offers a café, a pond full of waterfowl, running tracks, football pitches, tennis courts, cricket nets and even a bowling green. The park also used to have a metal sculpture by Barbara Hepworth. Alas, vandals cut it from its plinth in 2011, presumably for its value as scrap.The Victorians knew that people need green space. Dulwich Park has long been my place of peace, especially so in the months of lockdowns.I thought twice before choosing Cafe Milano — a glitzy Italian restaurant in Georgetown — since it has become a byword in DC for elite shoulder-rubbing. But according to my calendar, it is the place to which we went the most during the pandemic, not least because it is a few blocks from where we live. Given pandemic restaurant inflation, its hitherto bubble prices now seem almost reasonable. Moreover, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump have left town, so we no longer have to curse fate for coinciding with their Secret Service entourage. Most of all, though, Cafe Milano has a nice menu and is never dull. It almost feels as though you are in London or New York.In pre-pandemic times, I would have faced an agonising choice over this commission: which of my happy places should have top billing? The old friends’ desert retreat in the Karoo, which ideally would feature in my every February? The foothills of the Carpathians, where everyone should go to dream, and for a glimpse of the bucolic landscape of yesteryear? That secretive wine bar, unknown to FT colleagues, near St Paul’s?But after 20 uninterrupted months in the UK — and this after I assumed on reaching adulthood I would be permanently peripatetic — I face no agonising: for me it is the stretch of the Thames Path that winds east and west for a mile or so from the forlorn spans of Hammersmith Bridge. I have paced that bank hundreds of times in the last two years, sometimes in silence cooking up commissions, sometimes in ennui, but more often animatedly inspired by the companionship of a dear friend. Here I have refashioned intros, line-ups, Lunches, festival plans and much more. I have also been reminded of the strength of humanity, the greatness of our capital and what counts — and it also has several of the finest pubs in London! An outdoor respite from the office life of Paris’s 8th arrondissement, with grass to lie on, trees for shade, benches on which to sit and eat your sandwiches, a pond for ducks and moorhens, and a playground and miniature ponies for the children: the 18th-century Parc Monceau has all these and more behind its wrought-iron gates. Even by the high standards of statuary in the parks of the French capital, it boasts an exceptional collection of sculptures of artists and mythical figures, including Chopin and Maupassant. And the park has secured a little place in history as the first drop zone for a parachute jump: on October 22 1797, André-Jacques Garnerin rose 700m above the park in a montgolfière, before detaching the balloon and plummeting in the basket towards the ground until his descent was slowed by a sort of fabric umbrella that had yet to be named. Thus parachuting for pleasure and warfare was born.The British Library doesn’t have all the books ever published, but it has enough for several lifetimes. Part monastery, part social club, it is the spiritual home of numerous London writers, the place where the lonely challenge of research becomes a shared endeavour. When inspiration dries up, you can lounge in the courtyard or walk along the canals of King's Cross. During the various lockdowns, I missed the austere pleasure of summoning up books from the archives and taking notes quietly in pencil (per the house rules). I can’t wait to get back there regularly so I can complain about the prices of the cafeteria.When I need a quick sunshine fix, a bit of exercise or a moment to clear my head, I dash across the street from my house and climb an elegant set of steps dating back to the days when the people of Los Angeles moved around the city on streetcars and trolleys. In one direction I can look down and see the neon and streetlife on Sunset Boulevard; cast my gaze a little higher and there is the downtown skyline. In the other direction is a wide street lined with towering palms. I never tire of looking at them.The staircase is part of a network of steps built in the 1920s in some of LA’s hillside communities to help residents connect to shops and public transport. The stairs are a connection to a lost Los Angeles, but with smart urban planning they could also point to its future.Mornings in Madrid can be cold, because the city is on a plateau about 700m high, but by Spanish lunchtime (3pm or so), the autumn sun is blazing down and it feels 20C. I’m sitting on the tree-lined, octagonal Plaza de Olavide, on the terrace of one of the square’s pleasant but unexceptional restaurants, having an aperitif of Albariño white wine. Like in all the best Spanish squares, there’s a playground in the middle, so parents are de-stressing while the kids go wild. Handsome bourgeois apartments overlook us. The adjoining streets are pedestrianised, so it’s as quiet as central Madrid gets. The three-course lunchtime fixed menu costs a ludicrous €13 or so. At moments like this, Spain is the world’s most liveable country. Here is the European dream. (Directions)— Simon Kuper, FT columnistI’m sitting on a bench surrounded by scruffy grass, the shouts of small children in the little playground, someone moving giant chessmen on the abbreviated board; over the road is Lord’s, where my dad took me to the cricket in the 1950s as he said it was the only place he could get a good sleep; nearby are the remains of John Sell Cotman (a very underrated water colourist) — and I know I’m back home. Sure, there are crumbly headstones but this is one of the least gloomy places in the world for me. Tough-guy flowers poke through the grunge and the dog doo-doo; the pearly light of London mantles this little corner of the rowdy city; it’s a short walk to some fine smoked salmon and sea bream at Brown’s fishmonger, and why wouldn’t I be wearing a big fat smile of homecoming? The spring and summer of 2021 was a time of long-awaited openings as Germany gradually came out of the coma of lockdown. Few of them, though, could be classified as a major cultural event. The exception was the inauguration of the Neue Nationalgalerie, which opened its doors last August after a six-year, €140m renovation.It’s housed in one of Berlin’s most spectacular buildings — a temple-like construction by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, one of the pioneers of modernism. I remember being struck speechless on my first trip to Berlin in 1988 by the sheer abundance of great works it contains by Kirchner, Dix and Beckmann. Coming to live in the city in 2015, I thought I’d spend every other weekend there, only to discover it was shut for repairs. Now at last it has reopened, and it has quickly reestablished itself as a place of pilgrimage for Berlin’s art lovers. After all those months of sensory deprivation, nothing can compare with the intense colours, energy and lyricism that pulse out of every painting and can cure even the worst bout of pandemic blues.Had Thomas Mann moved to LA in time, I like to think Death In Venice would have dramatised the Pacific and not the Adriatic coast. The morose Aschenbach would come out to one of the widest tracts of sand, around Lifeguard Tower 32, where the hubbub of the boardwalk feels almost as remote as Japan on the other side of the drink. He might find it most curative in winter, when the beach would be his but for the odd meditator and lost skater. The rest of the world takes on a pleasing irrelevance. He is free.Recently I went to the National Gallery to see the Albrecht Dürer exhibition. Slightly lost on my way to the exit, and for once in no particular hurry, I wandered slowly through one airy — and largely empty — labyrinthine room after another, past the drapery and dimples of the Titians and Tintorettos, turning left into the Netherlands, through the richly coloured, expressive physiognomy of Bruegel, Massys and Gossaert. Before I knew it I was floating through the gossamer worlds of Claude and Poussin, past swashbuckling Velázquez portraits and Caravaggio’s chiaroscuro showstoppers.And then, after the national treasure chest of Turners, Constables and Gainsboroughs, a sudden, welcome blaze of modernity: Cézanne’s luminous bathers. After that, all is lightness, sunflowers, lilies, lazy days on the Seine. Emerging blinking into Trafalgar Square, I realised I felt just the way I used to feel on numerous afternoons there as a teenager — dizzy with it all, seeing brushstrokes in the clouds. For anyone with unsated wanderlust, there is no more transportive place to lose a few hours. Turn off your phone, switch on your senses and simply drift.The Surfrider, a reborn icon of the Malibu scene, is a source of surf history and celebration — immediate in the majestic ocean views and in anticipation of riding the waves below. More specifically, the perfect place is the roof-bar corner table, looking across the Pacific Coast Highway out to the line-up at First Point — where the legendary Malibu right-hander breaks.During the day, it’s the ideal perch to plan your surf session. In the evening, sit back with a sundown Negroni and survey the elegant longboarders ride clean lines all the way to Surfrider Beach, erstwhile playground of Gidget and Miki “Da Cat” Dora, with a combination of awe and envy. If you watch often enough, you recognise the regulars, like the guy in the cowboy hat whooping along the wave towards the pier. Never seen him less than “stoked”, no matter how many thousands of waves he has ridden. And like the pinball wizard — never seen him fall. If you are in luck, dolphins roll by Malibu pier. But it’s hard to feel out of luck out there.Hoi Ha Wan, a wondrous bay ringed by dense forest in the east of Hong Kong’s New Territories, always brings me joy and quietude. I come here often, alone or with my wife and three boys, to kayak its clear and clean waters or to just sit on the beach with a book and watch and listen to the sea. It is part of a marine park that is home to 60 coral and 120 fish species. Areas have been cordoned off to boats to allow the coral to replenish and are ideal snorkelling spots, where you can see the world coming back to life beneath the surface.What keeps Hoi Ha so special is how hard it is to reach. You can only get here by public bus or taxi — no cars are allowed without a permit, except for those very few who live in the country park — which makes it all the more becalming. And if you are lucky enough to get here on a weekday, there is a decent chance you will have it all to yourself.The Big Echo in Akasaka is one of thousands of karaoke joints in Tokyo, but this one perhaps best qualifies as the most harmonious (usually) of happy places. It has been, through its stumbling proximity to the bar and restaurant cluster of Akasaka, both fastigium and finale of truly magnificent evenings spent with a beloved cadre of dearest and loudest friends. A private room where the lyrics are projected onto the walls; a dimming of the lights; an all-you-can-drink deal. Glorious. Surprises will co-mingle with beloved predictability. The corporate lawyer will sing Avicii, the Goldman guy will do Manilow, the tech entrepreneur will take on A-ha. They will ask for Billy Idol, but my voice will be shot by then. It’s perfection.In 1943, George Orwell published a famous essay on his favourite pub, praising its superior qualities and revealing at the end that this idyll was, in fact, too good to be true. Overall he described a place with Victorian fittings where sustenance was satisfying, the atmosphere convivial and family-friendly, and the staff knew customers by name. Now, 79 years later, I have what Orwell desired.Tucked away on a quiet street near Kensington Gardens, The Cleveland Arms was one of the last and first places we visited as London locked down and opened up (with takeaway pints for the park happily purchased in between). Warm and welcoming, it’s a classic old boozer with a modern menu: short, seasonal and gratifying, with taps to please most tastes.The Cleveland Arms is a place of real community in our sprawling metropolis, helmed until recently by an exuberant Italian named Toni, who was adored by the pub’s patrons, their progeny and pups. If the option were available, I’d be tempted to seek a government contract for Toni. He made every visit (and ours are frequent) memorable. We are spoiled with good pubs in this corner of west London — but this one is something special.Nearly all of my happiest moments throughout these past two pandemic years occurred in Central Park. In those 1.3 square miles, I took countless evening walks around the Harlem Meer after long work days, picnicked on Sheep Meadow and brunched at Tavern on the Green with friends, ice-skated with friends to celebrate my birthday, watched a Shakespeare play in the open-air theatre and raced rowboats rented from The Loeb Boathouse. Central Park has long been one of the liveliest places in this city, but the pandemic transformed it into the epicentre of daily life for the Covid-conscious.Few things can temper Germany’s bleak midwinters like the wares of your local baker. This is a country that values quality loaves, with makers here required to become masters in the art of breadmaking before opening their own premises. I’ve been fortunate enough to have a brilliant one on my doorstep here in Frankfurt’s Nordend district.Entering Kronberger on a cold winter day — usually after queueing for a short while — feels like walking on to the set of your favourite Christmas movie, shunning the ever-present grey for the vibrant delights of their festive fare, from Lebkuchen to chocolate Christmas trees and decorations with hundreds and thousands of sprinkles. Baking is on site, and products are as fresh as one might imagine. Its attractions survive the winter months intact. Indeed, while I’ve been working from home, it has become a ritual to go there at the end of my daily walks and pick up a Rosinenbrötchen (teacake) and a slice of their delicious quiche, and forget for a minute or two about the pandemic raging here and elsewhere.In New York, my happy place is transient — it happens in a lot of different places at a lot of different times. Usually I know it’s coming. It’s most exciting when I don’t. I call it “the great reveal”: a stop or two on the subway, where the train emerges from underground to a spectacular view. I picture the great reveal in snapshots: standing at the door on a crisp sunny day, studying the longview of Brooklyn to the Verrazzano Bridge. Lounging at midnight in a near-empty car, feet on the seat, transfixed by the lights of Manhattan for the billionth time. A glance up from my phone to catch the sun setting over a tiny Statue of Liberty that I could pick up and put in my hand. It happens on the Q train as it crosses the Manhattan Bridge, or the 7 in multiple spots in Queens. But my local great reveal is on the F train in Brooklyn. The train sets free at a height and hugs a curve, bending us down into the city and revolving it, like a plane or a planet. New York from that arc, between Fourth Avenue & Ninth Street and Carroll Street, feels somehow grand and also contained, unknowable and also entirely mine.My happy place is Grovelands Park, a rather beautiful and largely undiscovered park in Enfield, one of London’s northern suburbs, near where I live. Scattered across the capital, green spaces like this are welcome gaps in the sprawl — but Grovelands is lovelier than most. It has tree-lined paths, which change colour with the seasons. There’s a swan-inhabited lake, with a small opening at which delighted toddlers can be seen feeding the ducks. There’s a wood that provides shelter from noisy traffic. There’s even a pitch-and-putt golf course, which you can watch with amusement as locals hack their way around. The pandemic has transformed me into one of the joggers around the park, a place in which to unwind for half an hour before, inevitably, heading back in front of a screen.Paris is a beautiful city that charms visitors, but when one lives here it can also be loud, stressful and dirty. One of my favourite places to seek peace and perspective is the Musée de l’Orangerie in the Tuileries, just off the Place de la Concorde. My go-to spot is the pair of oval-shaped galleries purpose-built to hold Claude Monet’s Les Nymphéas murals.Depicting the pond and gardens at his home in Giverny at different times of day, the paintings are typical of the Impressionist — saturated with colour, dreamy, and evocative. The curved walls of the galleries cradle both the murals and the observer, creating a calm, timeless vibe. Yes, we have all seen Monet’s work splashed on postcards and museum swag a million times but, for me, seeing it here never gets old.Milan’s Indro Montanelli Gardens have been my refuge since moving to the city last year amid ongoing social restrictions and sleepless nights looking after my newborn baby. Conceived at the end of the 18th century by Archduke Ferdinand Habsburg, the Giardini Indro Montanelli in the central Palestro district was the first public park in the city. It remains one of its few green lungs and is probably the most intimate. I have enjoyed long walks in this 172,000 sq m park; I often sit at the café by one of the little artificial lakes, and I take my eldest daughter to the playground by the Via Manin gate almost every weekend.But when I’m working at home, what I enjoy the most are my sporadic midday escapes here: I file stories, speak to sources and transcribe interviews from a quiet bench. Incidentally, the park was renamed in 2002 after the famed Italian journalist Indro Montanelli, who spent a lot of time here. As a journalist, I completely understand why, out of all the history-filled spots this bustling city has to offer, these Palestro gardens were his favourite.Where’s your happy place in your city?

287  For someone who started their career working on the floors of the London Stock Exchange, the hours following the UK’s exit from the single market could hardly have been more wrenching.In a single day, Alasdair Haynes, chief executive of Aquis Exchange, a UK share-trading venue, watched virtually all share-trading business that he had courted over eight years being unceremoniously yanked out of London and transferred in January 2021 to EU exchanges.The stunning shift, which affected €6bn of trading in European shares that day, seemed emblematic of the blow by Brexit to the City of London’s status as Europe’s dominant financial capital — a harbinger of lost business for London and fresh opportunities for rival centres such as Frankfurt, Paris and Amsterdam.A year down the road the story looks less dramatic and clear-cut, says Haynes, whose customers moved to an EU-domiciled subsidiary in Paris. The manner of the UK’s departure was undoubtedly “an own goal” by London, he says. But the EU is struggling to map out a winning strategy of its own to build up its capital markets.“In Europe, different centres are all fighting each other.to get business back at any cost,” says Haynes, who has held senior trading roles at Morgan Grenfell, UBS and HSBC in his 35-year career in the City. The UK fared better than some expected in 2021, while the EU’s plans to date “have not been very impressive.”As the City marks the anniversary of its divorce from the single market, bankers and officials confirm that broader picture. Rather than experiencing the big-bang shift of swaths of financial sector business from the UK to the EU that some predicted, the City is enduring a slow puncture that will take years or decades to play out.The EU’s efforts to reduce its reliance on the UK and build up a financial sector commensurate with its economy have remained slow-moving and inconclusive, in part because of a lack of political focus in big capitals.Brussels is likely, for example, to confirm early this year that it has ditched hopes of rapidly pulling the systemically sensitive job of clearing trillions of derivatives transactions from London into the union, instead embarking on a much more gradual process with an uncertain destination.“We need to take the long view here: developing deeper capital markets in the EU is neither easy nor quick to do,” acknowledges Valdis Dombrovskis, European Commission executive vice-president, adding that the EU has made good progress rolling out legislation. “We still have barriers to knock down.”The post-Brexit trade deal struck in late 2020 made precious little provision for financial services, and since then Brussels has refused to offer London anything like the same market access arrangements — or equivalence — that financial centres including New York, Tokyo or Hong Kong enjoy.A memorandum of understanding on regulatory dialogue has sat unsigned gathering dust on the shelf — a casualty of EU anger over the UK’s demands to redraw the Northern Ireland protocol. The notion that the UK will lure in large amounts of financial activity after a wide-ranging regulatory bonfire has proven to be an illusion.EU financial capitals have meanwhile reported a surge in activity as firms are forced by regulations to shift business from the City of London. Two dozen large financial services firms have announced plans to move £1.3tn of assets from the UK in the aftermath of Brexit, according to research from EY.Paris has been one beneficiary, as the French capital seeks to lure bankers and financial firms with tax breaks and other incentives. It has attracted 2,800 UK employees since Britain voted to leave the EU in 2016, according to EY.The bulk of roles are in trading, as France capitalises on the existing expertise of its main banks in many derivatives markets. A number of US banks have also chosen Paris as one of their EU bases, among them JPMorgan, which is due to increase its staff from 250 to 800 people in France this year.A further 20 to 30 per cent of the new jobs are linked to investment funds — hedge funds such as Citadel have set up shop or expanded their teams in Paris — while the rest are made up of fintech and insurance companies, according to Arnaud de Bresson, the managing director of lobby group Paris Europlace.“You can see the transfers happening and they are real,” says Stéphane Rambosson, co-founder of Vici Advisory, an executive search firm.London has, meanwhile, lost its crown as the main hub to trade shares in Europe to Amsterdam as tough rules from Brussels curbed cross-Channel dealings. Euronext, the EU’s largest stock market operator, is moving the data centres that house all its trading from Basildon in Essex to Bergamo in Italy.The EU sovereign debt market, including hundreds of bank employees in sales and trading, has slipped out of London. Officials hope that increasing issuance of bonds collectively backed by EU governments — which has ramped up dramatically with the €800bn NextGenerationEU debt issuance programme — could give the EU market a further boost and ultimately provide a eurozone-wide safe asset that aids capital markets integration.Despite all this, the City of London remains the continent’s most important financial hub across swaths of activity. Brexit-related job moves from the UK to the EU total less than 7,400, according to EY figures tracking announcements up to December — far short of the tens of thousands predicted after the 2016 referendum.Relative to gross domestic product, EU financial markets — incorporating pensions, asset management, equity markets, bond markets, private equity and venture capital — were just half the size of the UK’s in April 2021, according to New Financial, a think-tank.London employs more than 418,000 people in financial services, UK government data shows, and it remains the dominant hub for trading currencies and derivatives, clearing, insurance and private equity funds. London is still the main place to raise equity in Europe and has just enjoyed its strongest year since 2007.Chris Woolard, the recently departed interim head of the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, who now heads EY’s regional regulatory practice, argues that the commission is currently “reconciled” to the idea that in the short term the UK has a relative competitive advantage because of the scale and liquidity of its markets.But that does not mean Brussels is content to let matters stay as they are. The union is embarking on a project to bolster its self-reliance across a range of industries ranging from semiconductors to hydrogen, medicines and high-end batteries. That agenda will take on even greater urgency in the coming months as France holds the rotating EU presidency and seeks to build up the “strategic autonomy” initiative.Financial services post-Brexit should in theory sit within this plan. The idea, says Dombrovskis, is not to grab market share — contrary to what some UK and industry executives claim — but to address the “systemic risks” of being heavily reliant on financial infrastructure such as clearing houses that are not under the supervision of EU authorities. “I am confident that we will gradually start seeing real changes in the share of capital markets and investments financing of EU companies,” he says.The problem is that this is proving to be a very gradual process and key capitals have not been focusing their political energy on the EU financial agenda. The union has for decades been pursuing efforts to bolster its financial centres via a project currently dubbed the “Capital Markets Union” — turning the EU’s hodgepodge of smaller financial centres into a world-class system and lessening its reliance on bank lending.CMU now ought to be assuming greater urgency post-Brexit, as the EU seeks to wean itself off being overly reliant on a financial capital sitting outside the single market.Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, has argued the harmonisation of the region’s capital markets also needs to be accelerated to help provide the €455bn of extra annual investment needed to fund the region’s climate, energy and digitisation targets. Europe has an opportunity that is “too good” to pass up in green finance, she says, with 60 per cent of all green bonds issued globally last year coming from the eurozone.Nevertheless, leaders made only a brief mention of CMU in their euro-summit statement last month, and the project was absent from commission president Ursula von der Leyen’s “state of the union” address to the European parliament in September setting out her top priorities.“I’m not sure at the EU level there really have been huge incentives to drive the relocation of activity into the EU,” says one senior executive at a large US bank. “The EU is keen to reduce reliance on the US and the UK in key areas of capital markets.The EU has to really develop local capacity to do that.”Clearing is the most obvious area where the EU is treading water. A clearing house stands between two parties in a trade, acting as a counterparty and ensuring one side is paid if someone defaults on payment. The business is not particularly lucrative, but it needs billions of dollars of collateral to support trades that are open for months.EU politicians have long wanted to pull clearing of euro-denominated derivatives from London, where the majority of the €90tn business is handled. But the huge costs involved in transferring positions means the market has barely moved — even though an EU deadline that allows EU banks to use London is due to expire in June 2022. The commission is expected to announce a further extension to the permit that allows EU banks to use UK clearing houses — probably for an even longer grace period than the previous one.Esma, the pan-European securities regulator, wants the commission to consider measures such as tougher bank capital requirements to force firms to park more business in the eurozone. “What we intend with this is that the clearing volumes will migrate from the UK to the EU clearing houses, and as such the huge dependencies are reduced,” says Froukelien Wendt, a member of Esma’s clearing house supervisory committee.Brussels is planning renewed efforts in the coming months to narrow the legal and regulatory gaps between its financial centres, including an overhaul of EU listing rules and — crucially — a new attack on one of the most stubborn barriers to greater integration, the sharply differing national insolvency regimes.Financial services commissioner Mairead McGuinness also recently unveiled reforms to boost cross-border capital flows, including a pan-EU database of easily accessible corporate financial information and a “consolidated tape” of capital market transactions — a common feature of US markets for decades.But some argue the steps to date remain too modest. “There’s a lot of savings out there but we fail to put it into [European] capital markets. If we have a very simple and accessible trading landscape it can help bring people to capital markets,” says Rosa Armesto Plaja, deputy director-general of Fese, a trade association for stock exchanges in Europe.Executives say momentum on CMU will continue to be lacklustre as long as attempts to consolidate the bloc’s fragmented banking sector remain stuck, entrenching a reliance on lending rather than capital markets. The EU’s half-completed Banking Union project has also drifted for years with no deal on the most contentious remaining aspects — including pan-European common deposit insurance.“We’ve kind of given up a bit on Banking Union. It just doesn’t seem to be moving forward and it feels like the EU has got this really strong group of blocking member states,” says an executive at a large international bank. “Until we get more consolidation and modernisation in the banking sector, we’re still going to see an overreliance on bank lending.”None of this means that London’s position in Europe is somehow unassailable — far from it. The modest trickle of migration from the City to other European financial capitals is in part a reflection of the Covid-19 freeze on executive relocations, and it could easily accelerate.One likely driver is the work of bank supervisors, who, allied with European Commission officials, are quietly tightening the screws on banks that want to do a lot of business in the single market without maintaining substantial physical operations there with plenty of staff.Bank executives, lawyers and supervisors say that the ECB is increasingly forceful in its demands that lenders move more resources to the EU to run their European businesses, requiring banks to add hundreds of extra staff and billions of euros of additional capital to their operations.While banks have moved close to €1tn of assets from the UK to the EU in recent years, many of them still rely on complex structures to run their European operations out of London, such as so-called back-to-back models, which allow the risk of EU trades to be transferred to the UK.Banking supervisors are seeking to complete a “desk-mapping” exercise assessing how lenders manage their EU operations, after which the ECB is expected to step up its demands for firms to move staff and capital to the euro area.That effort has been complemented by new legislative proposals from the commission in October that will enable supervisors to force banks to convert larger branches into fully capitalised subsidiaries in the EU.At the same time, it will become more difficult for non-EU banks to sell services in the single market without having a branch or subsidiary there under the new rules.Officials have dismissed fears that the proposals amount to a sweeping prohibition on any markets or investment banking activity being sold from outside the EU — although some observers including Simon Gleeson of Clifford Chance believe the reforms could make European market less attractive to foreign banks.“A number of banks are going to turn around and say, can I be bothered to do business in the EU?” he says.EU financial markets activity is likely to remain spread across at least five major financial centres, each with its own specialism, such as banking in Frankfurt, trading in Paris, investment funds in Dublin and Luxembourg, and market-making in Amsterdam. This kind of physical fragmentation has arguably become less debilitating given increased digitalisation and the shift to online working, which was accelerated by Covid-19.In Brussels the overriding view is that the status quo needs to change — even if achieving this will be a project that takes years. As one senior EU official puts it, the goal is not to stop doing business with the City of London, but rather to do it “on a sustainable basis”.“We put a lot of eggs in the London basket, which made sense when the UK was part of the EU,” says the official. “But now a lot of our key infrastructure is outside the union, which is not a comfortable place to be in the long term.”
288  Nato has warned Moscow to abandon its belligerent foreign policy and co-operate with the west or face a military alliance steeled for conflict on the eve of a week of intense diplomacy aimed at averting a Russian assault on Ukraine.Jens Stoltenberg, Nato secretary-general, said the US-led defence pact was prepared for “a new armed conflict in Europe” should negotiations fail, as western officials readied for potential discussions with Moscow on reducing the size of military exercises, arms control and a pledge not to deploy US missiles in Ukraine.“I am aware of Russia’s history. For centuries they have experienced conflict with neighbours,” he told the Financial Times. “[But] Russia has an alternative: to co-operate, to work with Nato.”Russia has deployed about 100,000 troops at locations close to its border with Ukraine in recent months, sparking fears that it is planning a fresh attack on a country it invaded in 2014, with the annexation of Crimea.President Vladimir Putin has denied any plan to invade. But he has warned of possible military action if the US and Nato ignored Moscow’s demands for defence agreements that would severely reduce US and Nato capabilities in Europe. Russia claims those capabilities are a threat to its borders.“It is possible to find together a path, a political way forward, and also to address Russia’s concerns.But there continues to be a risk of conflict,” Stoltenberg said in an interview. “Nato’s deterrence is credible and strong.We have to hope and work hard for the best, but be prepared for the worst.”His warning came ahead of formal talks between Russian and US officials in Geneva on Monday, followed by a meeting of the 30-member Nato alliance and a Russian delegation on Wednesday. A third meeting hosted by the broader Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe is set for Thursday.On Sunday evening, Russia’s lead negotiator and deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov met his US counterpart Wendy Sherman, deputy secretary of state. He said their conversation over dinner in Geneva “was difficult, but businesslike”.“We plunged into the matter of the upcoming affairs. I think that tomorrow we will not waste time,” he said in comments reported by Russian state news agency Ria. “I never lose my optimism, I am always guided by it.”US state department spokesperson Ned Price said Sherman had “stressed the United States’ commitment to the international principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the freedom of sovereign nations to choose their own alliances” and “affirmed that the United States would welcome genuine progress through diplomacy”.Price added that Sherman had “underscored that discussion of certain subjects” relating to European security would be reserved for multilateral talks involving Nato this week.Russia’s demands include a ban on Ukraine and other countries joining Nato and a Kremlin veto on alliance activities in member states that joined after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Stoltenberg said both conditions were unacceptable because they breached Nato’s “core principles” of offering membership to all and defending allies equally.Instead, Stoltenberg said the US and Nato were prepared to speak with Russia about possible risk-reduction measures such as “arms control, on efforts to try to have more transparency on military activity, exercises, and also on lines of communications”.Ruling out US missile deployments in Ukraine and discussing broader rules on missile systems in Europe were two areas where Washington saw possible scope for agreement, a senior Biden administration official said ahead of the talks, adding that it would be dependent on whether “Russia is willing to make a reciprocal commitment”.The US was also “willing to explore the possibility of reciprocal restrictions on the size and scope of [military] exercises, including both strategic bombers close to each other’s territory, and ground-based exercises as well”, the official said, adding that “no firm commitments” would be made in Geneva.Washington has firmly denied media reports that it could offer to pull back some troops stationed in eastern Europe in exchange for Russia scaling down its deployment on the Ukrainian border. Instead, officials said the US and other Nato allies were ready to increase their presence if Putin took any military action.The US, EU and other western partners have warned that they will impose financial sanctions on Russia in the event of military escalation. Officials said yesterday that the US was ready to “immediately impose severe and overwhelming costs on Russia’s economy”.The US is also preparing potential trade curbs on Russia and has been discussing the possibility of a range of export controls with allies and partners in Europe and Asia, according to people familiar with White House thinking.While the Kremlin has voiced hope for quick solutions from the talks, Stoltenberg said he expected it would take “a series of meetings” to find any mutually acceptable outcomes.“We are ready to strive for a better relationship,” said the former Norwegian prime minister. “We have proven before that we are able to make compromises and find solutions with Russia.”
289  US officials will sit down with Russian diplomats in Geneva on Monday in the first of a sequence of meetings that could prove crucial to European security.Russia has laid out its red lines in two draft treaties — and with about 100,000 troops amassed close to Ukraine’s eastern border, has threatened military action if they are not met. US and European officials will counter with their own demands that Moscow abide by the fundamental principles of European security: that countries can decide their own foreign and defence policy and that borders are not changed by force.Expectations of an agreement this week on a new security arrangement between Moscow and the west are low.“I don’t think we’re going to see any breakthroughs,” Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, said on Sunday. “We’ll see if there are grounds for progress, [but] it’s very hard to see that happening when there’s an ongoing escalation, when Russia has a gun to the head of Ukraine.”In Geneva Wendy Sherman, Blinken’s deputy, will try to stake out some common ground with her Russian counterpart Sergei Ryabkov that could pave the way to further talks.“At this stage it is very much a dialogue, not a negotiation,” said one western official.But Ryabkov said Moscow expected a “high probability” that the US and Nato would not take its demands seriously. “We won’t make any concessions under pressure or the threats western participants are constantly making at us,” Ryabkov told state newswire RIA Novosti.Ryabkov said talks that did not take Russia’s demands as a starting point would be “pointless” and insisted Moscow would only negotiate on its own terms.“We’re not going with our hands out, we’ve got a clearly defined goal that we need to achieve on the conditions we set. That’s all there is to it,” Ryabkov said.But Moscow’s top demand that there is no further enlargement of Nato has been firmly rejected by Washington and its allies.“I don’t see either Nato or the US wanting to scratch that Russian itch,” said Rose Gottemoeller, a former Nato deputy secretary-general and ex-assistant US secretary of state for arms control. “Nato is not going to change its policy on enlargement, period. It is part of Nato’s DNA.”Andrew Weiss, vice-president at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said a deal akin to the Yalta agreements between the Soviet Union, US and UK that divided Europe after the second world war was unlikely.“It is just hard to imagine the willingness for a normal mainstream American politician to entertain moves with the Russians that bring back horrible memories of Yalta and other backroom dealings in the 19th century that caused immense hardship for countries in Europe,” he said, citing former US president Donald Trump as an exception.A second Russian demand — that Nato powers do not deploy forces or weaponry in member states that joined after the fall of the Soviet Union — will also be rebuffed. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato secretary-general, said on Friday it would consign the alliance’s eastern members to second-class membership.In 1997 Nato agreed not to permanently station combat forces in its members that had been part of the Soviet bloc and deployed very few troops or equipment in those countries.The policy changed after Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Nato has beefed up its presence in Poland and the Baltic states. But the battle groups are small and posted on a rotational basis. It could in theory scale them back again but is unlikely to do so without a full Russian retreat from Ukraine.Russia’s call for a ban on the deployment of ground-launched intermediate range missiles could provide a basis for re-engagement on arms control. The 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty covering such weapons, which collapsed in 2019 over allegations of Russia violations, was breached when Moscow deployed its 9M729 cruise missile. The US might be prepared to renegotiate new controls if Russia agreed to include the 9M729 with verification mechanisms.Moscow’s demands for restrictions on military deployments and on exercises close to its frontiers could be broached in a renegotiation of the Treaty of Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), which Russia abandoned in 2015.Lastly, Russia’s request for more transparency, consultation and exchanges with the alliance on security threats could be met through renewed use of existing procedures, known as the Vienna Documents, which Moscow has largely neglected.Russia’s three meetings this week could theoretically pave the way to separate negotiations: with the US on arms control, with Nato on force deployment and exercises, and with the 57-member Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe on transparency.Despite scepticism about Russia’s serial violations, the west should be prepared to renegotiate security treaties, said Patricia Lewis, director of the international security programme at UK think-tank Chatham House.“You can go into this in good faith — with your eyes wide open.”A successful outcome of this week’s meetings would be a commitment by both sides to a “process and clear substantive agenda” for further talks, said Gottemoeller, but would require Moscow to seek “mutual benefit”.Progress would also depend on Russian de-escalation at Ukraine’s borders. Blinken said Russian aggression against Ukraine would be “front and centre” in the meetings, but he indicated Monday’s session would not directly address the so-called Minsk process for ending the conflict in the eastern Donbas region, which is being steered by Paris and Berlin.The big question, say analysts, is whether the Kremlin wants the talks to fail from the outset.“Not only are they asking for things that you know for a fact are non-starters, they’re asking them specifically in a way that they know will ensure they won’t get them,” said Michael Kofman, senior research scientist at CNA, a Washington-based think-tank.“The framing, even of the things in the Russian proposal that are plausible to discuss, is so inflammatory as to make it impossible,” said Samuel Charap, senior political scientist at the Rand Corporation, a US think-tank. “This is really about whether they’re willing to climb down from the maximalist demands and accept something less than the entire [set].”
290  Agreeing to talks with a belligerent power threatening to invade another country will inevitably be seen as a reward for intimidation. But the US and its Nato allies have no choice but to engage with Russia in a series of meetings this week to try to avert a conflagration in Ukraine, even if it feels part of a Kremlin protection racket. There may even be scope for compromise that would address some of Moscow’s purported security concerns and avert the threat of full-scale war. Whether Russian president Vladimir Putin is at all willing to engage in good faith is another question.Last month, Russia published its demands for a comprehensive rewriting of the European security system in two draft treaties, with the US and with Nato. Russian officials followed up with a barrage of threatening ultimatums. In both style and substance, this was no way to initiate talks. The texts contain far-fetched and one-sided demands that run counter to the founding principles of post-cold war European security, including each country’s right to choose its own foreign policy. The western allies could never accept these demands and Moscow knows it.Putin is fixated on stopping further enlargement of Nato. He claims that by expanding, the alliance betrayed assurances given at the end of the cold war — never mind that Russia acquiesced when it settled its own relationship with the organisation in 1998. For Moscow, keeping Ukraine out of Nato is central to its centuries-old insistence on creating a buffer zone on Russia’s borders.But explicitly to deny Nato membership to Ukraine, let alone Sweden or Finland, would contravene Nato’s founding treaty. Its members will not unanimously agree to change it. Nor should they reward Russian bullying. There is no appetite to bring Ukraine in at this stage, but it would be naive to think ending Kyiv’s Nato aspirations would end Russian destabilisation of Ukraine.US and European officials are rightly determined that these talks cannot be defined by Russia’s red lines. They will counter with their own. Russia’s violation of territorial integrity, denial of the right of nations to choose their own destiny, repeated aggression against Ukraine and destabilisation in various ways of other western democracies must all be on the table. The challenge for diplomats on both sides will be to identify areas of common ground within this melee that could serve as the basis for further talks and eventually structured negotiations.Fortunately, there are some, even if it means reinventing some of the treaty provisions that Russia has violated or neglected in the past. Russia’s lopsided demand that it and the US refrain from deploying ground-launched, intermediate-range missiles outside their national territories could be the basis for talks to replace the 1987 treaty on such weapons which collapsed in 2018 after Russian violations. Russia and Nato could explore new controls on conventional force deployment and exercises and agree to renewed transparency and communications. Nato has ruled out creating “second-class” members where it could not station troops. But it might conceivably reconsider deployments in frontline countries if Moscow made peace with Kyiv and accepted limits on placing its own forces or arms in Belarus or Kaliningrad.Progress will require goodwill on both sides and Russia shows none by holding a gun to Ukraine’s head. Russian de-escalation along Ukraine’s borders is a prerequisite for any substantive negotiations. Putin may have every intention of walking away and using the failure of talks as a pretext for attack. The west must hope for the best from its diplomacy while preparing for the worst by underlining its readiness to impose tough sanctions and to bolster Kyiv’s defences.Letters in response to this editorial comment:Russia’s desire for a buffer state is not a bad outcome / From David C Speedie, American Committee for US-Russia Accord, Charlottesville, VA, USMoscow’s demands would dismantle Nato’s deterrent / From James Sherr, Senior Fellow, Estonian Foreign Policy Institute, International Centre for Defence and Security, Tallinn, EstoniaPutin sets up talks for failure, to justify incursion / From Albion M Urdank, Emeritus Professor, British and European History, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, US
291  Policies to tackle climate change are likely to keep energy prices higher for longer and may force the European Central Bank to withdraw its stimulus more quickly than planned, one of its senior executives has warned.Isabel Schnabel, the ECB executive responsible for market operations, said the planned transition away from fossil fuels to a greener low-carbon economy “poses measurable upside risks to our baseline projection of inflation over the medium term”.After the economy rebounded from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, a sharp surge in energy prices drove inflation to 5 per cent in December, a record high for the eurozone. But the ECB has forecast energy prices will fade and has committed to maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy for at least another year.However, the inflationary impact of the green energy transition could force the central bank to reconsider this position, Schnabel said, speaking via video link to the annual meeting of the American Finance Association on Saturday.“There are instances in which central banks will need to break with the prevailing consensus that monetary policy should look through rising energy prices so as to secure price stability over the medium term,” Schnabel said.Energy prices in the 19 countries that share the euro rose 26 per cent in December from a year earlier, close to a record high set the previous month. Natural gas prices hit record highs in the region last year, driving wholesale electricity prices to €196 per megawatt hour in November — nearly quadruple average pre-pandemic levels — the ECB executive said.“While in the past energy prices often fell as quickly as they rose, the need to step up the fight against climate change may imply that fossil fuel prices will now not only have to stay elevated, but even have to keep rising if we are to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement,” Schnabel said.The German economics professor, who joined the ECB board two years ago, has emerged as the most vocal critic among its top executives of its vast bond-buying programme, which has acquired a €4.7tn portfolio of assets since it started seven years ago.The ECB last month responded to concern about rapidly rising prices by announcing a “step-by-step” reduction in its asset purchases from €90bn a month last year to €20bn a month by October. But other central banks — including the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England — are tightening policy more quickly and critics say the ECB should do the same.Schnabel outlined “two scenarios where monetary policy would need to change course”. One is if persistently elevated energy prices caused consumers to expect continued high levels of inflation and created a 1970s style wage-price spiral. But she said “so far” wages and union demands “remain comparatively moderate”.The second scenario is if policies to tackle climate change, such as a carbon tax and measures to compensate poorer households for higher energy costs, turn out to increase inflationary pressures — as recent studies suggest is already happening — she said.Philip Lane, the ECB’s chief economist, seems to disagree. He told Irish broadcaster RTE on Friday that while rising energy prices were “a major concern”, there was “less upside this year” and he was confident “supply will shift, pressures should ease in the aggregate this year”. Like most central banks, the ECB has been surprised by the persistence of upward pressure on prices. Last month it sharply raised its eurozone inflation forecast for this year to 3.2 per, while predicting it would drop back below its 2 per cent target next year.But Schnabel said this assumption was “derived from futures curves” showing that energy prices would not contribute to overall inflation in the next two years, adding that “these estimates could be conservative”. If oil prices stayed at November 2021 levels, she said it would be enough for the ECB to hit its inflation target in 2024.This story was corrected to reflect that Philip Lane is the ECB’s chief economist, not its chief executive.
292  Brussels is resisting pressure to change rules forcing airlines to use or lose their valuable landing slots after warnings of thousands of half-empty and polluting “ghost flights” operating this winter.German carrier Lufthansa has said it will be forced to operate 18,000 flights unnecessarily this winter to comply with EU rules which mean airlines have to regularly use their slots or give them up.Some EU governments are also demanding changes to Commission rules that require airlines to use 50 per cent of their slots this winter or hand them back to be reassigned, down from the normal 80 per cent.But Adina Valean, EU transport commissioner, told the Financial Times the rules “give airlines the needed flexibility to prevent empty flights”. She pointed out that flight data shows that air traffic this winter is around 77 per cent of pre-pandemic levels, and close to estimates of 79 per cent predicted for the start of the year.“While we need to remain cautious, it may indicate that the impact of the fourth wave and the Omicron variant on air travel may not be as negative and long-lasting as initially feared,” said Valean.The EU’s slot threshold is due to rise to 64 per cent in the summer, when demand for flying is expected to recover. When there are travel restrictions in place, airlines can claim force majeure and do not have to use the slots.Belgium’s transport minister George Gilkinet has also demanded changes to the system, warning that running ghost flights risk undermining the EU’s ambitious emissions reduction goals.In a letter to Valean, seen by the FT, Gilkinet calls for “fast action” to reduce the 50 per cent threshold and provide “new exemption possibilities [for carriers].at least for the winter season 2021/2022 and summer 2022, and until a way out of this coronavirus crisis can be confirmed.”Lufthansa’s uneconomical flights will still carry passengers who want to fly, but will be so quiet that the airline would cancel them if it could do so without losing future landing rights at key airports including Frankfurt.Reports this week that Brussels Airlines, owned by Lufthansa, was running around 3,000 empty flights this winter attracted criticism from prominent climate activist Greta Thunberg.Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr said the disruption caused by the Omicron variant meant regulators should have gone further this winter to prevent unnecessary flying.“While climate-friendly exemptions were found for this in almost all other parts of the world during the time of the pandemic, the EU does not allow this in the same way. That harms the climate and is exactly the opposite of what the EU Commission wants to achieve,” Spohr told German media.Take-off and landing rights at busy airports are some of airlines’ most valuable assets, and can change hands for tens of millions of pounds.The question over how to handle slots during the crisis has caused a rift in the aviation world, and pitted flag carriers such as Lufthansa against low-cost challengers like Ryanair and Wizz Air.Long-haul carriers, which have been badly hit by the crisis and are cut off from many of their routes, have argued the “use it or lose it” rules should be waived during the pandemic, while low-cost airlines, seeking to use the pandemic to mount a land grab, have pushed for full competition to return.Valean said some low-cost airlines had “quickly adapted to the new reality and often reached activity close to 2019 levels”. She defended the slot rules saying they were vital to protect airports, consumers, and competition between carriers.Brussels has the power to amend the slot thresholds until the summer using legal acts. After this period, the commissioner said the EU would assess “how to ensure that future airport slot rules provide for resilience in times of crisis and stimulate competition that benefits consumers and connectivity”.Air-France-KLM said it was “in favour of re-evaluating. rules so that airlines continue to operate flights only when demand justifies it”, but added that it would not operate empty flights just to keep slots.Airlines for Europe, a trade group, said it was in contact with the commission to make sure force majeure rules were “consistently and flexibly applied”.Letter in response to this article:Is a free market for airlines simply pie in the sky? / From Matthew G Andersson, President, Indigo Aerospace Chicago, IL, US
293  When I visited Athens over the holidays in 2020, I felt as if I were in a dictatorship, with strict evening curfews and mandatory text messages to be sent to a government agency before I could venture outdoors. In the hours after the curfew descended, it was so quiet it seemed as if the streets were laid with straw.This time, we were allowed to move freely, as long as we were able to show proof of vaccination and ID before entering indoor spaces such as restaurants and bars. In England, there have never been Covid curfews, nor do you have to explain to the authorities why you’re leaving your house, for which I am thankful. Taking the Tube every day, I often sat next to people without masks. But in Athens a friend was fined €300 for walking in Syntagma Square without one.Every time I drove to the city centre, there were anti-vaxxers protesting against Bill Gates, against big capitalism, against the supposed master plan to eliminate a large portion of the human race through a fake pandemic, ostensibly the greatest cover-up in recorded history. It reminded me of a sign I once saw outside a Baptist church in Alabama — “Whoever is praying for rain, please stop”.The anti-vaxxers are mockingly known in Greece as the “sprayed”, as they often belong to conspiracy theory groups claiming that government forces are spraying us from a high altitude in order to impair our cognitive faculties. As a result, we do not challenge authority and inject ourselves with dubious vaccines.Although the Orthodox church supports vaccination, a large number of priests, mostly in northern Greece, have opposed the jab, and many of their parishioners have died. According to the latest figures, the rate of full vaccination in Greece is 66 per cent; the government ban on unvaccinated people entering indoor public spaces, announced in November, seems to have had little effect. Omicron is spiking, with coronavirus cases running at some 35,000 a day.In mid-December the death of Giorgos Tragas, an unvaccinated celebrity commentator and head of the political movement Free People, caused a sensation. The Greek journalist, who died of complications of Covid-19, was a firebrand of the anti-vaccination movement. Damning on government mandates and lockdown measures, Tragas’s polemic against regulations had made him an influential, albeit controversial voice.The populist movement in Greece has its roots in a macho culture that validates virility and male identity by rejecting authority. In other words, if you do exactly as you’re told, you’re a doormat. According to an old Greek saying, a woman should never touch a lighter, a doorknob or a bottle; a man ought to light her cigarettes, open doors and pour the wine.The world is divided into facts and non-facts. Until a few centuries ago, people believed that tides existed just to help the ships come in, that spirits could tap into electric currents. It turns out that progress comes in a zigzag, not in a straight line.My favourite story on empirical evidence is about an early meeting of the Royal Society in London, allegedly attended by the king, regarding a bowl of water that scientists at the time assumed weighed the same with a goldfish in it as it did without. When a balance was brought, the experiment was carried out. The bowl was put on the balance, then the fish was added. Unsurprisingly, the bowl’s weight increased by exactly the weight of the fish.You can’t just walk into a restaurant any more, I reflected, as I fumbled with my NHS app to get inside a famous fish place. I couldn’t help thinking of Yuval Noah Harari’s grim predictions about data coming to rule all aspects of our lives.But there are still traditions in Greece untouched by the technological revolution. I know people who turn their empty coffee cups upside down on a saucer to have their future read by an aunt (the coffee dregs leave imprints and shapes that are interpreted); and friends of mine will sometimes pay €50 to go to a fortune teller in a shabby part of town to find out whether they will get a promotion at work or what will happen with the men they desire.And on January 1, a cake dedicated to St Basil is cut and divided among all members of each family to see who will win the lucky charm, usually a €2 coin (10 drachma before 2001) wrapped in tin foil and placed in a slit at the bottom of the cake so it’s not visible. Whoever finds it in their piece is the signified recipient of good luck for the year ahead.On New Year’s Eve, I had dinner with friends at one of the oldest Athenian restaurants, where I once had my wedding party. There were six of us at a round table, the maximum number allowed by government regulations. My friend complained that her nostrils were sore from excessive testing. Her 22-year-old daughter was ready to go to an illegal gathering.Before leaving, she took out her phone to show me an invite for an irreverent party called “Positive Vibes”, which you could attend only with a positive PCR test taken within the last 24 hours. The location was undisclosed and there was a complex process to go through to find out the address, as the fine for private parties starts at €50,000. Not to mention that anyone with Covid must self-isolate.In between courses and bottles of red wine, the talk was about the trials of two women, Ghislaine Maxwell and Elizabeth Holmes. I’d just rewatched 12 Angry Men (1957), probably the best film representation of the part of the US constitution that promises defendants a fair trial and the presumption of innocence. If the world is divided into facts and non-facts, this is a film about the importance of reasonable doubt.With dessert, an email pinged on my phone. It was a lab notification that the PCR test I had taken that morning proved I did not have Covid-19. This meant I could fly home to London. I could not check in unless I had uploaded a negative PCR test result and a passenger locator form, and I could not upload the latter unless I had a confirmation number for a pre-paid Day 2 test to be taken on arrival. The world as we knew it is gone.“Stay negative” was the text that circulated as the new year was about to arrive. There was no music allowed in the restaurant, as part of the current measures, but everyone was toasting to the end of the pandemic, to life resuming at full speed. A few minutes after midnight, my son called to say that in his grandmother’s house the cake has just been cut and the coin was found in my slice. Apparently, this is my year.
294  The second week of January is traditionally Burgundy Week in London. At the many tastings of 2020s that would usually be planned for next week, the vast majority of wines would be from the Côte d’Or, the east-facing “golden slope” of limestone and marl that produces Burgundy’s most revered and most expensive wines.Yet anyone who studies a map will see that the southern end of the Côte d’Or bleeds straight into the northern end of the Côte Chalonnaise wine region. It is named after its main town, Chalon-sur-Saône. To the west, Côte Chalonnaise wine country clusters round the villages of Bouzeron, Rully, Mercurey, Givry and Montagny. Their wines are generally much, much less expensive than those of the Côte d’Or but the soils and elevation are very similar, and many vineyards enjoy the same sort of aspect as most of those on the Côte d’Or, facing the rising sun.So why are Chalonnaise wines perceived to be so decidedly inferior? The reasons are more historical and political than geographical. Napoleon was keen to give strong focus and character to each of the new départements into which France had been divided after the French Revolution. The Côte d’Or was intended to focus on wine production, while to its immediate south, Saône-et-Loire, named after its two most famous rivers, was to focus on farming, especially Charolais beef, and industry. Montceau-les-Mines, west of wine country, was a mining centre, an important source of coal throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. The iron ore deposits around Le Creusot, north of Montceau, gave rise to a rash of vast factories during the industrial revolution.But everything changed. The ravages of the phylloxera louse towards the end of the 19th century left Côte Chalonnaise vineyards, like most on the planet, in a terrible state. Added to that, men returning from fighting in the first world war were lured to work in the factories, rather than vineyards. (The Côte d’Or had little industry to speak of, so viticulture there was much less seriously ruptured.) The result was that the best vineyard sites — those on the slopes that were the most difficult to work — were abandoned in favour of the more fertile plains. Quantity was prioritised over quality and the Côte Chalonnaise became known as a source of cheap vin de soif for local factory workers.The second world war was no kinder to vintners here. In the excellent and much-revised second edition of Inside Burgundy, Jasper Morris points out that the demarcation line between occupied and Vichy France cut right through the region and at least one citizen was arrested for visiting her garden in Vichy France from her house in the occupied zone.Yet the Côte Chalonnaise had a tradition of medieval monastic viticulture as venerable as the Côte d’Or. Viewed from this historical vantage point, it was only fairly recently, in the late 20th century, that the better vineyard sites were replanted.Since vines take years to produce their best wine, now is surely the moment for the second coming of the Côte Chalonnaise. Furthermore, there is quite a group of ambitious producers there today.One is Domaine A&P de Villaine in Bouzeron, just two miles from Santenay in the Côte d’Or. It makes some of the most distinctive wines in Burgundy: single-vineyard expressions of Burgundy’s “other” white wine grape, Aligoté, which has long been regarded as a poor substitute for Chardonnay because it’s more difficult to ripen. Yet climate change has revealed just how good fully ripe Aligoté can be, and this domaine makes many of the finest.The “A” in the name (now just Domaine de Villaine) refers to Aubert de Villaine, who has just retired from leading the Côte d’Or’s most famous wine estate by a mile, Domaine de la Romanée-Conti. For many years, he and his American wife Pamela lived in Bouzeron but they have now moved. Since 2000, the domaine has been run by Aubert’s nephew, Pierre de Benoist, whose parents own Sancerre’s Domaine du Nozay.Aligoté is beloved by de Benoist. “Immediately when I tasted the wine I felt similarities with the Sauvignon in Sancerre,” he says. It is certainly as high in acidity and makes a great aperitif.Still, most of the white wines of the Côte Chalonnaise are Chardonnays, just as the reds tend to be Pinot Noirs — exactly as it is in the Côte d’Or. When I visited the region in September, I was particularly taken by the single-vineyard Chardonnays of Domaine Feuillat-Julliot, which happen to be made by an all-female team. The great majority of grapes grown here in Montagny’s pretty, east-facing amphitheatre go to the large co-op in nearby Buxy. Yet Françoise Feuillat, daughter of the owner of the famous Mercurey domaine Michel Juillot, has grown her own domaine from eight to 15 hectares, replacing red wine vines with Chardonnay. She and her daughter Camille bottle everything themselves.The grandest domaine of the Côte Chalonnaise, in terms of its holdings, is the historic Domaine Thenard of Givry, which enjoys the enviable situation of being the second-biggest owner of the fabulously expensive white wine vineyard in the Côte d’Or, Le Montrachet, where it owns almost two whole hectares. Even the billionaire entrepreneur François Pinault has managed to acquire just 0.04ha of Le Montrachet vines. Both Dom Thenard and Pinault produce Le Montrachet, along with about 15 other owners of vines in this famous vineyard. Pinault’s is available in such small quantities that it is for personal use only.The Côte Chalonnaise also produces some fine reds. Ones to watch are those being made by Philippe Pascal and Guillaume Marko in the spectacular new four-floor, gravity-fed winery of the restored Cistercian Domaine du Cellier aux Moines on a steep slope overlooking Givry, which must be one of the region’s finer vineyard locations. This is just one property where young vines produce better-quality wine than the older vines because the previous owners planted poor-quality clones of Pinot Noir.In most wine regions, only the finest vineyards earn the title Premier Cru, or first growth. But in the Côte Chalonnaise, arguably far too many are designated as such. Perhaps it is the desire to signal clearly which are the best sites that has propelled what you might call rampant Premier Cru inflation in the Côte Chalonnaise. For example, almost 60 per cent of Montagny’s vineyards are classified as Premier Cru, which is so many as to stretch credibility. Further north, in Rully and Givry, the proportions (less than a quarter) are perhaps more useful.This is very much a region in transition but, as Anne-Cécile Lumpp, daughter of vigneron François Lumpp in Givry, assured me while showing off their latest vintage, the Côte Chalonnaise is on the rise.
295  In Moscow the hope is for “fairly quick results”, while Washington talks of uncertain outcomes. As US and Russian diplomats prepare for a summit in Geneva with Europe’s geopolitical balance at stake, the difference in mood music is stark.That Russia arrives at the table on Monday with more than 100,000 troops stationed menacingly on the border of neighbouring Ukraine, and has threatened military action if the talks come to nothing, is just part of its leverage.More importantly, President Vladimir Putin has already achieved the goal of forcing the US to discuss a slew of demands that would reshape Europe’s security architecture, with few areas of possible agreement that would not look like western capitulation.“Putin is going into these talks with a very strong hand. I think this meeting is misjudged,” said Judy Dempsey, senior fellow at Carnegie Europe. “The summit would only yield marginal success if the west went in united together and they had a serious negotiation strategy. And they don’t have one.”Russia viewed Europe through the cold war prism of a continent bisected between superpowers, Dempsey explained, which conflicts with the US and European view forged after the collapse of the Soviet Union.“How [the Americans] are going to actually square this circle is going to be very difficult. Putin is of the old school and will not give up on spheres of influence,” she added.Two lists of Russian demands submitted to the US and Nato last month include a ban on Ukraine and other former Soviet states joining the western military alliance, a prohibition on the deployment of any missiles close enough to hit Russia, and a Kremlin veto on where Nato troops and weapons can be stationed in almost all of its eastern flank members.The negotiations chime with two fundamental objectives that have defined Putin’s two-decade rule: a seat at the geopolitical top table opposite the US, and the prospect of halting Nato’s eastern expansion and shrinking the American military presence in Europe.“The very fact.that security guarantees are being discussed at all.is a huge breakthrough” for Russia, said Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of R. Politik, a Kremlin-focused political consultancy. “It’s never happened before.”For US negotiators, led by assistant secretary of state Wendy Sherman, a de-escalation of the Ukraine crisis is the primary goal. But how to achieve this without giving their Russian counterparts a prize to take home to Moscow that would weaken the security of Kyiv or Nato allies in eastern Europe appears a perilous task.Jen Psaki, White House press secretary, said this week that President Joe Biden believed the Geneva talks could “make progress on some issues, while others are not viable” — and that the US would not be “responding” to Moscow’s demands “point by point”.“We don’t know what next week’s conversations will bring but. we believe there are areas we can make progress on with Moscow. if they come to the table ready to do that,” she added.Biden is under growing pressure to defuse a crisis that threatens to ensnare his administration as it is trying to focus on other issues, mainly tackling the surging Omicron coronavirus variant and calming inflation.At the same time, the White House knows that any suggestion of it having caved to Russian demands would undermine its own claims of standing up to authoritarian leaders, likely trigger a bipartisan backlash on Capitol Hill and ring alarm bells among allies around the world that rely on US security guarantees.The Russian delegation, led by deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov, will also meet Nato officials on Wednesday in Brussels and members of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe the following day. But Moscow has made clear that it sees the US as its primary negotiating partner, and that Nato allies will follow Washington’s lead.“We hope.for a fairly quick result,” Ryabkov told Izvestiya newspaper on Thursday. “It will become clear whether rapid progress is possible.on the subjects that interest us.”R. Politik’s Stanovaya said Putin would only be satisfied with concrete progress in Geneva, given the extent to which Nato has already expanded into the former Soviet eastern Europe.“In reality, no one knows what will be enough.because it’s clear Putin won’t get everything on his list,” she added. “But on this first stage.some sort of concession on the part of the US will be necessary.”Complicating Sherman’s brief is the absence from the talks of both Ukraine and the EU, both of which have demanded a role in the talks but been successfully sidelined by Moscow.US officials have repeatedly stressed that no discussion of Ukraine can take place without Ukrainian present, and that European security was a matter for Europe and Nato. But ruling out both of those topics would leave little to discuss.The co-ordination between the US and Europe is complicated by persistent divides within the EU over both how to handle Russia, and Brussels’ role in the continent’s defence and security.France and Germany, who held their own talks in Moscow this week, are viewed with scepticism by some eastern EU states which see them as too willing to find an accommodation with the Kremlin. France is also leading a push to expand the EU’s ‘strategic autonomy’ and defence capabilities, a move that is opposed by other member states who reject anything that would weaken Nato’s role as their primary security guarantee.“The US and the Europeans.need a shopping list of what they want, not just what Russia wants,” said Dempsey at Carnegie Europe. “This [summit] is precisely about what Russia wants. We still do not know what [the west] wants from Russia.”“We are going to the table with nothing,” she added. “Absolutely nothing in our hands.”
296  Nato’s secretary-general has ruled out creating “second-class” members of the military alliance to appease Moscow, ahead of a week of high-stakes diplomacy between the Kremlin and western powers that aims to avoid a feared Russian invasion of Ukraine.Russia will hold talks with the US and Nato next week for discussions on security proposals drawn up by Moscow, which include a ban on Ukraine joining the US-led military alliance and giving the Kremlin a veto on military deployments in member states close to Russia.Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said these two proposals were unacceptable, after an extraordinary meeting of foreign ministers from the alliance convened to discuss the upcoming Russia talks.“We cannot end up in a situation where we have second-class Nato members, where Nato as an alliance is not allowed to protect them,” he told a press conference.Russia has deployed over 100,000 troops close to its border with Ukraine in recent months, a force that the US says could be used to attack the country. Russian president Vladimir Putin has denied any plans for an invasion, but warned that Moscow could take military steps if its security proposals were ignored.Stoltenberg suggested that arms control measures and possible confidence-building initiatives between Nato and Moscow were possible areas for agreement.“We are ready to engage in arms control with Russia, conventional and nuclear, but that has to be reciprocal,” he said. “That’s a different thing [to] imposing one-sided restrictions.”Putin’s proposal would require Nato to reject a key part of its founding treaty, under which the organisation can invite any willing European country to join if it contributes to security in the north Atlantic area.A Russian delegation will meet US officials in Geneva on Monday, before travelling to Brussels for a meeting with Nato on Wednesday. Russia will also take part in a broader discussion hosted by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe on Thursday.The Nato meeting came as French president Emmanuel Macron said he would be speaking to Putin in the “coming days”. The EU needed to undertake talks with Russia, Macron told reporters in Paris, adding that dialogue did not mean conceding anything.The EU has been sidelined from next week’s talks, and continues to struggle to develop a clear voice on the Ukraine stand-off or to insert itself into talks aimed at resolving it. This has left key powers including Germany and France as the main European interlocutors.The primary tool for resolving the crisis should not be military in nature, but diplomatic tools and dialogue, added a French official, insisting European capitals were displaying a “coherent and united” approach.
297  Kazakhstan’s president said on Friday that he had ordered security forces to “shoot to kill without warning”, after days of protests in the former Soviet country left government buildings destroyed and dozens dead.In a televised broadcast to the nation, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev depicted the unrest, which began with demonstrations last weekend over a rise in fuel prices, as a co-ordinated attack by a 20,000-strong army of bandits rather than a spontaneous protest. However, he said that order had now largely been restored following a “counter-terrorism operation” backed by Russian forces.“Those who do not surrender will be eliminated,” Tokayev said. “Law enforcement and the army have been given the order by me to shoot to kill without warning.”His speech marked an aggressive shift after earlier attempts to appease protesters failed to quell the increasingly politicised disorder.At least 26 protesters and 18 police officers have so far been killed in the violence, according to Kazakh officials, with more than 3,700 people arrested, Interfax cited Kazakh state television as saying.Tokayev accused the “so-called free media” of inciting unlawful activity and lambasted “so-called human rights defenders”.“All of these irresponsible demagogues became participants.and we will react severely to all acts of vandalism against the law,” he said.The street protests, the country’s worst since independence in 1991, began over a near-doubling of prices for a type of vehicle fuel but escalated quickly in a reflection of broader discontent.Tokayev has since vacillated between mollifying the demonstrators and threatening harsh measures.On Thursday, the government announced a 180-day price cap on vehicle fuel and utility rate rises. Meeting two of the protesters’ other demands, he has also accepted the resignation of the government and appeared to displace former president Nursultan Nazarbayev from a key security role, through which he continued to wield influence.But Tokayev also appealed for assistance from a Russia-led military alliance.The Collective Security Treaty Organization, which also includes Kazakhstan, Belarus, Armenia, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, started to deploy troops in Kazakhstan on a peacekeeping mission on Thursday.Kazakh and CSTO officials insist the troops will not fight the demonstrators, but rather guard government institutions and significant infrastructure, such as the international airport at Almaty.On Friday, the Russian defence ministry said Russian special forces, which arrived on 75 aircraft, plus Kazakh law enforcement personnel, had regained control of the airport. Control has also been re-established over all city halls in the country, some of which had been stormed by protesters.Kazakhstan’s deputy foreign minister said the total military presence of the CSTO will number about 2,500 troops.Tokayev said he had “decided to switch the internet back on in some areas.for limited intervals of time” after an internet blackout was imposed midweek.He also gave “a special word of thanks to the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin”, for reacting “swiftly” to his request for help. The Kremlin intervention, which took place ahead of security talks with the US and Nato about Ukraine, was its second in two years after Putin backed Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko in his crackdown on protests in 2020.Chinese president Xi Jinping told Tokayev on Friday that China was ready to offer Kazakhstan the help it needed to overcome difficulties, China’s Global Times newspaper reported. Tokayev had taken appropriate measures to quell unrest, the paper cited Xi as saying.
298  Driven by soaring energy and food prices, annual price growth in the euro area — as measured by the harmonised index of consumer prices — outstripped the expectations of economists polled by Reuters, who had on average predicted a 4.7 per cent rise, slightly down from 4.9 per cent in November. The surprise increase is likely to put pressure on the European Central Bank to reduce its monetary stimulus quicker than planned. Although most economists expect inflation to begin to ebb from January onwards, it is forecast to remain above the ECB’s 2 per cent target for much of this year.“This should be the peak, but headline inflation will stay elevated at least until late summer, especially as higher wholesale energy prices are passed through to retail consumers and other parts of the economy,” said Carsten Brzeski, head of global macro research at ING. “Several corporate clients have told us they will increase prices over the course of 2022.”Inflation has risen sharply in recent months as the eurozone economy rebounds from the shock of the pandemic, activity restrictions have been lifted and supply struggles to keep pace with demand, driving up energy costs and creating shortages of many materials. Eurostat said prices were up 0.4 per cent from the previous month, driven by an acceleration of price rises for food, alcohol, tobacco and other goods. Energy prices rose 26 per cent from a year earlier, a slight slowdown from the previous month.Excluding more volatile energy and food prices, core inflation was steady at 2.6 per cent. Most economists expect eurozone inflation to start falling in the coming months as the effect of Germany’s pandemic-driven temporary cut in sales tax disappears from the data, energy prices stabilise and global supply chain bottlenecks ease.However, European wholesale natural gas prices almost doubled to record highs in the run-up to Christmas and jumped again this week after supplies from Russia slowed. Supply chain bottlenecks continue to cause delays and higher costs for manufacturers, pushing up the price of many consumer goods.“The fast pass-through of surging wholesale costs into retail utility bills in Spain, and to a lesser extent Italy, despite government intervention, was the key upside surprise for us in December,” said Jacob Nell, head of European economics at Morgan Stanley. The ECB responded to mounting concern about rapidly rising prices last month by saying its €1.85tn pandemic-response bond buying scheme would stop net purchases in March as part of a “step-by-step” reduction of its quantitative easing policy.The central bank also sharply raised its eurozone inflation forecast to 2.6 per cent for 2021 and 3.2 per cent for 2022, while predicting it would drop back below its 2 per cent target next year.Philip Lane, ECB chief economist, said 5 per cent inflation sounds “so strange” after a long period of ultra-low price growth in the eurozone. But he told Irish broadcaster RTE, “we do think inflation pressures will ease over the course of this year” so the case for raising rates “is not there”.Investors continue to bet that high inflation will force the ECB to start raising interest rates from deeply negative levels earlier than it expects. Money market futures are pricing in a 0.1 percentage point increase in the ECB’s deposit rate in October.Jack Allen-Reynolds, senior Europe economist at Capital Economics, said eurozone inflation was likely to remain above 2 per cent “at least until the fourth quarter” and predicted that as a result the ECB would “begin to prepare the ground for tighter monetary policy in 2023”.
299  Welcome back to Moral Money, at the end of a week in which the Omicron coronavirus variant continued to wreak havoc across much of the world. The US recorded more than 1m confirmed cases in a single day. In developed countries, governments are rolling out booster shots and leaning ever harder on the minority of citizens who have refused to get vaccinated. But their counterparts in developing nations are struggling to get hold of vaccines at all. Fewer than 8 per cent of Africa’s 1.3bn people have been fully inoculated against Covid-19.The companies that produce the vaccines are facing increasingly forceful calls to address this disparity (see our post on this from last month). Yesterday a group of 65 institutional investors with $3.5tn in assets wrote to Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, asking them to link executive and board pay to “the global availability of vaccines”. Achmea, the Dutch institution that organised the letter, said it planned to vote against executive packages that did not have this link.The letter reflects growing pressure on companies to link their leaders’ pay with their environmental and social impacts. More than two-thirds of institutional investors want to see more of these links, according to an Edelman survey last year. While many companies have focused on paying executives for performance on carbon emissions targets, we can expect to see more of these calls for them to take social effects into consideration too.Still, there’s been plenty more to think about beyond the Covid-19 chaos. We’ve seen a fresh burst of controversy over the EU’s landmark green taxonomy, and over the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining. More on both of those below. See you next week. Simon MundyWhere the debate around European sustainability rules is concerned, 2022 has started with a bang. On New Year’s Day, a leak revealed that the European Commission was planning to include nuclear and gas power projects in its “sustainable finance taxonomy”, a classification system to steer investment towards green projects. The news has triggered a stand-off between various European politicians. But what are the market implications?According to Nathan Fabian of the UN’s Principles for Responsible Investment initiative, the inclusion of gas and nuclear risks sapping investor confidence in the taxonomy and undermining its central purpose: galvanising a surge of capital towards low-carbon projects.Fabian has a powerful voice in this debate as chair of the European Platform on Sustainable Finance, an expert advisory panel convened by the European Commission. “Markets like clarity, they like low transaction costs,” he told me. If the taxonomy became a widely trusted guide to which assets were truly climate-friendly, he said, it would reduce the need for investors to carry out their own expensive assessments on that front. On the other hand, he added, “the harder you make it to use the tools, where there [are] blurry lines, that’s a scale killer. I think there is absolutely a risk there.”There are multiple conditions around the sort of projects that will pass muster even if the current proposal does go through. Any natural gas plant receiving the seal of approval, for example, would need to have relatively low emissions, and must displace a more polluting fossil fuel installation.In any case, it’s far from clear that the latest proposals will make it into the final version of the taxonomy. The proposal will face opposition in the European parliament from the likes of Dutch lawmaker Paul Tang, who told me last month of his resolve to resist an “unholy alliance” between French nuclear advocates and eastern European gas proponents, all keen to protect their domestic industrial interests.The long-running, deeply politicised controversy over the taxonomy is already sparking unhappy mutterings among investors in Europe. Financial institutions had been invited to start disclosing from this month how far their portfolios aligned with the new framework, but the taxonomy’s details remain under discussion.“Seeing how this process has unfolded, it almost undermines the credibility of it,” said Lennart Hermans, environmental research head at London-based Osmosis Investment Management. “These regulations are changing even as they come into place, which is confusing for everyone.”Isobel Edwards, green bond analyst at Netherlands-based NN Investment Partners, said that funds with serious commitments to sustainability were unlikely to suddenly overhaul their investment strategies on the strength of the EU’s labelling exercise. But fund managers were coming under pressure from their investors, she added, to explain how far their portfolios would align with the EU’s taxonomy.And that means, according to the PRI’s Fabian, that branding gas power as sustainable in the taxonomy risks boosting investment in an energy source that should already be on the way out. In its recent report setting out a road map for limiting global warming to 1.5C, the International Energy Agency warned that gas plants should be eliminated entirely in developed nations by 2035. “There’s a risk that capital will be channelled into projects that may become stranded assets,” he said. Simon MundyThis week, the government of Kosovo did something green warriors should note: it implemented a ban on cryptocurrency mining, since it believes this activity is consuming far too much electricity at a time of energy shortages. Some ESG activists might be tempted to shrug their shoulders; the crypto sector has sometimes had such a questionable reputation — because it has been associated with money laundering in the past — that high-minded sustainability investors have usually shunned it before.But the news from Kosovo is actually part of a wider trend: the energy consumption from crypto is increasingly being put under the spotlight. And that enhanced scrutiny might, just possibly, end up creating a green(er) type of crypto in the future.The big issue at stake, as a report from Sustainable Funds Monitor recently noted, is the high levels of energy usage — and associated carbon emissions — of the computer “mining process” that creates digital tokens. Figures from DRG data centres show that in 2017 bitcoin consumed 707KWh energy per transaction, 11 times the level of ethereum, the second-biggest platform. That means that “bitcoin’s annualised electrical energy consumption is equivalent to that of the country of Thailand”, the report says. And since 2017, consumption has soared.This is sparking action, as I explain in my column. The Rocky Mountain Institute has partnered with dozens of crypto companies to pledge to adopt a 2030 net zero target, aping what is happening in the mainstream banking world. It hopes to hit this by embracing carbon offsets, switching electricity generation to renewable sources — and adopting tech innovations such as the “proof of stake” algorithms (which are less energy-intensive) instead of “proof of work” systems (that consume vast quantities of energy).Bitcoin, the largest asset, is not adopting PoS anytime soon; however, big players in the ethereum platform say they will embrace PoS in the middle of this year — if their current tests perform well (“If” is the important word here, since ethereum’s PoS plans have been delayed before).If this all falls into place, it will reduce crypto’s overall carbon footprint. But it may also create a bifurcation in the market. As mainstream investors embrace crypto-products, they are increasingly likely to insist that these are traceably “green” — and some companies will rush to meet this demand. Indeed, American TV stations such as CNBC are already airing ads for eco-conscious green blockchain services.However, another part of the market that is not targeting mainstream investors will remain murky, in every sense. That means that in crypto-land — like almost every other business sphere — data on energy generation (and much else) will be increasingly important. And Moral Money predicts that this scrutiny of tech energy usage will not end with bitcoin; far from it, 2022 could be the year when eco-warriors start paying far more attention to the energy consumption patterns — and carbon footprint — of all the data centres that power the internet. The geeks should be warned. Gillian TettThe anniversary of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol prompted some business groups to condemn those perpetuating the falsehood of a stolen election, but also elicited calls from activists for businesses to do more to support voting rights and rethink their political contributions.A new Conference Board survey shows that executives in charge of companies’ political spending feel plenty of pressure — but far more of that is coming from employees than from investors. There should be more focus on investors’ relative silence on the issue, rather than singling out companies for criticism, said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, the Yale School of Management professor.Announcements from shareholder activists including the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility this week also suggest that companies can expect more shareholder resolutions on this theme in 2022.

300  Turkey spent more than $7bn on propping up the lira in December, official data showed, as analysts warned that backdoor interventions meant that the true toll of the currency defence was even higher.The country’s central bank announced a return to the contentious policy of selling foreign currency to support the lira in December as president Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s insistence on cutting interest rates despite soaring inflation sent the currency plummeting to record lows.Data published on Friday showed that, during its five officially announced inventions last month, the bank burnt through a total of $7.3bn.The central bank spent billions of dollars more from its dwindling foreign currency reserves on undeclared interventions that were conducted through Turkey’s state banks, analysts said. These sales heated up after an emergency package announced late last month by Erdogan that aimed to boost savings and support the lira, according to market participants.The lira rallied strongly after Erdogan’s plans were unveiled, pulling back from a record low of 18.36 against the US dollar to around 11 by December 23. However, it has since weakened to almost TL14.The multibillion dollar intervention has cast a fresh spotlight on the adequacy of Turkey’s foreign currency war chest in a country that has a large external debt burden, with $170bn coming due in the next 12 months.Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, warned this week that the nation’s gross reserves had “fallen significantly” in the final month of 2021, declining by about $15bn to $111bn. That drop is partly explained by a sale of foreign currency to Botas, the country’s state-run energy importer, that totalled $3.4bn last month, according to new data published on Friday.But Goldman Sachs said that the figures also suggested that “sizeable [foreign currency] interventions may have been used to support the lira” around the time of Erdogan’s announcement.It said that net reserves, excluding money borrowed from Turkish banks and from other global central banks, stood at minus $66bn, according to Goldman estimates.Tim Ash, an analyst at BlueBay Asset Management, said that Turkey’s stock of reserves “looks weak” compared with its foreign obligations. Asking how long the central bank could continue defending the currency, he said: “The answer is not very long if it continues to keep up the pace of intervention seen in December.”Erdogan, a life-long opponent of high interest rates, ordered the central bank to reduce its policy rate by 5 percentage points to 14 per cent in the last four months of 2021 despite warnings about the impact on the country’s soaring inflation.When taking into account inflation that stood at an official rate of 36 per cent in December, the rate cuts have pushed the country’s real interest rate to minus 22 per cent. That has deterred investors from saving in lira and piled huge pressure on the currency, which lost about 45 per cent of its value against the dollar last year.The new savings schemes unveiled by the government were an attempt to reverse a trend that has led to Turkish savers flocking to foreign currency in a bid to protect their savings from currency fluctuations and inflation.But initial data suggest that there has been limited appetite for the new products, which promise to protect savers from currency risk through a guarantee that the state will compensate them for any exchange rate losses. Nureddin Nebati, Turkey’s finance minister, said on Tuesday that TL84bn had been deposited in the new accounts. That compares with total banking sector deposits — in both local currency and foreign currency — of TL3.2tn held by individuals, according to data from the banking regulator.Turks’ foreign currency savings remained largely stable in the fortnight after the announcement — a trend that suggests that most of the demand came from locals switching pre-existing lira savings into the new accounts, rather than selling dollars and euros to buy lira, according to Barclays analysts.
301  Bonjour and welcome to Europe Express.Our main story comes from Paris, where Emmanuel Macron and Ursula von der Leyen are set to address the media this morning. With the EU presidency firmly in French hands, we will take a look at the Elysée’s ambitions for a more “sovereign” Europe and where reality is likely to bite.On the Brexit front, we will explore why the rejection of a case by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg could have a positive impact on EU-UK relations.And with the Netherlands announcing the appointment of a dedicated minister for pensions, we will unpack the main elements of a pending reform of the country’s $1.7tn retirement system.Emmanuel Macron has left no doubt that he wants to lead a Europe with more swagger in its step as he takes over the EU’s rotating presidency, writes Sam Fleming in Paris.With commissioners visiting Paris for the opening of the six-month presidency, French officials have been setting out more detail on what exactly this reassertion of European “sovereignty” will mean. In the process, the discussions have exposed the many contradictions that flow from the French agenda.The philosophy is fairly clear. Faced with a world driven by brutish great power conflicts, a more aggressive China and an unreliable US, Europe must reassert itself as a sovereign actor. The supply chain disruptions laid bare during the Covid-19 crisis only underscore the urgency of this cause.Paris has set its sights on a March summit as the moment to push Macron’s more interventionist approach, with an industrial and economic relaunch permitting Europe to be a “master of its own destiny”. In Brussels, this means pursuing EU initiatives to crack down on foreign subsidies that distort the single market; tougher tools to counter coercive trade practices; a carbon border adjustment mechanism to tackle polluting imports; an international deal requiring multinationals to pay more tax where they do business; and twin pieces of legislation aimed at Big Tech companies.A central plank alongside all this is a bid for an industrial relaunch that will claim to boost European self-reliance in critical sectors including greener technologies such as batteries and hydrogen, as well as semiconductors, the data cloud and pharmaceuticals.This will involve a number of so-called important projects of common European interest — big industrial initiatives that marshal public sector support (subject to commission state aid approval). This will be allied with a pitch for strategic public investments in those areas to get favourable treatment under a reformed Stability and Growth Pact — as indicated by Macron and Italy’s prime minister Mario Draghi in an FT column late last year.France reckons the winds in Europe are blowing in favour of this more interventionist vision. But it will still bump up against uncomfortable political and economic realities.A revised SGP might do more to propel public investment, for example, but as the commission has repeatedly pointed out, the lion’s share of spending in the digital and green transition will have to come from the private sector.The two projects aimed at unleashing bigger flows of finance — the Banking Union and the Capital Markets Union — remain badly stalled, and officials are not talking up the prospects of progress during the French presidency.The risk with state-driven initiatives aimed at reshoring industry is that they end up splashing public money on ill-considered projects — one of the worries surrounding the EU’s semiconductor ambitions. And for all the talk of furthering pan-European interests, it tends to be the big member states that clinch the most enticing projects.Politically, the idea of carving out large chunks of public investment is still seen in the most frugal states as the thin end of a wedge that could denude the budget rules of credibility. Officials also suspect any deal on the SGP is unlikely to land until after the French presidency — potentially late this year or in 2023.Meanwhile, talk of the EU becoming a more credible sovereign actor on the global stage will continue to clash with realpolitik. Nowhere is this more obviously apparent than in the Russia-Ukraine crisis, where the EU is still confined to playing a peripheral role.In another sign that Ireland’s economy is booming despite the Covid-19 pandemic, tax revenues hit a record of €68.4bn, an increase of €11.2bn, or about 20 per cent, from 2020. Corporation tax receipts — which under an OECD deal are set to rise to 15 per cent from Ireland’s long-cherished 12.5 per cent rate — rose almost 30 per cent to €15.3bn. (Full report here)Late last year, as tough talks on ironing out post-Brexit trade rules for Northern Ireland hit the rocks, the UK climbed down on its refusal to accept oversight from the EU’s top court. So a ruling this week by another European court might bring Brexiters some cheer, writes Jude Webber in Dublin.The European Court of Human Rights (which is a pan-European, not an EU, body), has thrown out the so-called gay cake case, brought by activist Gareth Lee against an evangelical bakery in Belfast that refused to ice a cake for him with the words “Support Gay Marriage”. The Strasbourg-based court found that the plaintiff had asked it to “usurp the role of the domestic courts”.“Victory for UK government at ECHR,” Joshua Rozenberg, a prominent legal commentator wrote on Twitter. “The decision is final and will be welcomed by the UK government.”According to the court, Lee had “failed to exhaust domestic remedies” in the case. The ECHR ruled that Lee, who had won his case in the lower courts before losing at the Supreme Court, had not raised the issue of human rights during the seven-year saga.In 2018, the Supreme Court found Ashers Bakery did not break discrimination laws by refusing to decorate the cake as Lee requested because of their opposition to same-sex marriage, which was illegal at the time in Northern Ireland. Lee said he was frustrated that the core issues of the case at the ECHR did not get “fairly analysed because of a technicality”.As for the UK’s objections to the European Court of Justice being the ultimate arbiter of trade rules in Northern Ireland, which remains in the EU’s single market after Brexit, that issue appears parked for now while the sides thrash out practical ways to improve the flow of goods. Talks resume next week between the UK’s new Brexit honcho, foreign minister Liz Truss, and the EU’s Maros Sefcovic.The Netherlands has followed neighbouring Belgium and appointed its first dedicated pensions minister as the Dutch government undertakes sweeping reforms aimed at making its $1.7tn retirement system more sustainable, writes Josephine Cumbo in London.Carola Schouten is expected to take up the role as minister for poverty policy, participation and pensions when the fourth Mark Rutte government is inaugurated next week. Previously, oversight of the retirement system, regarded as one of the world’s best, had fallen under the purview of the ministry of social affairs and employment.The appointment of Schouten, who has served as deputy prime minister and agriculture minister since 2017, comes as the Dutch retirement income system undergoes a sweeping overhaul aimed at improving sustainability.Most pensions in the Netherlands are “defined benefit”, promising guaranteed retirement benefits for life. However, this system came under pressure after the 2008 financial crisis, which strained scheme funding ratios and led to benefit cuts for many pensioners.Rules coming into force no later than January 2023 will see this system swept away in favour of a “defined-contribution” model, in which pension funds will no longer make promises about the amount in benefits they intend to pay out to members.
302  When Reuters advertised an opening for its first Athens correspondent position in 1982, Bruce Clark didn’t think twice. Greece had mesmerised him ever since a childhood visit to the port and ancient cult centre of Delos spurred him to learn Ancient Greek at school and later, as a student, to spend a few months in Athens.Now, decades later, he has converted his love and experience of Athens into an exhaustive yet compelling history of the Greek capital. In just over 500 pages, Athens, City of Wisdom ranges from the golden days of millennia past to the ravages of the eurozone crisis and the coronavirus pandemic.It’s an almost Herculean task, and yet the author manages to keep the reader engaged as he moves through thousands of years of history marshalling countless bits of detail — from the old fables to an encounter with the father of Yanis Varoufakis, Greece’s fiery finance minister during the euro crisis.Athens is not alone in having a long and rich history. Yet Clark (a former diplomatic correspondent for the FT) argues that like Jerusalem, it justifiably commands a special place in the western imagination. Early on in the book, he draws a comparison between the Acropolis — “revered as a testament to human reason, skill and freedom” — and the Temple Mount, “the home of monotheism”.Given such a sweep of history, it’s a story that brings with it a multitude of moments — highs and lows; glorious triumphs and bitter defeats — which the author presents in 21 detail-packed chapters, each focusing on a critical moment in the history of Athens.Yes, readers will be familiar with stories of the cradle of democracy and western civilisation. But here they also get the more troubled, and less well-known, centuries of the Byzantine and Ottoman eras. Athens drifted into insignificance during the 400 years of Turkish occupation, an era during which the Acropolis turned into a mosque, adding a minaret to the Athenian skyline.Yet the legacy of ancient times somehow survived. Clark vividly brings to life the first Olympic marathon of modern times, drawing on the reports of an earlier generation of foreign correspondents who covered the event in 1896 when Greek athlete Spyros Louis crossed the finish line in the Kallimarmaro stadium.Among the author’s other, more chilling finds are the final broadcast in April 1941 of Athens Radio before the city fell to the Nazis and years of terror. As a native Athenian, I also read with horror that during the post-1945 civil war, Greek Communists gave orders for the Acropolis to be blown up, an instruction that was thankfully ignored by the commander who received it.Yet it is perhaps the more modern times that are the most remarkable. While in the earlier chapters, Clark encounters his subject with the objective coolness and distance of a historian, he later draws on his own reporting and experiences to shed light on the ugliness and charms of the sprawling city that Athens has become.When Clark arrived in the city, Greece was undergoing rapid change. A seven-year military dictatorship had ended a few years earlier in 1974, and the first socialist leader, Andreas Papandreou, had just taken over the reins of government. Greece had also just joined the European Economic Community (later the EU), and a sense of progress was in the air as the country was transforming socially and economically.In the 1980s, Clark writes, Athens “had the dirtiest air of any major city in the European Community”, illegal buildings were popping up everywhere and its politics were rife with corruption and scandals. After a short period of growth fuelled by cheap loans, courtesy of low eurozone interest rates, Greece in 2009 descended into the biggest economic crisis of any advanced economy in modern times. In just a few years, citizens saw their incomes shrink about 25 per cent and the centre of Athens became a stage for violent protest shrouded in tear gas and the smoke and flames from Molotov cocktails.Yet, as the author reminds us, this wasn’t a new experience for the city. In both ancient and modern Athens, “passionate” arguments could “sway people’s feelings and determine what actually happens, in unpredictable ways”. However, as Clarks adds, the difference is that those policy dilemmas in ancient Athens were those of a powerful state where citizens were wondering how precisely they should use that power. In modern Athens, discussions and demonstrations were about “how to conduct oneself from a position of weakness”.Such moments of historical awareness neatly underpin a story that brings together the personal and historical. In one aside, Clark describes how he was in the audience on June 12 1986 when a classics student called Boris Johnson chaired a debate on the Parthenon marbles at the Oxford Union, in which he argued passionately for their return from the British Museum to Athens — an issue that remains unresolved to this day.Such wrangles and other present-day troubles, notwithstanding, Clark’s affection for a city that he still sees as a symbol of democracy is unmissable and highly informative. This native Athenian reviewer certainly came away with many fresh insights into her home town.Athens: City of Wisdom by Bruce Clark, Head of Zeus £25, 512 pagesEleni Varvitsioti is the FT’s Greece and Cyprus correspondentJoin our online book group on Facebook at FT Books Café
303  Thirty years after the fall of the Soviet Union, the protests that have shaken Kazakhstan may mark the end of Nursultan Nazarbayev’s long grip on power — but do not suggest the oil-rich central Asian country will make a smooth transition from autocratic rule.Nazarbayev had ruled the country for most of Kazakhstan’s post-Soviet history, stepping down in 2019 to hand his official role as president to a designated successor, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. But Nazarbayev hung on to his role as chair of the national security council, prolonging his grip on the closely controlled state.In the wake of the spiralling protests this week, however, Tokayev — once seen as nothing but an administrative appointee — has publicly assumed control of the security forces from the man who put him in the presidency. Nazarbayev, the 81-year-old “leader of the nation” and for whom the capital city is now named — has been sidelined, with rumours even suggesting he may have left Kazakhstan.“The Nazarbayev regime and consequently the semi-transition of power which began with his resignation in 2019 are now both over,” said George Voloshin, Paris-based geopolitical analyst at Aperio, a consultancy.It leaves western investors, who have substantial interests in Kazakhstan’s rich oil and gas fields, eyeing a period of upheaval.For Russia — which sent a contingent of troops to Kazakhstan as part of a regional mutual assistance treaty and is readying for talks with the US on Ukraine and European security — it produces more unwelcome uncertainty on its border.Ben Godwin, associate director at political risk consultancy Prism, now expects “elite infighting”. “Tokayev has taken over power from Nazarbayev but the Nazarbayev people still control everything, including strategic industries such as oil and gas, banking and mining,” he said.“If Tokayev is able to secure power, there will be a long period of renegotiating with the remaining oligarchs,” Godwin added.The protests swelled from demonstrations that followed the doubling of the price of liquefied petroleum gas, the main fuel for vehicles, after price controls were lifted on January 1. The discontent over fuel prices quickly turned into broader hostility towards Nazarbayev.“The fact that localised economically motivated grievances in the western part of the country quickly spread to other regions indicates that there was a lot of pent-up dissatisfaction with the government in the general public,” said Alex Melikishvili, an analyst at IHS Markit.There was anticipation after the 2019 presidential transition of political liberalisation but Tokayev’s doctrine of a “listening state” — which was supposed to make the government more responsive to people’s needs — “has not really brought tangible results in terms of overall democratisation”, said Melikishvili. “This spring will mark three years since Tokayev has been in power and there are still no opposition parties in Kazakhstan.”The worsening economic situation in the country has exacerbated discontent. Kazakhstan’s commodities-dependent economy has been suffering since 2014 when oil prices crashed. The pandemic added more strain, with higher prices, a widening wealth gap and the state failing to help the most vulnerable in an adequate way, according to analysts.The protests “have to do with the bad economic situation and the lack of political reforms to tackle the chronic deficit of political competition and the domination of the Nazarbayev family and affiliated clans within the economy”, said Aperio’s Voloshin.Tokayev initially responded to the protests with concessions, including cutting LPG prices to below last year’s level and sacking the government. But he changed tack immediately after gaining control of the security council, declaring a state of emergency in the entire country.He also called in troops from the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization, a mutual defence treaty that also includes Armenia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Moscow’s quick deployment of troops is unprecedented for the CSTO: the alliance created in 1992 declined to intervene in ethnic clashes in Kyrgyzstan in 2010 and to support Armenia against Azerbaijan in 2021.Russia, the powerbroker in the region, is interested in retaining stability in Kazakhstan, with which it shares its longest border of almost 8,000km. The countries have close economic links and Russia maintains several military bases and the Baikonur space rocket launch site on Kazakhstan soil.“The next two days will be defining for Tokayev, who has to show a tough response, especially in Almaty,” said Stanislav Pritchin, senior research fellow at the Center for Post-Soviet Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences.Protesters have stormed stores, banks and supermarkets in the country’s most populous city.Prism’s Godwin said Kazakhstan’s western oil-producing region, where the first protests arose on Sunday and which has a history of demonstrations, would remain a problem in the long run. “These people are very different to the people in Almaty and Nur-Sultan. They are extremely determined and extremely angry. And as we saw in 2011, they are prepared to camp out for months,” he said.Zhanaozen, a city in Mangystau province, has been the scene of frequent protests in recent years over low wages and rising prices. A 2011 protest by striking oil workers turned violent after police attempted to clear their camps.Given that some of the protesters’ demands are hardly realistic, it may be tough for Tokayev to satisfy them, analysts said — or, despite the government shake-up, to reform Kazakhstan’s ruling structures.“The new government is unlikely to be qualitatively different from their predecessors because the pool of qualified cadres in Kazakhstan’s ruling circles is limited,” said IHS Markit’s Melikishvili.
304  Steel group ArcelorMittal’s bank accounts in Ukraine have been frozen by a court after a senior executive at the company was accused of tax evasion in the latest attack on the group by the authorities.The multinational company, one of the world’s leading steel producers, is Ukraine’s largest foreign direct investor and has faced several investigations over tax in the past few years.The Luxembourg-based group bought the steel mill in Kryviy Rih — Ukraine’s largest and one of the biggest in Europe — from the state for $5.2bn in 2005. It says it has pumped an additional $4.8bn into the country since then.A Ukraine court ruled in favour of a request from the prosecutor-general’s office for the freezing of accounts, resulting in the halt of financial transactions, as fears mount over a Russian military attack. Russia has deployed more than 100,000 troops close to the Ukraine border and demanded that the US and Nato agree to security pledges banning former Soviet states from joining the western military alliance and restricting where US troops could be stationed in eastern Europe.Ukraine court documents accused the group’s chief financial officer in Ukraine of failing to pay tax arrears of 2.24bn hryvnias ($81m). The allegations are based on investigations conducted by the counter-intelligence agency Security Service (SBU) and are the latest in a number of court cases and probes against the company over tax.The CFO, who was named by ArcelorMittal as Serhiy Plichko, could not be reached for comment.But ArcelorMittal, on his behalf, defended him against the accusations. Yaryna Klyuchkovska, an ArcelorMittal spokesperson, said tax evasion cases should not fall under the “purview of the SBU’s investigative powers” and the freezing of assets order in Kyiv “was based on an individual, not the company”.“The company considers these charges baseless and a clear example of political pressure on a major foreign investor,” a separate company news release stated.“Still, the criminal charges, however contrived, are brought against an individual, not the company. There is no current tax related civil proceeding against ArcelorMittal Kryviy Rih and therefore no legal grounds to freeze the company’s accounts.”Klyuchkovska noted that the company had won previous court rulings related to alleged tax evasion in its name and found it puzzling why a corporate officer would be targeted individually, which is a criminal, not administrative case.The prosecutors said on their telegram channel, used to broadcast official messages, that their action was aimed to “compensate for the damage caused to the budget of Ukraine”.
305  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
306  The bloodshed in Kazakhstan is a bitter end to 30 years in which the ex-Soviet republic had seemed — despite occasional flurries of unrest — an example of stable authoritarianism. Former president Nursultan Nazarbayev had suppressed demand for democratic freedoms by pushing through liberalising economic reforms that sucked in foreign investment and raised living standards. Now, facing the biggest protests in years, presidential successor Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has sacked the government and removed Nazarbayev as head of the security council. Authorities say dozens of protesters and at least 12 police have been killed in escalating violence. A Russian-led military alliance has sent in paratroopers as “peacekeepers”.One lesson for democracies and autocracies alike is the explosive political risk of rising energy prices — even in a country, like Kazakhstan, with big reserves. Initially peaceful protests were triggered by a rise in liquid petroleum gas prices, used widely to fuel cars in the country’s west. They turned into an outpouring of pent-up anger over corruption, lack of political choice and the dominance of the 81-year-old Nazarbayev’s family and allies in top political and industrial roles.With no clear leaders or demands, and an upsurge in looting that suggests they may have been infiltrated by criminal groups — or provocateurs — the protests might have struggled to gain the critical mass to turn into a revolution. But Tokayev was sufficiently unsure of his own security forces’ ability to put them down that he invited in the Moscow-based Collective Security Treaty Organization to help restore order. For the first time in its 20-year history, the regional pact is taking part in what it calls joint “anti-terrorism” operations.Moscow had reason to accept the request. Alongside Belarus and Russia, Kazakhstan is one of the founders of the Eurasian Economic Union that Vladimir Putin has assembled as a kind of anti-EU and pressed other ex-Soviet states to join. All three countries are also dominated by ageing autocrats. Russia has already had to prop up the Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko after mass protests in 2020. Now it is doing so again in Kazakhstan — where Nazarbayev’s decision to relinquish the presidency in 2019 but remain life-long “Leader of the Nation” had been seen as a potential model for Putin.Russia’s intervention may prevent the arrival of a new, unfriendly, government in its sphere of influence, in contrast to the revolutions in Ukraine in 2014 and Georgia in 2003. But, as in Belarus, if the Tokayev regime survives, a crackdown on opposition is likely to follow. Discontent will only be driven underground to fester.Kremlin-linked analysts suggest the CSTO deployment is aimed at heading off a potential civil conflict after weapons appeared among Kazakh protesters. But it may stoke popular resentment, and will leave the country’s leadership, like that in Minsk, more beholden to Russia. China and Turkey, which have also vied for influence in the resource-rich country, are watching closely.The unrest in central Asia provides an awkward backdrop, too, for next week’s talks with the US and Nato after Russia’s troop build-up around Ukraine. Putin is likely to see it, without foundation, as western interference timed for the eve of the negotiations. Kremlin delegates will surely be instructed to drive through the president’s demands to curb Nato. As he eyes what is happening to Nazarbayev, a man from whom he has drawn inspiration, Putin may be all the more eager for a diplomatic, or failing that military, success that he can sell to his own public.
307  France and Italy are moving ahead with new measures to pressure the unvaccinated to get their Covid-19 jabs, showing how some European countries are taking a more coercive approach as they race to curb an Omicron-driven surge of infections.While Italy has opted to make immunisation required for anyone over the age of 50, France will instead turn its “health pass” system into a “vaccine pass”. A negative test will no longer suffice to access bars, restaurants and other social activities.With infection rates hitting record highs in many European countries, governments are grappling with ways to convince hesitant citizens to get immunised against Covid-19 in a bid to keep economies open and relieve the pressure on health systems. Many have already required immunisation for workers in healthcare and facilities for the elderly, as well as other public sector employees.But with the more transmissible Omicron variant appearing to cause milder disease, health experts disagree over how much pressure should be exerted to increase vaccination rates given that 70 per cent of the EU population over 12 years has had one jab and immunity will be boosted as Omicron spreads.“There is little consensus in the public health community about the best way to reach the holdouts,” said Jocelyn Raude, a professor in health psychology at the Graduate School of Public Health in Rennes. “Some people think it’s best just to leave them alone since they cannot be convinced and the epidemiological benefit of doing so may be marginal.” Officials are also trying to assess how additional measures will affect public enthusiasm for additional boosters if new variants emerge to prolong the pandemic.In France, President Emmanuel Macron caused controversy on Tuesday when he said his strategy was to “piss off” the unvaccinated by making their lives as difficult as possible. But his tactics might be spurring a change in behaviour: some 66,000 people got their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine on Wednesday, three times the average daily levels seen in recent months.As daily infections hit a record high of 332,000, the lower house of the French parliament passed the first reading of the vaccine pass law after three days of raucous debate and more than 650 amendments. The bill moved to the senate on Thursday for approval. About 5m people have not received any vaccine shots — or 9 per cent of the eligible French population aged over 12. They include not only committed anti-vaxxers but also housebound or isolated elderly people, as well as children and teens whose parents have chosen not to get them jabbed.The seven-day average of cases hit record highs over recent days in 12 European countries. Current case rates in Italy, France and Spain are more than three times their pre-Omicron peak, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.Cases have risen by 40 per cent in Germany and the Netherlands over the past week, while Ireland currently has Europe’s highest infection rate at 392 cases per 100,000 people.In Germany, the government’s plan to institute a vaccine mandate for all adults by February has been delayed to allow more time for parliamentary debate. The idea has backing from Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s ruling Social Democrats, but is not universally supported by their coalition partner, the liberal Free Democrats.The SDP said on Thursday that it is aiming for a final decision by the end of March on the introduction of a universal vaccine mandate.About 17 per cent of over-12s remain unvaccinated in Germany and Austria, and 21 per cent in Switzerland, the three highest rates in western Europe, according to analysis of figures from Our World in Data and the UN.Some German health experts and the national ethics council have also questioned whether such a mandate would be useful at this stage in the pandemic.Protests against coronavirus and vaccination measures are a weekly occurrence across Germany. With far-right groups latching on to the protest movement, some officials argue a heavier hand is needed to pressure people into vaccination, while others fear such measures would only serve to drive protesters further toward extreme groups.“The risk is that mandating vaccination can reignite protest movements,” said Raude.Italy’s government stopped short of implementing a general vaccination requirement.Instead the new age-linked requirement for at least two jabs was imposed by Draghi after hours of infighting within the coalition with stricter vaccination rules demanded by the centre-left Democrats rejected by the rightwing League and populist Five Star. Workers older than 50 will also be required to show proof of vaccination to go to work.According to government figures, 2.2m Italians aged 50 years or older remain unvaccinated.
308  Good afternoon. The Britain after Brexit briefing is back for 2022, the year that Brexit may finally really “get done” — or at least the first phase of Brexit.If all goes to plan, this will come in two parts: firstly an agreement in the next two or three months to put the post-Brexit trade rules for Northern Ireland on a politically and economically sustainable footing; secondly the phasing in of full border controls on imported goods from the EU into the UK, of which more in subsequent editions.On the Northern Ireland trade question, after a Christmas and New Year break where I understand officials really did take time off, talks to try and cut a deal with Brussels will begin in earnest in the UK next week. The Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney is also in London tonight in order to lay some of the groundwork.In pondering the challenges of the coming negotiation, it’s worth recalling at the outset that the EU and the UK do already have an agreement which was negotiated in 2019 — the benighted Northern Ireland Protocol. It’s just that the UK government, in retrospect, has declared it to be unsustainable.The original agreement remains the baseline from which the EU measures its concessions and that is likely to be a fundamental source of tension between the two sides as they try to thrash out a compromise.Following the resignation of Lord David Frost, it is now Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, who will negotiate with the EU Brexit commissioner Maros Sefcovic. But while Truss might lighten the tone with her trademark goofy optimism, it doesn’t change the fundamental problems.This remains the fact that Boris Johnson’s decision to leave Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market for goods — necessitating EU-style border checks on goods going from Great Britain to the region — has been honoured in the breach since it came into force in 2020.The deal has never been fully implemented, initially because the EU and the UK agreed ‘grace periods’ to give business time to adapt, but subsequently because the UK has extended those grace periods, first unilaterally and latterly with the grudging connivance of Brussels.The difficulty is that the UK baseline for success is to further reduce that already partially-implemented Irish Sea border, while the EU side still seeks to defend the basic concept of the protocol, which requires goods to conform to EU rules.So while some momentum was built up towards a deal before Christmas by Frost’s decision to soften his demands to remove the European Court of Justice and an acknowledgment that certain controls at the Irish Sea border would be required, the two sides remain some way apart.In October the EU put forward ideas to smooth the border, which Sefcovic claimed will reduce customs checks by 50 per cent and so-called “SPS” checks on plant and animal products by 80 per cent. However, those are not figures that the UK or Northern Ireland industry recognise on the ground.One reason is that the EU might argue that it is reducing SPS checks by “80 per cent” from the original deal — which required the full implementation of export health certificates (for goods going from Dover to Calais) that have never been required.Some EU officials talk about reducing the “intensity” of checks, rather than the “quantum”. So the number of lines in a customs form might shrink by 50 per cent, but you still need the form.That’s fine, but it is the practical impacts, rather than semantic niceties, that will preoccupy Truss as she tries to reach a deal she can sell to restless backbenchers and even, with luck, more moderate Unionists in Northern Ireland.One key bone of contention cited by officials and trade groups is the EU’s offer to create an “express lane” for goods that can be proven to be destined only for consumption in Northern Ireland — but limited only to “primary products originating in the UK”.In practice, say trade groups, that means a GB-based food manufacturer that uses, say, Brazilian beef in a ready meal, must ‘export’ the product into Northern Ireland either via the continental EU or through Dublin. This, they say, is impractical.The EU — recalling the original deal — argues that such a restriction is fundamental to the protocol, and necessary to prevent Northern Ireland becoming a backdoor for non-UK products into the EU single market. It also argues that there is plenty of meat in the single market that can be made into pies for Northern Ireland.Ultimately, this was the deal that Johnson signed, but expect a full-court press from Northern Irish trade groups and the UK this month to try to make the EU side understand the challenges this approach throws up for NI supply chains and the impact it will have on consumer choices and politics in the region.Gaps also remain for goods going in the other direction — from Northern Ireland into Great Britain — where the UK government has promised “unfettered access” for NI businesses to the UK internal market.The difficulty is that under EU rules, goods leaving the EU single market should submit exit declarations. Mindful of the political symbolism of this, the EU agreed in the 2019 deal that this procedure was not necessary for Northern Ireland goods being sent into Great Britain, accepting instead that data from shipping manifests could act as a substitute.But, in its demands to reform the protocol last July, the UK government said the system was “not operable without putting in place burdensome new requirements to collect further information” and requested a new settlement “to definitively eliminate these requirements”.The EU did not address the issue in its suggested package of changes last October, so as things stand, Brussels continues to cling to the original deal. Fixing this will be another key part of negotiations.Resolving gaps on these kinds of issues are core to a workable deal. The UK has accepted that shipping goods from Birmingham to Belfast cannot be exactly the same as sending them from Birmingham to Brighton. The question is how different does it really need to be?With Northern Ireland elections looming in May, the pressure is on to do a deal, not least because the UK government is facing a series of other headwinds — inflation, labour shortages, supply chain issue, rising energy prices — that mean a sizeable chunk of the Cabinet want the Northern Ireland issue put to bed.And Truss, as foreign secretary with one eye on the top job, arguably has a broader appreciation of the UK’s strategic priorities than Frost, while the EU side also points towards the logic of doing a deal.But all politics is ultimately local. Any deal Truss strikes will crystallise a trade border in the Irish Sea that Johnson has always been in denial over. And to sell that back home, Truss will need wins that measure up against the UK’s benchmarks, not the EU’sLooming over the negotiation is, of course, a deteriorating economic climate which the FT’s annual survey of economists reckons will be exacerbated by Brexit.This is not as simple as pure trade friction, but a combination of added bureaucracy that reduces imports and exports; a less flexible labour market caused by ending free movement; and a less optimistic climate for investment, impeded in part by the fact that the UK is no longer an easy gateway into the EU single market.In the opinion of Paul de Grauwe, professor at the London School of Economics: “Recoveries are driven by optimism about the future.Brexit will impose chronic pessimism about the future of the UK economy.”Already business sentiment seems grim. According to December PMI survey data the UK was the only western economy to see falling exports — and a quarter of UK manufacturers cited Brexit as the reason for the fall.And, finally, three unmissable Brexit storiesOne year on, as far as Northern Ireland is concerned, Brexit is nowhere near done, writes Jude Webber from Belfast. As she points out in this excellent piece, the UK region is in a significant election year, with polls showing unionist parties on course to lose their majority for the first time — and among the most pivotal issues in the May 5 elections is Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit trading arrangements.The Tories are wondering what happened to the Brexit they promised, says Robert Shrimsley in his latest column. As he writes: “With personal and corporate tax rises just introduced, ministers pledging not to scale back employment rights and an increasing role for the state, the buccaneering post-Brexit vision of a low-tax, low-regulation UK seems more remote than ever. So long Singapore-on-Thames, hello Sweden.”The government is overhauling England’s agricultural subsidies after Brexit and, over the next two decades, planning to restore land almost twice the area of London to nature. Initial projects will aim to restore 10,000 hectares of wildlife habitat and save carbon emissions equivalent to that of 25,000 cars, while improving the habitat of about half of England’s most threatened species. Find out what they are, and more about the new plans.
309  German inflation remained close to multi-decade highs at the end of last year, forcing the government to promise aid for poorer households as energy prices continued to surge at double-digit rates.The annual pace of price growth in Germany was 5.7 per cent in December, according to the harmonised index of consumer prices published on Thursday. That was down slightly from 6 per cent in November, which was the highest level since shortly after the country’s reunification in the early 1990s.German energy prices were 18.3 per cent higher than a year earlier.Christian Lindner, Germany’s finance minister, said the new government was considering providing financial aid to offset rising heating costs for poorer households this winter.“We have to do something,” Lindner told a meeting of his Free Democratic party in Stuttgart. “I promise that, with the means I have available, we will provide such solidarity-based support for the people who are particularly affected.”France, Spain and Italy have already pledged to take similar action.Spiralling prices are a sensitive subject in Germany, whose approach to money is still haunted by the hyperinflation of the 1920s and 1940s that wiped out most people’s savings.Economists expect German inflation to fade this year as the effect of the country’s pandemic-driven temporary cut in sales tax disappears from the data. This should automatically knock about 1 percentage point off overall price growth from January, they estimate.“Because many of the special factors and the imbalance between supply and demand should at least weaken in the course of 2022, we expect the inflation rate to decline to a little under 2 per cent by the end of the year,” said Jörg Zeuner, chief economist at Union Investment.However European wholesale natural gas prices almost doubled to record highs in the run-up to Christmas and they jumped again this week after supplies from Russia slowed. Global supply chain bottlenecks have also caused delays and higher costs for manufacturers, pushing up the price of many consumer goods.Record order backlogs at German manufacturers show no signs of easing after new orders outstripped economists’ expectations by rising 3.7 per cent in November, rebounding from a fall in the previous month thanks to higher demand from foreign customers.Improvement in the country’s labour market is likely to add to upward pressure on costs, because of rising shortages of workers and the government’s promise to raise the minimum wage by a quarter to €12 per hour.The German employment agency said this week that job vacancies increased by 213,000 last year to 794,000. The jobs website Indeed said the number of German vacancies it was advertising had risen almost 50 per cent from pre-pandemic levels.“Inflation is unlikely to come down in a straight line from here,” said Carsten Brzeski, head of macro research at ING, pointing out that the price of almost half of the 92 largest components of the German inflation basket rose 4 per cent or more in December — up from only 10 per cent a year ago.Food prices were up 6 per cent, services prices rose 3.1 per cent and rents increased 1.4 per cent.Over the course of past year, German inflation averaged 3.1 per cent, its highest level since 1993 and up from 0.5 per cent in the previous year when the pandemic caused a deep recession. The Bundesbank recently raised its 2022 inflation forecast from 1.8 to 3.6 per cent.Eurozone inflation figures due to be released on Friday are expected to show a dip from 4.9 per cent in November to 4.7 per cent in December. But this is still close to a 13-year high — and more than double the European Central Bank’s 2 per cent target.
310  Russian paratroopers and allied military units started to arrive in Kazakhstan on Thursday after the country’s president appealed for help in quelling protests that have led to dozens being killed in clashes with police.Limited numbers of Russian paratroopers, plus contingents from Armenia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, were sent as a peacekeeping force at the request of President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev to the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a Russia-led military alliance.A video shared by Russia’s defence ministry showed soldiers boarding a military plane bound for Kazakhstan. The alliance’s troops would focus on “protecting important state and military facilities, and assisting Kazakh law enforcement in stabilising the situation”, an alliance statement said.Key infrastructure includes the Russian space centre in Baikonur and several military sites. Russian units already in the central Asian nation “have begun to carry out their assigned tasks”, the alliance added.Kazakhstan is a significant producer of natural resources including oil and uranium, and markets have also grown unnerved by potential supply disruptions, with oil prices rising to $82 a barrel, their highest point since late November. The price of uranium, the metal used in nuclear power stations, jumped 8 per cent to $45.25 a pound on Wednesday. Kazakhstan, the world’s biggest producer, accounts for more than 40 per cent of global primary production. “To put it in context, Kazakhstan’s market dominance in uranium is four times that of Saudi’s dominance in oil,” said Nick Lawson, chief executive of London-based advisory firm Ocean Wall.As for oil supplies, Chevron, which has a 50 per cent stake in Kazakhstan’s highest-producing field, Tengiz, said it had “adjusted” the field’s usual output of between 550,000 and 600,000 barrels a day after “contracted employees.gathered at the Tengiz field in support of protests”. Royal Dutch Shell, meanwhile, said production at its Karachaganak and North Caspian fields was ongoing, and the Caspian Pipeline Consortium — the 1,500km-long line that carries two-thirds of the country’s 1.4m b/d of crude oil exports — was functioning normally.The active joint action by the CSTO, which has a collective security provision, is the first since it was founded two decades ago.It was unclear how many troops might arrive in total. Armenia is dispatching 70 soldiers, while Tajikistan is sending 200, according to RIA news agency. They may remain in the country for about a month, Interfax reported, quoting the deputy head of the Russian parliament’s defence committee.Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of political consultancy R Politik, said the maximum participation from CSTO allies would reach no more than 3,500 troops. As for Russia, it had “decided to take part symbolically but [its forces] will be there primarily to protect infrastructure”, she added. “Russia does not want to get involved.It does not want to do the local government’s dirty work.”The protests, which began this week, have taken place mainly in the country’s largest city, Almaty. Triggered by fuel price rises, they escalated rapidly into more widespread political protest, with cars and buildings set on fire, including the presidential residence and mayor’s office.Dozens of people were killed in clashes in Almaty overnight, city police said, and witnesses reported intense gunfire. The Kazakh health ministry said more than 1,000 people were injured.After making several concessions on Wednesday — including firing the government and apparently displacing longtime ruler Nursultan Nazarbayev from a key security role — Tokayev announced a tough crackdown and imposed a state of emergency.Internet access was partially restored on Thursday. But the government ordered banks to remain shut and closed its borders to foreign citizens, RIA reported, quoting embassy officials.It was unclear whether security forces had regained control of Almaty’s international airport, and many airlines have cancelled flights to Almaty and Nur-Sultan, the capital.Some passengers due to depart on Wednesday were evacuated to a nearby village, said Evgeny, who was on holiday from the Russian city of Magadan. He was due to fly out but was unaware of the broader situation because internet access was blocked.“Suddenly, everyone started to run,” he told the Financial Times, describing the situation in the airport. “We didn’t know what was going on, but then we were told that attackers had seized the airport.” Passengers were initially evacuated to a nearby cargo terminal.The Kazakh government on Thursday also introduced price controls on petrol, diesel fuel and liquefied petroleum gas for 180 days, the government’s press service said, in another attempt to appease protesters.Russia’s foreign ministry said Moscow “will continue to closely consult with Kazakhstan and other CSTO allies in order to analyse and, if necessary, develop further effective steps to assist Kazakhstan’s law enforcement agencies in conducting a counter-terrorism operation”.The Kremlin’s intervention to help an ally facing upheaval is its second in two years after Russian president Vladimir Putin backed Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko in his crackdown on popular protests in 2020.Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said the EU had “great concern about developments” in Kazakhstan and that the CSTO’s “external military assistance brings back memories of situations to be avoided.”Neighbouring China described the situation as an internal Kazakh matter, while Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan phoned Tokayev, saying Ankara stood in “solidarity” and hoped the “tension” would end soon.
311  The blatant disregard shown for the rule of law, media pluralism and other fundamental rights in Poland and Hungary, together with slippage in a few other capitals, has created a dangerous rift in the EU. Unless this rot is soon fixed, it will seriously corrode solidarity among member states, weaken the union’s legal order — and therefore the single market — and hamper the union’s effectiveness at a time of greater challenges. How the EU, particularly Brussels and Berlin, handle this debilitating fracture will be a defining issue for 2022 with consequences well beyond.The most pressing challenge is Poland. For five years, the Law and Justice-led government has waged a fanatical campaign to exert political control over the judiciary and remove judges it deems opposed to its ultra-conservative political agenda. It has forced the early retirement of supreme court judges, illegally installed appointees to the constitutional tribunal and introduced a disciplinary regime to rein in disloyal justices.When the European Court of Justice, following an infringement procedure by the European Commission, ruled that the disciplinary regime was incompatible with EU law, Warsaw refused to comply. It then dramatically raised the stakes with a politically-inspired constitutional tribunal ruling that rejected both the European court’s jurisdiction in the matter and the treaty obligations Poland signed up to when it joined the EU 17 years ago. Other countries’ top courts have in the past questioned the primacy of EU law — the keystone of its legal order — but none with such bad faith as Poland’s. Even Hungary, Europe’s illiberal trailblazer, has avoided such a provocation.Poland’s move has thrown down the gauntlet to the European Commission, the guardian of the EU’s treaties. The commission has stepped up its efforts, albeit belatedly, to hold Warsaw to its obligations through infringement proceedings. For a long time, that was its only effective check on member states.Now it has new sticks to wield. One is the temporary leverage afforded by the EU recovery fund. Brussels has so far refused to approve the €36bn plan for Poland or €7bn for Hungary over rule of law concerns. The other is the so-called conditionality mechanism that allows Brussels to suspend all other EU payments to countries over rules of law concerns. For Warsaw, that is another €121bn at stake.The commission has set three demands for Poland: scrap the disciplinary chamber, change the disciplinary rules and reinstate dismissed judges. Warsaw seems open to the first but rejects the other two. Furthermore, it has floated the idea of further reforms of the supreme and lower courts, which inevitably raises red flags. Brussels will soon have to turn up the pressure on Warsaw, and that means activating the conditionality mechanism.The handling of this issue is set to one of the biggest leadership tests so far for Ursula von der Leyen, the commission president. Like many German politicians, she feels a special responsibility towards Poland. Like her political mentor Angela Merkel, she is anxious to avoid a new east-west divide in Europe. But the commission’s reticence in the past has only emboldened the autocrats. At the same time, channels for dialogue must be kept open. Ultimately, the dispute will require a political rather than legal solution.Poland’s government will relish a clash with Brussels and complain it is the victim of EU over-reach. In reality, this is about the ruling party’s domestic excesses. Poles sadly will pay the price for it while their country is being marginalised in Europe.
312  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.French president Emmanuel Macron is receiving the entire team of EU commissioners in Paris tonight, as is customary at the start of the rotating six-month EU presidency. One of his priorities, advancing negotiations on a carbon tax on imports from countries where industries do not have to green their technologies, is already making waves in the European parliament. We will unpack the arguments and why governments are likely to strike back.Meanwhile in Germany, an agreement was reached to support the re-election of President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who we will profile today.And in Baltic news, the Lithuanian government is determined to maintain its hawkish stance on China, despite criticism from the country’s president.This year will be crucial for the EU’s attempts to export its environmental policies to the rest of the world (see: the taxonomy), writes Andy Bounds in Brussels.One of the blockbuster policies to be negotiated in the coming months is the EU’s carbon border adjustment mechanism — a tool that will force foreign importers to pay a CO2 price equivalent to EU businesses. It is designed to prevent polluters from simply decamping to less onerous jurisdictions to avoid paying the price for carbon.The European parliament’s environment committee wants the CBAM, due to come into force from 2026, to be introduced sooner and on a wider range of imports. Dutch Labour MEP Mohammed Chahim outlined his draft report yesterday.One of the most contentious parts of the CBAM is how quickly to phase out free carbon credits awarded to EU industries that pay Europe’s domestic CO2 price. The introduction of the CBAM is meant to help level the playing field between EU and non-EU producers of electricity, steel, cement, iron and fertiliser, thus removing the logic for free allowances.The European Commission’s draft text, published last summer, proposed a gradual phaseout from 2026 onwards, with 2036 the year in which all free credits are removed.In his report, Chahim sought to shorten this phaseout to allow the CBAM to kick in earlier. European industries such as steel are big beneficiaries of free carbon credits, whose price reflects the now-record cost of CO2, which hit €90 a tonne last month.Chahim wants the phaseout to start in 2025 and be entirely eliminated at the end of 2028. “Free allowances have had their uses in the past but with the introduction of CBAM, we have an alternative carbon leakage measure,” Chahim told Europe Express.EU governments wary of the merits of the CBAM will push for longer timelines to protect industries from the soaring cost of polluting, with steelmakers already intensifying lobbying. Member states will have to agree on their position before final negotiations with MEPs this year.With all the main parties in the Bundestag now backing his bid for a second term, Frank-Walter Steinmeier is on course to be re-elected German president next month in another victory for the Social Democrats, writes Guy Chazan in Berlin.Once written off as a spent force, the SPD is riding high. Germany’s chancellor, president and speaker of parliament all hail from a party that earlier last year was polling at just 14 per cent and seemed to have forfeited all claim to the status of volkspartei.Steinmeier himself is an SPD institution, a man who has figured prominently in national politics for more than two decades and shaped many of the policy debates that have defined modern Germany.Critical to his rise was his close relationship with Gerhard Schröder, dating from his time as prime minister of Lower Saxony in the 1990s. Not long after Schröder unseated Helmut Kohl as chancellor in 1998, he appointed Steinmeier his chief of staff.In that role, Steinmeier was instrumental in formulating “Agenda 2010”, the programme of far-reaching reforms that overhauled Germany’s labour market and welfare system. The measures helped reduce unemployment and increase competitiveness, but also alienated millions of SPD voters.In 2005, Steinmeier was appointed foreign minister in Angela Merkel’s first government, a “grand coalition” between her centre-right CDU/CSU and the SPD. He held the post until 2009, when Merkel formed a different coalition with the liberal FDP. That year, he headed up the SPD parliamentary group, effectively making him leader of the opposition.In 2013, he reassumed the job of foreign minister in another grand coalition, and it was in this role that he came to personify German diplomacy during the 2014 Ukraine crisis, when he and Merkel deployed a combination of economic sanctions against Moscow and tireless negotiations to prevent an all-out war in the region.In 2017, Steinmeier was elected the country’s 12th president. It is largely a ceremonial role, but he made a splash by intervening in the political impasse that year created by the breakdown of coalition negotiations. He was instrumental in persuading the SPD to overcome its resistance to joining the CDU/CSU-led government, paving the way for yet another grand coalition — Merkel’s third.Steinmeier was born in 1956 in the west German town of Detmold, the son of a carpenter and a factory worker who had been driven from her home in modern-day Poland after the second world war.As president, he has won recognition for well-calibrated speeches that emphasised Germany’s moral responsibility for the Holocaust and denounced racism, rightwing extremism and anti-Semitism.By supporting ceremonies to commemorate Covid-19 victims, he has also emerged as an advocate of social cohesion during a pandemic that has left German society polarised and embittered.Post-Brexit trade arrangements are set to feature prominently in Northern Ireland’s elections in May. The customs checks in the Irish Sea, which have caused problems for trade between Britain and Northern Ireland, have also led to a boom in trade with the Republic of Ireland. (More here)Lithuania’s support for Taiwan has sparked huge anger from China, and this week brought about the first cracks in the united front of Lithuanian policymakers, writes Richard Milne, Nordic and Baltic correspondent.But it also prompted Taiwan to reward Vilnius with a $200m investment fund, with the first money expected to flow later this year. (More here)Lithuania’s president Gitanas Nauseda told local radio on Tuesday that it had been a “mistake” to name the representative office as Taiwan and not the less controversial Taipei, as many other European countries have done.But the Lithuanian government is not backing down.Radvile Morkunaite-Mikuleniene, vice-chair of the parliament and deputy head of the ruling party, told Europe Express that Lithuania was a “parliamentary republic”, with policy shaped by the government.“One thing is very clear: we do not step back from our decision. We definitely don’t call it some kind of error. This is his personal stance,” she said of Nauseda’s comments.The spat between the president and the government — coming after a similar squabble over Covid-19 policy — is deeply unfortunate for Lithuania, as it struggles to keep the international community on its side, not just over China but also over Belarus and Russia.China’s “very aggressive reaction”, in Morkunaite-Mikuleniene’s words, has included not just blocking imports from Lithuania but also trying to stop foreign manufacturers such as Germany’s Continental from using components made in the Baltic country. The Taiwanese investment fund is being set up to counter some of those actions.Lithuania’s government declined to comment, but officials are privately dismayed over how the internal dispute is viewed internationally, especially after revelations that all three Baltic countries have hit record trade levels with Belarus even as they push for extra sanctions against Alexander Lukashenko’s regime.Morkunaite-Mikuleniene said it was important to stick to the defence of democratic values and not “bend ourselves in front of countries that are breaching international agreements”.“Sometimes there is a feeling that you are climbing a steep hill, and after you reach the top there will be an easy walk but suddenly you see new obstacles that are in front.I hope we will stay firm. The most important is not to get scared.”
313  As Europe looks to boost future gas supplies amid a bracing winter, much could depend on a judgment call by Vladimir Putin on the competing interests of two of his closest allies.Igor Sechin and Alexei Miller are two of the powerful men in Russia with deep connections to Putin, having worked with the president in the St Petersburg mayor’s office back in the 1990s and proved their loyalty since.Sechin, once Putin’s personal secretary, heads up the giant oil producer Rosneft. His great rival in Kremlin politics, Miller runs Gazprom, the gas goliath. The demarcation between Russia’s greatest corporate assets has been that Gazprom dominates the gas market while Rosneft manages the oil.But the contentious Nord Stream 2 pipeline project could disrupt that dynamic. The $11bn pipeline across the Baltic Sea built by Gazprom will allow the company to send 55bn cubic metres of gas to Europe per year, bypassing Ukraine.Allowing Rosneft, now Russia’s second-largest gas producer, to access Gazprom’s pipeline to Germany looks a logical way to make the project compliant with European energy laws mandating that no company has a monopoly on use of a pipeline. Germany is yet to certify the project.Rosneft has made numerous attempts at gaining access to Gazprom’s pipelines but had always been pushed back. Until last summer.Putin instructed the government to work out a plan to allow Rosneft to export 10bn cubic metres of gas a year to Europe using Gazprom as an agent. He then reportedly told the two companies to agree the terms of such “experimental” flows by March.“It shows the idea is being seriously considered, which in recent memory is the first time Rosneft has been close to getting the right to export, albeit using Gazprom as an agent,” said Mitch Jennings, Moscow-based oil and gas analyst at Sova Capital.The stakes are much higher for Gazprom than just one pipeline. “In theory, this could allow Moscow to increase Nord Stream 2 load and raise export volumes,” said Dmitry Marinchenko, senior oil and gas analyst at Fitch Ratings. On the other hand, “this is bad news for Gazprom”, which could lose market share.If Rosneft is allowed to use a part of its system, it will very possibly want access on other routes, too, including to China, the biggest market. “Everyone understands that if Sechin is allowed a piece of the pie, he will bite off the whole pie,” said an industry expert.Gazprom supplies more than one-third of Europe’s gas needs and started to supply China in 2019. Its only other competition from Russia so far came with Novatek’s LNG volumes, most of which are contracted to Asia and some sold on the spot market in Europe.“Surprisingly in Russia, which has hardly any elements of market economy in the energy sphere left, there continues to be competition between state-controlled companies, groups of influence and officials,” Marinchenko said.Rosneft has been stepping up gas business in Russia and abroad. Producing just over a tenth of Gazprom’s output, it plans to almost double its annual production to 100bn cubic metres of gas. The company has had plans for several LNG plants but has not built any.The decision on pipeline exports for Rosneft is so big that it has to be made by the president himself. Industry participants say Miller and Sechin are unlikely to strike a deal without intervention.“But as always in Russia, the decision can be very easily made in, say, April by the only person who has the power to do it,” a person close to the issue said on condition of anonymity, referring to Putin.Sechin has been traditionally seen as the closer ally to the president — Putin brought him along when he went to Moscow and made him deputy prime minister in 2008 before entrusting him with Rosneft in 2012.Miller became deputy energy minister in 2000, when Putin first became president, and took the current position as chair of Gazprom’s management committee a year later. He has won plaudits recently, having made his company Russia’s biggest by market capitalisation, which now exceeds that of Rosneft by about 30 per cent. Miller also brought Gazprom record profits last year. The Kremlin, as the company’s major shareholder and dividend taker, “should be as pleased with Miller as ever”, one industry analyst put it.The two companies now have a clear timeline in which to step up the lobbying, but signs of potential change in the landscape of Russia’s gas industry are clear.nastassia.
314  It was not much more than a week ago that it appeared Vladimir Putin once again had the west cornered.With more than 100,000 troops amassed on the Ukrainian border and a list of security demands nearly as robust, the Russian president had forced the White House and Nato into negotiations over issues that should be considered settled history, such as the right of countries in the former Soviet sphere to join the Atlantic alliance. The alternative, it seemed, was war.But the popular uprising in Kazakhstan now under way has revealed yet again that Putin’s aggression in the region does not always spring from a position of strength.Russian propaganda will blame foreign operatives for the sudden outbreak of demonstrations across the central Asian steppe. Kazakh leaders have already welcomed armed Russian help, citing “external meddling”. But the fear in the Kremlin is just the opposite: that the Kazakh protests are the latest sign that citizens who have lived for decades under stultifying autocracies will eventually take no more.“It is absolutely not in Putin’s interest to have this blow up in his backyard when he’s in the middle of a showdown with Nato,” said Eugene Rumer, who handled Russian and Eurasian issues at the US national intelligence council.It is no accident that Putin chose brinkmanship over Ukraine in the months following a similar popular revolt in Belarus, where opposition leaders came close to toppling the regime of strongman Alexander Lukashenko after Europe’s last dictator rigged national elections against his rival, political neophyte Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.The Belarusian protesters, like their Kazakh counterparts, raised the spectre of the “coloured revolutions” of the early 2000s that tipped Ukraine and Georgia into the western camp, where they actively sought Nato and EU membership.In addition to giving Lukashenko a green light for a brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations, Putin escalated his campaign of suppression at home, shutting down Russia’s most prominent civil rights group, Memorial, just before the end of the year.Amid Putin’s sabre-rattling, it is easy to forget that his Ukrainian gambit could be the product of his weakness, not strength. And the Kazakhs have reminded the world just how weak Putin’s grip may well be.“This puts a lie to Putin’s claims that [the Ukraine stand-off] is all about Nato and western provocation,” said Ivo Daalder, a former US ambassador to Nato. “It’s all about his not being able to stand an independent democracy next to him.”Georgia’s rose revolution was followed a year later by Ukraine’s orange one. Belarus’ uprising has been followed a year later by one in Kazakhstan. The combination may prod Putin to escalate even further. But the people of Kazakhstan — and Belarus, and Ukraine, and Georgia — have already shown the limits of Putin’s Soviet dreams.Peter Spiegel is the FT’s US managing editor
315  Kazakhstan’s president appealed to a Russian-led military alliance for help on Wednesday after vowing to act with force to curb protests that have swept the resource-rich central Asian nation in the most significant challenge for years to autocratic rule.Shortly afterwards, Armenia’s prime minister Nikol Pashinyan, who chairs the Collective Security Treaty Organization, blamed the crisis on “external meddling” and said the group would send a contingent of “peacekeepers” to Kazakhstan for a “limited period of time […] with the goal of stabilising and normalising the situation in the country”.A state of emergency was declared nationwide after anger at rising fuel prices escalated into protests in several Kazakh cities, with significant buildings set alight and demonstrators overrunning an airport in the former capital Almaty.President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev accepted the resignation of the government and said he was assuming control of the security council, giving him more powers to direct forces or crack down on protests if he saw fit.It leaves questions over the role of former longtime president Nursultan Nazarbayev, who stepped down in 2019 after three decades as leader but who had retained control of the security council and held significant sway as a “leader of the nation” figure.Late on Wednesday, Tokayev said he had made an appeal for help to the CSTO, a Russian-led military alliance that also includes Belarus, Armenia and two of Kazakhstan’s neighbours. He said assistance was needed to fight armed and organised bands of terrorists that had been trained abroad.Tokayev’s announcement, made after a phone call with his counterparts in Moscow and Minsk, could open the way for foreign troops to enter Kazakhstan and assist the government in putting down the protest. The alliance’s treaty promises assistance to member states whose security or stability is threatened.A Russian parliamentarian said any peacekeeping forces would only be involved in “ensuring the security of infrastructure”, with other activities carried out by local forces. But Leonid Kalashnikov, chair of CIS affairs in the Russian Duma, an area of responsibility that covers former Soviet states, added that CSTO forces would remain in place “for as long as Kazakhstan’s president needs them”.In a statement on Wednesday evening, US state department spokesperson Ned Price said Washington condemned “the acts of violence and destruction of property” and called for “restraint by both the authorities and protesters”.“We ask for all Kazakhstanis to respect and defend constitutional institutions, human rights and media freedom, including through the restoration of internet service. We urge all parties to find a peaceful resolution of the state of emergency,” he added.Kazakhstan is a big oil producer and member of the Opec+ group of countries. Brent crude prices rose on Wednesday, in part on worries that the protests could disrupt oil supplies.The country is also significant for global energy markets as it produces uranium for nuclear plants. Last year it accounted for more than 40 per cent of global output. It is also among the top dozen suppliers of zinc and copper.Kazakhstan, like Russia and other countries in the region, has been struggling with rising prices for basic commodities amid the economic strain of the pandemic.Protests that started over fuel prices three days ago have since snowballed into the biggest in Kazakhstan’s post-Soviet history. Though Tokayev has made significant concessions to demonstrators, these have done little to quell the situation.After accepting the government’s resignation on Wednesday, Tokayev also acted on another of the protesters’ demands, saying he would step into the role of chair of the security council. This suggested Nazarbayev, who previously held the role, had been displaced.“As a result, as the head of state — and, as of today, as the chair of the security council — I intend to act as forcefully as possible. It is a matter of the security of our citizens,” said Tokayev, who is viewed as a loyal Nazarbayev ally.The price of Kazakhstan’s dollar-denominated debt dropped after the protests and the resignation of the government. The yield on a bond maturing in 2045 rose nearly 0.2 percentage points to 3.95 per cent, the highest level since May 2020, as its price fell more than 3 cents on the dollar.Shares in uranium company Kazatomprom dropped 8 per cent, and those of Kaspi.kz bank lost more than 20 per cent.The upheaval in one of Russia’s largest neighbours is also a potential concern for Moscow, which has enjoyed a close and stable relationship with Kazakhstan’s leadership. Russia’s foreign ministry said it was keeping a keen eye on the situation.In the most populous city, Almaty, tear gas and stun grenades were used as protesters stormed a presidential residence and set fire to the main administrative building. A video shared on social media showed protesters in another town in the area tearing down a statue of Nazarbayev.Protesters seized Almaty’s international airport, the Orda.kz news outlet quoted an airport press service employee as saying. Airport staff evacuated any passengers before the protesters, numbering about 45 people, arrived, the outlet reported.The government blocked access to the internet almost nationwide, according to internet disruption monitors, with reports too of patchy mobile service, and some TV services being suspended. Hundreds of people were detained.Workers had gathered at the Tengiz oilfield, the country’s largest, in support of the protest but output had not been affected, a spokesperson for Chevron, the operator, told the Financial Times. The spokesperson said the company was working “to resolve this situation as soon as possible”. Tengiz pumps about 600,000 barrels a day of oil, and includes ExxonMobil, Kazakhstan’s KazMunayGas and Russia’s Lukoil as partners.Some journalists and commentators in Moscow accused unspecified outside forces of stirring up protests in Kazakhstan to destabilise Russia’s eastern flank, ahead of a round of diplomatic negotiations when Moscow wants to discuss the balance of power to its west.Washington, Moscow and Nato member states are set to meet for talks next week, when Russia intends to press for “security guarantees” to limit the military alliance’s expansion in Europe.
316  The EU’s top diplomat has warned Russia and the US against creating “spheres of influence” in Europe ahead of talks between the two countries next week regarding proposals from Moscow that would reshape the continent’s defence and security architecture.Russia, which has stoked fears of a potential military attack on Ukraine after deploying more than 100,000 troops close to its border, has demanded the US and Nato agree to security pledges that would ban former Soviet states from joining the western military alliance and restrict where US troops could be stationed in eastern Europe.Next week’s negotiations will see Russian officials hold meetings with a US delegation and with Nato, overlooking demands from the EU that it deserves a seat at the talks.But Josep Borrell, head of the EU’s foreign and security arm, warned that this was no time for a deal akin to the Yalta agreements struck between leaders of the Soviet Union, US and UK that divided Europe after the second world war, and that Brussels would eventually need to play a role in the talks with Moscow.“We are no longer in Yalta times,” Borrell said during a visit to Ukraine on Wednesday. “Spheres of influence for two big powers do not belong.in 2022. In this dialogue there are not two actors alone, not just the US and Russia.”Russia denies that it is preparing an invasion of Ukraine, but President Vladimir Putin has threatened potential military action if its security demands issued to the US and Nato last month are ignored.Officials from the US and Russia will meet in Geneva next Monday, before the Russian delegation attends a special session of the Nato-Russia council in Brussels two days later.While Borrell has said the EU cannot be a “neutral spectator” on the issue, bloc officials have told the Financial Times that the union’s absence from direct talks with Moscow is a reflection of its lack of foreign policy clout, and internal divisions over its defence strategy.But Borrell vowed that the EU would play a role in a later stage of the negotiations.“If Russia is really willing to talk about security in Europe, then Europeans have to be part of it,” he said. “Not the first day, but [these negotiations] will not just last one day or one week.Like it or not, they will have to talk with us, be sure of that.”Borrell’s visit to eastern Ukraine took him to the front line of the war being fought between the Ukrainian army and rebels backed by Moscow since early 2014. It was the first time the EU’s top diplomat had paid a visit to the conflict-hit region.Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba, speaking alongside Borrell, said any discussions regarding Ukraine must involve Kyiv. Ukraine will not be present at the US or Nato talks, but is expected to attend broader talks with Russia organised by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, scheduled for January 13.
317  The leader of Sweden’s main opposition party urged the Scandinavian country to emulate neighbour Finland and stress it has the right to join the Nato military alliance in the face of pressure from Russia.Ulf Kristersson, head of the centre-right Moderates, said Sweden’s political parties should show a common front against Russian warnings that Stockholm and Helsinki should not seek Nato membership.Finland’s president and prime minister both pointedly affirmed in their new year’s speeches that their country had the right to seek membership of the western military alliance if they chose to do so.“Sweden should now, in broad political agreement, do the same as Finland. It would strengthen our country’s security, and it would increase the stability of our part of Europe,” Kristersson wrote on Facebook on Tuesday evening.Russia’s sabre-rattling on Ukraine and the gathering of about 100,000 troops on its border have galvanised the security debate in the Nordic and Baltic region and particularly in Finland, which like Sweden is militarily non-aligned but has a close partnership with Nato.Jake Sullivan, US national security adviser, spoke to his Nordic counterparts on Tuesday, and “participants reaffirmed the right of each country to choose its alliances”, according to a statement by the White House.Sweden’s defence debate has been far more subdued than Finland’s, in large part because the governing centre-left Social Democrats are against Nato membership.All five opposition parties on the right of Swedish politics, including the nationalist Sweden Democrats, voted in favour of adopting an option to seek Nato membership as part of the country’s security policy in 2020, giving them a majority in parliament on the issue.Ann Linde, the Social Democrat foreign minister, called the vote at the time “very negative for Sweden’s security” and said such decisions should be made across party lines.But the debate has been reopened after Russia’s foreign ministry said late last year that if Sweden and Finland joined Nato there would be “serious military and political consequences that would require an adequate response from the Russian side”.Linde had earlier rejected Russia’s demands for no new eastward expansion of Nato, saying it would “reduce the opportunities to make independent political choices”.Still, the centre-left government in Stockholm has been silent since Russia’s latest comments and both the prime minister’s office and the foreign ministry did not respond to requests for interviews.Most security experts expect Finland and Sweden to co-ordinate any application for Nato membership should they decide to join. But in recent days some Swedish experts have warned that Stockholm must prepare for Helsinki to act on its own as the debate in Finland is more advanced.Despite the Swedish Social Democrats’ scepticism about joining Nato, the country has moved significantly closer to the military alliance and the US in the party’s seven years in government and has conducted joint exercises.The centre-right is likely to try to make the topic a big campaign issue ahead of September’s parliamentary elections as Kristersson seeks power, possibly in conjunction with the Sweden Democrats.
318  The Roman emperors Augustus and Tiberius built villas here but it took until 1822 for a hotelier called Giuseppe Pagano to build a locanda on the island of Capri, the so-called “land of sweet idleness” at the south side of the Gulf of Naples. Subsequently renamed Hotel La Palma, it hasn’t latterly been one of the island’s most fashionable addresses, despite its location off the Piazzetta in the heart of the island’s main town. But that is set to change when it reopens this summer as part of the Oetker Collection, owners of the fabled Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc on Cap d’Antibes.With uncharacteristically understated interiors by the fashionable London-based designer Francis Sultana, whose first hotel project this is, it promises more than a little in common with its Riviera stablemate. Its Beach Club on the island’s south coast recalls the Eden-Roc’s terraces, as do its pool deck, rooftop bar and restaurant, which will be overseen by Gennaro Esposito, whose Torre del Saracino in Naples has two Michelin stars. Due to open June 18; double rooms from €550; oetkercollection.comComo Hotels and Resorts is the Singapore-based hotel group behind Parrot Cay in Turks and Caicos, the Shambala Retreat in Bali and the newly transformed Laucala Island in Fiji, but its French CEO Olivier Jolivet has long wanted to create a hotel with wine at the heart of its ethos. During his previous tenure at Aman, there was talk of one in Argentina, another in Provence. This year he will finally get to open one, Como Le Montrachet, named after what many consider the greatest of all white burgundies. Four 18th-century stone buildings, among them an existing hotel on the main square of the village of Puligny-Montrachet, are being converted — it’s a phased opening — by Italian designer Paola Navone into 31 “sanctuaries” (no mere rooms here). “Exceptional dining options and exquisite wine experiences” are promised, along with what should surely, given Como’s form, be an outstanding and thankfully not wine-themed spa. Due to open in autumn; rates yet to be set; comohotels.comSix years ago, the Hinduja Group and OHL Developments paid more than £350m for a 250-year lease on the Old War Office in Whitehall, a turreted former government ministry that opened in 1906, having cost a then-staggering £1.2m to build. Next winter it will open as a hotel — Raffles London at The OWO — with 120 rooms, 85 residences, a spa and 11 restaurants and bars, its interiors the work of New York-based Thierry Despont. The principal suite will be named after Winston Churchill, who served as secretary of state for war and air here from 1919-21 in an office previously occupied by Lloyd George and later by John Profumo.Expect much to be made of Ian Fleming too. He is said to have developed his idea for James Bond while employed here as a naval intelligence officer during the second world war. Indeed, no other building has featured in as many 007 films. In Octopussy, A View to a Kill and Licence to Kill it stood in for MI6. It has a cameo in Spectre. And the final scene of Skyfall was shot on its roof, soon to be the setting of a restaurant with panoramic views. Late 2022; rates yet to be set; theowo.londonIn 2017, French couple Fabrice and Evguenia Ivara, a former KPMG auditor and Moët Hennessy brand manger respectively, arrived on Sumba and decided to stay. Back then, most tourists tended to be surfers, drawn by its legendary breaks, and the only really smart hotel was what is now Nihi Sumba. The island, which is twice the size of Bali, an hour’s flight away, could do with another, they thought. So having found a beach on which they could build, they set about building Cap Karoso, a 47-room hotel plus 20 villas, their flat roofs disguised by organic gardens so that they seem to merge with the landscape. They’ve also established a farm that will produce most of the food in its restaurant, and plan to open an agricultural school for the local community as well as ateliers for local and visiting artists. Due to open in September; doubles from $250; capkaroso.comBuilt and equipped at a cost of €120m, the 55-room Lanserhof Sylt consists of a cluster of what look like giant thatched cottages, reminiscent of those in the local villages and overlooking the Wattenmeer, a watery landscape of shifting mudflats that is paradise for birdwatchers. Rather than simply a spa, this will be the third “medical resort” from the Lanserhof group: as well as indoor and outdoor saltwater pools and Technogym equipment, the facilities run to MRI and CT scanners, while a stay here involves a comprehensive range of tests, analyses, scans, ECGs and precisely focused massages, not to mention “medical lectures”. But if a week here (the minimum length of a “classic” cure) doesn’t sound entirely pleasurable, for those resolved to, as they put it, “get rid of unnecessary ballast” (physical or psychological), Sylt is a beguilingly beautiful setting — an island with a microclimate that ensures the North Sea, which laps (or lashes) its 35km stretch of pale quartz sand, is warmer than you might suppose. Due to open on May 1; seven-night Cure Classic from €7,120 per person; lanserhof.comSextantio is known for its two wildly atmospheric alberghi diffusi in Italy, one in the medieval houses of the tiny Abruzzo hill-village of Santo Stefano, the other in the sassi (or cave dwellings) of Matera in Basilicata. Rather than creating conventional luxury experiences, its aim is to open hotels in what it calls “areas of social disadvantage” — the latest project being at the northern tip of Nkombo, an island in Lake Kivu, on the border between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The verdant, hilly island covers 22 sq km and is Rwanda’s, though the population of 20,000 is largely Congolese.Sextantio Rwanda, The Capanne Project, as it styles itself, will consist of a cluster of beehive-like thatched dwellings inspired by the King of the Tutsis’ Hut in the Ethnographic Museum in Butare and built without electric tools. There’s a beach from which one can swim, though it won’t be warm: the lake has depths of 1,000m and an altitude of 1,460m; the year-round average air temperature is 20C. Exploring the lake in dugout canoes and night fishing are among the activities on offer, along with trips to the Nyungwe Forest National Park (for sightings of a dozen primate species), and the Akagera Savannah in the east of the country (for bigger animals). However, Sextantio’s philanthropic founder, Daniele Kihlgren, hopes that guests will also interact with village life on the island, visit its schools and health centre, learn about the farming and fishing that sustains its population and ultimately come to support the NGO he has set up to provide “the neediest in Rwanda” with health insurance. For this is a hotel with no published rates: the price of staying here is a donation. Due to open March 21, sextantiorwanda.comThe venerable Viennese grocer Julius Meinl am Graben, a sort of Austrian Fortnum & Mason, is making it first venture into hotel-keeping with The Julius, a 10-minute walk from Wenceslas Square (and about twice that from the Charles Bridge). The Italian architect Matteo Thun, well known for the Vigilius Mountain Resort in the South Tyrol and the Waldhotel at the Swiss Burgenstock resort, has transformed a late 19th-century neo-renaissance building, formerly offices, into a hotel of 168 studios and suites, many with kitchens. The subdued palette has been inspired by the art nouveau posters of the artist Alphonse Mucha, a museum of whose work is a couple of blocks away. Julius hotels in Belgrade and Budapest are expected to follow. Due to open March 1; doubles from €190; thejulius.euNot to be confused with Chile’s remote Explora Hotels, Phuket-based Explorar Hotels & Resorts has built its first refreshingly inexpensive hotel Pawapi Koh Mook on a comparatively undeveloped island in a part of the Andaman Sea where it’s still possible to spot dugongs, the critically endangered elephantine marine mammal.Diving and snorkelling aside, the island’s chief attraction is its Emerald Cave, a huge limestone grotto within which lies a beach that is accessible only by swimming. More readily accessible, the stretch of white sand on which its 23 simply furnished thatched bungalows and villas on stilts are strung out looks even lovelier.

Jaguars, jaguarundis and tapirs, though rarely glimpsed, are among the wildlife, and there are even the remains of 27 ancient Mayan cities, notably Muyil, which has a 17-metre-high pyramid. This spring the only hotel in the reserve reopens after a wholesale transformation as Casa Chablé. Sited on a speck of an island, it consists of a villa with five suites and five further bungalows on its 200m of beach. Like the other locally owned Chablé hotels, inland near Merida and further up the coast, it takes cooking and wellness very seriously, but the main draw here will be nature.

And in 2019, they began to rent a couple of them out, bases from which visitors might explore one of Europe’s last great wildernesses, still populated by bears, wolves and lynxes, on foot, by bike or on horseback. This spring they will open their first guesthouse, the Corner Barn, a 300-year-old former farm building converted to accommodate four handsome bedrooms. A restaurant specialising in the local cuisine, which bears not just Hungarian but Turkish and Armenian influences, operates in another restored barn, using locally sourced and foraged produce, not least abundant truffles (when in season).

319  The last time German inflation was as high as it is now, in June 1992, the Bundesbank’s benchmark lending rate, the Lombard rate, was 9.75 per cent. Today the European Central Bank, the Bundesbank’s successor, is charging banks in Germany, as well as the wider eurosystem, zilch.A lot has changed since the summer of 1992. Twenty-nine years ago, the unified German state was in its infancy and monetary union was yet to be born. It is, according to a note out Tuesday from research outfit Laburnum Consulting, the latter of these two changes that does more to explain why the gulf between rates then and now is so vast.As we enter 2022, the ECB is breaking with another tradition. For the first time in more than a decade, policymakers in Frankfurt are mapping a different course to that being taken by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, each of whom is either hiking interest rates or set to consider them in the next few months in response to the spike in inflation witnessed over the past year. The ECB, meanwhile, is set to leave rates on hold for the duration of this year. The Laburnum note — written by Laburnum founder and former Bank of England official John Nugée and economist Gabriel Stein — thinks this is in part because the eurozone’s monetary guardian is setting policy with the region’s more heavily indebted sovereigns in mind:This, Nugée and Stein argue, is set to lead to the ECB coming under fire, yet again, in the German popular press for favouring the currency zone’s more profligate members, at the expense of the more parsimonious.We agree that this narrative is likely to play out. And it may, as the months roll on, seem as though the ECB is reluctant to remove support for reasons which economic factors alone fail to explain.While workers here are yet to experience the sort of wage growth their American counterparts have, there are increasing signs of tightness in the labour market. Here’s a chart from an email from Nomura’s economists, which piqued our interest when it landed in our inbox in mid December:However, while the ECB is an outlier in terms of its plans for the coming year, the central banks may still have far more in common with one another than they do earlier generations of policymakers.Despite the shift in rhetoric from the Fed, the yawning gap between rates now and rates then is a similar magnitude in the US and Germany. The last time US inflation was above 6 per cent, in the autumn of 1990, the effective federal funds rate was around 8 per cent. Today it hovers above zero.There’s a chasm between where rates are right now and where they were the last time we saw inflation as high as it currently is.There are good reasons why they don’t need to be as high today as they were in the early 1990s. For instance, governments, firms and households are now more indebted — relatively small rises in rates will have a bigger impact on behaviour than in the past. Price pressures may be a different beast this time around too. Some of the inflation we’ve seen of late is in markets for goods such as used cars. Such inflation is linked pandemic-related supply shortages and may well disappear as businesses adapt to a world with Covid-19.Still, a question hovers over the degree to which aggressive fiscal spending and monetary easing has led to something more enduring happening to inflation than chinks in global supply chains alone can justify. Rates don’t need to rise as high as 10 per cent. But if (and — in our view — it remains a big if), higher inflation becomes endemic, then they are going to need to rise an awful lot higher than any monetary policymaker is owning up to.
320  President Emmanuel Macron has come under fire from political rivals for saying he wanted to “piss off” the unvaccinated by depriving them of restaurants, cinemas and social activities to pressure them to get protected against Covid-19.“There is a tiny minority of people who are resistant,” he said in an interview with Le Parisien newspaper published on Tuesday night.“We can reduce that, I’m sorry to say, by pissing them off even more. I am not here to piss off the French, I complain all day long about the administration when it bugs them. But the unvaccinated, I really want to piss them off. So that’s what we will keep doing, all the way to the end. That is the strategy. I am not going to send them to prison, I am not going to vaccinate them by force,” he said.Macron’s comments were criticised by his competitors in the upcoming presidential elections as well as by opposition lawmakers, who were debating the government’s draft law that would require proof of vaccination to access public places including restaurants, cafés and theatres. A negative Covid test will no longer suffice.The late-night parliamentary session in the National Assembly was suspended after the opposition demanded that the prime minister come to justify the use of the expression “emmerder”, slang deriving from the French word for shit.Far-right presidential hopeful Marine Le Pen accused Macron of abdicating his responsibility to unite the French and called his words “vulgar” and “violent”.“It shows the president wants to declare war against a part of the French public, who I remind you, even if we do not share their choices, have broken no laws,” Le Pen said at the National Assembly.Valérie Pécresse, the candidate for Les Républicains, said she was “outraged” by Macron’s suggestion that the unvaccinated could no longer be considered responsible citizens. Macron in the interview justified this conclusion by saying the unvaccinated were threatening the freedom of others.“I want to value the efforts made by the French, not to humiliate those who are not vaccinated from the Elysée,” Pécresse said on CNEWS, accusing Macron of a “terrible lack of empathy”.Green party candidate Yannick Jadot called Macron’s remarks unhelpful: “Do you think insulting people will convince them to get vaccinated?”The episode comes as the more transmissible Omicron coronavirus variant pushed Covid infections to record highs with about 272,000 cases reported on Tuesday, making France among the worst-hit countries in Europe.Macron’s government has bet that the booster campaign and some light-touch restrictions such as homeworking and mask-wearing will be enough to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed. Yet hospitals have already begun to cancel non-emergency operations in the Marseille and Paris regions, and doctors admit they are rationing beds in intensive care.About 79 per cent of the French population have been vaccinated with two doses, and 34 per cent have received a booster, according to Santé publique France, although the proportion of those who have been given a booster is much higher for older people. That leaves about 5m eligible people who have not been vaccinated, including some militant anti-vaxxers, but also adolescents, and housebound or isolated elderly people.Before the pandemic, academic studies showed France to be one of the most vaccine-hesitant countries globally.But Macron’s creation of a so-called health pass last summer that required proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test to access many public places has helped to push immunisation rates in France to among the highest in Europe. He now wants to turn it into a “vaccine pass”, which would mean only the vaccinated can use it.The episode marked the return of the more combative Macron after several television interviews in December in which he sought to project more empathy. He has repeatedly made off-the-cuff remarks during his tenure that critics say come across as arrogant and scornful, such as when he told an unemployed gardener that he could easily find him a job “just by crossing the street” or when he criticised the state’s spending of “crazy money” on anti-poverty programmes.Asked by Le Parisien if he was running for re-election, he stopped short of officially declaring his candidacy, but signalled his intentions as polls show him as the frontrunner.“There is no false suspense. I want to,” Macron said.
321  Happy New Year and welcome back to Europe Express.France is now in the driving seat of the rotating EU presidency and its ambition for a more autonomous European security and defence policy is being tested in a flurry of meetings with Russia about Ukraine, where Washington (and to some extent Paris and Berlin) are upstaging the EU’s own diplomatic service. We’ll unpack the arguments EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell made for the bloc not to be left out of upcoming Nato-Russia talks.Meanwhile, on the pandemic front, the French government is extending its aid to businesses struggling with the new wave of restrictions imposed to halt the spread of the Omicron variant. Government inaction three months before the presidential election would have been easily seized upon by opponents, who are already criticising the latest restrictions on big rallies.And in fresh Brexit statistics, we’ll look at why Europe is importing less and less food from the UK — while Britain is still going strong importing European wine.What a difference half a year makes. Last June, Brussels was aghast at a Franco-German proposal for the EU to sit down with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Now, Brussels is outraged that it has been snubbed in favour of the US and Nato, and has demanded to be given a chance to talk with the Kremlin next week about Ukraine, writes Henry Foy in Brussels.Josep Borrell, head of the EU’s foreign and security arm, who has personal experience of what it feels like to be dismissed as a geopolitical lightweight by Moscow, has said that the EU “cannot be a neutral spectator” when European security is being discussed. The Kremlin would beg to differ.As many EU officials privately admit to Europe Express, the bloc only has itself to blame for not being seen as a worthy defence and security sparring partner, given that it is riven by disagreements and division in precisely these areas.Case in point: the EU-Nato declaration. With 21 countries members of both organisations, agreeing on a largely symbolic statement of co-operation that effectively reinstated those made in 2016 and 2018 was supposed to be a simple task.But despite a majority of member states calling on EU Council president Charles Michel to make short work of a draft submitted in September by Nato, it has been delayed into this year.That, by accident or — more likely — design, brings the debate over its contents under the French EU presidency, and the Elysée’s belief that the EU needs more “strategic autonomy” and defence capabilities independent of the US-led military alliance.Speaking of France, while Borrell calls for a united EU voice to speak with Russia, Paris and Berlin are instead sending envoys to talk to Moscow privately. That will please the Kremlin, which, of course, prefers talking to individual countries anyway as it is easier to work out where their geopolitical and business interests align.Eastern EU states, who are members of Nato precisely because they fear Russia and are wary of their western colleagues going soft on Moscow, will get their time across the table with the Russians next Wednesday, when the Moscow delegation sits down for a summit with the alliance.But the Russians will come to Brussels for the Nato headquarters, not the EU’s. Despite Borrell’s chagrin, the EU will need to accept its role as a neutral spectator — and readouts from the meetings after they conclude.For all the dreams of “strategic autonomy” and Michel’s proclamation that 2022 will be the “year of European defence”, when Moscow needs to talk power politics, it knows who to call.France is extending fresh financial help to small companies struggling because of new health measures and easing repayment conditions on state-backed loans as it tries to keep an economic recovery on track despite a surge in Covid-19 infections, writes Sarah White in Paris.Like many European peers, France avoided mass defaults throughout the pandemic and shielded businesses such as restaurants that had to close for months on end thanks to a vast aid package that included furlough schemes, government-guaranteed loans and help with welfare bills and rental costs.As a fifth Covid wave picks up, with a spike in infections led by the highly transmissible Omicron variant, France has so far shunned any form of full lockdown and is banking on stepping up a vaccination booster shot campaign.But new restrictions, including a ban on events of over 2,000 people, are set to hit the entertainment industry. Nightclubs are closed and bars and restaurants may struggle as people are told to revert to working from home and cut back on socialising.Economy minister Bruno Le Maire said companies under pressure in sectors such as tourism or hospitality could apply for aid to cover their fixed costs if their revenues halve in January. The government will also allow some businesses to renegotiate their state-backed loans, with those due to start repaying them from March able to apply for a six-month delay.“We’re not reactivating the ‘whatever it takes’ mode,” Le Maire told RTL radio yesterday, referring to the broader aid packages put in place in 2020.Some 25,000 to 30,000 small companies out of a total of nearly 700,000 that have taken out state-backed loans via their banks could struggle with immediate repayment, Le Maire said.France’s banking federation said the financial sector was in talks with the government over how to articulate the loan extensions, which it said could be envisaged on a case-by-case basis for struggling companies. It said more than half the businesses that had taken out state-guaranteed loans had begun to repay them already.Poland’s annual inflation hit 7.8 per cent in November, the highest level for two decades, and the fourth highest in the EU. This development poses a problem for the country’s ruling Law and Justice party (PiS), which has so far remained popular thanks to a large extent to its success in improving the lot of less well-off Poles. (More here)Agri-food imports from the UK to the EU declined by almost €3bn, or 27 per cent, in the first nine months of 2021 from a year earlier, after new post-Brexit trade rules came into effect, according to European Commission data.The decline in trade came even as exports from the EU to the UK rose slightly, by 0.5 per cent, with particularly strong rises for wine and live animals, writes Judith Evans in London.The import drop came after new post-Brexit regulations took effect from January 2021, imposing new veterinary and customs checks on goods sent from the UK to the EU, even as the UK delayed the full implementation of the new rules on goods travelling in the opposite direction until 2022.The decline was particularly steep for tropical fruits, nuts and spices, where imports fell by 88 per cent, or €217m — a drop that Dominic Goudie, head of international trade at the UK’s Food and Drink Federation, said probably reflected new rules of origin. These impose tariffs on imports to the EU where foodstuffs originate elsewhere and have not been significantly processed in the UK.This shift has prompted some multinationals to reorganise supplies, he said.“Some businesses have reorientated their supply chains — if they are supplying to their own factories or customers in the EU, they will trade directly into the EU instead of coming via the UK,” Goudie said.Other areas where trade declined steeply included wine, pet food, vegetables and confectionery.Trade has rebounded somewhat from the early months of 2021, when some companies had stockpiled in advance of the new Brexit rules, and others — especially those importing and exporting animal products — fell foul of delays and paperwork mistakes at the border. But imports from the UK in September 2021 were still 25 per cent below a year earlier, the commission said.Goudie said data on the final quarter of 2021 would help to show whether UK exporters will make up some of that lost ground. New sanitary and phytosanitary requirements on agri-food products moving from the EU to the UK from July will meanwhile present a fresh challenge for EU exporters, he addedand later this week
322  Chinese banks rushed to meet their annual state-imposed lending quotas last month by buying up low-risk financial instruments, a divided EU has demanded a role in next week’s negotiations with Russia over the Ukraine crisis, and travel stocks rose sharply on Tuesday. Plus, the FT’s Frankfurt correspondent, Joe Miller, explains why the German city of Mainz wants to hang onto the vaccine maker BioNTech. 
323  One year on, as far as Northern Ireland is concerned, Brexit is nowhere near done.The UK region is in a significant election year, with polls showing unionist parties on course to lose their majority for the first time — a seismic political shift in a region that was created for them a century ago.But among the most pivotal issues in the May 5 elections is one that voters care little about. Instead of health, inflation, housing or jobs, the campaign will be dominated by Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit trading arrangements.“Undoubtedly it will be a big feature of the elections,” said Katy Hayward, a professor of political sociology and Brexit expert at Queen’s University Belfast.London and Brussels are expected this month to resume deadlocked talks on how to make the special arrangements, known as the Northern Ireland protocol, more workable. The negotiations will be the starting gun for a politically volatile year as the Democratic Unionist party seeks to keep its voters onside, nationalist party Sinn Féin aims to seize the first minister’s post and centrist parties try to be kingmaker.Brexit left Northern Ireland straddling two jurisdictions: as well as being in the UK market, it remained in the EU’s single market for goods. The arrangement was designed to ensure there would be no return of a hard border on the island of Ireland that could take the region back to the dark days before the 1998 Good Friday Agreement ended three decades of sectarian conflict.But the compromise put customs checks in the Irish Sea, which has caused problems for trade between mainland Britain and Northern Ireland, despite advocates arguing it offers the region a chance to benefit from access to both the EU and British markets.Already, trade with the Republic of Ireland is booming. Northern Ireland’s exports to its southern neighbour surged 63 per cent in the first 10 months of 2021, to €3.2bn, compared with the same period in 2020, according to Ireland’s Central Statistics Office. Northern Ireland’s imports from the Republic were also 46 per cent higher, at €922m.Neil Collins, managing director of Wrightbus, a bus maker focused on hydrogen-fuelled vehicles, said the protocol had the potential to be a “very, very strong suit for Northern Ireland”, but needed tweaks.According to a recent survey by the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Brexit has meant supply chain problems for nine out of 10 Northern Irish companies.Paul Jackson, commercial director at McBurney Transport, a haulage group, said overall costs had risen 25-27 per cent in 2021 and he expected another 10-12 per cent increase in 2022.“We have seen big increases in terms of our costs and.if we’re not careful, Northern Ireland could become a manufacturing backwater,” echoed Geoff Potter, managing director at Gray & Adams (Ireland), a maker of refrigerated trucks.The DUP, the biggest party supporting Northern Ireland’s place within the UK, has repeatedly threatened to walk out of the region’s power-sharing government unless the customs checks are scrapped. In a sign of how the protocol exacerbates cross-community party divisions, it is supported by Sinn Féin.The EU has offered to slash red tape and customs checks to end the row over the protocol, but London is pushing for further concessions. The UK government is also threatening to suspend parts of the deal by triggering the Article 16 safeguard clause, which could detonate a trade war with the EU.But polls show many people in both unionist and republican communities in Northern Ireland accept, or are resigned to, the protocol.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, leader of the DUP, has spent a great deal of political capital on the protocol in recent months but even if he went through with his threat, it would have little practical impact so close to the election. “Brexit has been bad for unionism.and really bad for the DUP,” said Pete Shirlow, director of the Liverpool University’s Institute of Irish Studies.The issue is also important to the Ulster Unionist party, which is seeking to mobilise the moderate unionist vote. “At the moment, half of their supporters are opposed to the protocol, a quarter are in favour and a quarter don’t know,” said Hayward at Queen’s University Belfast.With public ambivalence about the protocol, and census results expected to show Catholics outnumbering Protestants in Northern Ireland for the first time later this year, the election was “crunch time for unionism”, she added.There is also uncertainty over whether unionists would yield to Sinn Féin if the nationalist party came out on top in so-called designations — the process by which Northern Ireland’s elected representatives must designate themselves “unionist”, “nationalist” or “other” to ensure cross-community consent for decision-making.After an election, the largest party within the largest designation nominates who will be first minister and the largest party in the second largest community nominates the deputy first minister — although both posts have equal status.But the DUP has been unwilling to say whether it will serve alongside a Sinn Féin first minister. Support for the centrist Alliance party, which has been gaining ground since 2017 and designates itself as “other”, could be significant.“We’re going to get stuck in politics about who’s first minister and more distraction from the question about how do we fix health, how do we fix housing, how do we use the subvention [the UK government’s budget transfer to Northern Ireland] to build a new economy, how do we build a new society,” Shirlow said.Brexit threatens to amplify these political divisions. As Simon Coveney, Irish foreign minister, told the FT last month: “As long as the protocol remains a topic of dispute between the EU and the UK, and between Britain and Ireland, politics in Northern Ireland can’t settle in the way that it needs to, particularly in an election year.”
324  The purpose of the European Commission’s green taxonomy is clear. To hit its ambitious climate goals — reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 — the EU needs to mobilise a flood of capital to finance the necessary investment, funnelling bank loans, bond investors and stock markets towards environmentally friendly “green” technologies and away from unfriendly “brown” ones. Where best to draw the line, however, is far less straightforward. The scale of the task demands a radical approach; to meet its goals the EU must start rapidly phasing out fossil fuels now. But it also requires a recognition of just how difficult it will be to deploy sufficient renewable energy.Including natural gas as a “transitional fuel” is justified, but only temporarily and with strict conditions. Partly the reasoning for labelling the fossil fuel as “green”, in a proposal published at the new year, is political. The commission anticipates the need for a grand bargain between the nuclear-dependent France and more coal-reliant countries in the east, which will need natural gas to transition away from the black fuel, as well as Germany, where scepticism of nuclear power, which the commission also rightly classified as green, is widespread. While the scheme needs only to achieve a qualified majority to pass, the commission does not wish to over-rule any large countries. Pursuing a compromise is the best way to make progress.Europe must begin moving away from coal immediately, using natural gas as a temporary bridge. Yet around a quarter of the European Union’s total energy currently comes from gas and, the trade bloc says that, to meets its 2050 target, it will need to reduce emissions by at least 55 per cent by 2030. The Commission is therefore right to insist on conditions for any new natural gas infrastructure to genuinely reduce emissions, rather than to be used as an additional source of power.Natural gas power plants can qualify for the label in one of two ways. One is if they produce less than 100g of carbon dioxide equivalent for every kilowatt hour of electricity over the project’s lifetime — the average carbon intensity of EU energy is 230 grammes of greenhouse gases for every kilowatt hour. The second is if they meet several conditions, including being built before 2030, emitting less than 270g of CO2 per kilowatt hour and not providing a substantial amount of additional electricity capacity compared with the plants they replace. Such conditions mean that gas will, eventually, need to be combined with carbon capture technology when its role as a “bridge” is over.These conditions should be tightened in future. The taxonomy must not be rigid and should recognise that instead of a binary distinction between green and brown, climate change mitigation technologies are instead on a spectrum that includes “olive” alongside the bright green and the dark brown. Technological advancement, too, especially in terms of carbon capture and storage could eventually change the justification for some investment projects. EU’s policy should keep pace.Ultimately natural gas is not a green source of energy. Including it on the list — intended to be the international “gold standard” — risks imperilling Europe’s climate leadership, emboldening countries elsewhere to continue building new gas plants (South Korea included liquefied natural gas in its taxonomy last week). Natural gas does, however, have a temporary role during the transition. Rich, democratic countries, such as those in the EU, must demonstrate how best to get to net zero not only from a technological point of view but also politically, managing and spreading the costs.
325  A divided EU has demanded a role in next week’s negotiations with Russia over the Ukraine crisis and broader issues of European defence, after Vladimir Putin succeeded in sidelining the bloc in favour of talks with the US and Nato.EU officials speaking to the Financial Times expressed frustration at the way negotiations in Geneva and Brussels were arranged — with Russian officials set to discuss the security of Ukraine and the whole European continent with counterparts from both Washington and the US-led military alliance. While US officials have remained in close contact with those in Brussels and in individual EU states, Washington has not sought to alter Moscow’s proposed negotiations.Brussels “cannot be a neutral spectator in the negotiations” over Europe’s future security architecture, Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said on Tuesday as he started a three-day visit to Ukraine.The sidelining underscored Brussels’ lack of foreign policy clout amid divergent views on how to handle Russia and internal disagreements over the EU’s own security policy, the EU officials said, pointing to the inability of its 27 members to agree on a long-planned statement of co-operation with Nato.“This is not a theoretical exercise right now, it is about real threats,” a senior EU government minister said of the debate over co-operation with Nato. “In the current context, [the delay] exposes the divisions inside the union and makes us less able to respond to Russia as one.”Moscow, which has massed more than 100,000 troops close to the Ukrainian border, has issued a list of security demands to the west and threatened military action if they are ignored. These include Nato and the US not offering membership to Ukraine, and restricting the transatlantic alliance’s deployments in EU countries close to Russia.While Brussels is overlooked, some member states have instead sought bilateral contacts with Russia. Germany and France have stepped up diplomatic efforts, with German chancellor Olaf Scholz’s new foreign policy adviser Jens Plötner and his French counterpart Emmanuel Bonne travelling this week to Moscow for talks with senior Russian officials. The two will also meet Ukrainian officials this week for separate discussions.But in a sign of the EU’s discord, Mario Draghi, Italy’s prime minister, admitted last month that Europe had few ways to deter Russian action against Ukraine.“The EU’s limited role in the discussion with Moscow is a natural reflection of its own lack of unity,” said Andrew Weiss, vice-president of the Russia and Eurasia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Moscow has literally zero interest in engaging with the EU as such.”The Ukraine crisis has taken place as the EU debate about its role as a defence actor has intensified. Twenty-one of the EU’s 27 member states are also members of Nato, and many — particularly those in eastern Europe — see the transatlantic alliance as their primary protection against external threats such as Russia.The Nato-EU statement is being drafted by Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and European Council president Charles Michel. It has been billed by officials from both organisations as an uncontroversial update to previous Nato-EU declarations of co-operation signed in 2016 and 2018.But it has become hostage to discussions inside the EU over more “strategic autonomy” in defence and security, an initiative pushed by a group of countries led by France that believe the bloc should rely less on Nato and develop some of its own independent defence capabilities.Largely ceremonial, it was intended as a means to align shared objectives before the EU and Nato publish their own individual defence policies this summer that will outline strategies for the next decade.Its delayed adoption undermined the EU’s ambitions to project itself as a security actor and weakened its demand to secure a seat at the negotiating table, bloc officials said.National divergences over defence and security issues “inescapably harm the EU’s strategic direction and undercut its ability to be treated as a serious player in a crisis where power politics are what really matters”, said Weiss.While a majority of member states requested that the Nato co-operation declaration be agreed and signed last year, a final draft is only set to be circulated this month, bringing it under the purview of France’s six-month rotating presidency of the EU, which began on January 1.The declaration could be signed in March, said one EU official.Defending the slower pace of drafting, the official said Michel must represent the opinions of all member states, including those that are not members of the military alliance, such as Austria and Cyprus. A spokesman for Michel declined to comment.“A lot of it is about French control of the agenda when they have the presidency. There are elements they want in there, whether it’s primacy of the EU or strategic autonomy,” said a second EU official briefed on the drafting process.“Delaying it creates an issue from something designed to eliminate issues,” said a third official.French president Emmanuel Macron has made clear he wants to personally lead the process of reinforcing European sovereignty and defining the EU’s relationship with Nato during his country’s presidency of the bloc.French officials believe that agreeing the EU’s own defence and security policies should be prioritised before getting into the question of how it should co-operate with Nato.One French official told the FT the idea of an immediate EU-Nato joint declaration was a “secondary” matter.
326  Lithuania’s decision to allow Taiwan to open a de facto embassy in its own name was a mistake, the country’s president said on Tuesday, as he rebuked the country’s government for a move that sparked a diplomatic spat with China.Gitanas Nauseda told Lithuanian radio the centre-right government had not consulted him last year before the island’s representative office was opened in the name of Taiwan, rather than the city of Taipei — as in most European countries.Beijing has accused Lithuania of breaking its One China policy, under which it does not allow other countries to treat Taiwan as an independent country. It has recalled its ambassador and downgraded Lithuania’s diplomatic presence in Beijing.“I think it was not the opening of the Taiwanese office that was the mistake, but the name, which was not co-ordinated with me.I believe the name was the spark, and now we have to deal with the consequences,” Nauseda told Ziniu Radijas.Since Taiwan and Lithuania agreed in August to open representative offices in each other’s capitals, China has ratcheted up pressure on Vilnius. Beijing has not just banned imports from the Baltic country but has tried to stop manufacturers, including German blue-chip auto parts supplier Continental, from using components produced in Lithuania.Lithuania evacuated its remaining diplomats from Beijing last month after China demanded they hand in their diplomatic IDs to have their status downgraded.Both Nauseda and the Lithuanian government have insisted that they respect China’s policy on Taiwan, but that Vilnius has the right to establish economic and cultural relations with whomever it likes.“We would like to also have relations with China based on the principle of mutual respect. Otherwise the dialogue turns into unilateral ultimatums, requirements which are not acceptable in international relations,” Nauseda told the Financial Times in August.Taipei has tried to soften the blow to Lithuania from China’s economic retaliatory measures. On Monday, state-owned Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation snapped up a shipment of 24,000 bottles of Lithuanian rum that had been rejected by Chinese customs. Lithuanian beer brand Volfas Engelman’s Taiwan sales soared 23-fold in 2021, boosted by goodwill towards the Baltic country.Taiwan’s new envoy has also said that Taipei will set up a taskforce seeking to help Lithuania train semiconductor engineers and attract semiconductor investment.Nauseda’s comments about Taiwan on Tuesday have shattered the fragile unity on foreign policy that had existed between the president, who takes the lead on such issues, and the government, headed by prime minister Ingrida Simonyte, who Nauseda beat in 2019’s presidential elections.Nauseda has already clashed with Simonyte’s government over its Covid-19 policies, which descended into open bickering between the pair in November after the president vetoed a bill to make unvaccinated workers pay for their own tests.As well as its deteriorating relations with China, Vilnius is under pressure from Russia and Belarus, which has sent illegal immigrants over the border in a bid to make Lithuania soften its stance on sanctions.Nauseda, who represents Lithuania at EU summits, added on Tuesday: “Unconventional measures have started to be taken against Lithuania, and we have to be very active and signal very clearly to the EU that this is an attack, a kind of pressure on one of the EU countries.”
327  Italy’s parliament will convene on January 24 to start voting for the country’s next president, in an election that could herald the end of the national unity government and unsettle investors betting on a continued economic recovery.Roberto Fico, the Speaker of the lower house of parliament, summoned lawmakers from both chambers of parliament and representatives of Italy’s regions to take part in voting, which could extend over several days.Mario Draghi, Italy’s prime minister, unsettled lawmakers before Christmas when he signalled he was willing to be nominated as president. His potential resignation as premier could trigger elections, which would risk delaying structural reforms and investments linked to the EU’s pandemic recovery fund.Many lawmakers and international investors would prefer the former European Central Bank president to remain as PM until elections that are due in 2023, to complete structural reforms and amid uncertainty in the country over the Omicron coronavirus variant.Many MPs will also lose their jobs in the next election, after Italians voted in a 2019 referendum to cut the number of parliamentary seats by more than a third.Draghi is seen as a unifying figure for the unwieldy ruling coalition, which includes the centre-left Democratic party (PD), far-right League, populist Five Star and liberal Forza Italia, as well as small leftwing and centrist parties.Enrico Letta, leader of the PD, warned that if the governing coalition could not agree on a cross-party presidential candidate, a government crisis would follow.The first choice of the centre-right coalition parties, as well as the opposition Brothers of Italy, is former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who has made clear he is willing to take on the presidency. However, he would not be expected to receive support from Five Star or the PD.Five Star said it would consider a woman such as Senate Speaker Maria Elisabetta Alberti Casellati or justice minister Marta Cartabia. Former prime minister Giuliano Amato has also been suggested as a candidate.The presidential election is conducted by secret ballot among more than 1,000 MPs and regional representatives and is often unpredictable. Each voter writes their preferred candidate on a piece of paper and cast their ballot. For the first three rounds of voting, a two-thirds majority is required. Subsequently an absolute majority is required.President Sergio Mattarella, 80, whose seven-year term ends early next month, has made clear repeatedly that he is not seeking re-election.Italy’s president’s formal powers include appointing the prime minister and other members of the government. The head of state also plays a big, behind-the-scenes role in ensuring stability and respect for Italy’s EU and international obligations.
328  In preparation for Vladimir Putin’s imminent meeting with Joe Biden, the Kremlin published a set of demands on European security, including a ban on Nato expansion and the deployment of offensive weapons near Russia’s border. The backdrop to this démarche was Moscow’s intensifying military pressure on Ukraine and its resentment at Nato’s admission of 14 central and eastern European countries between 1999 and 2020.For Sweden and Finland, the Russian demands give extra cause for concern. For 30 years the traditionally neutral duo have drawn close to Nato, without applying to join the US-led alliance. On December 24 Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, stated that if Sweden and Finland were to become Nato members, “this would have serious military and political consequences”.From a Swedish and Finnish point of view, such warnings look disturbingly like an attempt to limit the foreign and security policy choices of democratic, independent states. The question is whether Russia’s truculence may backfire by prompting Stockholm and Helsinki one day to seek the safety of formal Nato membership and the alliance’s Article 5 mutual defence clause.For the moment, that seems unlikely. A Finnish government defence report, published in September, kept open the option of applying to Nato. But in reality Finland’s political parties are divided on the question and the public shows no great enthusiasm for full Nato membership.It is a similar story in Sweden. In December 2020 a parliamentary majority emerged for the first time in favour of adopting a Finland-style “Nato option”. However, when Magdalena Andersson, the Social Democratic prime minister, set out her government’s policies on November 30, she said explicitly: “Sweden will not apply for membership of Nato.” Andersson nevertheless made clear that “Sweden is deepening its defence co-operation with Finland and other Nordic neighbours, within the EU, with the US and in partnership with Nato”.Even this cautious statement illustrates how far Sweden and Finland have changed their defence and security postures since the cold war. Sweden, neutral since the Napoleonic wars, maintained that stance despite incidents such as the “Whiskey on the Rocks” episode of 1981, when a Soviet Whiskey-class submarine ran aground near the Swedish naval base of Karlskrona.Finland’s neutrality was more restricted, the result of a so-called friendship treaty signed under Soviet pressure in 1948. Acutely aware that their country had formed part of the 19th-century tsarist empire, Finns learned to live with their unusual status, under which they had limited room for manoeuvre in foreign policy but were able to develop into a prosperous democracy, rather than being turned into an eastern European-style communist satellite state.After the Soviet Union’s collapse, Sweden and Finland signed up for Nato’s Partnership for Peace programme in 1994, just before they entered the EU. And in 2016 they signed host nation support agreements with Nato, which offer alliance forces access to Swedish and Finnish territory in the event of a military emergency. In short, there may be little need for Sweden and Finland to become full Nato members, because it already seems close to inconceivable that the alliance would stand aside if they came under attack.What lessons do these arrangements hold for Ukraine? Not many, unfortunately. In Putin’s eyes, Ukraine is simply not a legitimate state in the way that Sweden and Finland are. Arguably, the challenge for Biden is not to bring Ukraine into Nato — an objective which, in any case, many Nato allies are lukewarm about — but how to make Putin accept Ukraine’s inalienable right to national independence.
329  It is often harder to identify tipping points while they are happening than after the fact. But that has not stopped people from questioning whether a lasting shift in the labour market is under way. After 40 years in which capital has had the whip hand over labour, is worker power on the rise?If so, it would mark a profound change of economic direction for much of the rich world. Since 1985, trade union membership has halved on average across OECD countries, while coverage of collective agreements signed at the national, sector or company level has declined by a third. At the same time, workers have been taking a smaller share of the pie. Real median wage growth has failed to keep pace with productivity growth on average across 24 OECD countries over the past two decades.But the pandemic has precipitated a shortage of workers in many countries that caught employers off-guard. Migrants have returned to their home countries, older people have retired early, and childcare or health problems have led others to exit the labour market.Workers have sought to capitalise on their sudden scarcity value. In the US, unionised workers have launched a series of strikes, from John Deere to Kellogg. Workers have also begun trying to organise in low-paid sectors without a history of union presence, from Starbucks to Amazon. In the UK, the proportion of employees who are union members has begun to creep higher after decades of decline. Workers are also finding new ways to fight for what they want. Organise, a UK-based worker campaign platform, now has more than 1m members after growing rapidly through the pandemic.Policymakers in some countries are trying to help tilt the balance. Joe Biden, US president, has promised to be “the most pro-union president you’ve ever seen” and wants to pass legislation to make it easier for them to organise. The European Commission has published draft legislation which it says will put a stop to gig economy companies wrongly classifying people as “self-employed” to avoid giving them worker rights and protections.Slow-moving demographic factors could contribute too. Some economists believe a global glut of workers in recent decades is set to end as population growth slows and the global share of working-age people begins to shrink. This could bolster wage growth by making staff relatively harder to find.Alternatively, workers might find their moment of leverage proves shortlived. More jobs and tasks are likely to become susceptible to automation as robotics and artificial intelligence improve. The rise of remote working and crowd platforms, which break jobs into small tasks, could lead to a fresh wave of globalisation that hits white-collar staff in the industrialised world.Increased use of algorithms to hire, assess and monitor workers is already beginning to feel disempowering for those on the receiving end. Gig workers managed by algorithms have told this news organisation how frustrating it is to be disciplined by machines that cannot be appealed to nor questioned.Whether or not the balance of power between capital and labour has changed for good, the pandemic has been instructive for both sides. Employers have discovered that staff availability is not a given, but a business risk to mitigate against. Many are paying more attention to recruitment and retention, and not just in the professional world. And a new generation of workers, from shelf stackers to delivery drivers, have learned just how essential they really are.
330  Standing on a lookout point above the Siberian city of Chita, 46-year-old energy worker Vitaliy Gobrik surveyed its fast-expanding suburbs, where the landscape bristles with thousands of low-rise chimneys.“Out of poverty, people burn coal, wood. but they also burn rubber, garbage, waste oil, wooden rail sleepers,” Gobrik said, smog sinking into the skyline below. “They put anything they can find in those stoves.”Chita is one of many big cities in Siberia that have not been connected to Russia’s domestic gas network. Instead, coal-fired power stations heat the city centre, while residents of the suburbs fend off freezing temperatures by firing up furnaces, causing some of the worst air pollution in Russia.Though Russia is the world’s biggest gas exporter, flexing its muscles as an energy superpower on the global stage, back home it has struggled to connect its vast landmass to the domestic network. Whole time zones have been left behind.Only 11 of Russia’s 83 administrative regions are fully connected to the gas pipeline network; about a third of settlements are not connected. In the vast Siberian federal district, with 17m residents, just 17 per cent of settlements have access to piped gas.State-run gas giant Gazprom, which has been responsible for expanding major domestic infrastructure since the 2000s, has said it plans to build all the domestic pipelines that are “technically feasible” by 2030.Igor Yushkov, an analyst with the National Energy Security Fund think-tank, said it would be more apt to use the term “economically justified”. Many areas are too remote and sparsely populated for costly projects to make financial sense. “In most cases, Gazprom is justified when it makes this argument,” Yushkov said.But many areas remain that should be connected, he added.“Gas is not just a commodity, it’s an element of social justice,” Yushkov said. “We are the largest country in the world in terms of gas reserves.while many people are without gas even when living along major export pipelines. Frankly, people are annoyed.”Chita, which lies about 5,000km or more than four days by train away from Moscow, bordering China and Mongolia, does not feature in Gazprom’s near-term proposals at all, according to the company’s pipeline expansion plans to 2025.Konstantin Ilkovsky, the region’s governor until 2016, realised gas was a priority when he first moved to Chita and wondered why his clothes would be a sooty grey colour by the end of a working day. “Everybody got gas, while we were left behind like some outcasts,” he said. “I felt personally resentful.” Ilkovsky lobbied Moscow for a gas pipeline and worked on expanding storage facilities for liquefied natural gas that could be delivered by tankers.“When there’s no wind and temperatures are below freezing — meaning the power plants are burning coal at full blast — the city is covered in coal dust,” he said. “And that is what people are breathing.”But in meetings with Gazprom and other authorities, Ilkovsky was told that his region’s population — at just over a million — was too low to make building a pipeline financially viable.Ilkovsky disagrees. “There is no alternative to gas. We are a gas superpower. It’s just funny to even be arguing about whether or not we need to connect these regions to the network,” the former governor said.Chita lies in a basin, at the confluence of two rivers, and the surrounding hills lock in polluted air. During the summer, smoke from nearby forest fires also gets trapped over the city, said Chita pensioner Elvira Cheremnykh.Cheremnykh, 69, lives in a one-room wooden house that she heats with logs when she can afford to. With coal, “you end up all black like the devil,” she said, standing in the snow outside her home on a particularly toxic day, the air’s smell and taste a mix of sulphur, petrol and soot.Her neighbours, however, burn whatever they can find, she said, and their chimney comes up right outside her window. “It’s impossible to breathe. it all ends up in here,” she said. “You need a gas mask, and even that won’t save you.”In the 1990s, businesses affiliated with the Yukos oil company developed a plan to build a pipeline beside a stretch of the Trans-Siberian railway, bringing gas to the region’s cities, said Ravil Geniatulin, who was governor of Chita and the wider Zabaikalsky Krai region for 17 years.“The project was genuinely about to get started,” Geniatulin recalled, from a room in the Chita city archives. “Maybe the documents still exist somewhere — maps, beautiful ones, where you can see the pipeline drawn on in blue.”In the mid-2000s the plans fell apart, he said, along with Yukos itself — which was seized by the government. Its chief executive Mikhail Khodorkovsky was jailed.The announcement of the building of Gazprom’s massive Power of Siberia pipeline, bringing gas for export to China from a field located just 500km away from Chita, raised hopes in the city once again. But a different route was chosen for the pipe.Plans are being made for a second Power of Siberia pipeline to China via Mongolia. “Skipping us, though, once again,” noted Vladimir Kurbatov, a Chita security guard and Communist party member, who has picketed the local government over gas supplies and air pollution.Kurbatov said many had given up on the idea of gas pipelines, himself included, but they were still desperate for cleaner air. He wants authorities to build the processing plants and storage infrastructure necessary for Chita to be powered on LNG, but is sceptical that a government-led clean air programme for the city will deliver on its objectives.“I’ve seen how people in western Russia live,” Kurbatov said. “It’s all clean there, all using gas.Whereas here we breathe the entire Mendeleev [periodic] table of elements.”
331  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
332  From a serious musical standpoint, New Year’s Eve concerts have always been questionable — disposable music for distracted drinkers. The Berlin Philharmonic has a little more standing in the business. A carefully chosen programme, an outstanding ensemble and a chief conductor with a forceful personality can add much-needed substance to the event.Kirill Petrenko had assembled a programme with plenty of bite to usher out a year we would, in general, prefer to forget. Then back pain obliged him to cancel, and Lahav Shani stepped into the breach.This was a gig no clear-thinking maestro would want. Even with some programme changes, how could a youngster take on such a delicate balance of frippery and profundity and bring it the necessary zing? With little rehearsal time, the risk was that this became about the chief conductor’s absence.You hear the absolute trust the orchestra now has in Petrenko in the split-seconds of uncertainty you get with a substitute. Or are we splitting hairs? Certainly soloist Janine Jansen had no difficulty taking matters into her own hands. Her account of Bruch’s Violin Concerto was fiercely emphatic, never leaving the smallest doubt as to what she wanted the orchestra to do. Hers was a ruthlessly unsentimental Bruch, and it was the better for it.With the 1919 version of Stravinsky’s Firebird Suite, Shani had his own party piece after the interval, and pulled out all the stops. You will hear Simon Rattle’s legacy in the way this orchestra plays this piece for years to come, but Shani worked hard to place his own stamp on it.Ravel’s La Valse brought the concert to a shattering, bittersweet close. The festive banality of the opening Fledermaus overture long forgotten, the orchestra submitted to Shani’s garish colours and abrupt contrasts, and the audience roared its approval.After all the sudden blows and shutdowns, the changing regulations and shifting ground, it is good to witness Berlin’s monster orchestra in full flight. Last year’s New Year’s Eve concert was only offered online; this year, with masks, proof of vaccination, and fresh tests, the audience was able to be together, in the hall, as it happened. The collective live moment is quintessential to the musical experience; no broadcast can replace the visceral thrill of it. May Omicron not take it away from us again.★★★☆☆berliner-philharmoniker.dePerhaps even stranger than the tradition of celebratory New Year’s Eve concerts is the habit among German opera houses of keeping their standard repertoire rolling over the festive season. While the Berlin Philharmonic rolled out waltzes and bonbons, the Komische Oper, a few hundred metres up the road, offered Janacek’s Katja Kabanova on Christmas Day.How about a bit of dysfunctional family drama and social cruelty to round off your Yuletide? Jetske Mijnssen’s grim little production sets the action within the claustrophobic walls of a 1950s home, keeping the chorus offstage and letting the social pressure play out through implication. With Annette Dasch giving her considerable all in the title role, the whole is darkly effective.On the podium, Giedre Slekyte keeps things together well. The cast is universally strong and wholeheartedly inhabits Mijnssen’s fastidious world of repressed characters in a cloying environment. The holiday season was not without its losses; so many orchestral players were ill that the woodwind players had to juggle multiple parts, and Karin Lovelius stepped in, wonderfully capably, as Kabanicha, the mother-in-law from hell.On the bright side, few things are more lushly gorgeous than Janacek’s score, and however disappointing your family Christmas may have been, it was almost definitely not as bad as that of the Kabanova household: the infidelity, guilt, town witch-hunt and suicidal plunge into the Volga of Janacek’s hapless heroine put most family squabbles into perspective. Paradoxically, this beautifully miserable production leaves you feeling elated.
333  As France gears up for this year’s presidential election amid an upsurge in Covid-19 infections, candidates’ differing approach to health measures at their political rallies has led to the emergence of a two-speed campaign.Marine Le Pen’s far-right Rassemblement National party said on Monday it would not apply a 2,000 person limit on indoor events, nor ask for proof of vaccination, measures required by President Emmanuel Macron’s government for many types of events.Political parties can choose which Covid health protocols to apply after the country’s constitutional court ruled in May that the government could not unduly limit religious, political or union activities by requiring people to show health passports.Mainstream parties such as Macron’s La République en Marche and Valérie Pécresse’s Les Republicains have pledged to put a limit on crowd numbers and apply other measures because they say it is a responsible approach to campaigning during a pandemic. In contrast, far-right and far-left candidates from Eric Zemmour to Jean-Luc Mélenchon eschew them in the name of liberty.“We won’t have the presidential election stolen from us, or the French people,” Sébastien Chenu, a member of parliament and spokesman for Rassemblement National, said on France Inter radio. “There are lots of problems in this country.during an election, we must be able to debate and inform the public.”But Le Pen’s campaign said it would delay its first big rally, originally scheduled for January 15-16 in Reims, because of the “health situation and epidemic peak predicted” around that time, and would hold it on February 5 instead.Mélenchon said he would hand out high-filtration N95 masks to people at a January 16 rally in Nantes. “We will take steps for people to be protected, but you cannot have a campaign without rallies,” he said.Meanwhile, Pécresse has said she would cap crowd sizes in a bid to be “exemplary”. As it has in other elections globally, the pandemic is expected to play a part in the dynamics of France’s election and voters’ perceptions of the candidates.Infections have been at record highs in the past week driven largely by the more transmissible Omicron coronavirus variant, which health officials estimate now accounts for about 60 per cent of new cases. About 160,000 new infections are detected daily based on a seven-day moving average, putting France at 234 cases per 100,000 people, similar to the UK and far higher than the US or EU, according to the Financial Times Covid tracker.Covid hospitalisations in France have risen 20 per cent in the past week. Last week, the government required people to work from home at least three days a week, limited crowd sizes at events and tightened mask wearing, but stopped short of closing businesses or imposing curfews like last year.French health minister Olivier Véran criticised some candidates for their decisions on rallies. “I wonder how they can claim that they will be responsible once in power if they are incapable of being responsible while they are seeking power,” he said.Macron is leading opinion polls, with about 24 per cent of voters saying they plan to choose him in the first round of France’s two-round election, according to Harris Interactive. Pécresse is polling around 17 per cent, followed by Le Pen with 16 per cent and Zemmour with 15 per cent.Dominique Reynié, an analyst at Fondapol think-tank, said the Covid surge made it harder for candidates to launch their campaigns and would create “volatility” in public opinion.“This will significantly delay voters in deciding their intentions. For the first time, none of the candidates, not even the president, can really control the agenda so it creates the conditions for surprises.”
334  “Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.” George Orwell was writing in the late 1940s — but that extract from 1984 is a perfect guide to how Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, the leaders of Russia and China, treat history.In the dying days of 2021, the Russian and Chinese governments both took dramatic action to censor discussion of their countries’ history. In both cases, the decision to “control the past” sends a bleak signal about the future.Russia’s Supreme Court closed Memorial, an organisation founded in the last years of the Soviet Union to record and preserve the memory of the victims of Stalinism. In Hong Kong, local universities bowed to China’s central government — removing from campuses statues commemorating the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989. In the decades after decolonisation in 1997, Hong Kong was a bastion of free speech within the People’s Republic of China. But that era has now definitively come to a close.The closing of Memorial feels like a turning point for the whole of Russia. For all the brutality of the Putin regime, Russia, until recently, has allowed considerably more latitude for political dissent than China. Putin’s opponents demonstrated in numbers on the streets in 2012, 2019 and in 2021. That kind of open criticism of Xi has long felt inconceivable in mainland China.Each country’s treatment of history has also been different. A portrait of Mao Zedong, leader of China’s Communist revolution, overlooks Tiananmen Square and his statues stand on campuses in Beijing and Shanghai. But to see a statue of Joseph Stalin in Moscow I had to visit the Fallen Monument park, where I found a severed stone head of the former Soviet dictator.As recently as 2017, Putin himself unveiled a monument to the victims of Stalinism in Moscow and laid flowers at its base. At the time, the chief operating officer of Memorial welcomed that gesture. But now, the prosecutor in the case that has outlawed Memorial complains that the organisation “makes us repent of the Soviet past, instead of remembering its glorious history”.Observers in Russia see the closure of Memorial as a deliberate move towards Chinese levels of censorship and control. Alexander Baunov of the Carnegie Moscow Center told the New York Times: “this is a real shift towards a Chinese approach to history” — in which “mistakes” by Mao or Stalin are acknowledged, but treated as minor blemishes on an otherwise glorious record. Grigory Yavlinsky, the veteran opposition politician, argues that it marks the tipping point between an authoritarian and totalitarian state.President Xi will certainly approve of Putin’s decision to crack down on criticism of Stalinism. The Chinese leader has long been preoccupied by the collapse of the Soviet Union and determined to prevent anything similar happening in China. In a speech to the Chinese Communist party’s central committee made just after he took power, Xi asked — “Why did the Soviet Union collapse?” His answer was that: “the history of the USSR and of [the Soviet Communist party] had been completely denied.Lenin had been rejected, as was Stalin.Ideological confusion was everywhere.The Soviet Union, which had been a great socialist country, collapsed.”Controlling discussion of the past remains central to Xi’s style of governance. Last year, his government passed a law to make it a crime to mock the country’s national heroes.In both Russia and China, moves to shut down historical debate go hand in hand with an intensification of present-day repression. In the same week that Memorial was shut, the Russian government arrested several supporters of the jailed opposition leader, Alexei Navalny. In Hong Kong, days after the Tiananmen statues were removed, the government shut down Stand News, the largest remaining pro-democracy media outlet, and arrested several senior staff.The suppression of history is linked to aggression overseas. A sign of the impending crackdown on Memorial came last October, when the organisation was raided during a screening of a film on the 1930s famine in Soviet Ukraine. That kind of historical memory is unacceptable at a time when the Russian government is making overt preparations to invade Ukraine.In a similar vein, Beijing last year moved to clamp down on suggestions that China’s involvement in the Korean war in the 1950s was anything other than a defence against a possible American invasion. That debate also has contemporary significance, at a time when the threat of a war between the US and China is once again rising.To complete the circle of repression, domestic critics of the Putin and Xi governments are routinely accused of working for hostile foreign powers — just as opponents of Stalin and Mao were. The argument that foreign powers are in league with the regime’s domestic critics, is then used to justify repression on patriotic grounds and to support the case for “strong” leadership.Both Putin and Xi have engineered changes in their countries’ constitutions that will allow them to rule unchallenged, long into the future. If Putin stays in the Kremlin until 2036, which now seems distinctly possible, he will have ruled for longer than Stalin himself. If you intend to emulate Stalin, why would you allow criticism of him?
335  Turkish inflation has reached its highest level since Recep Tayyip Erdogan came to power almost two decades ago as the president’s contentious economic management sparks a surge in prices.The country’s consumer price index rose 36 per cent year on year in December, according to data released by Turkey’s statistical agency on Monday.It marks the highest level of consumer price rises since September 2002, when Turkey was reeling from a financial crisis that paved the way for a landslide election victory for Erdogan’s Justice and Development party (AKP) in November that same year.The figure, a sharp increase from the previous month’s official inflation rate of 21 per cent, comes after Erdogan ordered the central bank to repeatedly slash interest rates in recent months despite double-digit inflation.His insistence that the bank lower its benchmark lending rate by a total of 5 percentage points since September, to 14 per cent, has led to deeply negative real interest rates, causing investors to flee from the Turkish lira and stoking inflation in a country that is highly reliant on imported energy and goods.That in turn has prompted mounting public discontent about the soaring cost of living, and led to an erosion of support for the AKP in opinion polls.December’s inflation rate, which was higher than the consensus estimate among analysts of 30 per cent, was driven by hefty increases in the cost of transport, which rose almost 54 per cent year on year, and food and drink, which rose close to 44 per cent.In a sign of the pain being inflicting on business by the plunge in the lira, which lost about 45 per cent of its value against the dollar in 2021, the producer price index rose significantly faster at a rate of 80 per cent year on year.Ibrahim Aksoy, an analyst at HSBC in Istanbul, warned that inflation was likely to rise further in the months ahead, predicting it would reach about 42 per cent in April and May.The figures were met with dismay by the country’s opposition parties. Durmus Yilmaz, a former central bank governor who now serves as a senior official in the IYI party, said inflation was “the root cause” of the country’s economic problems and called for “an urgent stabilisation programme”.Ali Babacan, a former Erdogan ally who leads the opposition Deva party, suggested the true inflation rate was even higher than the official figures, describing the country’s statistical agency as “the institute for fiddling the numbers”. He said the rate “doesn’t even come close to” the huge energy price rises announced at the start of this year, which led to electricity prices being increased by as much as 125 per cent for the most intensive commercial users and by about 50 per cent for households.Erdogan, a longstanding opponent of high interest rates, rejects the conventional economic wisdom that raising the cost of borrowing helps to curb high inflation.He has continued to insist, despite mounting dismay from Turkey’s business community, that lower rates will ultimately help bring price stability as part of what he says is a new economic model that aims to boost exports, investment and job creation.Erdogan has acknowledged the pain inflicted by inflation on the public, vowing last month that his government will not allow workers to be “crushed” by price rises as he announced a 50 per cent increase in the minimum wage in lira terms.Economists warned that, while a pay uplift for the lowest-paid workers was necessary to protect them from rising living costs, such a large increase would itself be inflationary and price rises risked running out of control.
336  This article is part of a guide to Frankfurt from I have been back to Frankfurt many times in the more than 15 years since I finished my posting as a foreign correspondent there. Recent jobs covering banking and finance, before the pandemic, meant frequent return trips — short flights, taxis to the city centre, meetings at Deutsche Bank’s twin towers or the European Central Bank headquarters — often without the need for an overnight stay.This is the Frankfurt that millions of business travellers experience. Germany’s financial centre is a handy hop from London and other European hubs. But aside from some swanky offices, half-decent restaurants and the nicely prettified Main river, there is little of obvious merit.This seems to be a city of often characterless downtown high-rises and a red-light district, near the main rail terminus, right out of the 1980s. At the airport, slow security and boarding can leave a bitter aftertaste. Even the historic Römer part of the old town — mostly rebuilt since the second world war in a mix of replica architecture and modern pastiche — divides opinion.But whistle-stop trips don’t have to be charmless. After living here, I know that at its best, Frankfurt, like many German cities, is engaging and convivial, as well as convenient and ordered. On a visit just before the pandemic, I took a break from my schedule of banker meetings to relish the city and reminisce. With an occasional nod to the passage of more than a decade, I found things remarkably unchanged.Though you’re unlikely to stumble on any of the gems in the Nordend district, where I lived, without being tipped off, plenty of them can be enjoyed even on a short business trip. This is part of the real Frankfurt, much of it more vibrant and authentic than the financial district.Just north of the banking skyscrapers is an understated community in which my wife, baby and I quickly felt at home when we arrived back in 2003. It was helpful that we were German speakers, but our network of friends — nearly all of whom lived within a few streets of our flat — were a mix of born-and-bred locals, Germans from elsewhere in the country and other expats from Europe, the US and even Sri Lanka.Nordend (literally, north end) spans a wide area, including the spot around Holzhausenpark where we lived, but also stretching east towards the more obviously lively Bornheim district, with its partially pedestrianised eating and shopping artery, Bergerstrasse, and its own large park, the Günthersburgpark — both highly recommended. (The tips below are focused on the Holzhausen area, which is a 15-20 minute walk from the north edge of the financial district or five to 10 minutes by underground or tram.)Though we travelled extensively across Germany during our nearly four years in Frankfurt, we also spent days, sometimes weeks at a time, hunkered down in our local community. We would buy staples at the small supermarket down the road, stock up on fruit and veg at the Turkish-owned stall round the corner, grab pastries and Saturday-morning rolls at the bakery 20 yards further on, and purchase the rest of our supplies at the endearingly dated health-food shop opposite.At weekends, we might visit the local theatre 50 yards down our street, or the arts cinema two roads down. Weekend breakfasts in the local café — with platters of fruit and cheese, and baskets of every bread imaginable — were a joy. A five-minute walk to the tree-filled Holzhausenpark delivered a toddler’s dream of playground fun, as well as outdoor table tennis (long before it became fashionable in London).So close to the city centre but a world away, the park is a great spot to take a break from the business hurly-burly. Many of the cafés and restaurants in the area make ideal alternative venues for breakfast, lunch or dinner business meetings, but with a good deal more character (and discretion) than most city centre hotels.On this last visit, I met up with Domenic, the FT photographer, outside my old apartment block. I could almost taste the memories, including the unpleasant one of my initial arrival in Glauburgstrasse, where my efforts to park my right-hand drive car against the flow of traffic — fine in the UK, but an offence here, apparently — earned me a dry welcome from the local police: “In Germany we drive on the right.”This part of Frankfurt, unlike some of the smart but soulless centre, wasn’t flattened by bombs in the second world war. Though the early 20th-century building that was our home for more than three years isn’t exactly charming, the environs are.I led us round the corner and noticed with a pang of regret that our old Turkish-run fruit stall has become an off-licence, our bakery is now a fancy café and the U-Bahn (underground railway) station — which is overground at this point — has a proper platform in place of the old scary streetside access.Our favourite Italian restaurant is still there, but under new management. Papanova, run by Calabrian-born Pasquale Terranova, is now a cosy modern bistro with top-notch food. The menu — from wood-fired pizza (the house speciality) to pasta, steak and fish — is uncomplicated, but this is as much a spot for dining solo or with friends as it is for relaxed business meetings.Sadly, the basement bowling alley, where we used to go for a bit of postprandial sport, is no longer in service. “The fire regulations would make it too expensive to upgrade,” Terranova told me, though he was happy to show me the makeshift drystore that the two-lane alley has become. “Maybe one day,” he added, sensing perhaps that the addition of bowling might win me back as a regular.Domenic and I continued our walkabout, heading south on Eckenheimer Landstrasse, to another old favourite: the ice-cream parlour, Eis Christina. If you’re visiting Frankfurt between early spring and late autumn, don’t miss it. The creamy sourness of the Himbeer-Joghurt (raspberry yoghurt) ice cream is a personal favourite.Next door to the ice-cream parlour I spotted a forgotten favourite wine-drinking spot: the Weinstube im Nordend. Its stylish but snug interior, full of unchanged dark wood and velvet, always chimed with the range of European reds and fine German Rieslings — many at a bargain €2.40-€5 a glass — along with tasty snacks and evening meals. It is only open in the evenings, so I made a mental note to return.We carried on west to the idyllic Holzhausenpark (Adolph-von-Holzhausen-Park, to give it its full name). At least half of my free time was spent here during our years in Frankfurt: from 7am playground trips at the weekends to coffee-and-cake outings with friends and table-tennis games with colleagues. This little park had it all.My retired music teacher father was even treated to a concert or two here in the idyllic lakeside Schlösschen, an 18th-century manor house (enter from Justinianstrasse). The programme (mostly afternoons and some evenings) is still a reassuring mix of string quartets, choral work and jazz, with some school concerts thrown in. If it’s a relaxing morning you’re after, quaffing coffee and reading the paper, try the outdoor café on the other side of the park.With time running short, we looped back towards our starting point. We passed the Stalburg theatre, a local arts spot with bar attached where we went with friends on at least two occasions to see the play Wer kocht, schiesst nicht (People Who Cook Don’t Shoot). Written by the theatre’s founder, Michael Herl, it’s a satire on life, death and sustainability, via the allegory of fast food. Poignantly, it was showing again that day — and is still running. German speakers with an appetite for real Frankfurt culture, perhaps with an Apfelwein (apple wine) from the theatre bar, shouldn’t miss it.Our final stop was my local bank. It’s still there, on the corner of Glauburgstrasse and Oeder Weg, though the fascia is now yellow rather than green, following Dresdner Bank’s 2009 takeover by Commerzbank. From his perch, Domenic snapped me in front of the building, then turned 90 degrees to photograph the famous Frankfurt skyline — with its dominant Commerzbank tower, once Europe’s tallest.Today, the struggles of the country’s barely profitable banks clash grotesquely with their hubristic skyscrapers. The city had pinned its hopes on Brexit leading to the transfer of thousands of jobs from London to bring fresh energy to the lacklustre financial scene. That flood has been more of a dribble, but at least a few more lucky expats, as well as short-stay visitors, will get to enjoy this under-appreciated city.
337  Economists expect the European Central Bank to continue its net asset purchases for two more years — well after other major central banks begin to scale theirs back — according to a Financial Times survey.Three-quarters of the 32 economists polled by the FT said they expected the ECB to stop expanding its €4.6tn bond portfolio in 2023; only just over a quarter said they thought it would do so before that.Many central banks around the world have already started to reduce their monetary stimulus in response to sharp rises in inflation as the global economy bounces back from the shock of the coronavirus pandemic.The ECB has been slower than most; in December its president Christine Lagarde said its €1.85tn pandemic-response scheme would stop net bond purchases in March, while an older asset purchase scheme would undergo a “step-by-step” reduction until at least October. However she has not specified when net asset purchases would stop altogether.In contrast, the US Federal Reserve said last month it would accelerate the tapering of its bond purchases to finish at the end of March, while the Bank of England said after it raised interest rates last month that its net purchases would stop at the end of the year.William De Vijlder, chief economist at French bank BNP Paribas, was among those predicting the ECB would continue its net bond purchases until 2023. He said the biggest risk for the eurozone economy was that “supply disruption continues, causing inflation to remain elevated, leading to a complete reassessment of the outlook for ECB policy”.Inflation in the eurozone soared to 4.9 per cent in November, a record high since the single currency was launched more than two decades ago, driven by soaring energy prices, resurgent demand and supply chain bottlenecks.Last year the ECB agreed a new strategy, committing not to raise its deposit rate from the current low of minus 0.5 per cent until it was convinced inflation would reach its 2 per cent target within the next two years and stay there for a further year. It also requires underlying inflation, excluding energy and food prices, to be “sufficiently advanced” to achieve its target. It said asset purchases would stop shortly before it raised rates.More than half of the economists polled by the FT said they expected the ECB to start raising its deposit rate by 2023. More than a quarter thought it would not do so before 2024.Lena Komileva, chief economist at G+ Economics, predicted the ECB would halt its bond-buying this year and raise rates by late 2023. Like several others, she warned of the risk of tightening monetary policy too soon — something the ECB was criticised for doing in 2011 when it raised rates twice on the cusp of the eurozone sovereign debt crisis.“While the effects of each new pandemic wave on growth are fading and inflation likely peaked in late 2021, a policy rush towards withdrawing fiscal and monetary support for private sector capital — industry, bank and entrepreneurial — in an ongoing pandemic is by far the biggest risk to the outlook,” she said.Almost four-fifths of economists predicted the ECB would tighten policy in the summer by making the rate less attractive on the subsidised loans it is providing to banks, known as targeted longer-term refinancing operations. These €2.2tn of loans at rates as low as minus 1 per cent give banks an easy source of profit by effectively paying them to borrow money.The economists were evenly split on whether the EU’s new €800bn recovery fund greatly reduces the chances of a eurozone bond market sell-off. The fund provides grants and loans from Brussels to member states to support their economic recovery in exchange for structural reforms.“Periphery spread levels are tight, and volatility might rise as the ECB reduces its purchases,” said Alberto Gallo, portfolio manager at Algebris Investments, referring to the spread between the borrowing cost of weaker countries on Europe’s periphery such as Italy and those of stronger ones such as Germany.“In particular, we might see volatility around French elections and potentially around Italian elections,” he warned.
338  Many people in Northern Ireland will tell you that these days, they no longer automatically ask themselves whether anyone they meet is Catholic or Protestant. A quarter-century of peace has effaced many of the bitter sectarian divides of the three decades-long Troubles.But to understand how important identity remains, just watch Northern Ireland’s football team before an international. Some players belt out “God Save the Queen” with gusto. Others listen in silence to an anthem they do not consider represents them.Football was partitioned along with the island of Ireland in 1921. But a long-simmering debate over whether a new anthem is needed is just one way the UK region is struggling to deal with the emblems of its twin identities.In December, four years after its initial deadline, an official commission published a report on emblems and other cultural expressions of identity.“In the conflictual politics in our society,” it noted, wryly, “we seem to spend an inordinate amount of time discussing flags, symbols, bonfires, statues, murals, banners and memorials”.Take flags. The commission considered whether public buildings should either fly only the union jack, since Northern Ireland is part of the UK, or the Irish flag as well to honour both Irishness and Britishness together — a compromise would be to fly the union jack only on certain days or have a no-flags-at-all policy.As for other, similar issues — the reason the £800,000, 168-page report is likely to gather dust on a shelf — the commission concluded that “there is currently no meeting point”.Ironically, Ireland’s tricolour is supposed to represent both communities — the green of the Catholics, orange for Protestants, and white symbolising peace.But even colour-coding can be complicated. The Northern Ireland football team plays at the Windsor Park stadium, in a traditionally unionist area, wearing a strip in the colour — green — traditionally associated with the Irish Republic. At the start of my Ireland posting last summer, I must subconsciously have been hedging my bets when, without calculating, I took along an orange jacket and a green dress to a conference.Sinn Féin, the republican party, which is now the most popular in Ireland both north and south, wants a vote on reunification in five to 10 years. Polls in Northern Ireland suggest the popular mood is less sure — its population can already decide to identify as British, or Irish, or both. But Brexit may be shaping opinions.In order to avoid having a hard border on the island, the post-Brexit trade rules known as the Northern Ireland protocol drew a customs line down the Irish Sea, leaving Northern Ireland within the EU’s customs union.A Lucid Talk poll in Northern Ireland in November found 36 per cent of respondents would ditch the protocol, reunite with the Republic of Ireland and return to full EU membership, versus 30 per cent who wanted to stay British even if that meant a land border with the Republic.On the other hand, a survey in December by conservative peer and pollster Lord Ashcroft found 54 per cent favoured staying part of the UK against 46 per cent who opposed, once undecided votes were removed. But it also found that 67 per cent thought Brexit had made Irish reunification more likely.In the Republic, nearly three-quarters of people embrace the idea of a reunited Ireland — as long as it doesn’t happen now and they don’t have to pay more taxes or change their flag and anthem, according to an Ipsos MRBI poll for the Irish Times. Even among Sinn Féin voters, only just over a third of respondents saw Irish unification as a priority.Addressing an Irish government forum on its “shared island” programme, Northern Irish comedian Patrick Kielty summed it up: “The vast majority of people in the north no longer look at things through a binary prism. They’re getting on with their lives — and each other,” he said. “Is it a love-in? No. Is it united? Definitely not. But you know too often on this island we get fixated with the notion of being united — remaining part of the UK, becoming part of a united Ireland.This island is never going to be united, and that’s OK.”
339  Belarus’s exports to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are at or close to record levels, cementing their trading relationships even as the three Baltic states take an aggressive stance on sanctions against the regime of leader Alexander Lukashenko.In the first 10 months of last year, Estonia’s imports from Belarus were more than double 2020’s total at €522m and more than a fifth higher than the previous peak in 2018. Lithuania’s imports have increased 50 per cent compared with 2020, hitting €1bn — a third higher than the previous 2015 high. Latvia’s are up two-thirds from 2020 to €407m, just 2 per cent below their 2011 peak.The sharp increases lay bare the tensions that the Baltic states face between economic opportunities and their geopolitical rhetoric, according to experts.“The Baltic states are in the process of discovering that translating strong and principled foreign policy positions into an effective sanction regime is not such a simple matter, even in the most clear-cut cases,” said Tomas Jermalavicius, head of studies at Estonia’s International Centre for Defence and Security. “There are domestic economic players — even state-owned corporate entities — that will use every possibility to find ways around them for as long as feasible.”The Baltic states have become the loudest voices in Nato for an assertive policy against both Belarus and Russia, as Minsk has in recent months used illegal immigrants to try to put pressure on neighbouring Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.But economic considerations are causing domestic political tensions. For example, Lithuania’s government almost collapsed last month after it emerged that it had continued to trade with Belarus in the face of US sanctions. Lithuania’s foreign and transport ministers submitted their resignations — which were rejected — after revelations that the country’s state-owned railway was still transporting Belarusian potash.Jermalavicius said that logistics and transport operators in all three Baltic countries would “always seize opportunities for extra earnings.if there is no pressure from the governments” as many had close relationships with Belarusian state-owned businesses.But Vidmantas Janulevicius, president of the Lithuanian Confederation of Industrialists, said that although the Baltic countries needed to obey sanctions, it would be “stupid” to block all imports, especially as the region was connected to China and central Asia through Belarus.“The most important thing is to stop the regime of Lukashenko, not the people of Belarus. If we [Lithuania] will not do this transit of goods, it will just move to another country,” he said.One problem is that US and EU sanctions on Belarus do not always overlap, and the American bans lack bite in the Baltics because of a lack of direct economic links to the US, despite it being their most important geopolitical ally.Jermalavicius said the situation raised “a legitimate question” about whether the Baltic states were ready to “accept the economic opportunity costs associated with their official political posture and regional security imperatives”.Estonia’s foreign ministry said the imports from Belarus were “goods in transit” and were carefully checked against sanctions lists. Lithuania’s foreign ministry noted that there was no legal basis in the EU to implement sanctions imposed by a third country. And Latvia’s foreign ministry said: “Any ongoing trade [with Belarus] is currently taking place in compliance with the sanction regimes imposed.”Imports from Belarus to the three Baltic states include wood products, fertiliser and oil.Jermalavicius said it was “a bitter lesson” for the Baltic states as the “margin of error in the current geopolitical circumstances is very narrow”.He added: “They should not waste their precious political capital and credibility accrued in Washington for the sake of a few hundred million euros that their businesses could earn each year by further dealing with Belarus.”
340  The US and its allies will “respond decisively” if Russia invades Ukraine, President Joe Biden told his counterpart in Kyiv as tensions mounted over Moscow’s troop deployments.The call on Sunday between Biden and Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky was the latest diplomatic attempt to allay mounting tensions after Russia amassed about 100,000 soldiers on Ukraine’s eastern frontier. Washington, Moscow and Nato member states are set to meet for talks in early January, when Russia intends to press for “security guarantees” to limit the military alliance’s expansion in Europe.Biden “reaffirmed” America’s commitment to Ukraine’s “sovereignty and territorial integrity”, according to a statement by Jen Psaki, White House press secretary.After the exchange, Zelensky wrote on Twitter that the leaders had discussed “joint actions” by Ukraine, the US and partners “in keeping peace in Europe, preventing further escalation, reforms, de-oligarchisation”.Biden’s message to Zelensky echoed a telephone conversation last week with Russia’s president Vladimir Putin, in which the US president said Washington and its allies were prepared to respond “decisively” should Moscow invade Ukraine.A day after the call with Putin, which was arranged last Thursday at Moscow’s request, Biden said: “I’m not going to negotiate here in public, but we made it clear that he [Putin] cannot — I emphasise cannot — move on Ukraine.”Although the Russian leader has previously denied any plan to invade Ukraine, he said last month he was prepared to use “appropriate military-technical measures” and “react harshly to hostile steps” should Kyiv and its western backers ignore Moscow’s “red lines”.Russian forces in March 2014 forcibly seized Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula after a pro-democratic movement ousted pro-Moscow president Viktor Yanukovich. An armed uprising erupted a month later in Ukraine’s two easternmost regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, with Russian-led forces taking over parts of the area.More than 13,000 people have been killed in the conflict and approximately 1.5m people have been displaced — the largest European displacement crisis since the Balkan wars, according to the International Organization for Migration.Approximately 7 per cent of Ukraine’s territory has remained under the control of Russia or its proxies since 2014.Moscow has denied being involved in the Ukrainian conflict, which has continued for eight years and escalated in recent months. Civilians have joined training camps to prepare to back up the Ukrainian military in the event of war.A senior US administration official said the tone of the conversation between Biden and Putin was “serious and substantive”, with both leaders acknowledging the possibility of “meaningful progress” in some areas but also others where “agreement may be impossible”.Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov said the Kremlin was “satisfied” with the conversation with Biden, calling it “frank, substantive [and] specific”, according to Interfax.Russia’s threat of military force has revitalised the debate in Finland about whether the Nordic country should join Nato, a move that would challenge demands from Russia to limit the growth of the military alliance in Europe.In their new year addresses, Finland’s president Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister Sanna Marin highlighted that the country retained the option of seeking Nato membership at any time.The telephone calls also come amid controversy over Russia’s role in Europe’s soaring gas prices. Some European officials have accused Russian gas giant Gazprom of withholding additional volumes as it aims to launch the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Europe, whose approval by German regulators is on hold.Gazprom insisted it was meeting all its contractual obligations to supply gas to Europe and said the record prices had killed demand for spot sales.
341  Russia’s sabre-rattling in Ukraine has reignited a debate in Finland about whether the Nordic country should join Nato, defying Moscow’s demands that the military alliance limit its expansion in Europe.Both Finland’s president, Sauli Niinisto, and prime minister, Sanna Marin, used new year addresses to underscore that the country reserved the option of seeking Nato membership at any time.“Let it be stated once again: Finland’s room to manoeuvre and freedom of choice also include the possibility of military alignment and of applying for Nato membership, should we ourselves so decide,” Niinisto said.Marin added in her separate speech that every country had the right to decide its own security policy, stressing: “We have shown that we have learnt from the past. We will not let go of our room for manoeuvre.”Russia’s foreign ministry said last week that Finland and Sweden joining Nato “would have serious military and political consequences that would require an adequate response from the Russian side”.The US, Russia and Nato member states are set to meet for talks in early January as Moscow has amassed about 100,000 troops on Ukraine’s eastern frontier.President Joe Biden also spoke with Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday and vowed that the US and its allies would “respond decisively” in the event of a Russian invasion.Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, has previously refused to rule out military action and has warned he has “all kinds” of options if his demands for “security guarantees” to limit Nato expansion are unmet.Finland and neighbouring Sweden are both militarily non-aligned but have a growing co-operation with Nato as well as strong bilateral relationships with members of the alliance such as Norway, the US, and UK.There is no sense of Finland imminently applying for Nato membership, but Russia’s activity on its border with Ukraine and its list of demands before Christmas have fired up an internal debate in Helsinki to a level last seen after Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.Niinisto also warned the west that it risked empowering Russia if it removed the threat of possible military action. Citing former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger on appeasing Nazi Germany, the Finnish president said: “Whenever avoidance of war has been the primary objective of a group of powers, the international system has been at the mercy of its most ruthless member.”Petteri Orpo, leader of the main opposition National Coalition party, a longtime supporter of Nato membership, said that now was the time to discuss whether Finland should apply and that he believed joining would improve its security and that of the region.“Russia has recently suggested that the possible Nato membership of Finland and Sweden would force it to retaliate militarily. Such a speech is reprehensible and ultimately says more about Russia’s ultimate goals than Finland’s or Sweden’s. Finland does not pose a threat to Russia now or in any other way,” Orpo wrote on Thursday in a post on his party’s website.Atte Harjanne, an active reservist and head of the parliamentary group of the Green party, a member of the ruling five-party government coalition, said the arguments for Finland joining Nato had been “strengthened” and the country should do so immediately.Leading politicians in the three Baltic countries believe Finnish and Swedish membership in Nato is crucial to improving the security situation on Russia’s western border amid worries about Ukraine as well as about Belarus and its use of migrants to test Poland, Lithuania and Latvia.Finland and Sweden joining Nato “could make entire northern Europe much more stable and safer”, said Marko Mihkelson, head of Estonia’s parliamentary foreign affairs committee.Finland is one of the few European countries that did not significantly cut its military strength after the cold war, as its 1,340km border with Russia, and memories of the bitterly fought 1939-40 winter war against the Soviet Union ensured security matters retained a high priority.But Finland has also preserved close diplomatic and commercial ties with Russia, and security experts said Niinisto was perhaps the European leader most respected by Putin, with whom he has regular conversations.
342  Germany, Austria and Luxembourg have hit out at Brussels’ plans to classify nuclear power as a sustainable technology in the EU’s landmark labelling system for green investment, which is central to Europe’s plans to decarbonise the bloc’s economy.German economy minister Robert Habeck, who is a member of the Green party in the country’s governing coalition, said: “It is questionable whether this greenwashing will even find acceptance on the financial market.” He told German press agency DPA on Saturday: “In our view, there was no need for this addition to the taxonomy rules.”Brussels’ proposal is part of a so-called “taxonomy” list, which aims to help channel billions of euros of investment needed to decarbonise the bloc’s economy.The plan, the first attempt by a leading regulator to bring clarity to investors seeking to put private capital into sustainable economic activity, covers about 80 per cent of the bloc’s emissions and is intended to be a “gold standard” for markets to decide what is truly green or not.But the process has been beset by fierce political infighting inside the European Commission and its member states.Leonore Gewessler, Austria’s minister for climate and energy, said on Saturday that Vienna would consider suing the European Commission if the classification of nuclear power as green went ahead. Claude Turmes, Luxembourg’s energy minister, meanwhile called the inclusion of nuclear power a “provocation”. The inclusion of nuclear power is widely seen as a victory for the French government which has urged Brussels to ensure the new rules do not punish a technology that provides almost two-thirds of French electricity. Nuclear reactors do not generate CO2 emissions but produce highly toxic waste.The inclusion of natural gas also means a number of EU economies that rely on gas imports in southern and eastern Europe will back the initiative.The inclusion of gas is also supported by Germany’s finance minister, Christian Lindner, who is the leader of the Liberal party in the governing coalition. The draft proposal says gas can be considered sustainable under certain conditions, such as for new gas plants approved before the end of 2030 that emit less than 270g of CO2 per kilowatt hour and if replacing traditional fossil fuels such as coal.“Germany realistically needs modern gas-fired power plants as a transitional technology because we are giving up coal and nuclear power,” Lindner told the Süddeutsche Zeitung on Sunday. “I am grateful that arguments seem to have been taken up by the commission.”Three German nuclear plants went offline at the end of 2021, with the country’s remaining three facilities due to be decommissioned in a year as part of a commitment to phase out all nuclear energy following the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan.The Brussels draft text will form part of a consultation with EU countries and independent experts that will run until January 12. However, anti-nuclear EU governments do not have the power to veto the taxonomy, which diplomats say is likely to win majority support in the EU Council.Astrid Matthey, one of the independent experts who advises the commission on the rules, criticised the draft for “contradicting the very purpose of the taxonomy”.“The conditions under which both technologies are to be included are far from ensuring that we reach the Paris climate targets and do-no-significant-harm to the environment. There is still a long way to go for this draft to become aligned with the Green Deal and the EU’s environmental targets”, said Matthey.
343  Barbara Kaczor took the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic in her stride. But the 41-year-old from Czestochowa in southern Poland has found handling the recent rapid surge in prices more of a struggle.“When you go shopping you spend so much money you don’t know what you have spent it on. I understand that prices change, but what is happening now is just crazy,” she said, reeling off the increases in the cost of everything from butter and tomatoes to gas. “Believe it or not, last yearwith the start of Covidwas much easier.”Kaczor is among millions of Poles feeling the pinch. Annual inflation hit 7.8 per cent in November, the highest level for two decades, and the fourth highest in the EU. With energy tariffs due to rise more than 20 per cent and gas prices by more than 50 per cent this year, consumers expect more pain - and the topic has raced up the political agenda.Much of the developed world is grappling with a similar pattern. But for Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party (PiS), rampant inflation is a particularly tricky problem. The conservative-nationalist government has come under fire at home and abroad over democratic backsliding. But despite these fights, it has remained the most popular party thanks to a large extent to its success in improving the lot of less well-off Poles.“PiS has won over voters with a very simple promise: you will be better off; your wealth will go up. High inflation makes it much harder to deliver on that promise, and that is why it is so dangerous for this government,” said Marcin Duma, head of the IBRiS polling agency in Warsaw.“Inflation is especially painful for those people who have seen their wealth grow over the last five or six years. They have been able to go on holidays, to buy things they couldn’t before. And now suddenly, their bills are going up and they cannot spend on the things that they have got used to.”For Kaczor, who works for a company that carries out surveys and teaches languages on the side, the jump in prices has meant longer hours to make ends meet, and fewer holidays and trips to the cinema. “Sometimes you have to decide what is a priority,” she said. “Most of all, you have to pay the bills.”Businesses are also concerned. Marcin Nowacki, deputy head of the ZPP employers’ association, said that while not all companies were feeling its impact, inflation was “the biggest threat” for this year, adding: “If it remains and goes above 10 per cent, it will be very difficult, and we will all feel it, both Poles and businesses.”Poland’s opposition has attempted to seize on the topic, accusing PiS of fuelling the problem through reckless spending. Last month, it projected “PiS = high prices” on to the ruling party’s headquarters in Warsaw. Opposition lawmakers unfurled a banner with the same message during a session in parliament.PiS officials argue that — as in much of Europe — inflation has been driven by external factors such as energy prices and disruption caused by the pandemic.The government has announced a 10bn zlotys ($2.5bn) package of temporary tax cuts on energy and fuel, and plans to cut VAT on food. It has also lobbied for reform of the EU’s emissions trading system: prices for carbon permits more than doubled last year.However, analysts say external factors are only part of the story. High energy prices have been compounded by Poland’s ageing, coal-intensive energy system, which makes the country particularly exposed to soaring carbon permit prices. Moreover, fiscal and monetary policy have been loose, even as the economy has grown at close to 5 per cent in recent years and labour shortages have put upward pressure on wages. Polish inflation was among the EU’s highest even before last year’s surge.“We are. paying the price for the mistakes of governments past and the lack of investment in the green transition. Our energy system is outdated and high-emission and so we have to acquire more carbon emission permits than other countries,” said Hanna Cichy, an economist at Polityka Insight in Warsaw.“There are very difficult demographic pressures, and there is also a competence gap: not only are there not enough workers, but we don’t have the right skills to fill the gaps in the market.”High inflation figures were “something that needs attention but not major panic”, said Tadeusz Koscinski, Poland’s finance minister. “The most important thing for us as a government is to control the emotions and make sure that people don’t think that this is a permanent situation.”However, barring an intensification of the pandemic, economists doubt inflation will return to the 2.5 per cent targeted by Poland’s central bank soon. “Core inflation is above 4 per cent and strong, so you have to expect that inflation will remain above 7 per cent [this year],” Cichy said. “It is very unlikely that it will return to the central bank’s target in 2023.”
344  Brussels wants to recognise nuclear power and forms of natural gas as “green” activity as part of a landmark EU classification scheme to help financial markets decide what counts as sustainable investment.In long-awaited plans, the European Commission has paved the way for investment in new nuclear power plants for at least the next two decades and natural gas for at least a decade, under a green labelling system known as the “taxonomy for sustainable finance”. The labelling system, which will cover industries that generate about 80 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions in the EU, is the first attempt by a major global regulator to decide what counts as truly sustainable economic activity and help stamp out so-called greenwashing in the financial sector.A draft legal text, seen by the Financial Times, says the EU’s green label should be awarded to controversial energy sources including nuclear power and natural gas under certain circumstances.The decision was taken after a vocal group of pro-nuclear countries, led by France, and pro-gas governments in southern and eastern Europe, demanded the taxonomy should not punish energy sources that provide a bulk of their power generation.Nuclear power does not emit greenhouse gases but produces toxic waste that requires safe disposal and can pose radiation risks.Natural gas is mainly made up of methane, which has more potent global warming properties than carbon dioxide in the near term, that can leak during production and distribution. But its supporters argue it is needed in the shift to lower carbon emissions.Brussels was forced to delay a decision on how to classify the two energy sources earlier this year after disputes inside the college of commissioners over whether they should be awarded the green label.The battle to recognise nuclear power and natural gas as green has intensified in recent months as EU countries have faced record electricity prices during winter, driven by soaring demand for natural gas imports.The draft taxonomy text says nuclear power should be considered a sustainable economic activity as long as EU countries that host power stations can safely dispose of toxic waste and meet a criteria to cause “no significant harm” to the environment. The construction of new nuclear plants will be recognised as green for permits granted until 2045, says the text.Natural gas investment is also included in the green label as a “transitional” energy but must meet a more detailed set of conditions, including producing emissions less than 270g of CO2 per kilowatt hour — for new gas plants approved before the end of 2030 — and if it is replacing traditional fossil fuels such as coal generation.The EU imports around three quarters of its natural gas needs, most of which is supplied by Russia. The bloc’s energy crisis has sparked criticism from some member states that Moscow is artificially driving up gas prices and the EU should accelerate away from gas imports to renewable energy.The taxonomy text will need approval from a majority of EU member states and members of the European Parliament. EU diplomats said the text was likely to win widespread support from governments but the green classification for gas and nuclear was criticised by environmental groups.France’s EU commissioner Thierry Breton has said he was in favour of labelling both technologies as green as it would help the EU meet a goal of cutting CO2 emissions to net zero by 2050, compared to 1990 levels.“Gas is not the best to achieve our goal because you generate some CO2 but at least it’s better as a transition than coal,” Breton told reporters last month. “We need to have the right financing in the taxonomy, including nuclear energy.”
9  AFTER SIX days and eight ballots, Sergio Mattarella was re-elected president of Italy on January 29th. In one way, the choice of the electoral college of 1,009 national lawmakers and regional delegates was absurd, since the 80-year-old incumbent had repeatedly indicated that he did not want a second term. But viewed from another perspective, his reinstatement was inevitable and welcome: any other outcome would have destabilised the governing coalition and perhaps have precipitated an early election.The decision was almost forced on party leaders by their rank and file, who cast 387 votes for the popular Mr Mattarella in the penultimate ballot. In the end, it was backed by all the parties in the broad, multiparty government headed by Mario Draghi, a former head of the European Central Bank. That, in turn, averts the collapse of the coalition and a snap general election, in which, the polls suggest, the populist right would have triumphed.The re-election of Mr Mattarella also frees the talented Mr Draghi, who began the election as favourite, to remain prime minister. That is by far the more important role, especially at what is a supremely testing time for his country. Over the coming months the government must adhere rigidly to a timetable of reforms and investments dictated by the European Commission in order to receive its full €200bn ($223bn) share of the EU’s post-pandemic recovery funds. Whether it succeeds will do much to determine whether Italy finally pulls out of the stagnation that has blighted its economy for two decades. The fortunes of Italy’s economy, in turn, will help determine whether Europe as a whole makes a successful recovery from the pandemic or will be dragged down by its most sluggish big economy.There have been concerns that Mr Draghi’s failure to get himself elected might damage his standing and thus his effectiveness as prime minister. But Mr Draghi’s ambitions have not been dashed so much as delayed. If, as seems likely, Mr Mattarella steps down before the end of his seven-year term, Mr Draghi would still have a good chance of succeeding him. Moreover, although the election has indeed opened deep rifts both between and within the governing parties, that has actually reinforced the idea that Mr Draghi, as much as Mr Mattarella, is indispensable. The biggest casualty was the fragile unity of the Italian right, already split by the formation last year of Mr Draghi’s heterogenous government. While the Northern League and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party joined it, the far-right Brothers of Italy remained in opposition. Since 2013, when the populist and hard-to-classify Five Star Movement scooped a quarter of the vote in a general election—and even more so since 2018 when it took one-third—neither right nor left have commanded a majority in parliament. The same was true of the electoral college formed to elect the president. That did not stop Matteo Salvini, the leader of the League, which had the second-biggest representation in the electoral college, from trying to impose a candidate of the right despite being outnumbered. His choice, Elisabetta Casellati, the speaker of the Senate, was always doomed. But she—and therefore Mr Salvini—failed spectacularly. Taking advantage of the secret ballot, around 70 representatives of the right withheld their support for Ms Casellati. Many were reckoned to be members of her own party, Forza Italia, hoping perhaps for a president with less conservative views on issues such as abortion. Mr Salvini then made things worse by backing the reinstatement of Mr Mattarella without apparently consulting his main ally, Giorgia Meloni of Brothers of Italy. An irate Ms Meloni tweeted: “Salvini suggests everyone goes and begs Mattarella to [take up] another mandate. I don’t want to believe it.” If Mr Salvini was the outstanding loser, then the nearest to a winner was the leader of the centre-left Democratic Party, Enrico Letta. By refusing to talk to the right until it agreed to discuss compromise options, he ended up with an outcome he had always advocated. The same was less true of Giuseppe Conte, the leader of the Five Stars. He had argued for a woman president, though many of the Movement’s electors wanted (and voted for) Mr Mattarella. At no point did he appear to be in real command of his troops. Mr Mattarella appears resigned to his fate. After 759 of the 983 electors present voted to keep him in office, he pledged not “to evade the duties to which one is called and must naturally prevail over other considerations”. But if the outcome is a mixed blessing for him, it is a boon for Italy. A political crisis has been averted, at least for another year or so, and the centre has been strengthened at the expense of the extremes. 
10  EVERY FOUR years the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas is required to carry out a simulation of disaster scenarios. In the most recent such exercise last year the ENTSOG boffins considered 20 shades of disaster, and concluded that “European gas infrastructure provides sufficient flexibility for the EU Member States to…ensure security of gas supply.” Cheering words. But the gasmen did not examine the spectre now haunting Europe. What happens if Vladimir Putin invades Ukraine again, the West hits Russia with sanctions, and Mr Putin retaliates by shutting down all the pipelines carrying Russian gas to the West?Listen to this story.The conventional wisdom used to be that a complete shutdown of piped gas from Russia, which makes up roughly a third of the gas burned in Europe, was unthinkable. Thane Gustafson, author of “Klimat”, a thoughtful book on Russian energy, observes that even at the height of the cold war, the Soviet Union did not shut off gas exports. And during Russia’s fiercest dispute over gas with Ukraine, in 2009, only the gas flowing through that country was disrupted, and then only fleetingly.But a shutdown is no longer unthinkable. Mr Gustafson now says: “I don’t think it is unlikely at all that Putin would actually reach for the gas tap over Ukraine.” Unlike his Soviet predecessors, the Russian president can afford the cost of a brief energy shock. Jaime Concha of Energy Intelligence, an industry publisher, has crunched the numbers. Not counting any penalties and assuming the average daily price seen in the fourth quarter of 2021, he reckons a complete cut-off of piped gas to Europe would cost Gazprom between $203m and $228m a day in lost revenues. So if such an embargo lasted three months (Mr Putin’s leverage fades in spring, when gas demand drops to just 60% of that in January), lost sales would add up to about $20bn.A loss of that size would have been devastating for the rickety Soviet economy, which relied heavily on hard currency earned by selling gas to the West. But Russia today has some $600bn sitting in its central-bank reserves and could easily handle such a blow. And it could even come out ahead financially, in the short term at least. Mere sabre-rattling over Ukraine has already sent prices soaring for gas and oil (the latter accounts for most of Russia’s energy revenues, not gas). Without a war, JPMorgan Chase, a bank, forecasts that higher prices will lead to Gazprom making over $90bn in gross operating profit this year, up from $20bn in 2019.If Russia does wield the gas weapon, how much would it hurt the West? If the interruption were limited to gas passing through Ukraine, as in 2009, the rest of Europe would manage fine. For one thing, Gazprom has already slashed the flow of gas through Ukraine. Citigroup, a bank, reckons it is half the level seen last year and a quarter of that in 2019.What if Mr Putin cuts off all gas to Europe? Some immediate disruption would be inevitable. This would be felt most acutely in Slovakia, Austria and parts of Italy (see chart), reckons David Victor of the University of California, San Diego. Of the big European countries, Germany is the most vulnerable. Because of its climate-motivated push to retire coal-fired power stations and its rash decision, taken in the wake of Japan’s Fukushima disaster, to shut down its nuclear plants, it remains more reliant on natural gas than it need be. It is Europe’s largest consumer of gas, which accounts for roughly a quarter of its total energy consumption, with Russia supplying over half of its imports.The good news is that Europe’s energy system is more resilient than it was during the crisis of 2009. Andreas Goldthau of the University of Erfurt in Potsdam points to some useful changes. Pro-competition measures (like a ban on “destination clauses” that forbid the resale of gas) have weakened Gazprom’s grip. A dense web of gas interconnectors now links previously isolated countries (see map).Another source of cheer is liquefied natural gas (LNG). Heavy investments in regasification plants mean that Europe has plenty of idle capacity. Citigroup estimates that with historical utilisation rates for those plants running at 50% of capacity or less, the region can in theory handle enough to replace nearly two-thirds of Russian piped gas imports. So the limiting factor is not regasification capacity, but the available supply of LNG. Since it takes a long time to expand new production and export capacity, Europe’s best hope would be to get hold of existing LNG cargoes originally destined for elsewhere.One investor notes that when European prices shot up threefold between October and December last year “an armada of LNG” sailed to Europe as cargoes were diverted from Asia. This inflow offset a decline in Russian gas imports (see chart 2). Market rumours suggest that a new armada is coming. Chinese state-owned energy firms, envisaging quick profits from high European gas prices, are hoping to sell dozens of LNG shipments. Massimo Di Odoardo of Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy, adds that because the journey from America to Europe is shorter than the one to Asia, LNG tankers can complete more trips—squeezing an extra 10% or so in export capacity to Europe. All told, he thinks extra LNG could fill 15% of the shortfall that would result from a complete Russian cut-off.Another source of resilience is the amount of gas held in storage. Last year’s bitter winter, along with Gazprom’s reluctance to fill storage units it controls in Europe, left gas storage at levels below the five-year norm. Even so, Rystad, an energy research firm, calculates that a continuation of normal weather this winter would leave enough gas in storage by spring to make up for two months of lost Russian gas exports. Some analysts believe the excess might even cover four months of a cut-off, though a cold snap would reduce this buffer quickly.Europe also has a secret weapon. Mr Di Odoardo points to its massive but little-discussed stores of “cushion gas”. For technical and safety reasons, regulators insist that storage units like salt caverns and aquifers maintain a huge amount of gas that is not normally available to put on the market. The analysts at Wood Mackenzie reckon that up to a tenth of this cushion can be used without causing problems. If regulators gave permission, as they might in a war-induced crisis, that would amount to well over a month’s-worth of Russian imports.In sum, Europe will suffer if Russia cuts off the gas; but that price will be paid from the wallet rather than through physical suffering. That cost will be exacerbated, predicts Jonathan Elkind of Columbia University, because “Europe is not starting from calm, but from a market on edge.” The continent’s energy markets have only just been through an early-winter price shock, and the price outlook for all energy commodities is ugly. JPMorgan Chase predicts that, even without a Russian gas cut-off, Europe will spend some $1trn on energy this year, up from $500bn in 2019. If the region were forced to consume its gas stocks to survive a Russian cut-off, it would then have to spend even more during summer frantically rebuilding its reserves to avoid an energy crisis next winter.That is an unpleasant prospect. But a bigger price would be paid by Russia over the longer term. One source notes that Gazprom would face “massive” commercial fallout, ranging from penalties payable to customers to a halt in dollars flowing to Russia for contract payments. Gazprom would find it difficult to secure any long-term contracts in Europe after such a display of aggressive unreliability. And the Nord Stream 2 pipeline so cherished by Mr Putin would surely bite the dust. A shutdown might even persuade China, now cautiously importing more Russian gas, that its long-standing concerns about Russian reliability are well founded.Mr Victor argues that such a brazen use of the energy weapon would probably lead Europe to try much harder to cut its dependence on Russian exports of gas “less because they are insecure and more because the revenue…is what funds Russian bad behaviour.” As Mr Gustafson pithily puts it: “If Putin wanted to destroy Gazprom’s business in Europe, he couldn’t go about it in a better way.” Corrections (January 25th and 31st): The original version of this story said that Jaime Concha’s estimate for the amount that a cut-off of piped gas to Europe would cost Gazprom was based on the average daily price seen in 2021. In fact it was based on the fourth-quarter price alone. And the map shows Ukraine’s actual flows for 2021, not its potential flows as originally indicated.
11  ON THE FRINGES of greater Paris, where urban concrete meets farmed fields, lies the suburb of Saint-Brice-sous-Forêt. Gently curved streets of two-storey houses, each with a parking space and garage, cover what were once apple and pear orchards. The narrow high street has just one café, and a “Cheesy Pizza” takeaway joint; but there is a drive-in Burger King on the outskirts. This is what the mayor, Nicolas Leleux, calls “the border of two universes”: city and countryside. It captures the worries and hopes of middle France, and exemplifies a crucial electoral battleground for April’s presidential poll.Listen to this story.Shy of extremes, the suburb tilts to the centre-right. In 2017 Saint-Brice-sous-Forêt preferred the centre-right presidential candidate, François Fillon, in the first round, but backed the centrist Emmanuel Macron against the nationalist Marine Le Pen in the second. In 2020 it replaced a centre-right mayor with Mr Leleux, a former navy submariner who belongs to Mr Macron’s party. Locals, in other words, may be torn at the presidential poll this time between a vote for Mr Macron, assuming he runs for re-election, and his centre-right rival, Valérie Pécresse. A well-known figure locally, she is the president of the Ile-de-France region, which encompasses the city of Paris itself and Saint-Brice-sous-Forêt, 17 kilometres (11 miles) away.Less than three months before polling day, however, talk is all about covid-19. Nobody spontaneously raises national politics. Daily new infections are still high across France, and shifting national rules about testing have caused chaos in schools. The mayor has opened a municipal testing centre to try to ease the stress. Residents also worry about heating bills and petty crime. The brutalist tower blocks of Sarcelles, a rough banlieue north of Paris, are not far away, and there are nagging concerns about “imported crime”. Yet fear of immigration, which the two nationalist candidates—Ms Le Pen and Eric Zemmour—insist tops French concerns, seems largely absent.Not that everybody is happy with Mr Macron. On a roundabout on the edge of town, ringed by car parks serving a giant hypermarket, Agnès, Josée Laure and Evelyne are standing defiantly in the cold, their hoods up against the wintry drizzle. Next to them lies a yellow-painted concrete block, which reads “ Gilets jaunes St Brice: we won’t give up”. It is a vestige of the “yellow jackets” uprising, which emerged across the country in 2018 against a rise in the carbon tax on motor fuel. The protests have subsided elsewhere. But this group is still active. “We put up our banners every Saturday,” says Agnès, a 48-year-old health-care worker, “but we pack them up after, and don’t leave any mess behind.”Their current gripe is a new national rule, introduced on January 24th, which makes vaccination compulsory for access to restaurants, cafés, long-distance trains and other public places. Only one of the trio says she is vaccinated; the others consider it an “infringement of our liberties”, if not an attempt “to poison the population”. Above all, they are indignant at the way Mr Macron has favoured the rich and displayed “contempt” towards ordinary people. As a spur to getting people jabbed, he recently said he wanted to emmerder (piss off) the unvaccinated. As for Mrs Pécresse, “she’s just the carbon copy” of him.April’s election seems set to be determined on the right, as Mrs Pécresse, Ms Le Pen and Mr Zemmour battle for a place in the run-off against the president. Mr Macron consistently tops first-round voting intentions; the various candidates of the left are trailing far behind. If so, disillusioned left-leaning voters such as those on the Saint-Brice roundabout may well end up abstaining. Josée Laure is considering this. Evelyne says she will vote for Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a perennial hard-left candidate with a knack for the late surge.What comes into sharpest relief in Saint-Brice is the collision between the needs of daily life, notably the car, and the desire for a greener future. A place of quiet middle-of-the-road aspiration, it evokes what Mr Leleux calls the “French dream”. “People have left the city to come here, not to live in a tower block, but in a house with a little garden, with neighbours, and a place to barbecue.” Nearly 88% of households own at least one car. His task, he explains, is to reconcile that dream with the need to reduce car usage. Few can afford an electric vehicle. Mr Leleux is planning cycle lanes and building a bike shelter at the railway station, on a direct line to Paris. Yet on a cold day in January there are no cycles to be seen on the streets.The Ile-de-France region, says Othman Nasrou, one of Mrs Pécresse’s vice-presidents and in her campaign team, is “like a small France”: it includes many car-dependent suburbs, so she is familiar with these complexities. Mrs Pécresse has proposed subsidies for households to buy electric cars, and mocked those who deride car use from the comfort of their nearby Parisian metro station. Anne Hidalgo, mayor of Paris and the Socialists’ presidential candidate, is on just 3% in national polls.Fashionable Parisian talk of the ideal “15-minute city” is all very well, says Mr Leleux. The reality is that to buy a baguette in under 15 minutes without a car is not possible in much of suburbia. If anybody has learned this, it ought to be Mr Macron, who won a huge majority of the vote in big cities in 2017, but later faced months of gilets jaunes protests. For now, insists the mayor, locals credit the president nonetheless with having been a “good captain” in difficult times. In April, it is on the streets of middle France, not the parquet-floored salons of Paris or its tenements, that such a claim will be tested. 
12  PRESS A EUROCRAT hard enough about the EU’s many imperfections, and sooner or later you hear a familiar defence. Never mind about coddled French farmers or Polish populists tearing up the rules: the crucial thing about the European project is that it has delivered peace. (The emphasis on this word is emotional; a small tear may well up at this point). Replacing centuries of warfare with decades of late-night summits quibbling over fish quotas is the European project’s proudest achievement. Fair enough. But peace stops at the EU’s borders. Surrounding the club is a zone of turmoil, which Europe seems powerless to soothe.Listen to this story.The prospect of war in Ukraine currently dominates the headlines. But look in just about any direction and Europe’s neighbourhood is a mess. Belarus, Europe’s last dictatorship, recently flew in migrants from Iraq, dumped them at the Polish border fence, gave them boltcutters and ordered them to try to break into the EU in the hope of causing another refugee crisis. The Belarusian despot is now welcoming Russian soldiers, perhaps on their way to invade Ukraine.In Turkey, an eccentric autocrat presides over a crashing currency. In the western Balkans, pound-shop demagogues rant and loot. Across the Mediterranean, a mere people-smuggling dinghy ride from the EU, North Africa now mixes a drift away from democracy (Tunisia) with civil war (Libya). Only Norway, Switzerland and occasionally Britain look like functional places. To lose one neighbour to strife or demagoguery may be regarded as a misfortune. To lose nearly all of them looks like carelessness.To be fair, much of the disarray has been deliberately fomented by one exceptionally aggressive neighbour. Besides grabbing bits of Ukraine and threatening much worse, Vladimir Putin has sown discord across the whole region. He props up a despot in Belarus and may one day swallow the country into Russia. His troops and cash support a breakaway sliver of Moldova, making life hard for its pro- EU government. He has stirred up disarray in the Balkans, not least in Bosnia, where his support for separatist Serb forces has brought the country to the brink of anarchy.Europe once had a viable strategy to counter such meddling. Countries that wanted to escape from Russia’s coercive “sphere of influence” were welcomed into the EU. The prospect of attending those dull fish-themed European summits, not to mention trading with and receiving subsidies from some of the world’s richest economies, was more than enough to lure countries like Bulgaria and Poland into the club. Accession talks required them to adopt hard but mostly sensible economic and political reforms. Being in the antechamber of the EU was itself a stabilising force.Now the prospects for further EU enlargement are essentially zero. The last country to join was Croatia, in 2013. Britain was the big state keenest to bring in fresh blood, notes Rosa Balfour of Carnegie Europe, a think-tank in Brussels. Today’s members are more likely to rue having let in Hungary than to look for ways to include Albania. To places with no hope of EU membership, promises of Russian or Chinese investment may sound rather appealing, though they come with strings attached.The EU has other carrots, which it has long dangled at countries that had no real chance of joining the bloc; Turkey has officially been a candidate for accession since 1963, though more in theory than in practice. The prospect of visa-free travel may induce governments to clamp down on corruption, say. Europe sends money, and recently vaccines, as part of its “neighbourhood policy”, which extends to bits of the Middle East. But the task is low on its list of priorities. The commissioner in charge of such policies comes from Hungary, where the government is notoriously corrupt and hostile to foreigners.It could have been EUThe way Europe deals with its neighbourhood is an extension of how it was built. The EU has no standing armies to push its agenda. Even if it had, internal divisions would dilute Europe’s influence beyond its borders. The club still comes with 27 different flavours of foreign policy, in addition to one nominally designed at the European level. Some countries focus on the bloc’s southern flank, where foreign policy is an extension of domestic imperatives—namely the desire to stem irregular migration. Various grubby deals have been struck with countries including Libya and Turkey to cut down the number of boats attempting the crossing into Europe from their shores. In Libya’s case, Italy and France have backed rival warlords: hardly a recipe for fostering harmony.The lack of unity is even more apparent when it comes to matters of war and peace. Bits of eastern Europe see NATO, and specifically America, as the bedrock of their security. By contrast, France’s President Emmanuel Macron relentlessly pushes the idea that Europe must develop its own “strategic autonomy”. Russia has long depended on a series of all-weather friends within the EU, notably Greece, Hungary and often Germany and Italy, to play down its wrongdoing. Meanwhile swathes of the continent depend precariously on gas from Russia to keep warm. Domestic politics nearly always trumps foreign relations. Even with 100,000 Russian troops menacing Ukraine, Germany’s new coalition is still dithering over whether to toughen its stance towards Russia. France is in pre-election mode, as Italy may soon be.Perhaps it was inevitable that the EU would be surrounded by dysfunction. All the functional countries in the neighbourhood were qualified to join the club and, apart from Norway and Switzerland, they did so. Thus the club kept expanding until it hit a wall of prickles—the countries that were too turbulent or ill-run to be admitted. That was once a mild irritant. Now its neighbours’ instability looks like a risk to the solemnly invoked peace that underpins the whole European project. And that could prompt tears of a different kind. 
13  COVID-19 HAS been a mixed bag for Europe’s architectural treasures. During the pandemic’s first year, overnight stays by international tourists dropped by 68% across the continent. Fewer visitors means less wear and tear on monuments, but also less income to maintain them. Gargoyles are not falling off cathedrals yet. But while attention was distracted, authorities have carried out some dubious renovations.Listen to this story.Take the Acropolis. (Xerxes did.) During Greece’s second lockdown in October 2020, builders poured wide concrete pathways around its temples. Authorities say the paths improve accessibility. Critics say they are causing floods. One academic accused the site’s administration of using the lockdown as a “smokescreen”.At least the pathways are meant as an improvement. Elsewhere heritage sites have been levelled. In May 2020 Albania’s government bulldozed the National Theatre in Tirana to make way for commercial development. The theatre was a humble modernist brick building built in 1939, but theatregoers loved it. Protests had blocked the demolition for years. Also felled in 2020 was the y-Block in Oslo, a curvy concrete icon of 1960s minimalism, though its Picasso murals were removed first.The latter two monuments had been among the seven “most endangered” heritage sites listed annually by Europa Nostra, a cultural association. Its secretary-general, Sneska Quaedvlieg-Mihailovic, says 2020 was the only year in which sites on the list have been demolished. Whether or not city planners deliberately took advantage of the pandemic to let the wrecking balls swing, the distraction cannot have hurt.Europe’s biggest heritage-site restoration project is in Paris. Authorities want to repair Notre Dame cathedral, damaged by a catastrophic fire in 2019, before the city hosts the Olympics in 2024. The church’s age and fame make it less vulnerable to ill-considered upgrades: governments are less cavalier with 12th-century churches than with 1960s office blocks. Crowdfunding may help, too. Tens of thousands of people have donated to the restoration, and they want to know how their money is being spent. The modernisation plans have touched off controversies in the media. All the better; as Athens has learned the hard way, public discussion before plans go ahead is a good thing.Dig deeperAll our stories relating to the pandemic can be found on our coronavirus hub.

14  A CAMERA STOOD next to the table, live-streaming the proceedings. But if Vice-Admiral Kay-Achim Schönbach, the head of the German navy, did not know he was speaking on the record, it did not take long to find out. He told a think-tank in Delhi that Vladimir Putin wanted respect, and “probably also deserves” it. The West should recruit Russia as an ally against China, he added; something he, as a “radical Roman Catholic”, would welcome.Listen to this story.One viral video clip and a very public brouhaha later, Mr Schönbach was gone. The pace of his departure showed that Germany’s government will not tolerate such comments when an unprovoked Russian attack on Ukraine is looming. Yet to many foreign observers the admiral was merely voicing soft-on-Russia sentiments that are widespread among German decision-makers. Ukraine’s foreign minister has said Germany’s refusal to send his country weapons is “encouraging Vladimir Putin”. The wife of a former Ukrainian president proposed a boycott of German cars. Even NATO allies like Poland publicly bristled.There is much to grouch about. Germany’s refusal to arm Ukraine, or to allow allies to do so, betrays a misunderstanding of the concept of deterrence. It has been deaf to allies’ concerns over Nord Stream 2 (NS2), a completed but not-yet-approved gas pipeline from Russia to Germany that bypasses Ukraine, depriving it of leverage and income. The Social Democrats (SPD), who lead Germany’s government, are particularly guilty in this telling. Critics spy a party stuffed with Putinversteher (Putin sympathisers) basking in nostalgia for the days of cold-war Ostpolitik, when SPD-led governments opened up to the east.Yet there is little evidence that Germany has gone soft where it matters. The government has signed up to the European consensus that further Russian military aggression against Ukraine will carry “massive consequences'', in the words of an EU communiqué last month. There is broad transatlantic concord over potential sanctions, if disagreement on details. Germany has even hinted at a shift on NS2. Asked about the pipeline last week, Olaf Scholz, the chancellor, said “all this will have to be discussed” should Russia invade. His NS2-sceptical Green coalition partners have been clearer still. Few imagine the pipeline will begin operating if Russia does attack.A bigger problem is the chancellor himself. The three parties in Germany’s new “traffic-light” coalition are visibly split on Russia, and Mr Scholz, a taciturn type who tends to speak in abstractions, has allowed a degree of cacophony. He has made no attempt to prepare Germans for trials that may lie ahead should Russia escalate, from rocketing gas prices to a refugee influx. Nor has he responded to Germany’s chorus of critics. “This government has a terrible communications problem,” says Stefan Meister, a Russia-watcher at the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin.That extends to the international scene. A comparison with Angela Merkel, Mr Scholz’s predecessor, is telling. When Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 Mrs Merkel marshalled the EU’s 28 fractious members to impose sanctions. Together with France, Germany established the “Normandy format” with Russia and Ukraine, placing Europe at the negotiating table. Her chancellery co-ordinated closely with Barack Obama’s White House whenever Russian forces probed Ukrainian defences. Today Mr Scholz is one European leader among many, Normandy is moribund and the transatlantic relationship looks testy. “It’s not that Germany has impeded consensus decision-making in NATO,” says John Lough, author of “Germany’s Russia Problem”. “It’s just that it is not carrying as much water as many of us would like.”Mrs Merkel also enjoyed Mr Putin’s respect, even as she came to despise his lies. She discussed Ukraine and eastern European security with Russia’s president half a dozen times in her last months in office. In his seven weeks Mr Scholz has done so only once, despite the urgency. Mr Putin now prefers to talk to America over Europeans’ heads. By weakening Europe, an equivocal Germany plays plumb into the Kremlin’s hands, says Mr Meister. Mrs Merkel learned that Russian menaces were better faced down if Germany led Europe’s response. It is an idea in which her successor has so far shown little interest. 
15  Seldom has an election for the Italian presidency, a mostly ceremonial post, attracted as much interest as the one that begins on January 24th in Rome. An electoral college of 1,009 parliamentarians and regional delegates is charged with choosing the next head of state, and will hold daily ballots until the job is done.One reason for interest is the ever-controversial Silvio Berlusconi. The former prime minister has been among those most conspicuously keen to become president. But on January 22nd he gave up his ambition. Close associates had earlier admitted Mr Berlusconi was unable to rally the backing he needed, despite support from the parties of the right. A second reason for the interest is the possibility that the choice will now fall on Mario Draghi, the current prime minister. Mr Draghi has presided over nearly 12 months of unusual calm and unity in Italian politics (his coalition government includes all but one of the main parties). And rarely have Italy’s fellow EU members needed its politicians to stay united and calm as much as they do now. Italy stands to be the largest beneficiary of the EU’s pandemic recovery funds. More than €200bn ($227bn) of the €750bn total is on offer and the hope is that it can be spent in ways that boost Italy’s economic growth. For more than two decades, the country’s dismal performance has acted as a brake on the economic growth of the entire EU.Mr Draghi’s government has made a good start on implementing the reforms and investments needed to absorb the cash productively. But his barely disguised hankering to quit the prime minister’s residence, the Chigi Palace, for the grander Quirinale puts it at risk. If he is elected, it will be hard to find a successor able to hold together the current, ideologically heterogeneous coalition. If he is not, his standing will be diminished, so it may be almost as difficult for him to continue to bring off the same trick. Fears have been expressed that Mr Draghi’s elevation could prompt a snap election. Though not impossible, that looks unlikely. As a result of legislation passed in 2012, if the current parliament is dissolved before September 24th, its members will lose the pension rights they have accumulated since it was convened in 2018 and be compelled to kiss goodbye to around €50,000 apiece in contributions. So a more likely scenario is that a successor government to Mr Draghi’s would be formed, which will attempt to limp past the deadline before collapsing at some point not too far from the natural end of the parliamentary term, in March 2023. The danger here is that a post-Draghi government would get little done. Assuming a replacement can be found, he or she is unlikely to enjoy anything like the support Mr Draghi currently basks in, not least because the political parties that currently back him will want to start to position themselves for the next election, pulling apart in their different directions. Yet the work of reform has much further to go, and if it stalls so too may the flow of funds from Brussels. The covid recovery funds are being disbursed in tranches, with future tranches dependent on continued implementation of the agreed programme. Whether, in the meantime, Mr Draghi does in fact become head of state will depend on several variables. Italian presidential elections are notoriously unpredictable—rich in surreptitious deals and giddying reversals. The incumbent, Sergio Mattarella, was elected in 2015 with 665 votes on the fourth ballot after receiving just four in the previous one. And since voting is secret, party members often ignore their leaders’ instructions. Covid-19 has created another layer of uncertainty. The rules require a two-thirds majority to win in the first three rounds and a simple majority thereafter. That is calculated not as a share of votes cast, but as a share of the total number of electors. Any absences will thus make it harder for anyone to win. More than 30 members of the electoral college have tested positive for covid in recent days. On January 21st the government rushed out a measure to allow them to leave isolation to vote, probably at a specially created drive-in polling station near parliament. The biggest obstacle for Mr Draghi is the legacy of Mr Berlusconi’s bid. Mr Berlusconi cajoled his allies, Giorgia Meloni of the hard-right Brothers of Italy and Matteo Salvini of the populist Northern League, into publicly supporting him. Mr Berlusconi thus became the paladin of the right—and so Mr Draghi, by default, that of the left. That makes it harder for Mr Berlusconi’s allies to switch their allegiance to the prime minister now. Yet neither left nor right has a clear majority in an electoral college teeming with independents. Roberto D’Alimonte, who teaches political science at the Luiss university in Rome, gives the left a tiny edge, of 463 to 452, leaving fully 94 electors with no clear allegiance. The League’s votes are especially crucial—all the more so since some in the centre-left Democratic Party and many in the broadly progressive Five Star Movement have reservations about the prime minister becoming president. Yet Mr Salvini, like Mr Berlusconi, has publicly argued that Mr Draghi should stay in government. To support his elevation to the presidency now will require a u-turn the League’s leader may find hard to justify. Unless the incumbent, Sergio Matterella, were himself to do a u-turn and agree to stay on till the next election, it is hard to see how this vote can end well for Italy.
16  THESE ARE happy days for the Nordic left. For the first time since 2001, they are running all four big Nordic countries—all five, counting tiny Iceland. Four of the five leaders are women: Magdalena Andersson, a Social Democrat, became Sweden’s first female prime minister in November. The Nordic model envied by foreign left-wingers (though not always understood) is having a moment.Listen to this story.So one might have expected a satisfied mood among the members of Byggnads, a construction trade union, who met at a Folkets Hus (community centre) in Stockholm in December. Instead they were angry. The LO, Sweden’s trade-union confederation, had just struck a deal with the employers’ association and the government that would reform labour law to make it easier to fire workers. In exchange the state will pay more to retrain them.“This is only for the benefit of the company owners,” said Felix Gravel, who installs insulation. He fears the proposed law will let firms bully their employees. Byggnads opposes the reforms, and Mr Gravel is questioning his allegiance to the Social Democrats: “Do they stand up for me? I’m just a dirty worker.”Nordic Social Democrats are winning elections, but they lack their old clear vision of the future. After decades of liberalisation, welfare states are less generous and inequality has risen. Fears of immigration and crime have boosted populists, forcing centre-left parties to move right on those issues, especially immigration. Meanwhile, young woke urbanites are turning to more radical left-wing parties.Denmark’s Social Democrats have shifted most on immigration. In 2019 Mette Frederiksen became prime minister pledging asylum rules even stricter than the previous centre-right government’s. She is implementing “ghetto laws” to break up neighbourhoods where high rates of immigration and crime coincide. That sucks the air out of the populist Danish People’s Party: its vote halved at the election in 2019.Ms Frederiksen has also introduced popular leftist policies such as a plan to triple construction of social housing. But while her anti-immigrant turn has won over people who fret about foreigners, it has lost some urban progressives. In municipal elections in November the Social Democrats’ vote share in Copenhagen fell by ten points; the Red-Green Alliance gained ground. Pelle Dragsted, a former Red-Green MP, says young people consider the Social Democrats uncool.In Sweden Ms Andersson is copying some of Ms Frederiksen’s moves. Sweden took in huge numbers of refugees during the migrant crisis of 2015-16. Gang wars, often involving immigrants, have raised the gun-murder rate, though it is still low. After taking over from Stefan Lofven, the previous Social Democratic prime minister, Ms Andersson vowed to deport more immigrant criminals. It later turned out a company she hired had employed an illegal immigrant to clean her house.It may be too late to win back many working-class voters. The Sweden Democrats, who began as a neo-Nazi party but are now less extreme, hold 18% of the seats in parliament. The centre-right Moderates once shunned them, but now collaborate with them. Lisa Pelling of Arena Idé, a progressive think-tank in Stockholm, co-wrote a book about neighbourhoods where the Sweden Democrats do well. It is tough reading for leftists. “Voters may suffer from service cuts or bad schools, but they see their problems entirely through the lens of crime and immigration,” she says.In their heyday, Nordic Social Democrats used to win 40% or more of the vote. Now they are lucky to get 30%. That forces them into fragile coalitions: when Ms Andersson negotiated on pensions with the socialist Left party, the Centre Party retaliated by voting down her budget. Its leader, Annie Loof, said Ms Andersson was betraying the “broad centre”. Ms Andersson was forced to resign after seven hours in office. She returned a few days later heading a minority government, but the opposition passed its own budget in the confusion. She is now stuck with it.Voters who move right over immigration often become more economically conservative, too. In Finland the populist Finns Party, which once backed more progressive taxes, has turned laissez-faire. Leftists worry that Sanna Marin, Finland’s popular young Social Democratic prime minister, appeals mostly to hip elites. It did not help when in December she missed a phone alert that a colleague had covid-19; she was out nightclubbing with celebrities.The left’s new vision revolves partly around climate change. Curiously, green parties do poorly in Nordic countries; other leftists take their votes. When Labour won Norway’s election in September, the country’s Greens won just three of the 169 seats in parliament. Yet social democrats’ climate policies are not always ambitious. In their coalition agreement, Labour and Norway’s Centre Party said they would let companies explore for more oil and gas in the country’s vast offshore fields.Inequality may be a more promising issue. Nordic post-tax incomes are relatively equal for rich countries, but have grown less so since the 1990s. There are sharp rural-urban disparities in health care. In Sweden the Left party’s new leader, Nooshi Dadgostar, the daughter of Iranian immigrants, has mostly ignored identity politics in favour of class issues such as eliminating for-profit private schools.The clearest vision of the Nordic model’s future is in northern Sweden, where hydroelectricity is powering climate-friendly industries. The huge Northvolt factory will supply batteries for much of Europe’s electric-vehicle industry. The town of Lulea, where a coalless “green steel” plant has just opened, is building 5,000 new homes. Green jobs and public housing are good terrain for the left. Elsewhere the Nordic left’s programme is a bit of a smorgasbord, but its politicians are optimistic. “We have been on the defensive for maybe 30 years,” says Mr Dragsted. “We are going on the offensive now.” 
17  “WHAT STANDS in front of us, what could be weeks away, is the first peer-on-peer, industrialised, digitised, top-tier army against top-tier army war that’s been on this continent for generations,” warned James Heappey, Britain’s junior defence minister, on January 19th, pointing to Russia’s build-up of over 100,000 troops on Ukraine’s border. “Tens of thousands of people could die.” Estonia’s defence chief echoed the warning. “Everything is moving towards armed conflict,” he said.Listen to this story.Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, is due to meet Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, in Geneva on January 21st. But the prospects for diplomacy are dim. On January 19th Sergei Ryabkov, one of Mr Lavrov’s deputies, said that even a 20-year moratorium on NATO membership for Ukraine would not satisfy Russia. In recent weeks, Russia has mobilised reservists and dispatched troops and missiles from as far away as the North Korean border.Western countries are bracing for the worst. On January 17th Britain began airlifting thousands of anti-tank missiles to Ukraine. Days earlier Sweden rushed armoured vehicles to the island of Gotland as three Russian landing craft passed through the Baltic Sea, destination unknown. The same day, Ukraine was struck by cyber-attacks which defaced government websites and locked official computers. Meanwhile, the White House said it had intelligence showing that Russia was planning staged acts of sabotage against its own proxy forces in eastern Ukraine to provide a pretext for attacking the country.Such an attack could take many forms. One possibility is that Russia would simply do openly what it has done furtively for seven years: send troops into the Donetsk and Luhansk “republics”, breakaway territories in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, either to expand their boundaries westward or to recognise them as independent states, as it did after sending forces into Abkhazia and South Ossetia, two Georgian regions, in 2008.Another scenario, widely discussed in recent years, is that Russia might seek to establish a land bridge to Crimea, the peninsula it annexed in 2014. That would require seizing 300km (185 miles) of territory along the Sea of Azov, including the key Ukrainian port of Mariupol, up to the Dnieper river.Such limited land-grabs would be well within the capabilities of the forces mustering in western Russia. What is less clear is whether they would serve the Kremlin’s war aims. If Russia’s objective is to bring Ukraine to its knees and prevent it from joining NATO or even co-operating with the alliance, simply consolidating control over Donbas or a small swathe of land in southern Ukraine is unlikely to achieve it.To do so would require imposing massive costs on the government in Kyiv—whether by decimating its armed forces, destroying its critical national infrastructure or overthrowing it altogether. One option would be for Russia to use “stand-off” weapons without troops on the ground, emulating NATO’s air war against Serbia in 1999. Strikes by rocket launchers and missiles would wreak havoc. These could be supplemented by more novel weapons, such as cyber-attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure like the ones which disrupted the country’s power grid in 2015 and 2016.The problem is that such punitive campaigns tend to last longer and prove harder than they first appear. If war comes, stand-off strikes are more likely to be a prelude and accompaniment to a ground war rather than a substitute for it. “I don’t see a lot between them and Kyiv that could stop them,” says David Shlapak of the RAND Corporation, a think-tank.The aim would probably be to hurt Ukraine, not occupy it. The country is as large and populous as Afghanistan, and since 2014 over 300,000 Ukrainians have gained some form of military experience; most have access to firearms. American officials have told allies that the Pentagon and CIA would both support an armed insurgency.Russia might consider what America’s army calls a “thunder run”, says Mr Shlapak, a swift and deep assault on a narrow front, intended to shock and paralyse the enemy rather than seize territory. And an attack need not come solely from the east.On January 17th Russian troops, some from the far east, began arriving in Belarus, ostensibly for military exercises scheduled for February. Russia has said it will also send a dozen warplanes and two S-400 air-defence systems. An attack from the north, over the Belarus-Ukraine border, would allow Russia to approach the Ukrainian capital from the west and encircle it.“Once they’re within rocket range of downtown Kyiv,” asks Mr Shlapak, “is that a situation the Ukrainians want to live with?” Even if Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, is willing to tolerate a siege, Russia may gamble that his government will simply collapse—and it may use spies, special forces and disinformation to hasten that process.Wars, though, unfold in unpredictable ways. Russia has not fought a large-scale offensive involving infantry, armour and air power since the climactic battles of the second world war. Countries under attack can just as easily stand firm as fall apart. Ivan Timofeev of the Russian International Affairs Council warns of a “long and sluggish confrontation” that would be “fraught with destabilisation of…Russia itself”.Even victory would be costly. “The Ukrainians will fight and inflict major losses on the Russians,” says Peter Zwack, a retired general who was America’s defence attaché in Moscow during the Kremlin’s first invasion of Ukraine in 2014. “This is going to be hard for Russia—and they are basically alone.” Coupled with the threat of heavy sanctions being prepared by America and its European allies, and the apparent absence of any domestic support for a new adventure, all this may, even now, be giving Mr Putin pause for thought. 
18  ANGELA MERKEL’S lethargy covered Germany like a “carpet of fog”, raged Friedrich Merz in 2019. There was never any love lost between Germany’s ex-chancellor and the man she forced out of a top job in the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in 2002. Tail between his legs, Mr Merz left the Bundestag in 2009, only to re-emerge nine years later to compete for the party leadership Mrs Merkel had vacated. His candidacy thrilled CDU members seeking conservative red meat. But moderates found his arrogance off-putting. His bid flopped, as did another last year.Listen to this story.But in September the winner of that second contest, Armin Laschet, led the CDU and its Bavarian sister party to electoral defeat. Now licking its wounds in opposition, the CDU has finally turned to Mr Merz, who takes over as leader this weekend. Once known as a macho tax-cutter with a taste for teasing the politically correct, Mr Merz, 66, now presents himself as a moderate. He promises to court women, gay people and young voters, and to pursue social justice.Will this convince the sceptics? CDU centrists seem willing to hold fire, though some MPs so distrust the ultras around Mr Merz that they have discussed leaving the party. Right-wingers want him to smite the woke. “We need a self-confident civic policy that…clearly positions itself against identity-politics excesses,” says Christoph Ploss, a young CDU MP who has long supported Mr Merz. The new leader’s first test comes in several state elections this year.At the next federal election in 2025 Mr Merz will hope to lead the conservatives’ bid to unseat Olaf Scholz, the chancellor. For now he will focus on bread-and-butter issues like jobs, industrial change and inflation, now at a three-decade high. Mr Merz says the European Central Bank must follow the Federal Reserve and prepare to raise rates. That the ECB is independent does not matter. Mr Merz wants to dispel the fog.
19  WHEN EASTERN EUROPEAN countries about to join the EU in 2003 spoke up in favour of America’s invasion of Iraq, France’s president at the time, Jacques Chirac, haughtily declared they had “missed a good opportunity to shut up”. Their furious response suggested they thought the same of him. Europe likes to stress its collective power, born of an ever-closer union that includes joint foreign-policy ambitions and dreams of an EU army. Yet each country also wants a licence to pursue pet diplomatic forays. While sometimes these policies are sound (like opposing ill-fated invasions in the Middle East, it turned out), occasionally they end up dragging the entire bloc into fights it would rather avoid. If Europe wants geopolitical relevance, it cannot allow every member to foment its own crises.Listen to this story.The EU’S foreign-policy grandees are currently upset and divided about Ukraine. Russia and America, in their stand-off over the country, seem to think of Europe more as a convenient place to meet than as a partner to be included, prompting France’s President Emmanuel Macron to this week renew his calls for greater European autonomy. Germany is at odds with its partners over how to respond to Russia. Fortunately for underemployed wonks another, less-noticed, superpower spat is brewing. China is trying to throttle the Lithuanian economy. The clash pits the world’s most populous country against the EU’s 21st-biggest member. Lithuania is being punished mainly for having allowed Taiwan (which China considers part of its own territory) to use the word “Taiwan” to describe its unofficial embassy, rather than “Taipei Representative Office”, as it does elsewhere at China’s insistence.Retribution has been swift. In a novel form of bureaucratic assault, Lithuania suddenly disappeared as an option on Chinese customs forms, thus blocking all imports from the Baltic minnow. This was inconvenient, to be sure, but generated little more than muted sympathy in European capitals. What support there was came more out of habit than conviction. Privately diplomats echoed Chirac: Lithuania had piped up out of turn. What on earth did it think it was up to, anyway? Other EU countries had lived for decades with the Taipei fudge.Perhaps luckily for Lithuania, China’s ire soon morphed into grotesque overreaction. Insults flew in state media. In November Lithuania’s embassy in Beijing was summarily downgraded to a lowlier diplomatic status. Staff, fearing for their safety, had to be evacuated. That left diplomats from other EU countries (and probably beyond) wondering whether they might be next. Then companies from across Europe whose exports to China merely contained Lithuanian components were also targeted for bureaucratic harassment. This was felt—or at least could be construed—as amounting to an attack on the bloc’s vaunted single market. That it inconvenienced German car-part makers probably helped get the attention of politicians there, and thus beyond.China’s short fuse has helped fire up Lithuania’s claim that the spat is a test case for the rules-based international order, and thus one that the rest of the EU has to get behind. This is happening, albeit with still-grudging enthusiasm. The European Commission, which deals with the EU’s external trade, is diligently putting together a case that China is breaching its obligations as a member of the World Trade Organisation. This might (one day) generate the faintest of blushes in Beijing. The boss of the EU’s foreign-policy apparatus, Josep Borrell, on January 14th promised solidarity and to iron things out at a proposed Europe-China summit in March.The big member states, whose diplomatic heft underpins the EU’s, have now waded in. France is promoting an “anti-coercion” plan that it hopes would deter bullies such as China, which it wants to push in its six-month stint chairing meetings of EU ministers. (The plan is nowhere near ready, nor agreed.) A German minister visited Lithuania to express support, but Olaf Scholz, Germany’s new chancellor, did not raise the issue in a get-to-know-you call with China’s president, Xi Jinping, in December.Nobody can hear EU screamMuch of foreign policy involves responding to crises. But Europe makes the job all the harder for itself if those crises are conjured up from within. Blaming Lithuania for the headache now borne in part by its allies is hardly fair: it is China’s ghoulish reaction that is the problem here. Standing up for Taiwan is laudable; arguably a more forceful defence of the place would be sensible EU policy. Yet the manner in which it has had to be done—or not quite done—hardly inspires confidence. In so far as European allies have had to step in, decisions made by one member state have in effect been made on behalf of the whole, yet without their say. Grand strategic planning this is not.Europe has ambitions to use its limited means to nudge China into changing its ways. An investment agreement both sides were keen on was shelved last year after a flurry of sanctions and counter-sanctions over human rights in Xinjiang. The push and pull of careful diplomacy is constantly at work. But China, like others before it, has found it easy to divide Europe at its convenience. Many eastern European countries a decade ago cosied up to it in a format designed to circumvent the EU’s own structures, known as “16+1” (which Lithuania left last year and which seems to be fading). That now looks a lot like some countries treating the EU as just another club that helps them further their interest—while expecting solidarity when things go wrong.Lithuania will survive its scrape with Chinese fury. The containers turned away from Chinese ports have been snapped up by Taiwan, which now has enough Lithuanian rum to last a lifetime. The Baltic country has been promised sizeable investment from Taiwanese microchip firms. So it has piped up and avoided catastrophe. Good news, it might feel. But it is also another reminder of just how hard foreign policy is for a club of 27. 
20  FIVE YEARS ago, when Brexit prompted fears that the European Union would unravel, Emmanuel Macron put Europe at the heart of his political identity. Supporters at his rallies enthusiastically waved the EU flag. So it was no surprise that, with France in charge of the rotating six-month presidency of the Council of the EU since January 1st, the French president headed on January 19th to the European Parliament in Strasbourg to renew his vows.Listen to this story.The EU, declared Mr Macron, represented democracy, progress and peace at a time when each was under threat. Faced with rising authoritarian powers, breaches of the rule of law within the EU and the menace of war on its doorstep, “European civilisation” needed to be upheld and cherished. He pleaded for a “new security order” in Europe. Resolute Atlanticists, especially in eastern Europe, hate the idea, which they think undermines NATO, but it is an abiding French passion. France had hung the EU flag alone under the Arc de Triomphe to launch the French presidency, noted the president—a decision met with howls of protest by his domestic opponents. “I’m proud of that,” he declared.The French opposition MEPs in the chamber, however (including a presidential candidate, the Greens’ Yannick Jadot), did their best to turn the event into a campaign debate. And miffed as Mr Macron was made out to be, the exercise struck a distinctly domestic note. For the president, expected shortly to confirm that he is running for re-election, is hoping once again to use Europe as a political football.In some respects, only a brave politician seeks to put Europe at the forefront of a French electoral campaign. The country may be co-architect of the post-war project, but in 2005 the French voted in a referendum against a draft EU constitution. In 2017 48% of the first-round vote at the presidential election went to candidates, such as the nationalist Marine Le Pen, who are Europhobic or Eurosceptic. Last year a poll found that only 53% of the French were optimistic about the EU, compared with 67% of Germans.France is split over Europe. Hostility to the EU characterises the political extremes. This includes the radical left, whose candidate, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, is better placed than any other on the left. And it marks the hard right, including Ms Le Pen and Eric Zemmour, a polemicist running on a viscerally anti-immigration platform to “rescue France”.In contrast, there is a broad pro-European consensus among the mainstream candidates. It reaches from Mr Jadot and the Socialists’ Anne Hidalgo via Mr Macron to the Republicans’ Valérie Pécresse. This broadly reflects what the French call Gaullo-Mitterrandisme: a general continuity in foreign policy between Charles de Gaulle, on the right, and François Mitterrand, on the left, over the need for France to retain an independent voice, while remaining a Western ally, notes François Heisbourg of the Foundation for Strategic Research. To this end Europe is a way for France to enhance its voice, not dilute it.Yet this underlying division over Europe is less clear now than in 2017. Mr Mélenchon no longer promises to tear up all EU treaties, although he still wants France out of NATO. Ms Le Pen maintains that her vision of Europe is the “antithesis” of Mr Macron’s, and wants to pull France out of NATO’s integrated military command. But she has now dropped all talk of Frexit, and no longer vows to take France out of the euro, a policy that proved unpopular. Instead, by promising to protect the French constitution from EU law, her strategy is to try to undermine the union from within, like her friends in Poland and Hungary.Mr Macron’s most credible challenger, Mrs Pécresse, holds pro-European views that are not so very different from his. She has had to nod to the nationalist wing of her party. She denounced the solo flying of the EU flag, and backs the idea of building barbed-wire walls to funnel migrants on the EU’s external border to reception points. But her underlying sympathies are with the EU as a political project. In short, nobody is quite as enthusiastic about Europe as Mr Macron. But nor are the differences quite as stark as before. 
21  EARLIER THIS month President Emmanuel Macron said he wished to “piss off” those who had chosen not to be vaccinated against covid-19. France’s 5m unjabbed people will soon be barred from restaurants, theatres and long-distance trains, among other things. Yet they might consider themselves lucky. Italy and Greece have passed laws making vaccination obligatory for all residents over 50 and 60 respectively. Austria has just done so for all adults, and Germany may follow suit.Listen to this story.Most European countries have already excluded unvaccinated people from large swathes of public life, to varying effect. In many places jabs are a condition of employment in hospitals and care homes. But facing a stubborn wall of vaccine scepticism, some governments have gone one step further. “I would have preferred to go another way. But…we need to take this drastic step,” said Alexander Schallenberg, Austria’s then chancellor, announcing the plan in November. Austria and Germany have some of the lowest vaccination rates in western Europe.Many feel queasy at the prospect of governments ordering them to have needles stuck in their arms. Proponents counter that the unvaccinated erode the freedom of other citizens by swamping health-care systems and making new lockdowns more likely. Either way, compulsory vaccination carries several potential risks.Start with the legal and logistical problems. Austria’s law, which will apply to 7.4m people—all residents over 18 bar pregnant women and those with medical exemptions—will take effect on February 1st. From mid-March the unjabbed face fines of at least €600 ($680), with further checks and fines applicable every quarter. But the agency responsible for the vaccine registry says it will not be ready until April. (Spot-checks will apply before then.) The legal system could buckle if many refuseniks opt for fines over jabs. Germany, where parliament will debate vaccine mandates next week, does not even have a registry, making enforcement look yet trickier.Moreover, constitutional courts will frown on mandates that look premature or disproportionate. Many reckon European governments could do more to balance the stick of restrictions with the carrot of better outreach. Rather than simply impose top-down measures, they could find vaccination champions in communities with large numbers of unjabbed people, including some minority groups.A second concern is epidemiological. The German and Austrian mandates were proposed when the Delta variant was dominant. But laws may not prove as adaptable as the SARS-Cov-2 virus. What if the next variant requires a modified vaccine, or a fresh booster? For Janosch Dahmen, a German Green MP and doctor, uncertainty surrounding the behaviour of future variants is a strong reason to press ahead with (well-designed) compulsory vaccination now. Others disagree. A leading Austrian virologist urged the country to rethink its plan in the face of the widespread immunity the Omicron wave will confer.A third worry is backlash. Most Germans support compulsion. But although moving from nudges to mandates may induce some sceptics to get the jab, others may become implacable foes. Anti-vax protests, many of them fuelled by the far right and prone to violence, are spreading rapidly. A vaccine mandate will surely swell them further. To avoid creating social “fissures” the Czechs recently scrapped a plan to oblige over-60s to get jabbed. (The age-limited mandates in Greece and Italy have proved less contentious.)No one knows if compulsion will work. One Austrian panel found that roughly two-thirds of the 1m remaining unjabbed adults were unlikely to get vaccinated at any cost. But such surveys have their limits. The French, for example, turned out to be more relaxed about jabs than polls had once suggested. As other countries grapple with their vaccine hold-outs, they will be watching the experiments in the German-speaking countries closely. Correction (January 19th 2022): This article gives vaccination rates for Germany and Austria. In the original version we suggested the rates applied only to the over-12s; in fact they were for the whole population. This has been changed.Dig deeperAll our stories relating to the pandemic can be found on our coronavirus hub.

22  IN GEORGE ORWELL’S “1984”, Room 101 is where prisoners are confronted with their worst fear. Finding Europeans’ prevailing phobia is trickier: what spooks voters in one bit of the continent (asylum-seekers! deficits! Russia!) may be of scant concern to those on the other end. Covid-19 is one contender, as it has made life dull from Dublin to Dubrovnik and beyond. Another is the continent’s ongoing energy crisis. Surging natural-gas prices are sending heating bills soaring, soaking up the cash Europeans have saved while moping around at home for two years. It is a crisis so all-encompassing that all parts of the EU will have to face up to their deepest apprehensions.Listen to this story.As with most nightmares, the origins of the power crunch are partly clear and partly mysterious. Europe went into the winter season with low stocks of natural gas, which is used for heating homes and generating electricity. Shrinking domestic energy production in places like the Netherlands, wimpy breezes that failed to spin wind turbines as much as hoped, booming Asian demand sucking gas eastwards, and maintenance trouble at French nuclear plants have coalesced into a shortage few saw coming. When Russia, whence gas pipelines tend to depart, did not rush to help with additional supply, prices spiked. The average European household faces electricity and gas bills of €1,850 ($2,100) in 2022, up from €1,200 in 2020, according to Bank of America. Fears of winter power cuts have been forestalled by a bout of unseasonably warm weather—for now.But the horror goes beyond the pocketbook: for many countries, it evokes their worst insecurities. Take proud France, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU. The crisis makes a mockery of the bloc attaining “strategic autonomy”, President Emmanuel Macron’s latest big idea. That Europe should be shielded from being bossed around by foreign powers sounds laudable, but seems more distant than ever. What autonomy can Europe claim when it requires Russian largesse to keep its homes warm? This is an awkward question at a time when Vladimir Putin is threatening to invade Ukraine. If America responds with sanctions against Russia, as it has threatened, it is Europe that will suffer the worst of the Kremlin’s retribution. No wonder the EU can scarcely find a seat at the negotiating table.Worse, some countries seem sanguine at the existing state of affairs. Germany is in the final stages of signing off on Nord Stream 2, a pipeline that will make Europe even more reliant on Russian gas. The EU’s biggest economy will have to confront angst of its own. The energy-price surge will be disastrous for its industry. It has also triggered a jump in inflation, the economic indicator Germans fear most. And the new coalition government, which is divided over Nord Stream 2, has just overseen the closure of three nuclear-power plants that might have come in handy in keeping the continent’s lights on. The country that thinks of itself as providing solutions for Europe is now part of the problem.Twin dreads keep northern Europeans awake through their long winter nights. One is that the EU will fail to act against climate change, which greatly concerns voters in the Netherlands and Scandinavia. The other is that “their” money will go to subsidise spendthrift southerners. The deal struck in 2020 for a European covid recovery fund neatly set these two fears against each other: frugal northerners agreed to underwrite a big aid package, on the condition it fund long-term investments (notably green ones). The gas crisis undermines that set-up. Governments in places like Italy and Spain are doling out billions to help households handle higher utility bills, while Polish miners work overtime to dig up filthy coal.Southern Europe’s biggest fear is of a sputtering recovery. Greece, Italy and others could use a good run after two crises in barely more than a decade. Big jumps in energy bills hurt poorer countries more. That applies to eastern Europeans too. But their Room 101 is dominated by Mr Putin, who keeps his hand on the gas tap while demanding that former Warsaw Pact countries stop hosting NATO troops. If winter temperatures don’t have Baltic countries shivering, the prospect of a hockey-masked Mr Putin picking them off like terrified teens surely will.Pump scareThe gas-price horror movie is most terrifying for Eurocrats. The causes of the current energy snafu are hard to distil down to a single factor, says Georg Zachmann of Bruegel, a think-tank in Brussels. That leaves plenty of room to designate a scapegoat, and one candidate comes to mind. The European Commission regulates EU energy markets (mostly quite sensibly) and has made carbon neutrality a central plank of the bloc’s future (also sensible). Sound as its policy decisions may be, they have aggravated the current crisis. For example, shifting to coal to keep prices down is less of an option, since it would require buying expensive EU carbon-emissions credits.Had Britain still been in the EU, the likes of Nigel Farage would no doubt have spent the past few months blaming Brussels for rising energy costs. Others might seize his demagogic mantle. France, home of the gilets jaunes, has recent experience of grassroots grumpiness linked to energy prices, and is gearing up for an election featuring some raucous eurobashers. Viktor Orban will also be looking for some element of the EU machine to pummel as he prepares to face Hungarian voters in April.European officials know the spotlight of blame might swing to them, and are not looking forward to it. Yet anxiety can be healthy when the fear is of being held accountable. Having voters fume at the EU’s approach to problems is a sign that it is devising policies some people disagree with, and might want overturned. That looks an awful lot like a functional democracy at a pan-European level. Scary, isn’t it? Boo! 
23  ORDINARILY, WHEN the EU favours a flood of collective spending, the Dutch put their collective finger in the dyke. In 2020 the Netherlands rallied a group of small, rich countries (the “frugal four”) to oppose the EU’s covid recovery fund. They eventually gave in, but not before Wopke Hoekstra, the then finance minister, insulted southern Europeans for lacking budget discipline. This week a new Dutch government took office. It comprises the same parties as the previous one, yet its stance on the EU is far more relaxed.Listen to this story.Mark Rutte, the Liberal prime minister, is back for a fourth term, but has turned boosterish on Europe. Just as important is the new finance minister, Sigrid Kaag of the centre-left, pro-EU D66 party. Finance is the most powerful ministry, and has largely run the Netherlands’ EU policy since the euro crisis of 2010-12. Mr Hoekstra, a Christian Democrat, has been shunted to foreign minister. This may seem an odd fit, but Mr Hoekstra incarnates an old adage about the country’s diplomacy: “I am Dutch, so I may be blunt.”Finance ministers are often popular in the Netherlands. Winning the post is testament to Ms Kaag’s bargaining skills, honed as a UN diplomat in the Middle East. The coalition negotiations lasted nine excruciating months. Striking a deal required the parties to trade favours, leading to some rather un-Dutch plans for big spending. They include a climate fund of €35bn ($40bn) through 2030 and reimbursing 95% of child-care costs up to the age of 12. Government debt will rise past the EU’s notional limit of 60% of GDP.Dutch flexibility would be welcome in Brussels, where France and Italy want to loosen the budget rules permanently. The new government may go along, with conditions. It also backs letting the EU raise more of its own taxes, including a carbon tariff on imports. Instead of clubbing with small thrifty states, it will work with the EU’s powerhouses, France and Germany.The Netherlands’ tone has changed, but its interests have not. As a country that trades a lot and has a big financial sector, it felt closer to Britain than to France until Brexit. It remains less statist than most EU members. “We will continue to be a liberal outpost in Europe,” says Hans Vijlbrief, a D66 minister who has worked at the finance ministry and in Brussels. But they may be less blunt about it. 
24  AS RUSSIAN TANKS poured west, heading from Vladivostok on the Pacific coast to the border with Ukraine, American diplomats headed east. Not since the Balkan wars of the 1990s has Europe seen a week of such crucial security summitry. On January 10th American diplomats met Russian ones in Geneva. Two days later the NATO-Russia Council convened in Brussels. On January 13th the diplomats headed to Vienna for a gathering of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), a group of 57 countries.Listen to this story.The purpose of this frenetic diplomacy was to prevent a war. Russia’s government has demanded, among other things, that NATO stop expanding and pull back from places that used to be part of the Soviet Union. It wants NATO members to stop co-operating with Ukraine, and a legal guarantee that Ukraine and Georgia will never join the alliance (something those countries have previously been promised). America and its European allies have agreed to discuss the Kremlin’s stated grievances, while beefing up their defences and threatening sanctions should Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, attack Ukraine again.On the face of it, the summitry took some heat out of the crisis. Sergei Ryabkov, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, said that his meeting with Wendy Sherman, America’s deputy secretary of state, was “very professional” and “deep”. Ms Sherman, who proposed ideas about how America and Russia could limit missile deployments and the size and transparency of their exercises, noted that Mr Ryabkov had even discussed “things that are not Russian priorities”.Yet Mr Ryabkov was keen that this not be misunderstood. Deals on missiles and exercises were nice, but a sideshow. “For us, it’s absolutely mandatory to make sure that Ukraine never, never, ever becomes a member of NATO,” he said, clarifying in English: “We need ironclad, waterproof, bulletproof, legally binding guarantees.”These were not forthcoming when Russia met the 29 other members of NATO in Brussels on January 12th for four hours of talks. “It is only Ukraine and 30 allies that can decide when Ukraine can become a NATO member,” said Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary-general of the alliance, after the meeting. “No one else can.”This was no surprise for Moscow, which had expected its demands to be spurned. Less clear was whether the Kremlin’s aim was to elicit a pretext to attack Ukraine, or simply to generate material for propaganda. Some people familiar with Mr Putin say that he has long lost interest in the day-to-day business of running Russia, but is excited by geopolitical theatre; in recent months, Russian officials have drawn grandiose parallels with the Cuban missile crisis. Mr Putin is well aware that ordinary Russians have little appetite for a big war. Yet he hopes to keep them in a state of fear, to distract from the many grumbles they have about his regime.Western officials are keen to keep talks going as long as possible in the hope that the crisis may dissipate. Russian officials have repeatedly warned that they will not be drawn into what Mr Putin has called the “swamp” of drawn-out discussions, not least because an invasion of Ukraine would become harder once the ground in the country’s east thaws in spring. Mr Stoltenberg said that Russia had been open to the idea of more dialogue, but declined to agree to a schedule of further meetings. Mr Putin will make the final call, but his emissaries showed little satisfaction. Russian proposals were not “a loaf from which you can peck out some...sultanas”, complained Alexander Grushko, the head of the country’s delegation to Brussels. If diplomacy failed, he thundered, the threat from NATO would be “countered by military means”.If Russia does indeed attack Ukraine, American officials have promised “massive” economic sanctions, far in excess of those imposed after its previous assaults in 2014, when it annexed Crimea. They hint at disconnecting Russia from the SWIFT network, which connects banks to one another, and banning it from receiving goods with American electronics in them. The measures would be “like none he’s ever seen”, warned Joe Biden, America’s president, after a conversation with Mr Putin on December 7th.Europeans have also explored sanctions on banks and individuals close to the Kremlin, says Sabine Fischer of SWP, a think-tank in Berlin, but they are more nervous. There are “serious concerns” over kicking Russia out of SWIFT, which has its headquarters in Belgium, she says, because it would hurt ordinary Russians and EU sanctions are supposed to be targeted.There is also uncertainty over the fate of Nord Stream 2, a controversial gas pipeline from Russia to Germany. American officials claim that Germany has agreed to suspend the pipeline in the event of war. Germany’s coalition government remains divided over the issue, and some officials are wary of restricting gas supplies just as Europe faces a looming energy crisis.Ukraine itself, the focal point of the crisis, has sat largely on the sidelines of this diplomacy. On January 2nd Mr Biden spoke to Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, for the second time in a month and on January 10th Mr Stoltenberg welcomed the country’s deputy prime minister to Brussels to show solidarity. Yet Ukraine has been given just one opportunity to participate in the talks, at the OSCE meeting, which is widely viewed as a sideshow.Meanwhile, Russia has shown no sign of stepping back (see map). Its buildup remains slow and is not yet large enough for a “serious” offensive, says a European intelligence official. Russia has deployed mostly equipment, rather than fully manned units; personnel would need to be flown in later. But the fact that the country has begun sending forces from its eastern military district, over 6,000km from Ukraine, is a “horrible sign”, warns Konrad Muzyka of Rochan Consulting, who tracks Russian military movements. “My prediction is these negotiations will end with no success within several months,” says Ruslan Pukhov, the director of CAST, a think-tank in Moscow. “The risk of war with Ukraine is very big.” 
25  AFTER RUSSIAN soldiers invaded their country in 2014, many Ukrainians began favouring Western holidays over ones associated with Russia. Women’s Day, an originally socialist holiday that took hold in Soviet times, has faded, while the American-made Mother’s Day is in vogue. As the snow piled up in Christmas markets in December, so did the evidence that Santa Claus was displacing the Soviet-era Ded Moroz (“Father Frost”) as the country’s pre-eminent bearded gift-bearer. Weightiest of all is the debate over when to celebrate Christmas itself. Epiphanius I, the head of Ukraine’s Orthodox Church, says he expects his congregants will favour switching from January 7th to December 25th within a decade.Listen to this story.Why is there an issue with the date of Ukrainian Orthodox Christmas? It began with Russian Orthodoxy’s attachment to the 2,000-year-old Julian calendar, which observes too many leap years. The Russian church never adopted the calendar devised in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII, which skips three leap years every four centuries. When the Soviet state went Gregorian in 1918, the Russian church did not. The Julian calendar now runs 13 days behind, so Christmas falls on January 7th—through 2099; in 2100, when the world next omits a leap year, it will move to January 8th. But in 2019 Ukraine’s Orthodox Church sealed its autonomy from the Moscow Patriarchate. It can now decide when to jingle its bells.Old Calendarists argue that switching would muck up the formula for calculating Easter, violating canonical texts. But it can be done, as shown by Orthodox churches in Greece, Romania and Albania, which use the Latin Christmas date. The Ukrainian state declared December 25th a public holiday in 2017, ostensibly for the sake of the country’s Catholics. But pushing too fast risks dividing Ukrainian society, splitting the church or pushing old-fashioned believers back towards Moscow.In secular terms the idea has a cold logic. Since 2014 Ukraine has unravelled its economy from Russia’s to knit it together with the EU’s. It makes sense for countries to align their rhythms of work and rest with their closest foreign trading partners. That is what Saudi Arabia did in 2013 when it became the last Islamic country to ditch Thursday-Friday weekends. Religions do not need to be logical. But if Ukraine does break with its cherished habit, marking Christmas on a different day would emphasise that its divorce from Russia is truly final.
26  ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF François Mitterrand’s death on January 8th Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, went in the driving rain to lay flowers at his grave. She was seeking “inspiration” from the late Socialist president, but it looked more like a requiem for the party’s current candidacy. Polls show Ms Hidalgo, the Socialists’ nominee, winning just 4% in the first round of the French presidential election in April. A result that bad would not only disqualify her from the run-off but fail to meet the 5% threshold for taxpayers to reimburse half of her campaign spending.Listen to this story.What has happened to the once mighty French left? Under the Fifth Republic, the grand old Socialist Party has provided two presidents (Mitterrand and François Hollande) and landmark social legislation, including the abolition of the death penalty in 1981 and the legalisation of gay marriage in 2013. A decade ago it controlled the presidency, both houses of parliament, and most regions and big cities. In Ms Hidalgo, it has an internationally respected mayor, praised for turning over swathes of central Paris to cyclists and joggers. The French Green party, with which the Socialists often govern, also has a presentable nominee, Yannick Jadot. Its big issue, climate change, is constantly in the news.Yet neither Ms Hidalgo, nor Mr Jadot, nor any of the candidates further to the left—including Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a 70-year-old left-wing firebrand, and a clutch of other anti-capitalists and communists—currently stands any chance of reaching the final run-off.The trouble for the French left is threefold. First, too many candidates have fragmented the vote. None seems to have the clout or the charisma needed to rally the others behind a single nominee. Ms Hidalgo had backed the idea of a “citizens’ primary” as a way to do this. Due to take place on January 27th-30th, this is a non-binding online vote proposed by 130,000 grass-roots supporters as a way to measure support for the different candidates, whether they like it or not. But Mr Jadot argues, reasonably enough, that he has already won his own party’s primary, and has no intention of heeding the result. Mr Mélenchon says all this is not his problem.Second, the mainstream French left has lost the working class. Its base is now made up largely of city-dwellers and public-sector employees. This is too narrow to win national elections easily. In the past, Mitterrand deftly linked the Socialists to the French Communist Party to secure the blue-collar vote. Now the biggest slice of that vote goes to the nationalist Marine Le Pen: 33% of blue-collar workers back her for president, next to 3% for Ms Hidalgo. Such voters want a harder line on law and order. Cycling, one of Ms Hidalgo’s signature issues, may be popular in central Paris and Green-run cities such as Bordeaux. Elsewhere, voters depend on their cars and resent being made to feel guilty for it.Third, France has shifted to the right. Today 37% of voters say they are on the right, up four points since 2017, next to 20% who say they are on the left, down five points in the same period. As a former economy minister in a Socialist government, Emmanuel Macron in 2017 drew from the moderate left to build his new centrist party when he ran for the presidency. Many such voters were subsequently disillusioned by his tax cuts for the rich, but since the pandemic they have grown less hostile, says Chloé Morin, a former Socialist adviser now at the Fondation Jean-Jaurès, a think-tank: “The weakness of the left means that voters on the centre-left are thinking that they might as well vote Macron to keep out the right and the far right.”“I’m not giving up,” insists Ms Hidalgo, who argues that polls understate support on the left. She blames Mr Macron for de stabilising the party system. But some even within the Socialist Party think that the solution to their troubles lies with yet another potential candidate: Christiane Taubira, a popular former justice minister from French Guiana who is something of an icon on the left. She says she will run for the presidency if she wins the “citizens’ primary”. Unless some of the others then step aside, however, Ms Taubira’s candidacy will only fragment the vote further.As candidates squabble over how to run for office, they are failing to tell the public what they would do if they win it. Yet France needs to grapple with big policy issues. These include how to integrate minorities, curb inequality and protect the poor from the burdens of the green transition, at a time when public spending has reached an exceptional 62% of GDP, the highest level in the EU. If the left has a future in France, this year’s candidates are doing a good job of disguising it. 
27  THE END of 2021 brought mixed news for Germany’s anti-nuclear crowd. On December 6th the gaggle of activists who had gathered outside the Brokdorf nuclear plant, in northern Germany, every month for the 36 years it had operated swapped their usual thermoses for champagne. For on December 31st Brokdorf, the construction of which had inspired some of the roughest protests in German history, was one of three nuclear plants switched off for good. The remaining three will be closed down by the end of this year, concluding a nuclear exit two decades in the making.Listen to this story.Then came the downer. Just before midnight on December 31st, after months of dithering, the European Commission circulated a draft energy “taxonomy” that labelled natural gas and nuclear fission as sustainable, with conditions. The taxonomy, which must be finalised and then approved by the EU’s 27 governments and the European Parliament, is designed to steer investment to climate-friendly projects. But if the aim was to please everyone by finding room for all but the dirtiest fuels, it failed in Germany. Robert Habeck, the vice-chancellor and co-leader of the Green party, called the draft “greenwashing”, citing concerns about safety and nuclear waste. An MP from the Social Democratic Party (SPD), which leads the governing coalition, compared nuclear supporters (ludicrously) to anti-vaxxers.Atomic fission was once the future in Germany. That was before the emergence, in the mid-1970s, of the world’s most enduring anti-nuclear movement. Unlike environmental groups in some other countries, says Jan-Henrik Meyer at the Max Planck Institute for Legal History and Legal Theory, Germany’s Greens emerged directly from the anti-nuclear campaign. Its precepts guided their actions in state parliaments as well as the national one, culminating in a decision by an SPD-Green coalition in 2000 to abandon nuclear for good. In 2010 Angela Merkel partially reversed that decision. Less than a year later, amid huge protests in the wake of Japan’s Fukushima meltdown, she made the biggest U-turn of her career and agreed to turn off all Germany’s nuclear plants by 2022.A disaster, say critics. Nuclear power entails hardly any carbon emissions and offers consistent baseload supply, unlike intermittent renewables. If new plants are pricey and create waste, prematurely decommissioning old ones seems self-defeating, especially when bureaucracy and bottlenecks are slowing the rollout of renewables. In the short term the burning of coal and gas may rise to make up the shortfall. And the transition to electric cars and the need for clean hydrogen will require yet more electricity, and thus an even more extensive rollout of renewable sources.Many Germans deny that scrapping nuclear has made emissions higher than they would otherwise have been. Emissions from power generation have fallen, even as nuclear plants have closed. Moreover, they argue, renewables would not have grown so quickly had nuclear been preserved. “There was a clear connection between the exit from nuclear and the entry of renewables,” says Simon Müller, Germany director at Agora Energiewende, a think-tank. The coalition that sought to halt nuclear power in 2000 also introduced vast subsidies for renewables as part of Germany’s Energiewende, or energy turnaround. If the subsidies hurt German consumers, who have long faced Europe’s dearest electricity, the rest of the world has benefited from the cheaper photovoltaic cells and wind turbines they made possible.But Germany’s Sonderweg (special path) in energy policy is not to the taste of countries with different histories, politics and energy mixes. France is placing a big bet on nuclear; several central European countries see it as a way to wean themselves off coal. Many resent the finger-wagging tone in Berlin, especially when Germany is boosting imports of Russian gas.Germany is unlikely to try to overturn the commission’s proposals, which would require a big majority of EU countries. But it will not be deflected from its anti-nuclear, pro-gas course: the commission has no direct say in countries’ energy choices. As the EU works on laws to realise its ambition to go carbon-free by 2050, and fears of a winter energy crunch grow, these new-year spats herald bigger rows. 
28  CRANK UP THE power flowing into a building and the lights shine that much brighter. Without an upgrade in its wiring, though, fuses will soon blow or smoke emerge from unexpected places. Political structures are much the same. A surge in power delights all involved—until some not altogether welcome things start happening.Listen to this story.Across the world the political current is swelling. The role of the state is expanding. The pandemic has eroded the already-shaky consensus about the limits of governments’ role in liberal societies. National polities, those age-old edifices, have ample experience navigating such surges and sags. For the European project, a hotch-potch of creaking foundations and shaky extensions improvised over the years, more state power will require a rethink of the institutional cabling that keeps the lights on.Big government ought to be familiar territory for Europe. Meddlesome public sectors are the norm at national level, crowned by EU institutions long derided by critics as a bonkers bureaucracy hell-bent on dictating the curvature of bananas. In fact the European project has more often been a force for governmental restraint. From its origins in the 1950s, the Brussels machinery has been less a Leviathan dictating new policies so much as a self-imposed straitjacket constricting national politicians. Why, the consensus went, should Europeans compete senselessly against each other when too often the culmination of such contests involved soldiers crossing borders and bombers flattening cities?The project’s most impressive achievements (and the emergence of its latest iteration, the EU, in 1993) came at a time when politicians the world over accepted that the public sector was bloated and overmighty. Few national leaders tried as hard as Margaret Thatcher to restrain it. But many outsourced the job to the Eurocracy. Brussels became an unexpected force in the checking of governmental power, a fountainhead of edicts to grudgingly obedient national politicians not to do things they might otherwise have got away with.The single internal market, created 29 years ago, still requires the elimination of all obstacles to the free movement of goods, people, money and services—tying the hands of politicians who would like to stem migration from other EU countries, for example. Schengen forbids the erection of border barriers between its members. Trade deals negotiated by the EU remove tariffs in a continent where protectionism is sometimes popular. State-aid rules bar politicians from throwing public money at favoured industries, no matter how keen they are to promote national champions. Above all, the introduction of the euro in 1999 eliminated the possibility of devaluation and, in theory at least, put tight controls on budget deficits.Now those who favour more government have the upper hand, from London to Washington and from Paris to Berlin. Can Europe, and more generally the fluid apportionment of powers between national and federal levels, adapt? Not easily. For the EU, banning stuff is straightforward: you only have to decide what to ban. Actually doing things is harder. First you must decide what to do, then figure out how to do it. Take public subsidies to industry. Forbidding them, as Europe has long done, merely involves chastising those that break the rules. But creating new handouts involves picking which companies should receive public largesse, and how much. Should it be microchip plants or defence firms? Who decides when priorities ought to change? Who pays?There are two ways that Europe can shift gears as government swells, argues Fabian Zuleeg of the European Policy Centre, a think-tank in Brussels. The first involves the EU getting out of the way. Countries can simply resume doing what they were once ordered not to do. For example, the rules around state aid and budget deficits were suspended as covid-19 raged, and are unlikely to snap back fully. That gives national governments more scope to indulge in once-forbidden behaviour. The drawback is that it throws the European project into reverse. The second path is for big government to happen at the European level. Some powers are shifting to EU institutions. In 2020 the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, was given the job of sourcing vaccines for everyone from Finland to Portugal. Europe’s ambitious green agenda is largely piloted from Brussels. The Next Generation EU (NGEU) fund, a €750bn ($846bn) pandemic response, is a step towards a federal budget. All that comes on top of already powerful bits of the edifice, notably the well-run European Central Bank.EU turn if you want toThis “more Europe” approach raises questions about whether the EU’s current institutional wiring is good enough. The Brussels machine is a fearsome regulator and legislator, but are its executive skills up to snuff? If the vaccine procurement episode is anything to go by, the answer is no. Early fumbles meant Europeans got their first jabs long after Americans and Britons did.A lot more centralisation would also require more oversight. The commission is acquiring vast new powers. For example, it can withhold NGEU funds from countries that fail to enact the reforms they have promised in order to get their hands on a share of the cash. With such powers should come more accountability. Yet what happens in Brussels is seldom much scrutinised beyond its bubble. The European Parliament ought to do the job, but is often focused on dogmatically demanding a bigger role for the EU (and for itself).Homeowners faced with vast electrical projects often settle for make-do solutions. Europe is likely to do something similar. Nobody is keen on a grand package of institutional reform, which only cumbersome treaty changes and consequent referendums could bring about. A new EU programme here, a fresh fuse-box there, will do the trick for now. But it may not prove a lasting fix. 
29  ITALIAN PRESIDENTIAL elections customarily have more twists and implausible turns than a Verdi opera. Voting in the latest—to replace President Sergio Mattarella—is to begin on January 24th. Over the coming weeks party leaders can be expected to trade bluff and counter-bluff, leaking the names of candidates whose chances they are in fact content to sacrifice while keeping secret until the last moment the identity of the one they really favour.Listen to this story.The outcome matters: Italian presidents have the power to dissolve parliaments and name prime ministers. They also hold office for an unusually long time: seven years, during which they acquire a moral authority that can constrain the actions of the government.This time, the choice may seem obvious. The prime minister, Mario Draghi, a former president of the European Central Bank, is internationally respected. He is free of party allegiance and heads a cabinet spanning the political arc from hard right to radical left. It would seem logical for this broad coalition to unite in his support.Yet he faces an uphill struggle. Ironically, the only major party to have consistently, if surreptitiously, backed Mr Draghi’s elevation is the only one that has consistently criticised his performance. The hard-right Brothers of Italy (FdI), led by Giorgia Meloni, chose not to join Mr Draghi’s coalition last year. Ms Meloni’s party is notionally allied to the populist Northern League, headed by Matteo Salvini, and the centre-right Forza Italia party, led by the 85-year-old Silvio Berlusconi who, without actually declaring his availability, has indicated that he too wants the presidency.Ms Meloni has had no choice but to offer Mr Berlusconi public support. But, unlike Mr Salvini’s, hers has seemed distinctly lukewarm. Were Mr Draghi to get the job instead, it would end his government and perhaps prompt an early election. That would suit the FdI, riding high in the polls, and particularly Ms Meloni, who on present form would emerge as leader of the biggest party on the right, and prime minister should the right secure a majority as the polls currently suggest.Enrico Letta, leader of the centre-left Democratic Party (PD), currently level-pegging the FdI in the polls, initially wanted Mr Draghi to remain prime minister until the next general election, due in 2023. But Mr Letta is said no longer to rule out backing his becoming president. The overriding priority for the PD is to ensure that the present coalition remains intact until the vote—not least to prevent the League, whose leader, Mr Salvini, has long been uneasy with the arrangement, from slipping away. The radical right could be an even more formidable force if it came into an electoral campaign after a year or more united in opposition.Which is where Mr Berlusconi—or rather, his allies’ support for him—becomes a problem. As Mr Draghi mused on December 22nd, it is unlikely that a coalition that had fallen out over the presidency could magically reunite to govern the country. But a joint candidate can only be agreed to in talks, and Mr Letta is refusing to negotiate with Mr Salvini until he rules out Mr Berlusconi. Italy’s longest serving republican prime minister he may be, but Mr Berlusconi is also a convicted tax fraudster and the erstwhile host of the notorious “Bunga Bunga” parties. Opposition to him is even stronger in the anti-graft Five Star Movement than in the PD. On January 3rd the Movement’s senators voted to try to square the circle by imploring Mr Mattarella to stay on until the next election. That is a solution the president has repeatedly dismissed. But it would offer a widely acceptable route out of a dangerous impasse. 
30  IN THE SNOW-BLANKETED town of Vovchansk in eastern Ukraine, where 20,000 people live just five minutes’ drive from the border with Russia, Sergei Sergienko lists his tribulations. Jobs are scarce, so he must leave at 5.00am for construction work in Kharkiv, the nearest city, for which he earns 700 hryvnias ($25) a day. His father is in recovery after covid-19 put him in hospital. Absent from Mr Sergienko’s list is the fear that Russian troops might sweep into Ukraine across the border down the road. “I try not to fill my head with worries about war, there are enough problems without it,” he says. Besides, he adds with a shrug, it is not something he can control.Listen to this story.Ukraine is deeply wary of threats to its independence, so one might expect widespread alarm at the sight of 100,000 or so Russian troops at the border, and at the muttering of Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, about “military-technical” action. Things are not so simple. Ukrainians have weathered eight years of war against troops backed by Russia in the breakaway “republics” of Donetsk and Luhansk, which have claimed 13,000 lives. But they have also lived through rhetorical twists and turns, the making and breaking of cease fires, and countless predictions of horrors that usually never came. In such a world, scepticism is a form of wisdom.A slight majority of Ukrainians believes an invasion is likely, according to the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, a polling outfit. Guessing the form it might take is a macabre game for some. Hackers could launch cyber-attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure. Troops could reach Kyiv and oust the government, or seize all land to the east of the Dnieper river, which bisects the country. Perhaps Mr Putin is after a strip of land connecting Russia to Crimea. Maybe he’d like to pry Russian-speaking cities like Odessa and Kharkiv away from Ukraine. Or perhaps it is all a ploy. If Mr Putin has settled on a plan, he is giving nothing away.The dynamic of efforts to avoid a war resembles that of a hostage negotiation. Russia points its guns at Ukraine, but directs the demands it unveiled on December 17th at America. These include a ban on Ukraine ever joining NATO, and on the alliance conducting any more drills on Ukrainian territory. Mr Putin seems poised to send troops to fight and die in Ukraine if talks break down. The West has no such inclination. And no last-ditch donation of Western weaponry will fix the mismatch between Ukraine’s forces and Russia’s.And yet even the Ukrainians expecting war are going about their lives. Take Serhii Kolisnyk, an IT professional in Kyiv. In his home is a ready-packed bag that he can head off with in an instant. It contains clothes for winter and summer, along with military gadgetry and what he calls “NATO bullets”—5.56mm cartridges from Lithuania, the alliance’s standard ammunition. A bullet wound on Mr Kolisnyk’s chest from 2015, when he was fighting in Donetsk, attests to his sincerity. But for now he is concentrating on his work. “Otherwise you will lose yourself in thoughts and not get much done,” he says.The puzzle of how to prepare for war without tormenting oneself is a collective one. In Kyiv, streets and markets bustle. Nightly news channels seldom lead with worries over war. But preparations are afoot, and not always smooth. In hipper areas of the capital, old air-raid shelters that became fancy bars and cafés must prepare to become shelters again. A three-minute test of Kyiv’s sirens was expected on December 29th before authorities postponed it indefinitely the day before. A poorly presented plan ordering women in certain useful professions like IT to register with the armed forces sparked confusion, internet memes and a viral petition decrying it.Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, is not exactly uniting the country behind him. Polls suggest that few voters fancy him as a wartime leader. That may explain why his tussles with political foes have not ceased. The president predicted an oligarch-led coup against him in early December that failed to materialise. On December 20th his predecessor, Petro Poroshenko, was charged with treason over alleged payments for coal sourced from Ukraine’s occupied territories. (He denies any wrongdoing.)It is not only the spectre of war that haunts Ukraine, but also that of a new peace with new politics. Since its revolution of 2014 Ukraine has tried to reform its economy and armed forces, and buttress the rule of law. One motivation has been the lure of membership of NATO and the EU, which ask applicants to spruce up before joining. But a Russian invasion, or desperate compromises to avert one, could create a climate in which Ukrainians no longer believe the Western dream is possible. That might cause reform to stall.Politicians in Ukraine would like to feel in charge of their country’s fate. But their wish to throw their lot in with the West has prompted the Kremlin to dismiss them as puppets unworthy of direct communication. In an article published in October Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian prime minister and president, offered a preview of the regime’s negotiation strategy: “It makes no sense for us to deal with the vassals. Business must be done with the overlord.” Russia and America have agreed to bilateral talks, scheduled for January 9th-10th. There will be no Ukrainians in the room.That makes it hard for Mr Zelensky to adhere to his catchphrase: “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine”. His government claims to be untroubled by the talks, and the Western powers insist they are constantly consulting it. But Mr Zelensky might well be feeling the same impotence as Mr Sergienko in Vovchansk. 
31  FOR CENTURIES the main way to Galicia, Spain’s north-western corner, was on foot, on the pilgrims’ trail to Santiago de Compostela. Poor roads meant that, until a decade or two ago, the drive from Madrid took nine hours. Recent improvements have cut the trip to the closest Galician city, Ourense, to about five.Listen to this story.Now the journey can be made in two hours and 15 minutes thanks to Galicia’s first connection with Spain’s enviable high-speed railway network. Next year the line should be extended to Santiago, the regional capital, and A Coruña, its biggest city. “Cinderella can now travel in a bigger and more comfortable car,” said Ourense’s mayor, Gonzalo Pérez Jácome, using his nickname for his city, which he says is treated like an unloved stepchild. No one wants to be left out of the system—Spain has the biggest high-speed rail network in the world after China’s—but he doubts that the new extension will bring dramatic changes.Spaniards have long been leaving poorer rural areas for better opportunities in richer cities. Politicians in rural areas lament this. But it is not obvious that pricey infrastructure will do much to curb it. Mr Jácome notes that Zamora, until recently the high-speed trains’ last stop en route to Galicia, has gained weekend tourists but continued to lose population since their arrival in 2015.In any case, Galicia has been doing well. It was once a byword for isolation and poverty, “the end of the world”, as the name of its westernmost point, Cape Finisterre, indicates. So many Galicians emigrated that gallego is still synonymous with “Spaniard” in parts of Latin America. But GDP per person, 66% of the national average in 1955, is now 92% of it. Ángel de la Fuente of FEDEA, an economic think-tank, points to fish processing, carmaking and clothing (Inditex, the parent company of Zara and other brands, is based there) and reasonably business-friendly politics, though he says a single cause of its catch-up is hard to identify.Another fix for Spain’s regional disparities has been proposed by the Socialist-led national government: opening new state bodies outside the capital. Many bigwigs in the conservative People’s Party (PP) say this would be pointless. Galicia’s leader, the PP’s moderate Alberto Nuñez Feijóo, has a warmer reaction, noting that it makes little sense to put the country’s Institute of Oceanography in landlocked Madrid. Once, people would have said the same about putting world-conquering companies and ultra-modern trains in Galicia.
32  RUSSIAN HISTORY is rich in shameful dates, many of them marking show trials and mass executions—or liquidations, as they were then called. December 28th, 2021, should be added to the calendar. On that day Russia’s supreme court “liquidated” Memorial, the country’s most vital post-Soviet civic institution, dedicated to the memory of Stalinist repression and the defence of human rights.Listen to this story.Memorial emerged as a group independent of the state in the late 1980s, at the height of Mikhail Gorbachev’s policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (reconstruction). One of its founders was Arseny Roginsky, a historian who spent four years in a Soviet prison for publishing a samizdat almanac entitled Pamyat (“Memory”). Another was Andrei Sakharov, the nuclear scientist who created the first Soviet hydrogen bomb and later campaigned tirelessly for human rights.The group was formally registered in 1990, a few months after Sakharov’s death. The initial goal was historical, to document the crimes under Stalin. Every year Memorial ran a mass reading of the names of some of his millions of victims, read out by thousands of participants. As post-Soviet Russia began to abuse its citizens, first in Chechnya and then throughout the country, Memorial became the country’s best human-rights organisation.Russia’s supreme court is Kremlin-controlled, so its decision was expected. In recent years Memorial has increasingly come under attack, its offices vandalised and its staff harassed. But this did not make the court’s ruling less significant. Memorial paved the way for post-Soviet Russia, its embrace of human dignity drawing a line that separated the new state from the systemic terror of the old one. The group’s liquidation has erased that line, making it easier for Mr Putin to whitewash not only the crimes of the past but also those of the present. A day earlier, on December 27th, a Russian court extended the jail term of Yuri Dmitriev, a historian affiliated to Memorial who had uncovered mass graves in Stalin’s gulags, from 13 to 15 years. Prosecutors fabricated charges that he had sexually abused his adopted daughter.Formally, Memorial was liquidated as a “foreign agent”, an old Soviet term for traitors. The trial resurrected language once used by Stalinist prosecutors. “Memorial creates a false image of the Soviet Union as a terrorist state…Why should we, the descendants of the victors, watch attempts to rehabilitate traitors to the motherland and Nazi collaborators? Perhaps because someone is paying them for it,” proclaimed Aleksei Zhafyarov, a state prosecutor. “It makes us repent of the Soviet past, instead of remembering its glorious history.”The ruling fell on the centenary of Sakharov’s birth and on the 30th anniversary of the Soviet Union’s dissolution. In his farewell speech on December 25th, 1991, Mr Gorbachev proclaimed a new era when human rights would be treated as supreme: “We have paid with all our history and our tragic experiences for these democratic achievements—and they must not be abandoned, whatever the circumstances.”Yet unlike the de-Nazification of Germany, the process of de-Stalinisation was never enshrined in law. Nor have the crimes of the Soviet state ever been prosecuted. The KGB was renamed and re-organised, not abolished. The securocrats who rule Russia today wrap themselves in nostalgia for the great empire that defeated Hitler. Meanwhile, they gloss over the way it abused its own citizens, and copy some of its methods.“The liquidation of Memorial is...a message to the elites: ‘Yes, repressions were necessary and useful to the Soviet state in the past, and they are needed today,’” wrote Grigory Okhotin, who founded OVD-Info, a human-rights organisation. The state considers any form of independence a threat. OVD-Info, which uses social media to organise legal help for the victims of repression, has been labelled a foreign agent. Its website has been blocked.The ruling on Memorial signals a move by the government from limited, targeted repression to something much broader. Internet freedoms are being rolled back. On December 24th a Russian court slapped a $100m fine on Google for “systematic failures to remove banned content”—the largest fine directed at the Western tech giant and the first to be calculated on the basis of its annual revenue. Hours later the court fined Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, $27m.Repression requires an excuse. The Russian government’s favourite one is the threat of war. Its build-up of troops on the Ukrainian border in recent months is part of the propaganda offensive. The Kremlin accuses America, NATO and Ukraine of threatening Russia. It labels independent Russian politicians and civil-society groups such as Memorial as Western collaborators. The West is nervously watching for Russian military aggression beyond its borders. But the onslaught inside Russia is well under way, against its own people and their memory. 
33  SPANIARDS EAGERLY tuned in on December 22nd to watch the annual Christmas lottery, nicknamed el gordo (“the fat one”). Punters were hoping for a share of €2.4bn ($2.7bn) in prizes. The European Union, meanwhile, had placed a bet of its own. It hoped Spain’s politicians might go out of their way to win a national jackpot of €70bn, the country’s share of the EU’s €750bn covid recovery fund. The grants were conditional on reforms, especially in two worrisome areas: pensions and the jobs market. The government met the EU’s deadline of December 31st. Whether its reforms merit the name is another matter.Listen to this story.Spain’s government, made up of the Socialists and the far-left Unidas Podemos grouping, entered office in 2019 on a misguided pledge to repeal an earlier reform from 2012. Those changes had made layoffs cheaper and let unions strike wage deals within individual firms, rather than in industry-wide negotiations. This is thought to have aided Spain’s strong recoveries from the euro crisis and the pandemic. The package the government announced on December 23rd stopped short of repeal, but took no great steps forward either.The government’s goal was to make the labour market less unequal. Some Spaniards have good jobs and are nearly unsackable; others have temporary contracts and little security. The new proposal curbs time-limited contracts and tries to stop companies from evading the law by subcontracting. Promisingly, it would make permanent a pandemic-era measure in which the state pays temporarily furloughed workers. Both the unions and the employers’ organisation blessed the deal. But it contains no creative solutions to Spain’s high structural unemployment.The other big missed chance was fixing pensions. Spaniards retire young (at 60.7 on average), live long (83.5 years on average) and get generous pensions (80% of pre-retirement earnings against an average of 62% in the OECD, a club mostly of rich countries). Spain has yet to feel the full strain of these promises because its baby boom came late. But the crunch will come. A reform passed earlier this year merely offered inducements to postpone retirement and increased contributions slightly (by 0.1 percentage points of salary paid by workers, and 0.5 paid by employers). That is not nearly enough.The European Commission is now in theory to judge whether Spain’s reforms are sufficient to release the next tranche of money. No one expects a thumbs-down: the commission does not want to deliver a shock to the EU’s fourth-biggest economy in the midst of a pandemic. The money will be put to some good uses, primarily greening and digitising the economy. But the chance to use it to fund bigger reforms has been lost, at least for now. Like punters who bet on el gordo, the EU must hope future years bring more luck. 
34  IN TIMES OF trouble, it is good to have something to lean on. For a currency this can be a central bank capable of keeping inflation at bay, or a stable and predictable government to reassure nervous investors. Since today’s Turkey has neither, its swooning currency, the lira, has had to look elsewhere for help. On December 20th President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced an unorthodox plan to rescue Turkey’s economy from the crisis his policies have caused. It involves the government insuring some lira deposits against swings in the exchange rate.Listen to this story.In the short term the scheme seemed to have worked. The day after Mr Erdogan’s announcement the lira staged a record rebound, quickly erasing a month’s worth of losses. Yet the main factor in the rally was not the deposit-insurance programme but the central bank, which spent billions of dollars from its shrinking reserves to buy lira. The currency’s recovery has bought some time for Mr Erdogan, who had been in deep political trouble. But it has only obscured, or even heightened, the risks to Turkey’s economy.The immediate source of those risks is Mr Erdogan’s obsession with low interest rates. For years he has insisted, in defiance of basic economics, that low rates reduce inflation rather than stoke it. Starting in September, with Turkish inflation nearing 20%, Mr Erdogan goaded the central bank into cutting its base rate four times, from 19% down to 14%. That triggered a currency crash. Even after its recent rally, the lira has lost almost 40% against the dollar in 2021, more than any other major currency.Mr Erdogan maintains that a weak lira will be good for Turkey’s economy, boosting exports and attracting investors. Few Turks agree. In a recent poll, 94% said depreciation has had a negative impact. About two in three said they could not meet basic needs without taking out loans. Even more think inflation is far higher than the officially reported rate of 21%.Fast-rising food and energy prices hit the poor especially hard, since they spend a bigger share of their earnings on necessities. There are long queues at shops selling subsidised bread. Real wages have plummeted. Turkey’s middle class, which swelled during Mr Erdogan’s first decade in power, is shrinking. One chef at an Istanbul restaurant says he took out a cash loan in September to stock up on nappies for his infant child, fearing they would soon be unaffordable. Since then their price has more than doubled.Mr Erdogan would never describe it as such, but his scheme to save the lira is in effect an indirect rate rise for savers. Under the plan, Turkey’s government will compensate holders of fixed-term lira deposits when the currency’s depreciation against hard currencies exceeds the interest rate offered by their banks. Were the dollar to strengthen by 30% against the lira in a year, for example, a depositor at a bank with a 14% annual rate would get an additional 16% courtesy of Turkey’s treasury. The Turkish taxpayer will end up bailing out the Turkish depositor.The scheme may have helped prevent a run on the banks. Turks had been converting their savings to dollars at a record pace, contributing to the lira’s fall. More than 60% of the country’s deposits are now held in foreign currencies. Some were considering fleeing Turkey’s banks altogether. “People had begun to lose trust in the banking system,” says Ozlem Derici Sengul, founding partner at Spinn Consulting in Istanbul. “The decision stopped this.”Yet the rally had less to do with confidence in Mr Erdogan’s plan than with interventions by Turkish lenders. Since the start of December, Turkey’s central bank has burned through at least $20bn in foreign reserves to prop up the currency, sometimes acting itself and sometimes through state-owned commercial banks. In the two days surrounding Mr Erdogan’s announcement Turkish banks bought $7bn-worth of lira.Regardless of its effectiveness, the new scheme is a big risk for public finances. If a large portion of Turkey’s roughly $300bn-worth of private savings moves to guaranteed deposits, a sharply falling currency could put the state on the hook for hundreds of billions of lira. “The system may implode when faced with an exchange-rate or risk-premium shock,” says Hakan Kara, the central bank’s former chief economist.Standard economics would have Turkey raise interest rates to bring down inflation and stabilise exchange rates. But that looks less likely than ever. Mr Erdogan has dug in his heels, ignoring pleas from economists and business groups and invoking an Islamic injunction against usury to justify his eccentric policy.Loyal media outlets have proclaimed Mr Erdogan’s move a masterstroke, and the government has ways of discouraging sceptics from speaking up. On December 27th Turkey’s banking regulator filed criminal charges against Durmus Yilmaz, a former central-bank governor, and at least 25 others for criticising monetary policy and for other statements it disliked. Mr Yilmaz had accused the president of turning the country into a “laboratory” for crackpot ideas. But other critics are beyond the reach of Mr Erdogan’s enforcers. At a press conference on December 23rd, Vladimir Putin defended the Russian central bank’s recent rate increases. Without them, he said, “we could end up like Turkey.” 
35  GERMAN IS A thorough language. Almost every concept seems to be covered by a single compound word. There is Kummerspeck, or the weight one puts on if sad. Torschlusspanik is for the worry that your life is running out and opportunities slipping away. Most satisfyingly, there is Backpfeifengesicht for when someone has a slappable face. When it comes to the EU, a compound word pops up repeatedly: Schicksalsgemeinschaft, or a community of fate. Olaf Scholz, the new German chancellor, used the phrase when explaining why Germany must help its neighbours in the pandemic. His predecessor, Angela Merkel, was a fan too. Now, however, the concept—if not the tongue-twisting word—is spreading beyond the German-speaking world.Listen to this story.An acceptance among Europe’s leaders and voters that the continent’s fate is bound together has been the main shift of the two years your departing columnist has spent writing this column. Residual objections to the idea melted during the pandemic. A long-standing refusal to issue common debt was reversed. (Mrs Merkel once said common debt would not happen in her lifetime. She is, at time of writing, fighting fit.) Even the most sovereignty-obsessed governments, such as Poland’s, were happy to make the EU responsible for sorting out the continent’s vaccines in a new constitutional frontier.That the problems facing individual countries required a continental response became obvious. An effective climate policy can be orchestrated only at a supranational level. No European country is big enough to deal with China, or even Russia, alone. Most importantly, the acceptance of Schicksalsgemeinschaft has transformed European politics. Until recently, leaders trod lightly on each other’s turf lest theirs be trampled by others. In a community of fate, however, everything is everyone else’s business.Part of the reason for the shift is simple: money. Supervision is the price for solidarity. In the summer of 2020, leaders signed off a recovery fund of €750bn ($850bn) paid for with common debt, with half of it given as grants rather than loans to needy countries. Dutch taxpayers’ money is spent in Italy; German cash is in Polish coffers. It is only natural that they pay attention to how it is spent.The spectre of Schicksalsgemeinschaft has been summoned before. Mrs Merkel used it during the euro-zone crisis, when explaining why loans worth hundreds of billions to stricken southern European economies were necessary. But that was different. Lending a friend money is one thing. Not expecting it back—as is the case with €390bn of the €750bn—is another. Legally, the scheme is a one-off. In principle, however, the red lines have been erased. It has been used once and it can be used again.When money is shared, so is politics. The EU has become domestic politics by other means. During the pandemic, politicians went over the heads of their peers and started appealing directly to each other’s voters. Giuseppe Conte, then Italy’s prime minister, appeared in Dutch newspapers begging for aid. Mark Rutte, his Dutch counterpart, appeared in Italian newspapers, explaining why it would not be forthcoming (until he shifted). During the euro-zone crisis, such interventions were a novelty. Now they are the norm. If voters in other countries have a say, it makes sense to try to sway them.Fears about the EU falling apart are no more. The club will not break apart by accident. If anything, the EU is antifragile: it emerges sturdier from every crisis (by plugging holes already filled in other polities). Nor is leaving an appetising option. Britain, the country that most firmly resisted the idea of any common European destiny, botched its departure. Even the most Eurosceptic politicians have given up on leaving. Questions are no longer existential, but political.Being stuck together brings problems, of course. Troublesome members, such as Poland, have no intention of leaving. Britain pursued a clean Brexit, ripping up the rules that bound it to the continent; Poland is opting for a dirty remain, hanging around and ignoring strictures it does not like. Grinding out consensus is the only option. The flipside is that bad behaviour can no longer be ignored. Most leaders spent the bulk of the 2010s politely avoiding the topic of democratic backsliding in Hungary and Poland. Now the sight of, say, Dutch politicians chiding Polish ones is common.Stuck in the middle with EUA community of fate is not necessarily a community of peace. Rows between EU countries will become nastier as they switch from economics to deeper questions of values. The EU finds itself resolving whether banning a headscarf in a business is a defence of secular values, or an assault on religious freedom. At a summit this summer leaders gave Viktor Orban a tongue-lashing for proposing a homophobic law. It is precisely because they are stuck together that feelings run so high. A family fight is always more painful than one with colleagues.Those outside the community have an even rougher time. Talk of “Western” values has been replaced by “European” ones. Leaders such as Emmanuel Macron play up transatlantic splits. The differences between Europe and America are so large, he suggests, that they are best thought of as separate civilisations with distinct worldviews, whether on capitalism or le wokisme. A club that was once evangelical is now defensive. An impermeable border, guarded in places by the EU’s own border agency, is a policy with universal support among members.As the EU solidifies into something resembling a normal state, with border guards, debts, currency and, increasingly, shared politics, it will be a civilisation-state rather than a nation-state. Europe has always needed an “other”, an outsider to judge itself against. Now it has the rest of the world. Most of the continent’s politicians bridle at nationalism. But they are happy with the Europeanism that has replaced it. 
36  THE OSMANGAZI suspension bridge, one of the world’s longest, opened in 2016, stretching nearly 2,700 metres over the Marmara Sea. Combined with a new road, it has halved the travel time between Istanbul and Izmir, Turkey’s largest and third-largest cities. But for many Turks, the country’s currency crisis has made the crossing unaffordable. A driver making the trip every day for a month would have to pay tolls amounting to twice the minimum wage. The toll will rise again at the start of 2022.Listen to this story.Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has decked out his country with scores of new bridges, tunnels, airports and hospitals. Most are public-private partnerships (PPPs), deals whereby companies construct and operate infrastructure in exchange for fees from consumers or payments from state coffers. The lira’s slide over the past year has dramatically raised the cost of PPPs to taxpayers. The government guarantees companies involved in such projects a minimum level of income, almost invariably in hard currency. Such guarantees amount to a total of $150bn in the coming two decades, estimates Ugur Emek, an academic at Baskent University in Ankara. At the start of 2021, that was equivalent to 1.1trn lira. By late December, it had risen to 1.7trn lira.PPPs often make economic sense. In Turkey and elsewhere, they have a better record of avoiding delays and cost overruns than conventional public procurement. They have helped Turkish construction companies accumulate know-how and capital. Many projects, including sprawling hospitals that opened just in time before the covid-19 pandemic, have been a success.But the same few companies regularly walk away with the biggest contracts. Some projects are white elephants. “There’s an overreliance on PPPs,” says M. Coskun Cangoz, a former official at the World Bank now with TEPAV, a think-tank in Ankara. “We’re doing things in a less transparent way.”For Mr Erdogan, PPPs come with political benefits. He can take credit for launching big projects (a recent exhibit at his palace featured over 800 pairs of scissors and ribbons used for such occasions) and pretend that private companies shoulder the cost, since the investments do not show up as government debt. Defenders of PPPs say Turkey would not have been able to afford the new infrastructure by paying for it directly. But unless Mr Erdogan gets the economy back on track, Turks will pay dearly for his spending spree.
