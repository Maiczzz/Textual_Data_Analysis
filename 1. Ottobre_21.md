27  The UK and France remained at odds on Sunday over the deepening diplomatic spat on post-Brexit fishing rights, as both countries said the onus was on the other to find a solution.French president Emmanuel Macron and Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, held a 30-minute tête-à-tête on the margins of the G20 summit in Rome, but Downing Street and the Elysée Palace released contrasting statements on the meeting.Tensions over fishing rights have been simmering for months after the UK failed to issue permits for some small French boats to fish in British waters under the Brexit agreement.Paris on Wednesday announced it would increase customs and sanitary controls on freight, make stricter checks of trucks coming in and leaving France, and ban trawlers from landing their catch in French ports if the dispute was not resolved by Tuesday.“The ball is in Britain’s court,” Macron said at a press conference in Rome, saying that retaliatory measures would apply if London did not accept the “de-escalation” proposed by Paris.“We gave them a proposal. And so, if the British keep saying and acting like they don’t want to reach a deal, which was signed, and they don’t start to budge, then it will be regrettable. But we cannot help but respond and stand up for our fishermen.”French officials said earlier in the day that the leaders would work on “practical measures” in “the next few days” to promote a de-escalation in the fishing dispute.But Johnson’s spokesperson said “it’s down to France to decide if they want to step away from the deeply concerning threats”.The UK prime minister told Macron he hoped France would “de-escalate this rhetoric and withdraw their threats” to impose more onerous border checks, Downing Street said.Johnson also criticised France for a leaked official letter from French prime minister Jean Castex to Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, that Number 10 described as stating “the UK should be punished for leaving the EU”.Castex’s letter called on the EU to take further steps in the fishing row, acting in a “firm, united and proportional way”. “We must show clearly that respecting prior agreements is not negotiable and that leaving the EU causes more damage than staying in,” he wrote.Whitehall officials suggested that the letter had “ruined all trust” between the UK and France. One described it as “the punishment letter”.Speaking at a press conference in Rome, Johnson said he was “puzzled” by Castex’s letter. “I don’t believe that is compatible either with the spirit or the letter of the Withdrawal Agreement of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement [TCA],” he added.In an interview with the Financial Times on Friday, Macron warned that the international reputation of the UK was at stake in the dispute over fishing rights and warned that other nations were watching closely.“Make no mistake, it is not just for the Europeans but all of their partners,” Macron said. “Because when you spend years negotiating a treaty and then a few months later you do the opposite of what was decided on the aspects that suit you the least, it is not a big sign of your credibility.”France’s Europe minister, Clement Beaune, took to Twitter on Sunday to complain that “we do not lack just a few licences, but more than 40 per cent of French detailed requests”.“After 10 months, when such a significant amount of licences, targeting one country, is missing, it’s not a technical issue, it’s a political choice and a breach of the TCA,” he wrote.Lord David Frost, Johnson’s Brexit minister, said on Twitter on Saturday that the UK would launch dispute resolution proceedings if France implemented further checks on fishing vessels and at the border.The former UK ambassador to France, Lord Peter Ricketts, said he believed the relationship between France and the UK was at its lowest point in decades, surpassing the dispute over the Iraq war in 2003.“It’s a case of total collapse of confidence, after so many cases where the British government hasn’t respected its word,” he told the FT.“The prospect now is of real economic damage and a spiral downwards,” he said.
28  Brexit was billed as a win-win bonanza for Northern Ireland: access to not one but two single markets — the UK and the EU.Or as Maros Sefcovic, European Commission vice-president and EU Brexit negotiator, described the new arrangement, it offers the region “jam on both sides of their bread”.A poll by Queen’s University Belfast this week found the public increasingly agrees, with 52 per cent of respondents seeing the bespoke trading rules for Northern Ireland as “a good thing”, up from 43 per cent in June.But try telling that to some of the region’s fishermen.The new trade rules, which controversially introduced customs checks in the Irish Sea in order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, have left at least one UK seafood catcher and processor contemplating whether to cut the region out of its supply chain altogether.Whitby Scampi catches half its produce in Great Britain — the bulk in Scotland — and the other half in waters around the island of Ireland. It processes the tails in Northern Ireland and sends them to Britain for sale. But managing director Daniel Whittle is wondering if that route still makes sense because of post-Brexit veterinary inspections that he described as “utter madness” since they treat Northern Ireland as if it were outside the UK.“We don’t have a Scottish site currently. We could open a site and take part of the business — some or all of the processing — to Scotland,” he told the Financial Times. “We’re not committed to anything: we’re looking at the practical costs.”For the industry and the 1,200 people employed in Northern Ireland’s small fishing communities, that prospect represents an “existential threat,” according to Harry Wick, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fish Producers’ Organisation. for whom Whitby Scampi is its biggest client. “It could potentially finish us.”The region’s deal was cemented in the so-called Northern Ireland protocol of the UK’s withdrawal agreement struck with the EU that kept the region inside the EU’s customs union and single market for goods, despite the UK’s decision to leave.Because of grace periods, the protocol has not yet been applied in full, but already red tape and the UK’s refusal to accept key parts of what it signed up to, including oversight from the EU’s top court, have put it under severe strain.London has its finger on the trigger of Article 16, which would allow it to suspend as yet unspecified parts of the protocol, and says it is close to pulling it. Northern Irish unionist parties complain that an Irish Sea border undermines the region’s place in the UK and harms a landmark 1998 peace deal that ended the 30 years of sectarian strife known as the Troubles.Sefcovic, in turn, says he has extracted unprecedented concessions from some reluctant members of the 27-nation bloc to ease the tensions. But his new proposals presented last month — including an offer to slash checks on animal and plant-based products by 80 per cent and halve the customs paperwork — have largely been dismissed as insufficient in London.Not everyone is upset though. North-South trade has “absolutely boomed” since the protocol came into force, said Eddie Mullin, a director at EFL International, a haulage company. Irish data shows a 61 per cent rise in Northern Irish exports to the Republic from January to August compared with the same period last year.George Fleming, who can see the Republic of Ireland from the office of his machinery export business in Londonderry, also known as Derry, said: “We are finding things perfectly good . . . at the minute Northern Ireland is in a bit of a utopia.”“This family business is over 150 years old. We’ve come through the first world war, the second world war, the Troubles, BSE [mad cow disease], foot-and-mouth, currency crisis,” he said. “This is just a few politicians letting off a bit of steam . . . let them rattle away, we just get on with it.”He exports muck-spreaders, bale handling, storage and other equipment to the US, Australia, New Zealand and EU, as well as to Great Britain.Official statistics have yet to be published on trade this year between Northern Ireland and Great Britain but Fleming said it had become trickier, with some component suppliers in Britain thinking twice about sending goods to the region because of the extra hassle and red tape.Many of the challenges have been in the retail sector. The EU concessions cover allowing the free circulation of many foodstuffs across the Irish Sea, including chilled meats that would otherwise be banned from entering Northern Ireland since it remains within the bloc’s single market.“The commission’s proposals put a lot of emphasis on resolving the sausage wars, helping retailers . . . they aren’t able to allay my fears,” said Alan McCulla, chief executive of the Anglo North Irish Fish Producers’ Organisation, who said “every last bit” of his produce goes to Great Britain.For sensitive goods — for example, where the EU is concerned over biosecurity — there are potential workarounds, said Stephen Kelly, head of Manufacturing Northern Ireland, a lobby group.Those include shipping goods via Dublin and then trucking them to Northern Ireland, enabling produce such as citrus fruit to be exported under EU sanitary checks to prevent black spot blight. “It’s no more expensive and it overcomes the trust problems with the UK,” Kelly said.Many businesspeople fear the triggering of Article 16 will only create more instability. But Wick welcomed it if it could be used for political leverage “as a tool to solve problems”.Still, the clamour from business is for clear, long-term rules.As Noelle O’Connell, chief executive of European Movement Ireland, a European affairs non-profit organisation, put it: “Trade always finds the path of least Brexit resistance.”
29  President Joe Biden has said the US and EU are seeking ways to curb imports of “dirty steel” from China after Washington and Brussels put aside their own trade dispute.In a deal that was swiftly criticised by China, the US and EU have agreed to work jointly on a “global arrangement” to support sustainable steel and aluminium to reduce overcapacity and encourage greener production.It is part of a two-year ceasefire deal reached for the US to ease tariffs on European steel and aluminium. In return the European Commission has proposed to EU member states that they temporarily drop retaliatory tariffs, and pause legal action at the World Trade Organization.Speaking in Rome, Biden said the arrangement would “lift up US aluminum and steel . . . incentivise emission reductions in one of the most carbon intensive sectors of the global economy”.The deal would “restrict access to our markets for dirty steel from countries like China, and counter countries that dumped steel in our markets, hammering our workers,” Biden said at a press conference with Ursula von der Leyen, the commission president.Earlier Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU’s trade commissioner, told reporters the two sides would be “inviting like-minded economies to join this arrangement”. It would seek to tackle the longstanding problem of overproduction, which has led to tariff wars as countries protect their industries from cheap imports.“One of the elements we will be discussing will be how to restrict market access for non-participants that do not meet the conditions for the market,” he said. “We will do this [in a way that is] compatible with our international obligations and multilateral rules.”Doing so under WTO rules “is a challenge”, one EU official admitted.Dombrovskis noted there was already a Global Forum on steel excess capacity, but added that “due to the time that China has led this forum its efficiency may be somewhat limited”.China produces 56 per cent of the world’s steel, mostly through blast furnaces that use iron ore and coking coal. It was one of a handful of countries to increase output in 2020.The Chinese embassy in Washington said Beijing firmly opposed “the US groundless accusations”.“How the US develops its economic and trade relations with the EU is its own business. But it should not make an issue of China or even attempt to form a clique against China,” the embassy said. “We hope all sides can earnestly take effective measures to contribute to the orderly operation of the global market, and sound and steady growth of international trade.”As part of the deal between Washington and Brussels, the US has agreed to allow up to 4.4m tonnes of steel annually to enter from the EU tariff-free, in line with levels before President Donald Trump imposed tariffs under little-used national security legislation. Imports are half that level at present.The EU was threatening to double tariffs on products such as US whiskey in December without a deal.Dombrovskis said the agreement was “not an end destination . . . but a useful step on the road”.Von der Leyen said the global arrangement would help towards climate neutrality and ensuring a “level playing field” for the steel and aluminium industries. “Defusing yet another source of tension in the transatlantic trade partnership will help industries on both sides,” she said.The EU and US in June also paused a long-running dispute over subsidies given to aircraft makers Boeing and Airbus.Additional reporting by Sylvia Pfeifer in London
30  Disruptions to supply chains have been visible for a while in higher prices. Now they have firmly made their presence felt in both corporate earnings and growth data. US and eurozone figures at the end of last week demonstrated that bottlenecks are holding back production at factories — and slowing the pace of the recovery. That has had a knock-on effect on industrial giants such as Germany’s Volkswagen and California’s Apple. Both told investors that a global shortage of semiconductors had held back sales, leading them to miss out on around €500m and $6bn of profit respectively.For decades the goal of economic management, primarily delegated to central bankers, has been to keep the total amount of spending — or aggregate demand — growing in tandem with the capacity of the economy to provide the goods and services that consumers want, labelled aggregate supply. Keeping the two in balance is meant to preserve economic stability and stop price growth from accelerating, or decelerating, out of hand. The pandemic jolted both at the same time, reorientating consumer spending from services to goods that could still be enjoyed at home; closed gyms meant a scramble for exercise equipment, for example.Today’s bottlenecks are a demonstration that demand has recovered much more quickly than supply. That reflects, in part, the success of stimulus programmes, and the uneven fight against coronavirus. While mass vaccination efforts in Europe and the US have allowed for something approaching normal life to resume, in many developing Asian countries that produce the goods western consumers want, outbreaks have shut factories.Ultimately, this presents a challenge about which central bankers can do little. Inflation has risen and they have a legal duty to keep it under control. Consequently, many are beginning to scale back stimulus: on Friday the Australian central bank opted to cease defending its yield target for sovereign bonds, allowing the benchmark interest rate to start drifting upwards. It joins a club of major economies including New Zealand and Norway that have already started to tighten monetary policy. Investors expect the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to follow suit soon.While bringing demand down to match supply can keep price pressures in check, it is a much less satisfying solution — leading to lower growth and employment — than expanding supply. There are, however, no easy levers that policymakers can pull. While easy money and government spending can boost total demand, supply only grows slowly and governments have limited ability to influence it.Business investment is the one part of economic demand, at least in the US, that is still lagging. That is a shame. Capital spending is the best way to keep supply growing and prevent bottlenecks from recurring or shortages from becoming permanent. Easy monetary policy, however, appears to have done more to boost asset prices than investment in industrial equipment or commercial buildings.That could be down to the uncertain path of the recovery. Many businesses, just like central bankers, may be waiting to see whether the shortages are transitory or more permanent. Pulling the trigger on investment now could lead to excess capacity if they ease. Similarly if central banks tighten too quickly and demand is choked off, investment might be wasted. Generous tax relief for capital spending, along the lines of Britain’s “super deduction”, should be considered more widely. The best way to avoid bottlenecks is to get a wider bottle.
31  In the long and (in)glorious history of Anglo-French maritime hostilities, a bad-tempered spat over access to fishing grounds in the Channel should merit nothing more than a brief footnote, if that. Britain and France have much in common and many interests that are closely aligned. But the dispute over a few dozen fishing licences is absurdly being blown out of proportion by both sides for small-minded political ends. A small argument could escalate into a damaging trade war and poison the broader ties between Britain and the EU. There are bigger problems in the world that call for Franco-British co-operation.Fishing was always predicted to be one of the most hotly disputed issues in Britain’s divorce from the EU, and so it has proved. The French and British governments are at loggerheads over the granting of licences to French vessels operating in the UK’s 6-12 mile waters and those around Jersey. Under the terms of last December’s EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, French boats seeking continued access to these seas must have fished there in recent years. The contention is over the degree of proof French skippers need to show, especially around the Channel Islands. The French government believes the requirements have been made impossible for some to meet. Scores of French boats have been denied access, although many others have been licensed.Incensed by the continuing delays — and the lack of dialogue over the process — Paris has vowed to retaliate. Unless there is progress by November 2, it says it will ban UK boats from landing their catches in French ports, step up controls on British boats and on lorries entering France, potentially snarling up trade routes. It also threatened to “review” electricity supplies to Britain and pressed Brussels to trigger trade penalties against the UK.The French threats are excessive, provocative and probably of dubious legality. They extracted a few more licences from the Jersey authorities but not enough to defuse the stand-off. Prime minister Boris Johnson has demanded France drop its ultimatum and London has threatened to hit back with its own checks on French boats and with legal action.The problem is that for both Johnson and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron confrontation seems to offer a bigger political dividend than de-escalation. The UK prime minister seems to be doing everything to keep Brexit wounds open. Nothing pleases his tabloid cheerleaders more than a fight with the French and it provides a useful diversion from shortages and rising costs at home. It is hard to see him changing tack.The French president, meanwhile, is under pressure to stand up for French fishermen, a noisy lobby, with strong political support in north and western France. He faces re-election in April, and the nationalist right is setting the tone of the campaign. Macron is still smarting at the Australia-UK-US nuclear submarine deal. It was a major strategic setback for Paris but was celebrated in London, its most important military ally in Europe, as a feat of one-upmanship.Paris is understandably contemptuous about Johnson’s refusal to honour his Brexit deal commitments in relation to Northern Ireland. On fishing rights, it feels it has the means to hold the UK to its promises. Disruption to cross-Channel trucking from onerous checks could cause real economic damage. The risk is it goes too far and Britain overreacts. Other EU countries are reluctant to allow the entire relationship to be defined by the interests of French scallopers and trawlermen, but sympathy for the UK in other EU capitals is in short supply. Paris and London need to negotiate a way of out of this tit-for-tat trap. There is too much at stake.This article has been updated to reflect the latest on this story
32  The morning after António Costa’s minority government collapsed last week, Portugal’s prime minister crossed the border for scheduled talks with Pedro Sánchez, his Spanish counterpart and fellow socialist.Portugal was “an example of stability” and Costa possessed a capacity for dialogue and reaching agreements shared by few other prime ministers in Europe, Sánchez said.That praise will ring hollow this week as Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, Portugal’s president, prepares to dissolve parliament and call an election two years ahead of schedule after Costa failed to persuade the far left to support his 2022 budget.After sparking hope among Europe’s flagging centre-left parties by showing that overturning austerity in the wake of the sovereign debt crisis was not incompatible with EU fiscal rules or stability, Costa now faces a snap election that could leave Portugal without a clear government option.“It’s difficult to see how an election will clarify things, rather than making the situation even more unstable and volatile,” said Francisco Pereira Coutinho, a professor of constitutional law at Lisbon’s Universidade Nova.Concern is also growing that far-right populists will make gains in the election, complicating coalition building and damaging the image of a country that had prided itself on being a European haven untroubled by such political movements.Pereira Coutinho said Chega, a rightwing populist party whose name means “enough”, was likely to increase its share of the vote “enormously” from currently having only one deputy. “Chega has the most to gain from this crisis and the way that affects the election outcome could create difficulties,” he warned.Costa, the leader of one of Europe’s strongest socialist parties, has impressed his centre-left peers by forging an unorthodox path to power and making it work.In striking a pact between his mainstream Socialists (PS) and the far left in 2015, he brought Portugal six years of stability despite having a minority government. Sánchez followed his example four years later by entering into a government coalition with the anti-austerity Podemos party.But the Portuguese alliance that sought to reconcile EU fiscal rules with Marxist-Leninism collapsed last week when the anti-capitalist Left Bloc (BE) and the hardline Communist party (PCP) sided with right-of-centre opposition to vote down Costa’s budget bill.Seeing no electoral gains for their support and frustrated by the limits imposed by EU fiscal rules, the BE and PCP began distancing themselves from the PS after Costa was re-elected to a second term in 2019, failing for a second time to win an outright majority.Unlike Sánchez, Costa has been unwilling to bring his radical partners into government and failed to renew the written pacts between them after 2019, relying only on regular talks to ensure their backing.But after months of difficult negotiations and last-minute pleas, he failed to convince the BE and PCP to accept a budget that the PS claimed to be the most leftwing in recent history.Pedro Siza Vieira, economy minister, blamed the BE and PCP for throwing away a golden opportunity. “Never before in our democracy have the parties to the left of the PS had so much capacity to influence the government’s agenda, nor has a budget been so influenced by their ideas,” he said in the debate.The PS argues that by rejecting the budget bill and triggering a political crisis, the far-left parties have refused to take responsibility for shaping the country’s future in favour of returning to the protest fringe of politics.Catarina Martins, the BE leader, however, said the leftwing pact, known as the geringonça, meaning “bizarre contraption”, had been “killed off by [Costa’s] obsession with winning an absolute majority”.The prime minister, now governing in a caretaker capacity, will try for a third time to achieve that goal in the election expected in February, promising a leftwing platform and the same budget.On the basis of current polling, however, he will fall short, with the PS emerging as the largest party, but without an overall majority, a difficult feat for any party under Portugal’s proportional voting system.Deprived of backing from the BE and PCP, Costa could face the dilemma of having to enter into a coalition with the centre-right opposition — an option he has ruled out as preventing any alternation of power — or accepting a right-of-centre government dependent on support from Chega.“To avoid being seen as ungovernable, Portugal will need to take a German-style approach to discussing ‘grand’ or other formal coalitions,” said Pereira Coutinho. “Our parliamentary arithmetic will have to be much more creative.”
33  As the French government signals a future where nuclear power will play an integral role in achieving carbon neutrality for the country by 2050, its state-controlled energy giant EDF remains encumbered by its past.Positioned at the heart of the nuclear debate in France and Europe, EDF struggles under a debt-laden balance sheet and a reputation for being unable to make novel nuclear technologies on time and on budget.But now President Emmanuel Macron has extended an olive branch and seemingly cleared a path for it to expand internationally and attract much-needed investment.Macron — whose government has dressed down EDF for cost overruns and delays on one of its French reactor projects, and paused a much-hyped restructuring of the utility — recently announced a €1bn investment in research into small modular reactors (SMRs), a new technology garnering interest around the world.Meanwhile, government officials have also signalled Macron could announce the go-ahead for at least six large reactors before the end of the year — previously the decision wasn’t expected until well after a presidential election next April.“This is certainly a very positive moment for nuclear,” said Xavier Ursat, executive director and head of new nuclear projects at EDF.“This year, everything has become concrete.”Created in 1946 by General Charles de Gaulle, EDF holds emotional power in France, Europe’s last bastion of nuclear power, and is linked with the nation’s industrial past and future.For years it was unclear if Macron, under pressure to move away from nuclear power towards renewables, would give the green light to new reactors long called for by EDF. Shortly after coming to power, Macron committed to reducing nuclear’s share of France’s electricity production from 75 to 50 per cent by 2035.However, ambitious European climate goals, which hinge on pivoting to forms of energy that emit less carbon than fossil fuels, have put the spotlight on nuclear again and handed France an opportunity to assert its dominance in the field.For EDF, thawing state tensions and confirmation of France’s desire for a nuclear future bring increased visibility to ensure it can keep training and hiring the people it will need and attract investment.That will be no small task for a company saddled with €41bn of debt and a colossal maintenance and investment programme to fund. UBS estimates a total investment requirement of more than €100bn for it to secure a 20-year life extension for 80 per cent of its nuclear fleet.If approved, any government subsidies to fund six new reactors — estimated in leaked documents in 2019 to cost around €47bn — and the final price of the nuclear power produced by them, will ultimately be given the green light by Brussels.The cost of this funding could also be influenced by whether or not the EU includes nuclear energy in its taxonomy on “green finance”, making it a more attractive investment prospect. That decision has been delayed indefinitely because of infighting in the EU.“Whether we can get financing at a low rate or super high rates completely changes the final cost. That’s the real subject, behind the gross number,” said Ursat.EDF faces other hurdles too, including the failure to reach a compromise with Brussels over the restructuring of the utility that would have allowed it to raise the regulated price at which it sells nuclear energy and ringfence some of its activities.It also needs to show it can deliver on its next-generation European Pressurised Reactor (EPR) technology, which it is planning to sell to India, Poland and the Czech Republic.EPR reactors under construction in Europe — including Flamanville in France and Hinkley Point in the UK — are billions over budget and years behind schedule. The company’s previous chief financial officer quit over concerns about strains Hinkley Point was putting on EDF’s balance sheet.These setbacks have led some investors and analysts to question EDF’s strategy and growth in the risky and costly field of nuclear power, were it not more than 80 per cent owned by the French government.“The new reactor at Flamanville is not up and running yet, and some will want to see that project completed before France commits to more reactors with the same design,” said Sam Arie, an analyst at UBS. “From an investor point of view, is there interest in new nuclear projects? Not really.”However, recent soaring energy prices coupled with stringent climate goals seemed to have turned the tide in EDF’s favour.France’s cheapest pathway to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050 would involve building 14 new reactors, according to a report last Monday from French grid operator RTE, with other options that rely more heavily on expanding solar and wind energy production implying greater costs.Under the scenarios RTE presented, even if France were to reduce its current share of nuclear power in the electricity mix from 70 to 26 per cent by 2050, it would still have to build eight new reactors. If it built no new nuclear reactors and relied exclusively on building renewables and extending the lifespan of existing nuclear, this would cost €10bn more per year than options including new reactors.Recent rising energy prices have also brought a windfall for EDF. The cost of producing nuclear and renewable energy has remained constant but about 30 per cent of the company’s electricity is exposed to market prices.The rest of EDF’s electricity is sold at a fixed rate — much below current global market prices — meaning that French households and businesses have been shielded from the sharpest edge of soaring energy prices.Analysts at UBS have forecast EDF could make an extra €4 or €5 per megawatt hour (MWh) in 2022, which could create an extra €3bn in revenue.“EDF is a big winner in this energy crisis,” said Denis Florin, partner at Lavoisier Conseil, an energy-focused management consultancy. “They dramatically wanted these EPRs, and they really want money for research into SMRs. This is Macron’s reconciliation with EDF.”Meanwhile, France will act as the shop window for exports of the new SMR technology — billed to be less powerful but easier to produce and run than conventional reactors — with EDF expected to begin building its first “Nuward” reactor in nine years.The idea is for these mini-plants to be built in pairs, between them able to produce 340MW — the equivalent of old high carbon-emitting coal, oil and gas plants around the world that will reach the end of their lifespan in the next 20 years.“That is the market we are targeting, and for this market you have to be ready in 2030,” Ursat said.
34  The US and the EU have agreed to ease tariffs on billions of dollars of steel and aluminium products in a bid to resolve a trade dispute that has hung over transatlantic relations since the Trump administration.“We have agreed with the US to pause our steel and aluminium [section 232] trade dispute and launch co-operation on a Global Arrangement on Sustainable Steel and Aluminium,” said Valdis Dombrovskis, EU trade commissioner. He said Joe Biden, US president, and Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, would give more details on Sunday.The Biden administration and the EU have been negotiating a settlement on steel and aluminium trade for months. Former president Donald Trump imposed tariffs on metals products under little-used national security legislation in 2018.The agreement puts in place a system of tariff-rate quotas, which will allow exports of metals between the EU and the US with lower levies up to a certain volume.The EU was set to increase retaliatory tariffs on US goods from December 1, having paused action in May to allow time for negotiations.The deal was announced on Saturday during the G20 summit in Rome, in an arrangement US officials said would reduce global carbon emissions and Chinese overcapacity in the sector, while easing supply chain bottlenecks in the metals industry.US trade representative Katherine Tai said that in addition to the EU eliminating retaliatory tariffs against the US, “we have agreed to suspend the WTO disputes against each other related to the 232 disputes”.“Going forward, the US and the EU will analyse the volume of steel and aluminium imports from the EU each year, share information and best practices on trade remedies, and ensure that products from non-market economies do not benefit from the arrangement,” she said.Tai told reporters that the agreement “also addresses global overcapacity from China and toughens enforcement mechanism to prevent leakage of Chinese and other unfairly traded steel and aluminium into the US market”.The EU was under huge pressure from steelmakers to get the tariffs lifted. An EU official said the US would allow in at least as much steel as before the tariffs.The US bought around 3.2m tonnes annually from the EU before the tariffs and that has dropped by a third since.The deal mirrors those struck with Canada and Mexico, who agreed to limit steel imports in return for the lifting of tariffs.Kevin Dempsey, president and CEO of the American Iron and Steel Institute, an association of US metals producers that was supportive of the tariffs, said he appreciated “the Biden administration’s continued recognition that the American steel industry is critical to our national and economic security”.But he warned: “Proper implementation and enforcement of the [tariff rate quotas] will be crucial to ensuring that the new measures are effective in meeting these critical objectives.”US spirits producers, which had been hit by retaliatory tariffs in connection with the dispute, were thrilled. “With the removal of these EU tariffs, we are energised and ready to ramp up our American Whiskey promotions in the EU to reintroduce America’s native spirits to EU consumers and resume a great American export success story,” Distilled Spirits Council President Chris Swonger said.Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, told reporters the deal removed “one of the largest bilateral irritants in the US-EU relationship”. “The agreement, ultimately, to negotiate a carbon-based arrangement on steel and aluminium trade addresses both Chinese overproduction and carbon intensity in the steel and aluminium sector; it shows that we can solve the climate crisis while at the same time better protecting our workers,” he said.US commerce secretary Gina Raimondo said the two sides agreed in order to “face our shared challenge, which is global excess capacity, mainly by China”. She added many US businesses would not have survived a “crippling” 50 per cent retaliatory EU tariff due on some sectors from December 1.The deal received some early backing on Capitol Hill. “Working together, the US and EU can successfully fight back against China’s predatory economic policies and ensure American workers succeed,” said Ron Wyden, the chair of the Senate finance committee, which has jurisdiction over trade.“Continuing to strengthen the US-EU relationship is essential to combat China’s efforts to take over entire industries and leave American workers in the lurch,” he added.
35  Emmanuel Macron warned Boris Johnson on Friday that the international reputation of the UK is on trial in the Brexit disputes over fishing rights and Northern Ireland.In an interview with the Financial Times, the president of France said that for Johnson, the UK prime minister, and his government the issues represented “a test of their credibility”. Although Macron said he was sure of “goodwill” on the British side, he warned that other nations were watching closely.“Make no mistake, it is not just for the Europeans but all of their partners. Because when you spend years negotiating a treaty and then a few months later you do the opposite of what was decided on the aspects that suit you the least, it is not a big sign of your credibility,” he said.The French president’s comments followed warnings from British ministers of retaliation if cross-channel freight is disrupted by onerous border checks threatened by Paris from Tuesday in a dispute over fishing licences. The UK and EU are also struggling to resolve disputes over the Northern Ireland protocol that covers post-Brexit trade on the island of Ireland.Tensions over fishing rights have been simmering for months after the UK failed to issue permits for some small French boats to fish in British waters under the Brexit agreement. Paris on Wednesday announced it would increase customs and sanitary controls on freight, make stricter checks of trucks coming in and leaving France, and ban trawlers from landing their catch in French ports if the dispute was not resolved.A British trawler was seized and taken to the port of Le Havre on Thursday after the French authorities said it was operating without a licence. Another vessel has been fined. The UK’s Foreign Office summoned the French ambassador in London to discuss the situation with junior minister Wendy Morton on Friday afternoon.Macron told the FT there had been “no provocation, no tension” over fishing rights, but added “we need to respect each other and respect the word that has been given”.The president said he had “never created pointless controversy” with post-Brexit disputes. But he said the fishing issues were “important” for France and the UK. “We are talking about the life of our citizens.”Johnson said he was “puzzled” by France’s threats, adding he would “do whatever is necessary to ensure UK interests”. The prime minister said he would be “surprised” if Paris sought to disrupt cross-channel trade but did not rule out revoking fishing licenses for vessels in British waters.Officials in London fear the dispute could spiral into a full-blown trade war with France if post-Brexit checks are stepped up at Calais, further disrupting supply chains.One British diplomat said: “I’m worried that London may not be taking seriously the French threat to choke the flow of freight and let empty shelves put pressure on the British.” Another added: “I’m not surprised at French action since we have been playing hardball.”The UK is already facing trade disruption because of its decision to leave the EU. The country’s budget watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, forecast this week that Brexit would drive a four per cent decline in the UK’s long-term productivity, relative to remaining in the EU. It also predicted total UK imports and exports will “eventually” be 15 per cent lower than if Britain had remained in the EU.Lord David Frost, the UK’s Brexit minister, on Friday met European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic for talks over changes to the Northern Ireland protocol. However, there was little sign of progress, with a commission spokesman saying: “It is now essential to find common ground between the EU and UK’s respective positions.”Asked what France would do if Britain followed through on a suggestion by Frost that it could suspend parts of the protocol unilaterally using a mechanism known as Article 16, Macron declined to comment directly.“We cannot play with this. It’s too dangerous,” he said of Northern Ireland. “There have been too many people killed.”Johnson and Macron are set to speak on the sidelines of this weekend’s G20 summit in Rome to try to resolve the dispute.Additional reporting by Laura Hughes
36  President Emmanuel Macron has warned that an energy crisis threatens the world’s post-pandemic recovery, calling for leaders at a G20 summit in Rome this weekend to work together to stabilise supplies.In an interview, the French president also urged bigger financial commitments towards the fight against global warming on the eve of the COP26 climate summit in Scotland, and for particular attention to be paid to a deal to phase out coal power.The G20 needed to co-ordinate between energy producers and consuming countries to prevent a supply breakdown this winter, which risked “extreme tensions both economically and socially”, Macron said.“In the coming weeks and months, we need to get better visibility and stability on prices so tension on the energy prices doesn’t generate uncertainties, and undermine the global economic recovery, ” he told the Financial Times in the Elysée Palace. “What we expect is to have co-ordination to avoid soaring prices.” Global energy costs have surged this year, disrupting industry and hitting consumers with higher prices. Eurozone inflation surged in October to a 13-year-high of 4.1 per cent, according to a flash estimate published by the EU’s statistics arm on Friday.“I don’t think we’re going to be able to lower prices given tensions on the demand side,” Macron said. “But what we need to avoid is to have a break in supply [and further] increases in prices, particularly as we’re moving into the winter period for the northern hemisphere.”Rapid economic recovery from the pandemic has pushed up energy prices “almost too rapidly” which risked “weighing on economic growth and putting a burden on households”, Macron said.France and a number of other EU governments have sought to protect consumers and businesses with billions in aid and price freezes.Concerns have mounted that Russia’s state-backed gas producer Gazprom has kept storage levels unusually low in western Europe, exacerbating fears over supplies and driving up prices.Asked whether he blamed high European energy prices on Russia, Macron said: “I have no evidence that there’s been manipulation of prices and I’m not accusing anybody. These are trading relations. They shouldn’t be used for geopolitical reasons.” Asked about Gazprom’s power over Europe, Macron said: “It’s not a matter of whether we’re too dependent on a company or not, it’s how do we create alternatives. And the only alternatives are to have European renewables and of course, European nuclear.”France is the EU’s biggest user of nuclear power, contrasting with a move away from atomic power by Germany and some other countries.Macron called for Europe to develop a more diverse gas supply but also to speed up a transition away from fossil fuels, which will be necessary to slow rising temperatures and tame the climate disruptions caused by global warming.“What is happening now is ironic, because we are building a system where in the medium and long term fossil energy will cost more and more, that’s what we want [to fight climate change],” he said. “The problem is that industries and households will need to be accompanied in this transition . . . or it won’t be sustainable.”The French president, who is facing national elections in April, has been a vocal advocate of multilateralism. He has pushed for more co-operation globally and at EU level to reach deals on issues including international taxation and global warming.Against a backdrop of global tensions, a supply chain crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic, Macron said the G20 had a responsibility to work together, especially to help low-income countries. He urged leaders at the Rome summit to agree a plan for faster vaccine delivery to developing countries.“France has always stressed the importance of maintaining multilateralism, but we have to get concrete results from it,” he said.The leaders of China, Russia and Japan will not attend the summit in Rome in person this weekend because of Covid-19 concerns and an election in Japan.Macron said the G20 meeting, which is being hosted by Italian leader Mario Draghi on the eve of COP26, would also give countries a chance to hammer out more ambitious plans to fight climate change.“When we’ll be meeting in Rome, the major challenge is to ensure that members of G20 can usefully contribute in Glasgow, to making this COP26 a success,” he said. “Nothing can be taken for granted before a COP,” he added.“The first subject for the G20 is to accelerate the exit from coal power,” he said. G20 leaders expect a heated debate this weekend over including a pledge to end international coal financing.“We need the G20 to go right through to the eradication of all international financing of coal-fired power plants,” Macron said.Macron also called for rich countries, particularly the US, to commit more financially to help developing countries meet their climate goals. And he called on China to bring forward the date at which it will peak emissions, from 2030, to 2025.“So as not to lose more time, we have to do as much as is absolutely possible in terms of financing, and encourage the US administration so that they can convince Congress to front-load its financing.”Another issue will be to hold countries to their emissions targets for 2030 and 2050. “Our objective is to get maximum results from all countries,” he said. “This pathway is possible, even if it’s a challenge, especially for emerging countries which at the same time are trying to recover from the Covid crisis.”Macron also urged the G20 leaders to do more to help vaccinate the world against Covid-19. The group should end vaccine export bans, increase its donations of vaccine doses, and support vaccine production in Africa, he said.“Every French person has given one vaccine to somebody else in the world,” he said, referring to the roughly 60m doses that were on the way to Covax, the World Health Organisation’s procurement scheme for low-income countries. “If everybody in the G20 could do that we would get to the 20 per cent of the population vaccinated. This is vital,” he said.Follow @ftclimate on Instagram
37  Italian winemaker Giorgio Polegato opened a bottle of his own prosecco this week to celebrate a big boost to his business from a tax break — one announced not in Rome but in London.Rishi Sunak, the chancellor in charge of the UK’s public finances, announced a sweeping overhaul of Britain’s complex system of taxes on alcohol, including the end of a premium duty on sparkling wines.One of many fiscal gifts to British voters, it was also a helping hand from Boris Johnson’s pro-Brexit government to makers of Italian prosecco, Spanish cava or French champagne, whose products will become more competitive. Sunak said it would cut 87p from the cost of a typical bottle of prosecco.Polegato, who has been running the family winery with his brother since 1987, hailed the announcement as further good news for a sector that was heavily challenged by Brexit and the pandemic shutdowns but is now enjoying an uptick in sales.“This is great news after so many stormy months, between the pandemic and all the logistical problems and additional costs caused by the UK’s exit from the EU,” he said. “Once they are implemented, [the measures] will enhance the value of a product that involves a long chain of small local producers. That’s encouraging.”Until 2019 the UK was the largest export market for Italian prosecco of the Denominazione di Origine Controllata classification, which requires that a wine satisfy a defined quality standard. The 100m bottles sent to Britain were about 20 per cent of total DOC exports.Sales fell to 80m bottles in 2020 because of the pandemic, transport difficulties and the additional costs and customs clearance issues connected to Brexit.“We can only see a brighter future now,” added Polegato, from Refrontolo in Italy’s north-east.The UK duty overhaul from February 2023, which Sunak said was the most radical rethink of the centuries-old tax in more than 140 years, marks a departure from EU requirements on excise duty. The intended abolition of the premium on sparkling wines acknowledges that sparkling wines such as prosecco are no longer wholly about luxury consumption.“It’s clear they are no longer the preserve of wealthy elites,” Sunak said.Miles Beale, chief executive of the UK’s Wine & Spirit Trade Association, said: “The sector is certainly reinvigorated, but it also depends on the company, the country or the type of wine. If you are a prosecco producer, of course, this is really good news, especially if you export to the UK which is a reasonably major market for wine.”The UK is also the top export market for French champagne makers, ahead of the US, though the share of the market has dwindled since the Brexit vote in 2016. France’s champagne vineyards were hit by frost, severely denting their 2021 output, but sales have rebounded after the pandemic.“It is excellent news even if it’s too early to say whether it will have an impact on exports,” said David Chatillon, the head of France’s Union des Maisons de Champagne, which represents big brands such as LVMH’s Moët & Chandon and Veuve Clicquot.Prosecco has previously made headlines during the trade war between the UK and the EU ahead of Brexit. In 2016, then Italian economic development minister Carlo Calenda accused Johnson of “insulting” his country by suggesting it should back his version of a Brexit deal or lose sales of prosecco. Calenda told Johnson — then the UK foreign secretary — that Britain would also sell less fish and chips.Michele Costabile, professor of marketing at LUISS university in Rome, said the UK’s changes would help to maintain good relationships with other countries. “Internationally, it is clear that the UK has no interest in closing itself off [and] penalising a category of goods in which trade between the UK, France, Italy and Spain is very strong, from champagne to whisky.”Additional reporting by Sarah White and Domitille Alain in Paris
38  Lama, a 21-year-old Syrian student, and her ailing father had been stuck in the unforgiving terrain of the Poland-Belarus border for more than three weeks by the time Kamil Syller found them.“The father has cancer and he needs treatment. He and his daughter tried to get to a country where he could get better care . . . where it wouldn’t be dangerous,” said the Polish activist. “Instead he found himself in a forest.”The two Syrians are part of a surge of migrants attempting to enter the EU via its eastern border, a movement of people that both the EU and Poland say is orchestrated by Belarus’ dictatorial leader Alexander Lukashenko in retaliation for Brussels’ support for Belarus’ persecuted opposition.Since the summer, thousands of migrants from countries including Iraq, Syria and Somalia have flown to the Belarusian capital Minsk, before being transported to its western border with the EU.There, many trying to slip into Poland have found themselves trapped in the woods that span the border, sandwiched between Polish forces that will not let them enter, and Belarusian security services that refuse to let them retreat.Official figures suggest that the influx is accelerating. Poland’s border guard agency said last week that of the 24,500 illegal attempts to cross the border with Belarus this year, more than half had come this month.Activists and doctors say that as the stand-off has worn on, the state of the migrants they have been treating has worsened. Medical problems range from hypothermia, hunger and dehydration to conditions such as diabetes.“I think it’s because these people are spending longer and longer in the forest, and it’s getting colder and colder,” said Malgorzata Nowosad, from the Medycy na Granicy group of volunteer medics that helps the migrants. She pointed out that about 10 per cent of the migrants in the forests were children.The Polish government has responded by declaring a state of emergency in a strip of land adjoining Belarus — banning access to non-locals, including NGOs and the media — and dispatched thousands of troops and police to seal the border.Ramping up rhetoric against migrants, it plans to spend €350m on a border wall, and has passed legislation that critics say allows security forces to push back migrants found on Polish territory into Belarus.Activists say this breaches international law. But Poland’s government has insisted that it is acting legally and has an obligation to defend its territory.Officials say that attempts to provide aid to migrants on the Belarusian side of the border via legal crossings have not been accepted by Minsk. “We put the security of our fatherland above everything,” Mariusz Blaszczak, Poland’s defence minister, said last month.Locals living in the border zone, now filled with police checkpoints and military patrols, say that the crisis has upended normal life. “At some point we had, say, 100 soldiers, 50 migrants and 20 locals in the village,” said Mateusz Wodzinski, who lives less than two kilometres from the border.“[The migrants] would cross the border, run into the forest. And then the border guard and the army were trying to find them, and kick them back out. And they just kept going round and round.”Even in places which have not been heavily affected, many are unsettled by the influx. “If [the migrants] had good intentions they would cross the border legally,” said a woman who was visiting her mother’s village near the emergency zone. “If not, it means they have bad intentions.” Others are trying to help. In Michalowo, the town council set up a centre where migrants could receive aid in the local fire station. Although few have made it to the town about 20km from the border, the initiative has received so many donations of clothes, food and other supplies that it is planning to open two other storage centres, according to Konrad Sikora, Michalowo vice-mayor.Meanwhile, Syller launched an initiative calling on locals to hang green lights outside their houses as a sign to migrants that they could find aid there. So far, he said, only one other house in his village of Werstok had a green light, but others were privately supportive.Other volunteer groups have also been set up to provide food, water, warm clothes and power banks for the migrants. But activists are frustrated that the government will not allow them into the emergency zone. A further complication is that many migrants are too scared to seek help in case it results in them being handed over to the authorities.“They’re afraid that will mean being sent back to Belarus and to the forest. Unfortunately their fears are justified,” said Piotr Bystrianin, from the Fundacja Ocalenie aid group.Activists fear that the situation will worsen if the flow of migrants does not stop before Poland’s icy winter sets in, particularly as many will be unaware of the conditions they will face. “They’re totally unprepared,” Sikora said of the migrants. “When the spring comes, and the snow melts, there’s going to be a few bodies.”
39  Gas prices in the UK and continental Europe tumbled by as much as a fifth on Friday on further signs Russia will increase exports to the region after restricting supplies for months.Russia’s state-run gas exporter Gazprom said on Friday it had hit its target for filling domestic storage two days after President Vladimir Putin ordered the company to start filling its European storage facilities. The intervention comes after allegations from some analysts that Moscow has stoked an energy crisis by holding back supplies.The UK benchmark day-ahead contract dropped almost 20 per cent to £1.39 a therm after trading at record levels above £2 a therm for most of October.While prices are still roughly three times the level of the start of the year, the sell-off will provide much-needed relief to energy-intensive industries and boost hopes that the drag from gas prices on economies will not be as bad as first feared. Concerns about inflation have also been heightened by the gas price surge, increasing pressure on central banks to consider raising interest rates.While traders cautioned that prices could quickly head higher again if additional Russian supplies do not materialise in November, they said the signals from Moscow had been enough to stall the months-long rally.UK gas contracts for delivery in December fell 15 per cent to £1.67 per therm while the European benchmark fell almost 12 per cent to €65.70 per megawatt hour, having traded above €100 as recently as two weeks ago.“This is all about Russia and the hope that, finally, supplies are going to rise after the games we’ve seen from Moscow this year,” said one energy trading executive.Gazprom said on Friday it would have completed all domestic storage fills by November 8, the same day Putin said should be the deadline for starting to send additional supplies into Gazprom’s own facilities in Germany and Austria, which have been run down to unusually low levels ahead of the winter.Traders said the retreat this week was likely to have been exacerbated by macro and trend-following funds that entered the gas market when the rally accelerated in September now exiting their positions.There are still concerns, however, that Europe is beginning the winter with lower levels of gas in storage than usual and if the weather should be marginally colder than normal, supplies could remain tight, providing support to prices.Russia has consistently denied restricting supplies to Europe but has limited its exports to those covered by long-term contracts in 2021, and has drained its own storage facilities to levels much lower than normal for the time of year.“We think the sell-off has probably been overdone as we’re still quite sceptical that there will be a meaningful step-up in exports from Russia before the end of the year,” said James Waddell, head of European gas at Energy Aspects.Putin has said that if the continent wants more gas, then it should approve the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany, which has faced opposition from the US and eastern European countries that worry it will increase Russia’s leverage over the continent.Germany’s economy ministry this week said it had concluded that allowing the new pipeline to start would not endanger the country’s or the EU’s energy security, paving the way for Nord Stream 2 to receive certification by Berlin’s Federal Network Agency.Gas supplies have also tightened globally as economies have bounced back from the pandemic, with Asia paying a premium to attract more cargoes of liquefied natural gas, leaving less to head to Europe.“Low storage levels and fears of a cold spell have hung over this market,” said Laurent Ruseckas at IHS Markit, a consultancy. “But if Russia is saying it now effectively stands ready that will provide a degree of comfort to the market.”
40  Joe Biden acknowledged on Friday that the US treatment of France had been “clumsy” in its handling of the launch of a new security pact with the UK and Australia last month that had excluded and enraged Paris.“I think what happened was to use an English phrase . . . clumsy,” the US president told reporters while meeting with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron at the French embassy to the Holy See in Rome on Friday. He added: “It was not done with a lot of grace.”The US has been attempting to dampen French fury after Washington announced a security pact last month with the UK and Australia, which resulted in the scuppering of a long-planned multibillion-dollar order for French submarines and left French officials in the dark.It was a blow for Biden’s wider efforts to knit together US allies to counter China more robustly, which have suffered a series of setbacks over the summer despite the president’s repeated protestations that “America is back” on the global diplomatic stage.Paris had grown suspicious there was a problem with the Australian submarine deal, but US officials repeatedly refused to address their concerns directly. The French ambassador to Washington was informed of the collapse of the submarine deal only after leaks in the press.The French withdrew their ambassadors to Washington and Canberra after the announcement of the new security deal, which includes a separate agreement for nuclear submarines for Australia.Even before the announcement of the security pact, named Aukus, close allies including the UK had rounded on the US for its failures during the bungled and deadly withdrawal of US and allied troops from Afghanistan and fears for its impact on migration and counter-terrorism efforts.UK officials publicly criticised Washington decision-making over Afghanistan, and Ben Wallace, defence minister, has since suggested the US was no longer a superpower or a “global power”.Biden said in his remarks on Friday that he was under the impression Paris had already been informed “long before” about the submarine deal not coming through, although he did not say who he thought had told them. He said the US had no older or “more loyal” ally than France.On meeting with Macron ahead of the G20 summit in Rome this weekend, the pair posed with their arms around each other. When asked if he needed to apologise, Biden responded “to whom?” and said the pair had “already talked”.Macron said they had “clarified together what we had to clarify” but that it was “important . . . to be sure that such a situation will not be possible for our future”.“What really matters now is what we will do together in the coming weeks, the coming months, the coming years,” he added.In a statement following Friday’s meetings, the US committed additional assets to support French-led counter-terrorism efforts in the Sahel, pledged to support efforts to boost broader European defence and acknowledged the security contribution played by France in the Indo-Pacific.Both presidents also committed to “intensify co-operation on space issues” and ensure transparency in US-French discussions.
41  Good evening,Economic recovery in the eurozone has stepped up a gear, according to new GDP data published today, with the bloc outshining the US and China for the second quarter in a row.Growth rose faster than expected to 2.2 per cent in the three months to September, following a rise of 2.1 per cent in the previous quarter, meaning the euro area is now just 0.5 per cent smaller than in the final quarter of 2019 before the pandemic hit.The bloc’s progress could be derailed in the final three months of the year by surging inflation, which — according to preliminary data also published this morning — hit a 13-year high of 4.1 per cent in October, driven by supply chain problems and soaring energy prices.The new inflation data add to pressures on the European Central Bank to begin loosening its pandemic support programme. ECB president Christine Lagarde yesterday pushed back against expectations of a rise in interest rates next year to combat the threat, despite admitting that the bank’s latest meeting was dominated by “inflation, inflation, inflation”. Country data for the eurozone’s four largest economies provided more detail on the state of the recovery. France and Italy have rebounded the strongest with third-quarter growth of 3 per cent and 2.6 per cent respectively, but Germany slowed to 1.8 per cent from 1.9 per cent in the previous quarter after being hit by bottlenecks in its car industry as well as the effect of high energy prices.Momentum in Spain also slowed, with growth hitting a less than expected 2 per cent. A rebound in the country’s vital tourism sector and progress in manufacturing and construction was offset by a slip in household consumption.The US reported quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.5 per cent yesterday, while China reported a quarter-on-quarter increase of 0.2 per cent last week. Both economies have already returned to pre-pandemic levels.For up-to-the-minute coronavirus updates, visit our live blogG20 leaders are holding a meeting in Rome dominated by climate issues ahead of the upcoming COP26 summit in Glasgow. G20 countries account for more than 80 per cent of global GDP and a similar level of carbon emissions. Here’s our explainer on the key issues at stake. Economist and health expert Mariana Mazzucato says health spending should top the leaders’ agenda, arguing that “Covid-19 has exposed our current economic model as insufficient, outmoded and negligent”.UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has come under heavy fire after new analysis said his Budget on Wednesday would leave millions worse off and hit Britons with the highest levels of tax since the 1970s. Increases in mortgage costs for UK homeowners are set to add further pressure on households already stretched by higher energy bills and rising inflation, with concerns starting to show up in surveys of consumer confidence.The energy price crisis rumbles on. UK regulator Ofgem said it would consult on changes to the prices cap that governs household energy bills, with a decision expected in February ahead of the next review. Natural gas prices in the UK and Europe fell after Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered Gazprom to start refilling storage facilities. Oil majors meanwhile are sitting pretty: Exxon and Chevron today reported surging profits.Fresh data today showed that growth in US consumer spending slowed down in September, while the core personal consumption index, a measure of inflation closely watched by the Federal Reserve, rose 3.6 per cent compared with a year ago. Official data yesterday showed economic growth slowed in the third quarter to an annualised rate of 2 per cent, or 0.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter as measured in other major economies. President Joe Biden has announced the framework of his scaled-back $1.75tn spending package.The latest batch of results from US tech giants disappointed investors. Apple said supply shortages cost it $6bn as it recorded lower than expected third-quarter revenues of $83.4bn, although net profits increased 62 per cent to $20.5bn thanks to growth in its higher-margin services business. Growth at Amazon was hit by staff shortages as well as rising costs as it recorded revenues of $110.8bn and net income almost halving to $3.2bn.Samsung reported its highest quarterly profits in three years of Won12.3tn ($10.4bn) following surging demand for semiconductors. Sony has managed to overcome the chip problem that had hit production of its PlayStation consoles and said it might build a new manufacturing plant in Japan with Taiwan’s TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker.The effect of the chip shortage on carmakers varies by segment. It slashed almost €500m from Volkswagen profits and contributed to a 14 per cent drop in revenues at Stellantis, the group formed by the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot owner PSA. But premium brands Daimler, Porsche and Audi were able to weather the storm, reporting a strong set of earnings.Latest third-quarter bank results included NatWest profits tripling to £1.1bn thanks to a rise in mortgage demand and fewer loan defaults. Lloyds benefited similarly, with profits doubling to $2bn. BNP Paribas, France’s biggest listed bank, recorded a 32 per cent rise in net income to €2.5bn thanks to a jump in revenues from equity trading.There were some encouraging signs for the recovery of air travel as losses narrowed at Air France-KLM, which said passenger capacity would reach 70 to 75 per cent of pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, Airbus has raised its profit forecast on strong demand for its aircraft.Pandemic control: UK Covid-19 infections have hit the highest level ever recorded, according to official weekly data published today. An estimated 1.27m cases were recorded in the week ending October 22, beating the peak of 1.22m in early January. However, hospitalisations are much lower. The latest daily figures reported today show 43,467 new cases and 186 deaths, bringing the total number of UK deaths to 140,392.Other developments include the UK’s test and trace programme coming under severe criticism in a parliamentary report for its “eye-watering” cost of £37bn and data showing England has been much faster to abandon masks than the rest of the UK and Europe.Vaccines: The UK’s Health Security Agency was rebuked for publishing flawed jabs data that handed ammunition to anti-vaxxers. Misleading figures appeared to show infection rates among fully vaccinated people aged 40 and over were higher than among their unvaccinated peers.UK research has shown vaccination only cuts the risk of infection within households from the Delta variant of coronavirus by a third.The BioNTech/Pfizer and Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines are associated with four rare neurological complications, according to a new study analysing 32m vaccinated adults in England.US regulators have backed the BioNTech/Pfizer jab for 5-11 year olds. BioNTech has also struck a deal with Rwanda and Senegal to open Africa’s first mRNA manufacturing plant.Novavax has submitted its protein-based vaccine for UK approval and will follow up “shortly” in other jurisdictions.Treatments: Merck has signed a royalty-free licensing deal with the UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool to expand low-cost access to molnupiravir, its Covid-19 antiviral pill, throughout the developing world — one of the first such agreements struck by a pharma company. Merck is currently waiting for the drug to be authorised by UK regulators, which, if successful, would make it the first oral antiviral treatment for the disease.A study has found that fluvoxamine, a cheap antidepressant, can reduce the risk of hospitalisation in Covid-19 outpatients.Join us on November 8-10 for the FT Global Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology Conference, the essential annual event for pharma industry leaders.

42  Cevdet Caner has a lot of lawyers.The property magnate at the centre of a fight with short-sellers is flanked in Mishcon de Reya’s offices in London by the litigation specialist’s head of finance disputes, and a partner from Wolf Theiss, one of the biggest law firms in Caner’s native Austria. His media lawyer looms large on a teleconference screen.Caner also has a sense of humour.“How I don’t want to be seen is as the villain sitting on a nuclear-powered submarine in the Mediterranean,” he smiles, putting his little finger to his lips in imitation of Dr Evil, the supervillain in the Austin Powers films.Caner is referencing the short-seller report titled “Bond Villains” that has forced the 48-year-old to come out of the shadows, breaking the more than decade-long media silence that followed the spectacular collapse of his previous property empire.Viceroy Research, which bets against companies before releasing its findings publicly, has placed Caner at the centre of what it calls a “secretive, kleptocratic cabal” controlling vast swaths of the German real estate market, including through Frankfurt-listed Adler Group.The title is also an allusion to the debt-fuelled dealmaking that transformed Adler from a lower-tier real estate company into a sprawling conglomerate, owning 70,000 apartments across Germany. The report sent the group’s stock and bonds plummeting, which triggered a wave of margin calls — Caner tallies up eight of them — among Adler’s major shareholders, which borrowed heavily against their stakes.In Caner’s telling, he is the victim of a sinister plot orchestrated by a fund manager with a grudge — whom he declines to name on record — working in concert with Viceroy, banks and hedge funds to bring down Adler.While his detractors allege that Caner secretly controls the group and that he masterminded a controversial series of acquisitions and mergers that reshaped the German real estate market to the detriment of ordinary shareholders, he dismisses the claims as a “fantasy” and has filed a criminal complaint against Viceroy.“You cannot as an individual, or even with a team of people, drive and make hidden transactions and funny things in listed capital markets,” he says.Viceroy’s founder Fraser Perring told the Financial Times that Caner’s criminal complaint was “right out of the Wirecard playbook”.“This is to distract from the issues we have raised on Adler, who are still lacking any rebuttal of substance to our report,” he added.Caner rejected Perring’s allusions to Wirecard, questioning his credibility. But at stake is more than just the reputation of a colourful financier.Over the past decade, falling interest rates and rising property prices have driven up the value of an interconnected web of German real estate companies. Adler alone sits on more than €8bn of debt and if investors begin to cool on the sector, the fallout could prove messy.In Mishcon’s plush offices, Caner sketches out his beginning as the son of Turkish immigrants and the bitter legal battles that have defined his career.Wearing a simple blue sweater and his trademark rimless glasses, Caner looks changed since 2009, when he stood arms-crossed in a crisp suit and tie as creditors picked over the wreckage of his heavily indebted property empire.He had just presided over Germany’s second-largest real estate bankruptcy at the age of just 35, when his Level One group fell into insolvency in 2008 owing creditors, including Credit Suisse, more than €1bn. The fallout saw him make headlines as his £20m Mayfair townhouse was repossessed.While creditors alleged money was diverted out of the business and a decade-long criminal case in Austria followed, Caner was finally acquitted of fraud last year.Caner has been a Monaco resident for 20 years, though he insists he moved to avoid Austrian military service rather than tax. There his social circle grew to include the likes of Lars Windhorst, the flamboyant German financier with his own history of legal troubles, and Henry O’Sullivan, the British businessman recently charged with fraud in connection to Wirecard’s collapse.Caner once swapped coarse emails with O’Sullivan and Jan Marsalek, the senior Wirecard executive who is now an international fugitive. He tells the FT he knew O’Sullivan because their children went to kindergarten together and that he only met Marsalek two or three times.The entrepreneur says he rebuilt his fortune after the failure of Level One using two things: a smart investment idea and “100 per cent leverage”.Borrowing from what he calls a “small German bank” in 2012, Caner’s family trust built up a large stake in Adler Real Estate, an obscure property company that began life as a German manufacturing business in the late-19th century. Adler then embarked on a debt-fuelled expansion that transformed it into a significant player in German real estate and saw its share price rally as much as 2,000 per cent.While questions have swirled around the precise nature of Caner’s relationship with the company, he is unabashed about his love for Adler, saying he collects the classic cars and bicycles it once produced: “My heart is Adler, my brain is Adler. I love Adler. Everybody knows that.”Yet Caner — through his lawyers — has until now been at pains to distance himself from the company. Adler declined to comment about the relationship and turned down a request for an interview.“I could never say ‘I was a shareholder of Adler’, because I wasn’t,” Caner explains, “The beneficiary [of the trust] is not me, it’s my family.”While Caner confirms that he has advised Adler on a “deal by deal” basis, he insists that the arrangement has always been backed up with contracts negotiated at “arm’s length”.For his critics, this is another example of a legal smokescreen concealing the involvement of the Austrian businessman and his associates in key transactions.In 2016, Caner found himself in a legal battle with the Austrian takeover commission, which accused him of acting in concert with others to seize control of Conwert, another real estate group, whose management dubbed Caner the “undercover boss” of Adler. Caner dismisses the findings as “bullshit” and says he was vindicated by a ruling against the regulator from the European Court of Justice last month.Asset sales have also drawn scrutiny. Last year, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange forced an Israeli subsidiary of Adler to reveal that the previously undisclosed buyer of one of its real estate portfolios was Caner’s brother-in-law, who holds a stake in Adler. The deal has since been unwound and Caner says it did not amount to a related party transaction.But it is the convoluted three-way merger that created the company now known as Adler Group that caused the biggest uproar.Through an intricate sequence of takeovers and mergers spanning Israel, Germany and Luxembourg, Adler subsumed its more creditworthy rival ADO Properties, which owned an extensive portfolio of Berlin rental apartments. Debt-laden real estate developer Consus was then folded into the newly christened Alder Group.Caner insists he was not the mastermind behind the “very complex” deal, which he maps out on a Mishcon-branded notepad. But he praises its brilliance, arguing that landlords have to be combined with developers to alleviate pressure on Germany’s rental market.“Everybody, even our enemies, are saying this was the most genius transaction that ever happened in German real estate,” he claims.ADO lost its investment-grade status, however, and many of its minority shareholders failed to appreciate the genius, arguing that the deal hollowed out the group. Several complained to financial regulator BaFin in an unsuccessful bid to block it.The combination handed a major stake in Adler Group to Consus’s previous owner Aggregate Holdings, which booked a €95m gain on the transaction. Caner describes Aggregate’s owner Günther Walcher as a “very good friend”, who stuck by him even after losing money on Level One, and someone who he helped enter the real estate market.Caner has also advised Aggregate on transactions and he was present at meetings the group held with real estate lenders last week, according to people familiar with the matter. Aggregate’s chief financial officer Benjamin Lee confirmed that Caner attends the group’s investor meetings from “time to time”.Large players have sensed opportunity in the wake of the Viceroy report, with rival LEG Immobilien and private equity firm KKR examining buying assets from Adler. Germany’s biggest landlord Vonovia snapped up a call option on the group’s shares in return for helping Aggregate repay a margin loan.While some investors burnt on Level One have vowed never to finance Caner again, others are more pragmatic.“He travels at high speed,” said one real estate lender. “It works sometimes and it doesn’t work at others.”Additional reporting by Olaf Storbeck and Stephen Morris
43  The eurozone’s economic rebound gathered pace with growth of 2.2 per cent in the third quarter, closing the gap with the US and Chinese recoveries and keeping the bloc on track to regain its pre-pandemic level of output later this year.However, there was a mixed picture between the four largest eurozone countries that reported gross domestic product figures on Friday, with France and Italy outstripping expectations while Germany and Spain reported slower than expected growth.Economists say the eurozone’s outlook is also worsening as supply chain bottlenecks and surging energy prices hold back factory production and push up inflation. Both will weigh on growth in the last quarter of 2021.Inflation in the bloc rose to a new 13-year-high of 4.1 per cent in October, up from 3.4 per cent in the previous month, according to a flash estimate published by Eurostat on Friday.The increase was driven by a 23.5 per cent rise in energy prices, while food, alcohol and tobacco prices rose 2.2 per cent, industrial goods prices were up 2 per cent and services prices increased 2.1 per cent. Stripping out more volatile energy and food prices, inflation still rose from 1.9 to 2.1 per cent.“We have to brace ourselves for less positive news,” said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at the investment bank Berenberg. “Worsening supply shortages may temporarily depress industrial output in the fourth quarter. Some consumers may spend more cautiously as a new wave of infections seems to be rolling in . . . High energy prices may also weigh on sentiment and eat into the gains in real household incomes.”The sharp rise in prices has also put pressure on the European Central Bank to start winding back its exceptional stimulus measures, in line with other major central banks such as the US Federal Reserve that have signalled moves toward tighter policy.Yet while ECB president Christine Lagarde said on Thursday that inflation was likely to remain high for longer than first expected, she still predicted it would fall below the central bank’s 2 per cent target by 2023 and rebuffed investor expectations the ECB could raise rates next year.On growth, the eurozone has lagged behind the global economy’s recovery from the pandemic over the past year. But it has now started to close the gap, with the bloc’s growth rate exceeding that of the US and China for the second successive quarter in the three months to September.On Thursday, the US reported third-quarter GDP growth of 0.5 per cent from the previous quarter, while China had already said its economy grew 0.2 per cent in the same period.However, China’s economy exceeded its pre-pandemic level last year and the US did the same in the second quarter. The euro-area economy is still 0.5 per cent smaller than in the fourth quarter of 2019, just before the pandemic hit, but it is set to close that gap later this year.Currently, the gap between German output now and in the fourth quarter of 2019 before the pandemic struck, is 1.1 per cent, Italy’s has narrowed to 1.3 per cent, while France has almost returned to pre-pandemic levels. Spain’s gap is 6.6 per cent.The eurozone’s third-quarter rebound was driven by France and Italy, which had the strongest performances with growth that comfortably outstripped expectations at 3 per cent and 2.6 per cent respectively.However, there was gloomier news in Germany, where growth was slower than expected in the third quarter at 1.8 per cent, marking a slowdown from 1.9 per cent for the previous quarter. Spain, meanwhile, reported growth well below expectations at 2 per cent.The German government this week had already slashed its 2021 growth forecast to 2.6 per cent from 3.5 per cent previously, after supply chain bottlenecks caused shortages at factories. However, Berlin also upped its 2022 growth outlook from 3.6 to 4.1 per cent.On Friday, Germany’s federal statistical office said growth in the third quarter was mainly driven by “higher household consumption expenditure”.French finance minister Bruno Le Maire meanwhile described France’s third-quarter growth as “an exceptional result”, which meant the country was “on the right track”. France’s rebound was powered by a 5 per cent rise in household spending and a 2.3 per cent increase in exports.Italy’s GDP rose 2.6 per cent in the three months to September following a strong 2.7 per cent rebound in the previous quarter, official data showed. This was better than the 2 per cent growth forecast by economists polled by Reuters.Presenting the government’s 2022 budget, Italy’s prime minister Mario Draghi said on Thursday that the economy “will grow this year by more than 6 per cent, probably well above”. This would be the fastest pace since 1976 as the country rebounds from its largest economic downturn since the second world war.Spain’s growth was fuelled by a 7.9 per cent rise in output from the hard-hit sectors of retail, transport and hospitality, following a sharp summer rebound in the key tourism sector.Manufacturing production in Spain also expanded for the first time this year. However, household consumption slipped, despite high rates of Covid-19 vaccinations.Supply chain disruptions and rising energy prices pushed Spanish consumer inflation to 5.5 per cent in October, the highest rate in more than 30 years, threatening living standards and consumer spending. French inflation also accelerated to a 13-year high of 3.2 per cent.
44  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.G20 leaders meet in Rome tomorrow and Sunday — some in person, including EU top officials and US President Joe Biden, others virtually (China’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin), just before reconvening for the COP26 climate meeting in Glasgow on Monday. From the EU perspective, it’s a litmus test for its self-declared leadership, as it will prove a tall order convincing other countries to follow suit. We’ll bring you up to speed with the latest and what to expect from the back-to-back high-level meetings.On the Brexit front, a fresh round of talks is taking place in London today between EU Brexit commissioner Maros Sefcovic and his UK counterpart, Lord David Frost — with the dispute with France over fishing rights likely to sour the mood. But in brighter news, the EU is now recognising UK’s digital pass proving Covid-19 vaccination, meaning that Brits travelling to France (or Belgium) will have no problems getting into restaurants and theatres.Down south, we look at what the budget fiasco in Portugal means for Prime Minister António Costa and his potential ambitions to scoop up a top EU job.And in an interview with the FT, Moldova’s PM Natalia Gavrilita points to the fact that the modest aid she’s secured from Brussels is nowhere near the sums her country will need to make it through the winter and not cave in to Gazprom’s demands.A quick housekeeping note: Europe Express will be off on Monday and Tuesday, but we will be back on Wednesday, November 3.For the last two years, the EU has styled itself as the world’s leading diplomatic power on climate change. Over the next fortnight, those claims are going to be put to the test, starting with this weekend’s G20 summit in Rome, writes Mehreen Khan in Brussels.The presidents of the European Commission and European Council will be taking part in negotiations with leaders from the world’s 20 richest countries in a prelude to next week’s marathon COP26 negotiations on climate change.At the Rome summit, the EU will be centre stage in pushing for maximum contribution from rich country polluters which make up 80 per cent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. They include China and India who last night set an ominous tone for talks by submitting national climate plans to the UN that defied pressure for accelerated action.At the G20, leaders will spend the weekend tussling over the Paris agreement’s promise to limit global warming by 1.5 degrees Celsius — a target they are on course to miss. Beijing, Moscow and Delhi have also resisted signing up to pledges to phase out coal in the summit communiqué. China’s national climate plan stuck to an aim of ramping up domestic coal production until 2025 (coal accounts for nearly two-thirds of Chinese electricity production).Convincing rival powers such as China and Russia (whose leaders will not be present in person in Rome or Glasgow) will be a major test of the EU’s green clout.After the Trump administration came to power and took the US out of the Paris accord, the EU manoeuvred itself as a leading force on ambitious emissions reductions by enshrining a net zero climate law and laying out tough plans for the decarbonisation of the European economy over the next decade. By comparison, the new Biden administration, even though it rejoined the Paris accord, is struggling to win domestic political support for its own net zero plan.Ursula von der Leyen, commission president, has called the G20 a “pacemaker” for COP26’s “moment of truth” in the fight to reduce emissions. “The science says we are not on track,” she told reporters yesterday.Glasgow’s two-week summit, hosted by Boris Johnson’s government, risks being beset by low expectations before it has started. Beijing’s decision last night to keep its existing climate targets unchanged will further sour the mood.Declaring success at COP26 may end up in celebrating technical achievements, on sticky issues such as carbon trading, rather than grand political gestures on the phasing out of coal or agreeing a plan to reach the 1.5 degree Celsius target which looks set to elude world leaders again.One area where the Europeans are hoping for headline-making progress is reaching the $100bn target for climate financing for the world’s poorer countries. The totemic figure has been constantly undershot at previous summits, sowing mistrust between richer nations and their poorer counterparts. The EU is the world’s single largest pledger and wants the US to catch up so the goal is met in 2022 and the subsequent two years.“It’s not a question about who is more advanced than others. It is a question about the survival of mankind,” said von der Leyen.What will be the outcome of COP26? Tell us what you think and click here to take the poll.UK and European natural gas prices fell yesterday after Russia’s president Vladimir Putin ordered state-run Gazprom to begin filling storage facilities in the continent from next month. UK benchmark prices for both November and December delivery were down almost 10 per cent, while the European benchmark in the Netherlands declined 6 per cent. (More here)Good news for Britons wanting to visit the EU: All member states will accept the NHS-issued Covid-19 app as proof of vaccination from today, writes Andy Bounds in Brussels.In many countries, including France, Belgium and the Netherlands, a QR code indicating you have been vaccinated is necessary to get into bars, restaurants and public events.Following a decision by the European Commission, the system in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is now linked to the EU one so the scanners used by staff policing entry will recognise it.Vaccinated Britons can also freely cross EU borders, not just those with bilateral deals to accept the NHS app.Equally, the UK will accept EU certificates, though checks there are much lighter.In addition to the UK app, the EU also decided to recognise Armenia’s QR codes, said justice commissioner Didier Reynders. The EU-issued codes are now accepted in 17 other countries outside the bloc, including Turkey, Panama and Morocco (but not the US).António Costa, Portugal’s centre-left prime minister, was widely expected to step down as leader of the Socialist party before the next general election — scheduled until yesterday for 2023 — and seek a top post in Brussels. One former Portuguese socialist MEP had tipped him as a potential candidate for the presidency of the European Council, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon.But Costa has been forced to put any such ambitions to the side, at least temporarily.The anti-capitalist Left Bloc and old-guard Communist party, two small parties that had supported his minority government since 2015, sided with the right-of-centre opposition on Wednesday to vote down his 2022 budget proposals, triggering a political crisis that is almost certain to lead to a snap election.Costa appeared to have been counting on the €14bn in grants that Portugal will receive from the EU’s €800bn post-pandemic recovery plan to lift his party’s fortunes over the coming years, potentially putting an absolute majority within reach of a potential successor in 2023.Instead, he has pledged to lead his party into the snap election that President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa is expected to call for February and seek another four-year term as prime minister. He has vowed to fight the election on a leftwing platform, maintaining all the measures negotiated with the two smaller far-left parties in the budget that they have rejected, a bill described by the Socialists as Portugal’s most expansive budget proposals in recent history.The risk of the election proving inconclusive is considerable, however.The Socialist party enjoys a strong lead in opinion polls, with about 38 per cent of the vote. But that would be insufficient to secure an overall majority.If the far-left continued to deny Costa support, he could find himself at the head of a minority government forced to negotiate parliamentary support bill by bill or to seek an understanding with centre-right opposition.
45  Moldova’s prime minister has warned that the country is on the brink of an economic and social crisis as she called on the EU to offer more support to help the country weather pressure from Russian gas producer Gazprom.Natalia Gavrilita said in an interview that the “next two to three weeks” would be crucial. “These next few weeks are the time for Moldova’s friends to step up . . . [Otherwise] it will be very difficult politically, socially and economically for the country,” she told the Financial Times.The former Soviet state has declared a state of emergency after Kremlin-controlled Gazprom cut gas deliveries by a third and threatened that supplies could be shut off if Moldova did not agree to a more expensive contract.Gazprom has also said Moldova can get a better deal on gas if the country gives up some pro-EU policies, people briefed on negotiations told the FT this week.Gavrilita declined to comment on Gazprom’s offer, citing the negotiations with the Russian company.But she said she would “prefer not to be put in that position” of choosing between cheaper gas and closer relations with Brussels.The Moldovan crisis is part of a wider European gas crunch that has led critics of Gazprom, Europe’s largest gas supplier, to suggest it is trying to extract political concessions and punish countries and governments that it disagrees with.Russia has denied that politics has played a role in Gazprom’s negotiations with Moldova, and said it was discussing a new contract “exclusively on commercial terms”.Gavrilita’s enthusiastically pro-EU party won a landslide victory in parliamentary elections this year and wants to take Moldova out of its historic Russian orbit.The EU on Wednesday agreed to provide Moldova with a €60m grant, equivalent to 20 days of gas imports. The grant had given the country vital space “to keep negotiating without a ticking clock”, Gavrilita said.But she estimated that, without an acceptable deal from Gazprom, Moldova would need to spend about €800m over the next five months on alternative imports to meet its winter demand, based on market prices. That would require more support from Brussels, she said.“These are the four, five months when the EU really has to make absolutely clear that it supports Moldova,” Gavrilita added. “The volumes that Moldova needs are very small . . . in the European context. We do hope we can count on continued support.”This week Moldova bought its first non-Russian gas in four trial open-market purchases totalling 5m cubic metres, enough to meet less than two days of demand. The country is in talks over possible supply deals with national gas companies in Poland and Romania, and international trading companies that own gas stored in Ukraine.Gavrilita declined to comment when asked if EU companies were offering below-market prices as an alternative to a new Gazprom deal. But she said the country was discussing potential contract structures and repayment schedules that would make overall costs cheaper than spot market prices.“There are no easy solutions here. We are looking for a long-term contract, a price that will help us deal with the current price abnormality,” she said. “We are discussing various options with European partners.”Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said on Thursday that the bloc’s €60m payment was the “first step” of support to the country, adding: “This is what a partner does.”Borrell said the EU would not forbid Moldova to sign a new deal with Gazprom, but that Brussels was “strongly against” what he described as “weaponisation of the gas supply”.“Be sure that this [EU] money is not going to go to Gazprom’s pockets. It is going to go to the most vulnerable Moldovan people,” he added.Gavrilita said that negotiations with the Russian company would continue, and that Chisinau had always been “open to remain a partner to Gazprom . . . [with] a normal, economic, predictable relationship”.Gazprom’s levels of gas storage in the EU are well below usual seasonal levels, which has led some market analysts to say the company is trying to exert pressure for approval of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany.Russian president Vladimir Putin this week told Gazprom to begin filling storage facilities in the continent from next month.
46  The meeting of leaders of the world’s 20 biggest economies in Rome this weekend will be dominated by wrangling over climate targets that are likely to set the tone for the COP26 summit that follows.Italian diplomats hope that the first face-to-face summit of G20 leaders in two years can pave the way for a breakthrough on climate issues even though they are viewed very differently by the developing and developed nations that will be there.Although almost 200 countries will be represented at the UN-convened COP26 gathering in Glasgow that begins on Monday, G20 members account for more than 80 per cent of global gross domestic product and a similar level of carbon emissions.But the first big international summit hosted by Mario Draghi since he became Italy’s prime minister last year will lack the physical presence of high-profile G20 leaders, notably Xi Jinping of China and Russia’s Vladimir Putin.Draghi’s main task, according to Italian diplomats, is to secure agreement from G20 leaders for meaningful action to cut harmful greenhouse gases and limit global warming.This means securing commitments to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and to restrict warming to 1.5C over the same timeframe, in line with the goals of the Paris climate accord. The former central bank chief will also seek to build consensus to slash global methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030, compared with the 2020 level.New initiatives relating to the pandemic, which dominated last year’s virtual G20 gathering, are not expected. Italy hosted the G20 health summit in May where wealthier countries pledged to donate Covid-19 vaccines to poorer countries.Draghi will press the idea to create a new body of medical and financial decision makers that would seek to prevent the next health crisis, along the lines of the Financial Stability Board established following the 2008 financial crash. But this idea has run into resistance from Moscow and Beijing.The absence of Xi and Putin, who both declined to attend in person, citing the pandemic, could be viewed as ominous for multilateralism. The leaders of Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Japan will also not be in Rome, although Japan does have a general election this weekend.Xi and Putin will, however, participate via video conference. The Italians have shifted the times of the leaders’ summit working sessions to better accommodate their time zones, and have engaged in extensive talks with the Chinese and Russian delegations ahead of the event.However, at a time when relations between the US and both China and Russia are frosty, the symbolism of Xi and Putin’s absence is unfortunate given the desire of Italy to use this year’s G20 to achieve multilateral solutions for problems ranging from Afghanistan to developing world debt.Having enjoyed a significant global profile during his time as president of the European Central Bank, Draghi has existing relationships with many of the G20 leaders.Yet his government has damped hopes of a landmark agreement being struck in Rome, with diplomats cautioning that difference on issues ranging from climate change to Afghanistan will be very difficult to bridge at one meeting.Draghi held a special Afghanistan summit this month attended via video by several leaders, including Joe Biden, US president, and Narendra Modi, prime minister of India. However, neither Xi nor Putin took part, undermining the Italian’s attempts to build consensus on how to tackle the crisis caused by the Taliban’s takeover.While the success or failure of Italy’s year-long G20 presidency will almost certainly be judged on the progress of climate talks, the fact that the COP26 meeting occurs directly afterwards may mean that few remember what happened in Rome once events kick off in Glasgow.Unfortunately for Italy, perhaps the biggest multilateral breakthrough of recent years, the global minimum tax agreement, was struck by 140 countries at the OECD this month, depriving Rome of what could have been a lasting legacy of its G20 presidency.Although the leaders will endorse the tax deal backed by 140 countries, the fact that it was backed by G20 members and given the green light by their finance ministers only a fortnight ago means that this will amount to little more than a rubber stamp.The tax plan’s backers aim to sign a multilateral convention in 2022 and for it to take effect the following year.Developing-country debt that was put into focus during the pandemic will also be discussed. The G20 last year provided relief to poorer countries struggling to finance their pandemic response, but its efforts fell short of expectations.Its debt service suspension initiative launched in 2020 was expected to provide “north of $20bn” in relief last year alone, by allowing 73 eligible countries to suspend payments on debts owed to G20 governments and other creditors.But only 46 countries have taken part, deferring $10.3bn in payments on bilateral debt due between May 2020 and June 2021, with another $600m written off by the IMF. More than half the relief came from China.The mechanism is due to be replaced by a G20 common framework on debt relief from January, although this has not got off to the best of starts.Announced almost a year ago and designed to offer greater relief from private sector creditors, it has so far attracted just three applicants: Chad, Ethiopia and Zambia.As part of our coverage of COP26 we want to hear from you.

47  This week’s Britain after Brexit comes to you from Brussels, as Peter takes a well-earned half-term break. Holiday for most Belgian schools is next week, so inevitably the glorious autumn sunshine here will end this weekend with temperatures plunging from 17C to 10C. There is no rest for UK and EU negotiators, however, as talks about the future of the Northern Ireland protocol continue with Lord Frost meeting Maros Sefcovic, EU Brexit commissioner, in London tomorrow.But whatever happens to the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the EU will remain the UK’s biggest trading partner for a long, long time to come. And many in this city say it is time for British business to adapt to the new reality — influencing policy from the outside, as a third country, rather than from within as a member.The usual panoply of business groups is present in Brussels — the CBI, dominated by big employers, and a local partner of the British Chambers of Commerce, which caters to medium-sized companies. The CBI remains a member of BusinessEurope, which has a lot of sway in the EU and is consulted — if not always listened to — on legislation.Many UK companies, or at least businesses with big UK operations, are also members of sectoral groups such as ACEA, the carmakers’ body, or Eurofer for steel.But there is a need for a unified British voice, says Susan Danger of AmCham EU, which has represented the interests of US companies in Brussels for 60 years. It has 158 members that are “committed to and invested in Europe” and employ 4.8m people directly in the EU. That allowed them a hearing with policymakers, she said.“The British business groups have membership from multinational companies with UK operations. AmCham is purely US companies,” she told Britain after Brexit. “It is very clear who we represent when we talk to stakeholders.” The EU still remained the US’s most important global partner, as it would be for the UK, she argued.Some 55 per cent of income earned by US companies overseas comes from Europe. And 60 per cent of the US’s stock of global investment is in Europe, with a quarter of that in the UK. That contribution gets AmCham heard in the corridors of power.“You have to convince the EU to listen to you,” said Danger.On Wednesday, lobbying group Low produced a report suggesting AmChamEU as a model for how UK companies should push their interests in Brussels and hosted a debate with Ian Wright, chief executive of the UK’s Food and Drink Federation, Ben Butters, head of Eurochambres, and Danger. Both British executives are based in Brussels.Butters said that the ambivalent UK attitude to the EU had long been an issue. “There has always been something of a gap between British businesses and the EU policymaking machine. Even before Brexit, UK business was punching below its weight at EU level cumulatively.”Former UK Conservative health secretary Andrew Lansley, who advises Low, warned that the relationship between the UK and EU was “bedevilled by a lack of trust” and British business could get caught in the crossfire. “You may not find your interests are represented by the British government,” he said, given that London wished to change regulations inherited from the EU, which could make British products impossible to sell in the single market.This created a problem, Danger told Britain after Brexit. The precise attraction for US companies is the single market, smoothly selling to about 450m relatively wealthy consumers. It is also the magnetic pull that it has on global regulation. The “Brussels effect” means that companies adopt EU rules globally as it is simpler than operating differently in different countries. Even in areas where US business was initially unhappy with EU regulation, such as GDPR, the US itself often ended up enacting something similar, she said.However, the UK government is deliberately distancing itself from the single market. Its 180-strong diplomatic mission to Brussels is downsizing rapidly now that Brexit has happened.It also needs to pivot from being a policy scrutiny and negotiating team to one that builds relationships, picks up intelligence and influences.UK ambassador to the EU Lindsay Croisdale-Appleby is fitting this work in around intense talks over Northern Ireland and Gibraltar.He hosted a screening of the latest James Bond film, No Time to Die, and is organising other cultural and political events but London’s anti-Brussels rhetoric is not helping. As Wright from the Food and Drink Federation pointed out, it simply increased the chances British businesses would be blackballed.Even in industry groups “your European partners are not keen [to involve you] because it causes difficulties with the commission”.Danger believes companies must steer clear of British diplomats and create their own lobbying arm with a hub in Brussels.Wright said as a first step that his federation, along with the National Farmers Union and groups representing hospitality, could set up a specialist food embassy in Brussels but he would like others to join. “My preference would be for a collective engagement,” he added. Not least because “the scale is going to be so huge”. It is time for UK companies to boost their public affairs budgets.Wednesday’s Budget laid bare the extent of damage to trade and the UK economy that Brexit is doing. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent body that advises the government, forecast that it would reduce GDP by 4 per cent, double the impact of the pandemic.It also pointed out that exports to the EU had fallen, both in the five years since the EU referendum and the period since the UK left the bloc. Meanwhile, the UK has not offset that drop with exports to the rest of the world, a key government aim. In 2019 the EU accounted for 46 per cent of UK goods exports.UK goods exports to the EU plunged 45 per cent in January 2021 and in August were still down about 15 per cent on the level before the transition period ended. UK goods imports from the bloc fell more than 30 per cent in January and were still down about 20 per cent in August compared with December 2020. Overall, goods trade with the rest of the world by August was 7 per cent below average 2019 levels, while goods trade with the EU was 15 per cent below.And, finally, three unmissable Brexit storiesThe Budget set the UK further on the path to being a more European-like economy, with higher taxes and higher government spending. But government revenue as a proportion of GDP remains below any EU member apart from Ireland, though the gap is narrowing. Wages are also rising after a shortage of workers led to competition.Never mind Northern Ireland. The perennial problem of fish has resurfaced. France yesterday made good on threats to act after the UK and Jersey denied many boats a licence to fish in their waters. The biggest repercussion for UK business from the dispute will be increased checks on lorries crossing the Channel from Tuesday.The latest test of EU internal order is Poland’s defiance of the European Court of Justice. Warsaw’s decision that Polish judges outrank EU ones echoes UK thinking. Its rhetoric — accusing the EU of wanting to start a ‘third world war’, is also similar. But Poland wants to stay in the club while ignoring the rules.
48  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
49  Hellas: A Lyrical Drama, composed soon after the Greek war of independence broke out in 1821, is not generally considered one of Percy Bysshe Shelley’s best poems. But the preface to the poem contains the most succinct, powerful summary in the English language of the debt that western civilisation owes to the ancient Greeks. “We are all Greeks,” Shelley wrote. “Our laws, our literature, our religion, our arts have their root in Greece.”More than 150 years later, French president Valéry Giscard d’Estaing made the same point when he issued a passionate plea for Greece, newly liberated from military dictatorship, to be brought into the European Economic Community, later the EU. “What is Europe without Plato?” he asked.Western European and American admiration for ancient Hellene culture played an indispensable part in ensuring that an independent Greek state emerged from the ferocious struggle against Ottoman overlordship in the 1820s. The Greek cause was in dire trouble until the British, French and Russians destroyed the Ottoman fleet at the battle of Navarino in 1827 — “the last great naval battle of the age of sail”, as Mark Mazower puts it in The Greek Revolution. Each great power had its own motives for intervention but, for philhellenes everywhere, to support the Greeks was to support liberty, justice and civilisation itself.Greek independence set a precedent that resonates across two centuries of European history up to the present day, Mazower says. From Italy and Germany in the 1860s and 1870s to Montenegro and Kosovo in the past 15 years, the formation of new nation states, big or small, has been a consistent theme of Europe’s political development. Yet the history of Greece is not the same as the history of Greeks as a people, as Roderick Beaton’s The Greeks: A Global History amply illustrates.His book is studded with examples of the worldwide reach of Greek culture over the past 3,000 years. Greek mercantile networks in the 18th century stretched from Marseille to the Sea of Azov in a pattern resembling that of the 7th century BC. In the mid-17th century Greeks opened the first coffee shops in London (Greek Street in Soho testifies to their enduring presence in the capital’s life).Constantine Cavafy, one of the greatest modern Greek poets, was born in the Egyptian city of Alexandria — founded by Alexander the Great in or around 331BC — and rarely visited Greece. After the British novelist EM Forster met Cavafy in Alexandria in 1917, he wrote: “He was a loyal Greek, but Greece for him was not territorial . . . Racial purity bored him, so did political idealism. And he could be caustic about the tight-lipped little peninsula overseas.”Beaton, emeritus professor of modern Greek and Byzantine history, language and literature at King’s College London, is an authoritative guide to the countless ways in which Greek words and ideas have shaped the modern world. Alphabet, athletics, democracy, drama, history, pandemic, physics, politics, rhetoric — these are all words originating in ancient Greek. Much Greek influence was filtered through the Roman empire. The poet Horace, writing in the first century BC, observed: “Captive Greece took captive her fierce conqueror, and introduced her arts into rude Latium.”One prominent theme of Beaton’s erudite and highly readable book is the way that once great centres of Greek civilisation such as Alexandria, Constantinople and the southern Black Sea coast lie outside the borders of the modern Greek state. After the fall of the Roman empire in the west in the fifth century, Constantinople emerged as the capital of a Greek-speaking eastern empire that became known as Byzantium. Yet after western crusaders sacked the city in 1204, Byzantine power never recovered.Most Greek-speakers, from the Mediterranean and Aegean seas to Cyprus and Anatolia, lived for the next seven centuries under the rule of foreigners — Aragonese, Catalans, Florentines, French, Genoese, Venetians and, especially after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Ottomans. Athens, a shadow of its ancient self, was governed in the 13th century by a baronial family from Burgundy.Ordinary Greeks were never more than second-class citizens in the Ottoman Empire, but matters could have been worse, as Beaton suggests when reminding us of Spain’s expulsions of Jews and Muslims from 1492 onwards. By the 18th century, the Ottomans relied on Greek-speaking aristocrats known as Phanariots to rule the provinces of Moldavia and Wallachia, now part of Romania.Beaton’s book focuses, however, mostly on the ancient and medieval eras. It is three-quarters complete before he narrates the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople. Readers who want fuller treatment of Greece’s turbulent experiences since 1821 can turn to his 2019 book Greece: Biography of a Modern Nation, a history of rare quality.Mazower, a professor at Columbia University, sets himself the task not just of retelling the familiar story of the Greek fight for independence but of placing the event in the broader context of modern European history. His book unfolds as an engaging combination of fast-flowing narrative and insightful analysis. Next to the abolition of slavery, the cause of Greek freedom “was to reveal for the first time in modern history the transformative international power of public opinion expressed in print and fuelled through associational life”, he writes.Both sides committed atrocities in the war, and Mazower makes the perceptive point that some western European philhellenes who went to fight for the Greeks were shocked by episodes such as the slaughter in 1822 of Muslim civilians in Corinth. Yet it was the Ottoman massacre in 1821 of Greeks in Constantinople, and the public hanging of the city’s Greek Orthodox patriarch, that inflamed European opinion.Klemens von Metternich, Austria’s ultra-conservative chancellor, wrote that “beyond our eastern frontiers, three or four hundred thousand hanged, strangled or impaled do not count for much”. He could not have been wider of the mark. Philhellenism and public outrage at repeated Ottoman atrocities created a liberal European conscience, an impulse to interventionism that resurfaced during the Spanish civil war of the 1930s and the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s.As Greek civilians fled Ottoman forces in Asia Minor, the Peloponnese and vulnerable islands, the crisis “transformed international affairs by bringing a new subject to the attention of the world: the suffering non-combatant”, Mazower writes. On the US east coast, donations in support of Greek refugees poured in from towns, schools, colleges, churches and even the West Point military academy.However, these efforts fell far short of what was needed to turn the war’s tide in favour of the Greeks. Internal divisions on the Greek side were so sharp that in 1824 a civil war broke out within the war against the Ottomans, a clash that prefigured similar splits in Greece during the first world war and in the 1946-49 civil war. “The democratic spirit was genuine among the Greeks but it made military organisation impossible and led to an acute sense of rivalry that was one of the main factors in prolonging the fighting,” Mazower writes.The outlook for the Greeks was so dire by February 1826 that Colonel Charles Fabvier, a French veteran of the Napoleonic wars who fought with the Greeks, wrote: “Greece exists only in name. As the campaigning season begins, there are no more provisions, no soldiers nor money.” Yet the next year the British, French and Russians agreed to push for a settlement that would establish Greek autonomy under Ottoman suzerainty. The three powers did not explicitly threaten war, but they dropped a strong hint that, if the Ottomans rejected their initiative, some form of military intervention would follow.The result was Navarino, an Ottoman defeat so comprehensive that Greek independence became inevitable. Yet, as Mazower explains, the British government regarded Navarino as “the most controversial and unwanted of triumphs”. Under George Canning, foreign secretary from 1822 to 1827 and briefly prime minister until his death in 1827, British policy had moved in an increasingly pro-Greek direction, but his death put the government in the hands of politicians who were anti-Russian and pro-Turkish. In his King’s Speech of 1828, George IV went so far as to call Navarino “the untoward event”. Still, the die was cast.Greeks were barely involved in the three-power talks in London in 1830 that produced an accord to set up their country as a fully independent monarchy. Against the odds, Greece became the first new nation state to emerge from the multinational empires that dominated Europe’s political map in the early 19th century. Earlier this year, in somewhat subdued fashion because of the pandemic, Greeks celebrated the 200th anniversary of the outbreak of their war of liberation. There is no better time to remind ourselves, as Mazower says, that the achievement of independence was for Greeks “the greatest miracle of all”.The Greeks: A Global History by Roderick Beaton, Faber & Faber £25, 588 pagesThe Greek Revolution: 1821 and the Making of Modern Europe by Mark Mazower, Allen Lane £30, 608 pagesTony Barber is the FT’s European affairs columnistJoin our online book group on Facebook at FT Books Café
50  Christine Lagarde rebuffed investor expectations that the European Central Bank could raise rates next year to quell fast-rising prices, even as she acknowledged that its latest governing council meeting was dominated by a discussion of “inflation, inflation, inflation”.The ECB president said the council had done “a lot of soul-searching” to test its assumption that inflation would fade next year, and its analysis did “not support” market expectations for a rate rise before the end of 2022.Nevertheless, even as Lagarde spoke on Thursday, investors ramped up their bets of an ECB rate rise. Markets are currently pricing in a 0.1 percentage point rise by September next year.“The view in the market is that central banks are behind the curve,” said ING rates strategist Antoine Bouvet. “The ECB is no exception.”The ECB’s approach to rising inflation — which in October hit a 28-year high of 4.6 per cent in Germany, and a 37-year high of 5.5 per cent in Spain — contrasts with other major central banks such as the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve, which have both signalled moves toward tightening policy.Instead, after a two-day meeting of its governing council, the ECB said its €1.85tn pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) would continue, although at “a moderately lower pace” than the €80bn-a-month level it ran at until last month. The ECB also kept its deposit rate unchanged at minus 0.5 per cent.The ECB president dismissed fears of “stagflation” and said the euro area economy was still recovering strongly, even if it had lost momentum recently due to the supply chain problems and the surge in energy prices. She said: “We foresee inflation rising further in the near term but then declining in the course of next year.”However, in a subtle shift from previous statements, Lagarde said inflation would “take longer to decline than originally expected”, adding that supply chain bottlenecks were likely to last well into next year, although she expressed confidence it would fall below the ECB’s 2 per cent target by 2023.Economists expect eurozone inflation to rise to 3.7 per cent this month, its highest level since 2008. Some are also starting to predict it could remain above the ECB’s target next year.Neville Hill, chief European economist at Credit Suisse, said the ECB president had been “only half convincing in pushing back on the market’s pricing of higher rates next year”.Underlining how inflationary pressures are rising in Europe, the selling price expectations of EU companies rose to a record high in October, according to the European Commission’s latest monthly survey, while consumer price expectations rose to their highest level since November 1992.The ECB agreed a new strategy earlier this year designed to avoid the risk of raising rates too soon — something it was widely considered to have done just as the eurozone debt crisis was starting in 2011 and it hiked rates twice during a food and energy supply shock.Konstantin Veit, a portfolio manager at Pimco, said: “That President Lagarde failed to assuage markets probably contains an element of markets questioning the ECB’s commitment to the new monetary policy strategy.”Some central banks have acted forcefully in the face of rising inflation. On Wednesday, the Bank of Canada jolted markets by saying it would stop asset purchases and raise rates sooner than expected. Brazil’s central bank also raised rates by 175 basis points, its biggest move in almost 20 years.“The danger for central banks is that inflation expectations could become unanchored,” said Randall Kroszner, a professor at the University of Chicago business school and a former Fed governor. “The ECB seems prepared to be more patient.”Lagarde said she expected PEPP to end in March, adding that the decision on whether to expand an earlier asset purchase programme to offset some of the reduction would not be made until December.The €1.41tn already spent under PEPP since it was launched in response to the Covid-19 crisis last year has taken the ECB’s overall portfolio of assets to €4.5tn and allowed it to exceed a self-imposed limit to own no more than a third of any country’s eligible sovereign debt.There are expected to be divisions on the ECB council over how much of that flexibility to preserve under the continuing asset purchase programme, which is expected to be increased from its current pace of €20bn a month.When Jens Weidmann said last week that he would quit as head of Germany’s central bank at the end of the year, he warned in a letter to Bundesbank staff: “Crisis measures, with their extraordinary flexibility, are only proportionate in the emergency situation for which they were created.”
51  Turkey’s central bank governor has argued that recent rate cuts will help to stabilise the plummeting currency and soaring inflation by erasing the country’s chronic current account deficit.Sahap Kavcioglu, who took the bank’s helm in March after president Recep Tayyip Erdogan fired his predecessor, dismissed concerns about rapidly rising prices and the weakening lira — even as he predicted that inflation would be close to four times its official 5 per cent target this year.He told a press conference in Ankara that Turkey needed to “seize the opportunity” presented by the pandemic to become a centre of production and expand its exports thanks to a cheaper currency.Kavcioglu argued that this would help to turn the country’s longstanding current account deficit — caused by the fact that Turkey usually imports more than it exports — into a surplus.“Turkey’s main problem is the current account deficit,” he said. “When we solve this problem and there’s a current account balance, the exchange rate will return to normal.”Although Turkey posted a current account surplus in August for the first time in almost a year, thanks to a surge in tourism income, analysts expect it to return to a deficit if growth picks up pace. That could put fresh pressure on the already struggling lira, which is down about 20 per cent against the dollar this year.Economists and analysts expressed surprise and bemusement at Kavcioglu’s argument. Tim Ash, an emerging markets strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, described it as “gobbledegook”.Roger Kelly, an economist covering Turkey at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said “part of” the governor’s argument made sense because “the idea that pushing selected high tech goods and intermediate goods that can be exported can help the current account is true”.But he added: “The idea that current account balance can be achieved rapidly via an industrial policy based on a weak lira and selective financing for these sectors, rather than through productivity-enhancing structural reforms, seems short sighted.”Kelly said that, in the short to medium term, a weak lira would be “highly inflationary and present significant challenges to the servicing of the extensive external liabilities of Turkey’s corporates”.Turkey has about $170bn of external debt coming due in the next 12 months.The country’s nominally independent central bank has faced increasing interference from Erdogan in recent years as he has consolidated his control over the country’s institutions.The Turkish leader, who disagrees with the conventional economic wisdom that high interest rates help to curb inflation, has repeatedly pressed for lower rates in the hope of securing rapid growth even as it has come at the cost of rising inflation and financial instability.The central bank has cut its benchmark rate by a total of 300 basis points to 16 per cent in recent months, bringing it below inflation, which stood at almost 20 per cent in September.Kavcioglu said that he believed inflation pressures were “temporary” even as he raised the bank’s year-end inflation forecast from 14 per cent to 18 per cent.He said that Turkey was “not planning”, as feared by some international investors, to return to its contentious previous policy of using its limited foreign currency reserves to prop up the lira. Instead, he argued that a future current account surplus would create “balance” in the currency and tame inflation.Hakan Kara, a former chief economist at the central bank who was among a group of senior officials fired in 2019, suggested that the institution would “benefit from putting an end to press conferences for a while”.In a veiled reference to Erdogan, he added: “Whoever gives the order for the interest rate should be made to answer the questions.”
52  The Bank of England will consider whether it should force banks to hold extra capital to cover risks from climate change, as central banks come under pressure to assess any shock to the financial system.The central bank’s Prudential Regulation Authority said on Thursday that it would examine whether changes to bank capital buffers might be necessary to manage the impact of climate change, and it would publish its findings by the end of 2022.But the authority distanced itself from the responsibility for directing money flows. It stressed that capital requirements should be used only to address the effects of climate change, and to absorb any losses.Steering the move to a low-carbon economy was the responsibility of government, it noted.The UK took steps to become the first country in the G20 to force certain companies to disclose their climate-related risks, as it introduced legislation on Thursday that would make it a requirement from next April.Pressure has grown on global banking regulators to address the potential risks to the financial system from the estimated $750bn tied to fossil fuel assets in the major banks alone.Among the actions the PRA could take is to require banks to set aside capital both on a system-wide basis and on an individual basis, requiring banks to cover their specific exposures.Hedge fund manager Chris Hohn told the Financial Times this month that he believed central banks were “allowing systemic risk to build” by “not doing their job to regulate carbon”.Hohn’s Children’s Investment Fund Foundation said in response to the latest PRA statement that capital buffers were critical. “Capital charges exist to ensure the financial system is safe from systemic risk including climate change — higher charges for dirty assets with higher transition risk is essential,” said Mike Hugman, CIFF director of climate finance.Al Gore, former US vice-president, also said in an interview with the FT that banks’ capital requirements should be changed to incorporate climate, in order to dissuade financiers from investing in “destructive practices”.The PRA maintains that it is for policymakers to dissuade investors from ploughing money into carbon-intensive investments. Direct policy interventions, such as putting a price on carbon emissions, “would offer better incentives for action across the wider economy”, it said.The Brussels-based non-profit group Finance Watch said the PRA was taking “the right approach”. Current capital requirements underestimated the risks associated with carbon-intensive investments, and changing the rules would “effectively orient capital towards sustainable activities”.The PRA was not dictating banks’ investment decisions, said Thierry Philipponnat, Finance Watch head of research and advocacy, but it could change capital requirements to ensure that any lender taking on risk did not trigger a systemic problem.In justifying its position, the PRA said capital requirements “seem unlikely to be the most effective tool in reducing carbon-intensive activities unless calibrated at more extreme levels”.This could lead to “unintended consequences”, it said, such as investments classified as “green” being treated as less risky than they may turn out to be.That could have “financial stability implications”, and also deprive key sectors of the financing they needed to transition to greener business models, the PRA said.The European Commission has asked the European Banking Authority to assess whether capital requirements could be altered to take into account climate risk. The commission said this week that the introduction of new rules on bank capital would be delayed until 2025.Also on Thursday, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority said that most asset managers and listed companies had not yet set net zero emissions targets, despite many having committed to doing so and signing up to industry-led initiatives.The FCA said some institutions were concerned that setting climate goals would force them to reduce their exposure to certain clients or asset classes, which could “conflict with their business relationships”, such as their client’s instructions to invest in those assets.
53  UK and European natural gas prices fell on Thursday after Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered state-run Gazprom to begin filling storage facilities in the continent from next month.UK benchmark prices for both November and December delivery were down almost 10 per cent following Putin’s comments late on Wednesday, dropping to about £2 per therm. The European benchmark in the Netherlands declined 6 per cent to about €80 per megawatt hour.Both benchmarks remain almost five times the level of a year ago, but traders have been waiting for signals that Russia will boost supplies, having restricted top-up sales for much of 2021 while Gazprom has allowed its own storage facilities in Europe to fall to unusually low levels.Critics have suggested Russia has exacerbated an energy crisis in order to increase pressure on Germany and the EU to speed up the approval of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline.Russia has denied restricting supplies, but there have been some signs of concern in Moscow over the long-term impact of such high prices on future gas demand.The Financial Times reported this week that Gazprom’s largest storage site in Germany, and one of the biggest on the continent, is less than 10 per cent full ahead of the start of winter. The largest facility in Austria, also controlled by Gazprom, is about 20 per cent full.Some analysts have said that has increased the perception of tight supplies, leading to fears of shortages heading into a time of the year when demand for power typically rises.Russia has consistently said it has met all of its long-term contracts with customers.Putin suggested on Wednesday that Gazprom’s storage facilities in Germany and Austria should be filled once Russia has completed filling its own domestic facilities in early November.“This should certainly create a favourable situation on the European energy market, or at least a more favourable one,” Putin told Gazprom’s chief executive Alexei Miller in a televised meeting.But there is still some caution among gas traders and analysts over whether this will lead to an actual increase in supplies. Putin hinted earlier this month that Russia could act to cool runaway prices but so far supplies to western Europe have shown little sign of rising.
54  The UK has summoned the French ambassador after France detained a British trawler in an escalation of a long-running dispute over post-Brexit fishing rights.Liz Truss, UK foreign secretary, said: “I have instructed Europe minister Wendy Morton to summon the French ambassador to the UK for talks tomorrow to explain the disappointing and disproportionate threats made against the UK and Channel Islands.”Paris announced on Wednesday night that it would increase customs and sanitary controls on freight at the border, make stricter checks of trucks coming in and leaving France, and ban trawlers from landing their catch in some French ports if the dispute over fishing rights was not resolved. France also repeated a threat to reduce electricity supplies to the UK.The British trawler Cornelis Gert Jan was forced to dock in Le Havre and its captain appeared in court on Thursday accused of illegally fishing for scallops, and could face a €75,000 fine.France’s Europe minister Clement Beaune said in a television interview on Thursday that the new stricter controls were aimed at forcing the UK back to the table to issue more fishing licences after months of discussions. “It is time to speak the language of force because I fear that it is all the government of the UK understands,” he said on CNews. “There will be zero tolerance and no compromises.”A UK government spokesperson described the French actions as “unjustified” and said they “do not appear to be compatible on the EU’s part with the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) or wider international law”.But the island of Jersey bowed to French pressure on Thursday and increased the number boats allowed to fish in its territorial waters. The self-governing island, which is dependent on Britain for defence, said it was “extremely disappointed” that France was “pursuing an approach of retaliatory measures”.It said it had added 20 more permits for French vessels, bringing the total number licensed to fish in its territorial waters to 162 from Friday. Of these, 113 are permanent and 49 temporary, ending on January 31 2022. But 55 more vessels will still lose their rights from Sunday.The UK government said the French proposals, which threaten to disrupt trade through the important Dover-Calais route, probably breached its post-Brexit accord with the EU.“We repeat that the government has granted 98 per cent of licence applications from EU vessels to fish in the UK’s waters and, as has consistently been made clear, will consider any further evidence on the remainder.”The European Commission said it was in talks with the two sides to “resolve this issue as soon as possible”. “All French vessels entitled to a licence should receive one,” it added. Its officials were involved in the deal with Jersey.Tensions over fishing rights have been simmering for months after the UK rejected requests by some small French boats to fish in British waters under the Brexit accord. Those who can prove they have fished historically are entitled to a licence to continue.Around 1,700 EU vessels have received licences but the dispute is over the right of fewer than 200 mostly French vessels to fish in waters six to 12 nautical miles off Britain’s shores, or in the seas off the island of Jersey.France claims that only half of those eligible had been given licences to continue fishing even after it had furnished data and documents of past fishing activity by these boats to support the applications.The commission and EU member states have yet to back France’s call for action against the UK, but Brussels has been examining evidence of historic fishing from French boats.Peter Ricketts, a former UK national security adviser, said: “This is not the way Britain and France should be dealing with each other. Rather than both sides trying to show how tough they are, we need quiet negotiations to work out a sensible compromise before this gets out of hand and starts to do real economic damage. Or in other words, some diplomacy.”
55  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.Moldova’s pro-EU government has fallen on hard times, with Russia’s Gazprom demanding weaker ties to the bloc if the country wants to renew its gas supply contract for the winter. Moldova’s Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita is in Brussels since yesterday to seek EU help. On the table is an initial payment of €60m, which is a good start but not even close to enough. We’re exploring why the EU is taking this piecemeal approach and what perspectives the country has further down the line.In Brexit news, France is threatening the UK with beefed up custom checks on imports and cutting off electricity supplies, after the two parties failed to agree on fishing rights.On the technology regulation front, more delays are ahead, allegedly because of an upcoming visit of the whistleblower responsible for Facebook’s latest troubles. We’ll look at what the real reasons for the delays are.And with Luxembourg’s Prime Minister Xavier Bettel in somewhat warmer but not exactly hot water over student-time plagiarism, I’ll check in on how the enfant terrible of European Council is faring compared with politicians next door in Germany.Desperately short of gas heading into winter and faced with geopolitical blackmail from its sole supplier, Russia’s Gazprom, Moldova might have been hoping for more than just €60m in emergency cash from its friends in the EU, write Henry Foy in Brussels and David Sheppard in London.The money, agreed yesterday at crisis talks between Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, is equivalent to about 20 days of gas supplies for the cash-strapped country. So if Chisinau is going to survive the winter without striking a deal with Moscow, they are hoping that this is the first of many cheques from Brussels.The former Soviet state declared a state of emergency this month after Gazprom cut supplies by a third and warned it would turn off the taps altogether if Moldova didn’t agree to a new deal at a vastly inflated price.Part of that is down to the market. Global gas prices have been squeezed higher by a supply shortage and Europe has been particularly hard hit. But part of it is political: Gazprom has tied cheaper gas to Chisinau repealing parts of its EU trade deal and reform measures agreed with Brussels. Talks in St Petersburg yesterday with the Kremlin-controlled company ended without a deal.Gavrilita’s newly elected, enthusiastically pro-EU government is desperate not to cave to Russian pressure. But the brutal truth is that winter is coming, and right now, gas isn’t. Moldova, excluding the Russian-controlled breakaway territory of Transnistria, needs at least 3m cubic metres of gas each day, which at current European benchmark market prices works out at a daily cost of roughly €3m, according to traders.Moldova has some financial flexibility but not enough to cover that for the next five months. Here’s where Brussels comes in. Von der Leyen has said the EU “stands with Moldova”, and has worked to make sure member states are ready to provide gas to Moldova — as Poland and Romania did this week. But given the shortage of gas across Europe, no one will be making shipments for free.“One of the big issues for Moldova is that the price they’ll get buying from European suppliers is almost certainly at least as high as they would get from Gazprom,” said Tom Marzec-Manser at ICIS, a consultancy. “The Russian view is that if Moldova wants to be more western then here’s the western price — as it’s Europe that pushed for hub-linked pricing in the first place.”Gavrilita knows that either selling out her western ambitions to Gazprom, imposing sky-high energy prices on Moldova’s 2.6m population this winter, or running out of gas would cripple her pro-EU administration just as it is getting started. Which means there had better be some more from where yesterday’s €60m grant came from.The prime minister said she was “deeply touched by the EU show of solidarity”. Back home, officials told Europe Express that it was “a symbolic amount” — but just the first step. Chisinau is also in talks to receive $85m from the IMF in December and €100m from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development before the end of the year, and is hopeful that the EU could provide multiples of those amounts in repayable loans.EU-Moldova talks continue today in the more formal Association Council meetings, where gas is officially just an agenda item. But don’t expect Gavrilita to spend much time on the rest of the topics — including political reforms and trade — getting enough cash to get enough gas to survive til spring is the only thing on her mind.Brussels found 66 countries with which it has enhanced trade arrangements have erected barriers that contravene them, according to a report by its chief trade enforcement officer. (More here)What to do when you run out of reasons why a piece of legislation is getting kicked in the long grass? Hide behind a hearing with a famous whistleblower, writes Javier Espinoza in Brussels.In theory, everyone in Brussels agrees the draft laws aimed at curbing the power of Big Tech must come into effect fast. Many argue that while lawmakers are fighting over the small print, big players such as Google and Facebook are rapidly scooping up smaller competitors and conquering markets.But that small print is still hampering a unified view in the European parliament needed for negotiations to start in earnest with member states and the European Commission. The parliament has postponed a key vote next month that would have consolidated that common position — officially because Frances Haugen, a Facebook whistleblower who has helped trigger the company’s worst crisis since Cambridge Analytica, is visiting the European parliament then her views must be heard before the vote.That may be partially true. But the lack of consensus over which companies should fall under the scope of the new legislation was the main reason for the delay, according to multiple people with intimate knowledge of the discussions among European lawmakers.Evelyne Gebhardt, a German MEP involved in the discussions said it plainly after a key meeting on Tuesday did not yield satisfactory results: “We agreed that we disagree.”The sticking points? The Socialists are pushing for smaller companies, not just Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, to be included — for instance Booking.com. But the largest group in the parliament, the centre-right European People’s party, is opposing this.The commission, which originally proposed the new rules, is worried where the debate is heading. A senior EU official told Europe Express that they were worried the Socialists and Democrats were “having a parallel discussion and trying to turn the legislation into consumer protection law, which it is not”.There are some silver linings. Already two committees with representatives from both the EPP and the S&D have reached compromises. Rasmus Andresen, a German Green MEP, said these compromises should be used as a blueprint to move towards a solid parliamentary position. “We need more compromises to ensure we have a strong majority. The key is to end up with a united parliament,” he said.Just don’t expect things to move fast as we see the first of potentially more delays. “Rushing too much risks defective laws. We need to make the DMA future proof,” said Paul Tang, a Dutch MEP with the Socialists.And it’s not just the parliament that needs to move but also member states, which have yet to agree on a common position, and are still being lobbied to make changes to the draft. A group of chief executives from eight tech companies, including the Netherlands’ Booking and Germany’s Zalando, wrote to EU economy ministers yesterday, warning that the Digital Markets Act risked undermining European companies by capturing more groups than it intended.More delays, whistleblowers or not, were “very likely”, said a seasoned Brussels observer.Luxembourg’s Prime Minister Xavier Bettel is known for his quirky, candid and sometimes abrasive comments when he joins fellow EU leaders at summits or when he hosted UK PM Boris Johnson for talks that ended so acrimoniously Bettel held a press conference alongside an empty podium set.Yesterday, the reason he became viral on social media wasn’t health-related (he contracted Covid-19 this summer and had to be hospitalised). It was because he had allegedly copy-pasted the vast majority of his 1999 thesis at a French university, at the end of a programme equivalent to a masters degree today, according to an investigation by Reporter.lu.Out of the 56 pages Bettel wrote on the topic of EU election reform, only two — the introduction and conclusion sections — were not plagiarised, the investigation revealed, and 20 pages were lifted straight from the European parliament’s website.Bettel did not deny the plagiarism accusations and said the university should review whether the paper still meets the criteria in force at the time: “From today’s point of view, I recognise that it could have — yes, maybe should have been done differently,” he said.His laid-back attitude and the low likelihood that any of this will have political consequences for him stand in stark contrast with politicians in neighbouring Germany, where even the faintest hint of plagiarism can completely annihilate careers.German Green co-leader Annalena Baerbock’s lacklustre election performance was in part because of accusations that she failed to correctly attribute several passages in her book that were lifted from other sources.Other politicians, including ministers who were at some point in line to become Angela Merkel’s successor, had to step down because of plagiarism. Case in point: Former defence minister Karl zu Guttenberg (full name: Karl-Theodor Maria Nikolaus Johann Jacob Philipp Franz Joseph Sylvester Buhl-Freiherr von und zu Guttenberg) had to step down in 2011 from all political posts after it emerged he plagiarised his PhD thesis.When explaining himself yesterday, Bettel said he wrote the paper “to the best of my abilities” — the exact wording zu Guttenberg used 10 years ago, as Luxembourg reporter Diego Velazquez pointed out.An appeasing reaction came also from the French professor who was Bettel’s supervisor at l’Université de Lorraine in Nancy. Etienne Criqui told Paperjam that there was no possibility at the time to use IT programs to detect plagiarism. “One shouldn’t judge something that was done over 20 years ago,” he said.
56  Ankara is seeking to play down the damage caused by Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s threat to expel 10 ambassadors, despite a carefully choreographed climbdown that averted the worst crisis in decades between Turkey and the west.But the episode creates awkward mood music just when Turkey is trying to forge better relations with Joe Biden and hopes for a meeting with the US president on the sidelines of the upcoming COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.Top of Ankara’s agenda is a request to buy several dozen new F-16 fighter jets to fill a gap in its air force that analysts say could help prevent Turkey — widely viewed as an important buffer between Europe and the Middle East — from turning to Russia instead. But much will depend on Biden’s attitude towards the Turkish leader after their nations narrowly avoided a diplomatic catastrophe.“A crisis of perhaps unprecedented magnitude was possible if this problem was not resolved,” said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, Ankara director of the German Marshall Fund, a US think-tank. “But [the fact] that it is resolved does not mean it hasn’t left a bitter aftertaste.”Turkey’s relations with its traditional Nato allies were already strained before Erdogan was so enraged by a joint statement by envoys from 10 nations, including the US, that he called for their expulsion from the country.The Turkish president’s profound misgivings about the US were likely to have been worsened by their co-ordinated show of support for Osman Kavala, a jailed philanthropist, said Aaron Stein, director of the Middle East programme at the Philadelphia-based Foreign Policy Research Institute.Kavala, who was detained in 2017 and denies charges of seeking to overthrow the Turkish government, is seen in the west as a political prisoner. His release has been demanded by the European Court of Human Rights.But the Turkish president has described him as a “terrorist” and his angry response to the 10 nations’ call for a “just and speedy” resolution to Kavala’s case was “not actually irrational if you accept he thinks the west is trying to overthrow him”, Stein said.A diplomatic meltdown was averted after both sides ceded ground. The US offered a way out by declaring its commitment to a Vienna Convention clause stipulating the duty of diplomats not to interfere in other nations’ internal affairs. That enabled Erdogan to walk back from his expulsion threat.Ankara was cheered that mediation efforts were spearheaded by the US ambassador to Turkey, David Satterfield, according to several people familiar with the Turkish government’s thinking.In remarks published by Turkish media on Wednesday, Erdogan said he believed Biden decided to “display courtesy” by offering an olive branch. He added that he expected to sit down with Biden in Glasgow. However, a meeting has not been confirmed by the White House.High on any US agenda would be Afghanistan and efforts to secure flight operations at Kabul airport, which Turkey has expressed willingness to support. Washington also wants to discuss Ukraine and Syria.Ankara, meanwhile, is seeking to buy around 80 new US-made F-16 fighter jets and F-16 modernisation kits to upgrade its air force. Turkey, which has Nato’s second largest military, has relied on an ageing fleet after the US barred it from taking delivery of over 100 next-generation F-35 aircraft in punishment for its purchase of an S-400 air-defence system from Russia.Erdogan has hinted that he could buy Russian fighter jets if the request is turned down, alarming Nato allies already concerned about the S-400 acquisition.The US Department of State has acknowledged Turkey’s request for F-16s. Ankara argues the $1.4bn it has already paid into the F-35 programme could be redirected to F-16 purchases. Washington is seeking to resolve the F-35 dispute but has “not made any financing offers” on Turkey’s F-16 request, according to the US state department.A key stumbling block is that any F-16 sale would need the approval of Congress. Unluhisarcikli said there was a strong US national security argument in favour of the deal that could be used by the White House to persuade sceptical members of Congress, but questioned whether Biden would want to spend political capital on Turkey’s behalf.Asli Aydintasbas, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, predicted that Washington would nevertheless seek congressional support for the deal. “The F-16s are seen as a way to improve the relationship by the Americans,” she said. “They want to engage in this process as much as Turks do.”A senior Biden administration official did not comment on the F-16 discussions but said the administration sought to bolster relations with Turkey because it is “a longtime Nato ally” that is “strategically located” and involved in many of Washington’s regional interests.“We continue to seek co-operation where we can and push back where we need to,” said the official.But others were more circumspect. One person familiar with discussions within the Biden administration said that many US officials who believe in engaging with Erdogan had lost ground as a result of the debacle.“This is really a blow to the US-Turkish relationship overall, and especially given that the blow came to the state department,” said the person, adding that it was the agency that most supported strong bilateral ties with Turkey.James Jeffrey, an advocate of good relations with Ankara during his time as a diplomat in the Bush, Obama and Trump administrations, said Erdogan’s expulsion threat had blown over but showed his “instincts are to provoke his western allies, not his Russian and Iranian foes”.“Realistically, Nato and Turkey need each other,” he said. “But Erdogan’s instinct to punch his western partners in the eye — a combination of his own ideology and the feelings of his political base — poisons what should otherwise be a good relationship.”Additional reporting by Ayla Jean Yackley
57  This season’s treadmill of back-to-back art fairs — Art Basel, Frieze in London and then Fiac in Paris — may have tempered the high-level sales in the French capital but didn’t prevent the latest event retaining its cachet. Many international exhibitors hopped straight from London to Paris, where a high proportion (about a quarter) of the 171 galleries were from France. National support came from the top: President Emmanuel Macron made a glowing speech at a reception hosted for the fair at the Elysée Palace on October 20.The weighty, thoughtful art at Fiac reflected the strong museum shows in town and the demands of the fair’s more local audience. “Our public is extremely knowledgeable and expects to see good things. We are told if they don’t,” said Susie Guzman, senior director at Paris’s Jocelyn Wolff gallery. Their works included Francisco Tropa’s “Gigante” (2018), a bronze replica of all the bones in the human body, originally activated at the Centre Pompidou, which sold to a private collection in Paris (€55,000).The fair was in a new venue, the Grand Palais Éphémère, where it will stay until 2024 while the original Grand Palais is restored in time for the Olympic Games that year. “Nothing compares to the Grand Palais,” said Clément Delépine, artistic director at Galerie Mitterrand, a space founded by the nephew of a previous French president. But Delépine and others were relatively happy with the temporary location, which offers a striking view of the Eiffel Tower at the back. Overall the city was again abuzz, with new gallery openings including Gagosian, Skarstedt and Cécile Fakhoury.“There is a cultural renaissance in Paris, which goes beyond the effects of Brexit. We realise you can be in this world as a guest, not just as a conqueror,” Delépine said. At Fiac, his gallery was showing works by the late land artist Dennis Oppenheim (€100,000 each).One gallerist very glad to be back on the art fair circuit is Joumana Asseily, director of Beirut’s Marfa’ Projects. The six-year-old gallery for emerging artists takes its name from the city’s port neighbourhood and was destroyed in the August 2020 blast that killed more than 200 people. Gallery staff were not in the building at the time because of Covid-19 restrictions, Asseily says.She says the impetus to restart her business came from the wider international gallery community: she was asked to show in Galleries Curate, a pooling of 21 hybrid commercial art exhibitions that was one of many collaborative initiatives to stem from a pandemic-inspired WhatsApp group.“They knew what had happened to our gallery and gave us a reason to rebuild. I was very touched. We knew we were not alone,” Asseily says. She has since become a member of the organising committee for the new International Galleries Alliance. From Fiac, she reported sales from all four of her artists shown (€3,000-€20,000).Six galleries in the US and Europe are joining forces on coinciding shows that span 30 years of work by the contemporary New York artist Rochelle Feinstein. Each opens a dedicated exhibition between the end of January and early February 2022, and each with recent works based on a historic project (You Again, price range $35,000-$100,000). The six-venue show is “an extension of Rochelle’s mode of working. She is constantly expanding on and challenging the structures around painting, exhibiting and display,” says Candice Madey, who opens her Feinstein show on January 28.Madey will be joined by fellow Lower East Side gallerist Bridget Donahue as well as Hannah Hoffman in Los Angeles, Nina Johnson in Miami, Campoli Presti in Paris and Francesca Pia in Zurich. The all-female collaboration came about organically, Madey says, though she resists any sense of a wider trend. “We’ve all worked with Rochelle in some capacity; this originates with her,” Madey says.The business of advising artists and their estates after they die has extended beyond the remit of a gallery. In the US, art adviser Allan Schwartzman says he has been pleasantly surprised by the number of business coming the way of his new firm, Schwartzman & Associates. “The estates of the first wave of baby-boomer artists from the 1970s and 1980s are now sitting on supplies of great value. The need to help them through the nuances of the art market has accelerated even more than I expected,” he says. He is currently working with the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation and the estate of Conrad Marca-Relli, among others.In the UK, last month also marked the launch of Artistate, a collaboration between law and tax experts with the London gallerist John Martin. “It is not simply the Herculean task of sorting out a chaotic studio, cataloguing works and archives but retrieving works on consignment, going about the business of disposing of them and managing royalties. This can become too much for the family,” Martin says.Aristate offers an initial consultation for £250, “not so much for all of us together”, semi-jokes Pierre Valentin, co-founder of Artistate and a partner at the law firm Constantine Cannon. He and Schwartzman emphasise that they work alongside, rather than in competition with, art galleries.And finally . . . a painting that the BBC television programme Fake or Fortune? reattributed to the 19th-century Orientalist Jean-Léon Gérôme sold for £75,000 (£94,500 with fees) at Sotheby’s online on Tuesday. Its seller, Jon Swihart — an artist and confessed Gérôme devotee — bought the work at auction in New York for $6,325 in 1999, when it was catalogued as from the “Circle of Gérôme”, based on an expert’s downgrade at the time.Subsequent research organised by the Fake or Fortune? team and aired in August included an examination under light and comparisons with authenticated works. “At Prayer” (1858) was then reappraised by the Gérôme authority Emily Weeks who found “no doubt” that it was an early work by the French artist.

58  Spain’s leftwing government has backtracked on a high-profile levy on electricity companies’ “excess profits” after the sector said the measure put future investment at risk.A government decree this week revised the rules for the levy, which officials had previously forecast could be worth between €2.6bn and more than €5bn during the six months it would have been in force but which is now set to raise a fraction of that amount.The move comes as Spain faces pressure from other fronts over its stance on electricity prices, a red-hot political issue domestically. Spain was isolated at an EU ministers meeting this week when it suggested revisions to the bloc’s energy pricing regime.The excess profits levy was at the heart of Pedro Sánchez’s government’s effort to contend with record-high electricity prices — which in turn are largely caused by the soaring price of gas.But, in an interview with the Financial Times, Ignacio Galán, chair and chief executive of Spanish utility Iberdrola, said as a result of this week’s changes the levy’s impact on his group would be “null or minimal” — essentially because the tax will no longer be applied when electricity is sold on the long-term market at fixed rather than spot rates.He added that €114m of provisioning that Iberdrola put aside in September to pay for two weeks of the levy would now be returned to the group’s general funds by the end of the year. Iberdrola had previously expected the levy would cost it €2bn during the six months to the end of March.The government, which has accused the electricity companies of opacity, maintains it is too soon to predict the changes’ impact.The levy was designed to hit energy groups that benefited from high electricity prices but whose costs were not affected by the rising price of gas.However, energy companies argued that not only did the levy jeopardise future investment, but that, as originally framed, it was imposed on fictitious profits, since most electricity is sold on the forward market — a factor taken into account by this week’s changes.“For those of us who have sold all our energy at fixed prices — and for next year we have 96 per cent of our contracts sold at fixed prices not linked to the spot price — it [the levy] will have no impact,” Galán said of the revised decree.Iberdrola and other energy companies had previously argued that the levy forced them to renegotiate contracts and raise prices for industrial users.Galán added: “The decree [that initially imposed the levy last month] generated a situation of uncertainty; investors wanted certainty, and so we had to reanalyse all our plans. But now that the situation has been clarified, our plans are unchanged.” Noting Iberdrola’s worldwide investments this year of €10bn, not including an €8bn acquisition in the US, he said: “We can only raise this demanding quantity of funds if there is stability, predictability and rule of law.”Iberdrola, the world’s third-biggest utility and a self-styled champion of renewables, had been at the forefront of denunciations of the levy, which was also fiercely criticised by groups such as Endesa, the Spanish subsidiary of Enel, and Eurelectric, the pan-European industry group.Endesa has now welcomed the revisions to the levy as “rational”.Spain’s leftwing coalition had intended to use the funds to help shield consumer from rising prices, in a country where tariffs paid by 40 per cent of households are linked to spot market rates. According to Standard & Poor’s research, even before the pandemic Spaniards spent proportionally much more than elsewhere in Europe on electricity — an average of more than 8 per cent of net disposable income.Adding to the pressure on the Spanish government, Algeria, the country’s main gas supplier, has said it will close a pipeline via Morocco from Monday, although it plans to keep Spain supplied using a lower-capacity pipeline that does not pass through its North African rival, with which it cut diplomatic ties in August.
59  That coalition — struck between the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the anti-immigration League party of Matteo Salvini — attacked Brussels and pledged to increase Italy’s state spending. Some saw it as an existential threat to the eurozone itself.Now, the League, still led by Salvini, has returned to power, but inside thegovernment of national unity being led by Mario Draghi — who, as the former president of the European Central Bank and saviour of single currency, is the personification of pro-European technocracy.The League’s pivot from populist rabble-rousers to apparent pro-Europeans may appear somewhat confusing. However, the key to understanding this transformation is Giancarlo Giorgetti, minister for economic development and number two in the party.While Salvini is better known outside Italy, Giorgetti — a 54-year-old veteran who has been an MP since 1996 — is powerful in his party and has been instrumental in its change in strategy.In the current coalition, Draghi has asked him to play a crucial part in shaping Italy’s industrial future policy, as part of the national investment and reform plan. Salvini, by contrast, holds no ministerial role.Giorgetti has also openly disagreed with Salvini on important policy matters, such as compulsory vaccines, and serves as a counterbalance to Salvini’s more radical instincts. He argues that the Draghi reforms will be critical in reversing more than two decades of economic stagnation.“Above all, we are trying to construct a regulatory framework that is certain for investment,” he says. “We are completely changing the way the Italian public administration works. We are also making a huge effort to reform the justice system, to speed up trials and be faster and more efficient”.Giorgetti is optimistic that the Draghi plans will work. Alongside former Vodafone CEO and innovation minister Vittorio Colao, he has launched a plan to speed up the rollout of high-speed internet technology across Italy and launch a national cloud-computing programme.Giorgetti is frank, too, in acknowledging that Italy finds itself in a rare moment of stability. “We are in a situation that is particularly favourable in terms of borrowing costs,” he says.Still, while Italy was far from alone in having its economy ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic, it differs from other large European countries in having no recent record of recovering from a crisis. GDP today remains below where it was before the global financial crisis of 2008. Why, then, will this time be different?Giorgetti argues that just as important as Italy’s reform programme is the fact that European budget rules are allowing the country’s government to invest in the future.“In the past 20 years, we have paid the price of an austerity programme and budget rules in Europe that have been greater than other countries,” he says. “We can be much more agile now in investing. The pauperisation of countries has ended . . . we can use our resources in a much more intelligent way.”Just three years ago, Brussels chided Rome for attempting marginally to increase its budget deficit. Today, under Draghi and in the Covid-19 crisis all constraints have been suspended.“The picture is different,” Giorgetti says. “What was once taboo is no longer a taboo”.He believes that, with Draghi at the helm, Italy can have a more powerful voice in European industrial and budgetary policy than in the past. “With the elections in Germany and France, Italy can be an important protagonist in shaping the rules,” he says. “Under the leadership of Draghi, Italy can play a different role than before.”Giorgetti epitomises his party’s more centrist, pragmatic wing, rooted in its traditional base of northern Italian business rather than Salvini’s anti-migration tirades and pan-Italian nationalism.While Salvini became known as a sovereigntist for his “Italians First” rhetoric, as well as his flirtations with Putin’s Russia, Giorgetti is explicit about the importance of Italy’s place in the EU and its commitment to Nato.We have paid the price of an austerity programme. We can be much more agile nowHe believes in European state-aid rules being adjusted to allow countries to strengthen their industrial bases. However, on matters of defence, he says that Europe must keep co-operating closely with the US and, while Italy will always be collaborative, it must act in the interests of its own national champion companies, such as Leonardo.“I don’t think that Europe can be independent from the US in terms of its defence policy, so we have to continue to play a game that is global,” he says.Giorgetti also represents the fragility of political equilibrium in Italy. Soon after his interview with the FT, he told an Italian newspaper that he would favour Draghi leaving his role and becoming Italy’s president, opening the way for the country to hold elections.For now, Draghi’s personal plans remain secret. However, anyone betting on the country’s political future should also watch Giorgetti: the direction of Italy’s rightwing may depend on the balance of power between him and Salvini within the League.
60  “I told them that, if it had been like that, we would have been in the middle of a trade war with the UK,” said Gabriella Migliore, who runs a Brexit help-desk at the Italian Trade Agency, or Agenzia ICE, speaking at a conference this year.Instead, thanks to a last-minute EU-UK trade deal brokered in December 2020, tariff-free trade continued. Nevertheless, Italian exports to the UK have taken a hit — dropping sharply last year with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, and now recovering at a slower pace than in other key markets.SACE, the Italian credit export agency, expects growth of 5.3 per cent in Italian exports to the UK in 2021, but does not anticipate a recovery to pre-Covid levels until 2023. By contrast, it predicts the gap will be closed this year with Germany, France, the US and Japan, with double-digit increases in exports to their markets.So, is UK trade falling behind because of Brexit? “It is somewhat premature to draw conclusions . . . but it may be a good clue,” says Fabrizio Botti, an international economics expert at the IAI think-tank in Rome.In the first seven months of 2021, the UK was the sixth-largest market for “Made in Italy” products and accounted for Italy’s third-largest trade surplus after the US and Switzerland. Typical Italian exports to Britain — which peaked at more than €25bn in 2019 — include machinery, cars and car parts, pharmaceuticals, clothing, furniture, food, wine, clothing and fashion.Brexit has introduced significant administrative burdens for Italian exporters, though, with paperwork and confusion about regulatory changes. That includes the UKCA product-safety mark for goods and services, brought in to replace the old CE mark in 2021. Compulsory use of the mark has now been largely postponed to 2023.Even so, there is broad optimism — or, at least, hope — among Italian business leaders and policymakers that the UK will remain an important trading partner in future.“Our paperwork production has increased,” says Annibale Pancrazio, the third-generation boss of Pancrazio, a family business that has long exported tinned food to the UK. “It is really a nuisance,” he says, noting that dealing with it “might sometimes require staff to stay late in the evening”. But Pancrazio, based near the Amalfi coast in southern Italy, does not consider Brexit an insurmountable obstacle.“The Brits remain an attractive market . . . they may cook tomato sauce worse than us, but we don’t care as long as they keep buying it from us,” he says.Food exporters are among those who have fared reasonably well on the UK market, partly thanks to panic supermarket buying during the pandemic.SACE says it is the only export sector that kept growing through 2020 — and it is expected to grow further, at a rate of 2 to 3 per cent in the next two years.On the other hand, sales of motor vehicles and machinery were the category worst affected by the Covid pandemic and are struggling to regain ground, according to the agency.For Francesco Padovan, export manager for Coster Group, a Milan-based supplier of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems with a branch in the English East Midlands, Brexit has “essentially been a bureaucratic and logistical challenge”. But the company worked hard to prepare for it, and will continue investing in Britain.“Delivery times have nearly doubled and the cost is also very different,” he says. Yet “the UK is and will remain one of our main focuses,” with specific market products in the pipeline. Padovan says his company plans to expand its UK workforce. “We see the glass half-full and not half-empty,” he says.The Brits may cook tomato sauce worse than us, but we don’t care as long as they keep buying it from usNicola Piovesana, an export manager who works for Serena Wines, a leading producer of Prosecco, agrees. “So far, our biggest problem has been Covid rather than Brexit,” he says. The company lost three months’ business in early 2021 to UK lockdowns. “Once the country reopened, our sales have been very, very strong . . . in terms of volumes, we are absolutely satisfied.”Serena mainly supplies the hospitality sector and hopes to return to pre-Covid levels of UK sales by the end of the year. But looking ahead, Piovesana is less ebullient: he says the shortage of truck drivers that is affecting the UK economy “is starting to become a huge problem” which could turn it into “a less interesting country”.For some, the question is whether there might one day be a way back from Brexit. “For now, it’s done, but perhaps this may change in a generation or two,” says Massimo Ungaro, a London-based lawmaker for Italy’s ruling Democratic party, who represents Italians living abroad. “Besides, they [the Brits] haven’t yet seen its true cost.”
61  There are signs of hope, particularly in the so-called “Motor Valley” district around the northern Italian cities of Modena and Bologna, home to supercar manufacturers Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Pagani and their top-end suppliers.“There is a lack of awareness among our businesses with respect to the changes that are happening,” says Anna Moretti, a business management professor at Venice’s Ca’ Foscari university and co-editor of a report published this month on the state of the Italian auto parts industry.The fact that Ferrari, a brand beloved by petrolheads, is working to introduce a fully electric model by 2025 gives a sense of the transformation the industry is grappling with.In July, Italy’s environment minister Roberto Cingolani quipped that the prancing horse marque and the rest of Italy’s Motor Valley risked shutdown if they failed to adapt to the EU’s draft plan to phase out fossil-fuel engines from new cars by 2035.One of the most alarming findings from Moretti’s “Observatory on the Italian Automotive Components Sector” report is that Italian auto-parts makers reduced their spending on research and development in 2020 — a change probably influenced by last year’s coronavirus disruptions.“It is the first time that we have observed this, and it is very worrying,” Moretti says.The report found that the share of firms that reinvested part of their turnover in R&D fell to 69.4 per cent last year, almost four percentage points down from 2019.The publication also found that the combined turnover of more than 2,200 businesses active in the industry fell below €45bn in 2020 — down 11.9 per cent on the previous year and primarily as a result of the pandemic.Italy’s car-parts makers are mostly small, family-owned and concentrated in the north. And their recovery is hampered by problems affecting suppliers the world over, such as a shortage of computer chips, higher prices for raw materials and shipping, and the accelerating switch towards hybrid, electric and self-driving technologies.They also have to deal with the consequences of the recent merger between Fiat Chrysler and France’s PSA. There are fears that Stellantis, as the new company is known, will be less focused than its Italian-American parent was on Fiat’s old industrial base in Italy.Moretti talks about a “dual-speed” situation, with half of Italian auto-components businesses investing, innovating and holding their own in the global marketplace, while the other half are not doing enough and falling behind class-leading German rivals.She says opening up to outside co-operation in order to innovate, and forming inter-firm networks, is the best way out of the morass. But too many entrepreneurs are resistant to the idea. An exception is Florenzo Vanzetto, CEO and owner of VRM, a Motor Valley producer of auto and motorcycle parts that works with the likes of Ferrari, BMW, Ducati and Triumph.He says establishing RaceBO — a network of suppliers based around Bologna — was crucial to business growth.“I put together a group of companies, each supplying one another and none in direct competition,” he explains. “This helped us win a lot of business abroad . . . I couldn’t have won an order from a client like BMW on my own but, if you talk to them as part of a network of suppliers, it is different.”Vanzetto, who controls Marzocchi, a suspensions manufacturer he rescued from bankruptcy in 2016, plus RCM, a maker of engine and transmission components, expects turnover to grow from €85m to €110m this year.I couldn’t have won an order from BMW on my own, but if you talk to them as part of a network of suppliers, it is differentHowever, he is also bracing for a big squeeze on margins due to spiralling prices for raw materials and shipments from key suppliers in the Far East. “It is a disaster,” he says.Nevertheless, VRM looks to be on a solid footing, with factories working at full capacity.Vanzetto puts it down to the “cast-iron decision” to work solely as a tier-1 (ie, direct) supplier to carmakers; to the reinvestment of “at least 15 per cent” of turnover on new technologies and production systems; and to a deal with a technical college in southern Italy that helps the company recruit specialised workers who are otherwise in short supply.Still, big challenges lie ahead, for his business and the industry as a whole. “We make 150,000 cylinder heads per year, and if that line of business is going to disappear [with electric mobility], we must be quick to diversify,” he says, outlining a future for VRM focused on the production of body frame components and suspension systems.“It’s not going to be so quick and easy,” Vanzetto predicts.For relatively niche players like VRM, who work at the top end of the market, the transition is likely to be tough but manageable.For the rest of the Italian car component industry, perhaps less so.
62  Now, more than six months after Draghi was thrust from retirement into becoming Italy’s prime minister, expectations for what he can achieve are high.In February, he was called in by President Sergio Mattarella to form an emergency national unity government. As a result, Italy now has an experienced leader who has vowed to use more than €200bn of EU recovery money to transform the country’s stagnant and heavily indebted economy.The Draghi plan, which will mix ambitious investment with sweeping reforms addressing Italy’s most intractable problems — such as its slow legal system and bloated bureaucracy — promises to reposition the eurozone’s third-biggest economy as no longer a sluggish underperformer but an engine for growth.Already, in his short time in office, leading a coalition supported by all but one of Italy’s largest political parties, Draghi has successfully vaccinated a large majority of the country against Covid-19, won European approval for his multiyear spending and reform plan, and established Rome as an influential voice on the international stage.When Angela Merkel steps down as German chancellor, Italy will be able to lay claim to having the most internationally respected leader in the EU. Italian officials speak of the calls Draghi has held with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin and China’s President Xi Jinping as chair of this year’s G20 summit, and the dinners he has had with President Emmanuel Macron of France that ran late into the evening — the relationship blossoming between the leaders after years of frostiness between Paris and Rome.Yet there is also a sense of fear. The consequences of what Draghi is attempting to achieve extend beyond the borders of his own country. What will it mean for Italy, and for Europe, if Draghi fails? And, if the ultimate European technocrat cannot pull this off — especially with more than €200bn of EU recovery money, ultra-low interest rates and a suspension of any spending limits from Brussels — who can?So far, Italy’s economic rebound from the shock of the pandemic has been robust. However, beyond an immediate bounce, the true test will be whether Draghi’s leadership can bring about something that no other Italian government in recent history has managed: growth.The economy has not grown in real terms since the turn of the millennium. While Spain rebounded from the European debt crisis, the Italian economy remains smaller than it was in 2011.Following the pandemic, the Italian debt-to-GDP ratio has grown to more than 160 per cent — a number that will come down as the economy recovers but significant and sustained growth will be needed if it is to fall in a meaningful way.In the context of the broader EU, the success of Italy’s use of recovery funds may also come to determine whether the bloc chooses to embark on ambitious joint spending initiatives. Should the Italian reforms fail, and the money is seen to be wasted, then convincing so-called “frugal” northern European sceptics may be impossible.Draghi’s advisers are cautious, but also optimistic.“Growth is strong as we are coming out of a big hole,” says Francesco Giavazzi, an economic adviser to the Draghi government. “But Italy has had essentially zero economic growth since the mid-1990s. The issue is: will we go back to zero growth, or will we move to a growth path that makes the debt sustainable?”Giavazzi, who gained his PhD in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology a few years after Draghi in the late 1970s, believes that the combination of spending and targeted reforms offers a unique opportunity to alter Italy’s economic trajectory.“This plan provides a mixture of reforms and investment,” he point out. “In the past, we had no reforms as the country was unable to reform, and little investment as there was a budget constraint. Now, for once, we have the two things at the same time.”While Draghi has continued to enjoy high approval ratings from voters — who will almost certainly never get a chance to vote for him, as he never plans to run for office — most economists agree that it is too early to say if the plan will work.“The economic momentum in the short term is quite strong,” says Nicola Nobile of Oxford Economics. “Many international commentators have been saying this time is probably different, but I don’t know. We are in wait-and-see mode.”While international investor sentiment appears more optimistic than at arguably any time since the financial crisis, there has not so far been any tangible surge of foreign capital into Italy.The Draghi plan, according to data, has yet to convince foreign investors to snap up Italian government debt — although, given the meagre interest rates on offer across all European government bonds, this may have little to do with perceptions of Draghi’s chances of success.According to Bank of Italy data, the amount of Italian public debt held by foreign investors stands at around 30 per cent, down from around 35 per cent in 2015 and 40 per cent in 2010.In the short term, the unknown is how long the Draghi government will last. Italy’s President Mattarella — the man who was instrumental in putting Draghi in office this year — steps down in 2022.There has been much speculation in Rome about whether Draghi will then take the opportunity to step up to replace Mattarella as president, or whether he will instead decide to remain as prime minister until the end of the current parliament, a year later, in 2023.A further uncertainty is for how long the unlikely political bedfellows that make up the current Draghi coalition — it includes Matteo Salvini’s populist rightwing League as well as the centre-left Democratic party among others — will stay on board.Even if Draghi does not achieve everything he is aiming for, just completing some of the plan will make a significant differenceShould a resumption of hostilities break the coalition apart, then new elections could be called before the scheduled poll in 2023 and Draghi, who will not run for election, will be ejected from office prematurely.At the least, many are hoping that even if Draghi does not achieve everything he is aiming for, just completing some of the plan will make a significant difference.But even enacting small, lasting changes in a country that has resisted reform for decades represents a daunting task.“Italy is a very old country, and one with many problems,” observes Nobile. “To me, it looks unlikely that any government can massively change the entire structure of the Italian economy in just one or two years.”
63  When Fiorentina, the team based in Florence that plays in Serie A, Italian football’s top division, was for sale in 2019, Commisso rushed to complete a deal reported to have been worth between $150m and $200m.“The right price came along and I made the investment in a period of two weeks,” Commisso told the recent FT Business of Sport US summit. He believes Fiorentina should be more than just a personal trophy; he wants it to be an asset that increases in value, too.That aim is shared by other overseas investors who have bought into Italian football in recent years. The influx of foreign club owners is a new phenomenon in the country, particularly compared with the English Premier League, the world’s most valuable domestic football contest, which has long welcomed outside cash.Of the 20 Serie A clubs, eight now have non-Italian owners. Six of those were acquired by American individuals or financial groups in the past three years alone.Among the recent deals were hedge fund Elliott Management’s takeover of AC Milan in 2018; billionaire Dan Friedkin’s €591m acquisition of AS Roma; and the 777 Partners sports investment fund purchase of Genoa this year.“I think it’s one of the most exciting football leagues today in the world,” says Robert Platek, a senior executive at MSD Capital, a group that has lent money to European football clubs but who, in a personal capacity, acquired the small club Spezia in February. “The Italians are so passionate about their sport. More specifically, with Spezia, it was the region, the people and it was the underdog approach.”Investors are attracted to Italian football by the league’s status as one of the “Big Five” European leagues — alongside those of England, Spain, Germany and France. They attract the largest media rights and sponsorship deals. Their competitions have international fanbases with continued growth in viewership in North America and Asia.Commisso says the rush to acquire clubs in Italy is a matter of “supply and demand”, estimating that there are more wealthy individuals seeking to buy clubs than there are teams across Europe available for purchase.“I think there’s going to be more investors coming in to buy more of these clubs that are available for sale,” he says.Yet, after rushing into Italian football, Commisso admits to being stymied by challenges that are unique to the country. As a legacy of the construction involved to host the 1990 World Cup, many top clubs pay rent to play in crumbling, government-owned stadiums. Grounds are rarely full, partly because sometimes-violent “ultra” fan-groups put families off from attending matches.New owners seeking to fund rebuilds of stadiums in cities such as Milan and Rome have been delayed by local political wrangling. Commisso sought to renovate Fiorentina’s home ground, the Stadio Artemio Franchi, to gain more ticketing and hospitality revenues that could benefit the club in the long term, but his efforts have been blocked by local authorities who own the stadium.“One of the huge negatives in Italy has been the infrastructure situation,” he says. “It’s the inability of anyone like myself to be able to say: I want to build a new stadium so I can bring — not only the comfort to our fans — but raise more money out of the stadium investment. That’s pretty difficult to do in Italy.”The pandemic is causing new financial problems. Clubs across the continent lost a collective €9bn in revenues due to lost ticketing and broadcasting revenues, according to Uefa, European football’s governing body.Most Italian clubs spend the majority of income on players’ wages and transfer fees, as do clubs across EuropeThe resulting financial crisis has been exacerbated at many of Italy’s highly indebted clubs, such as Inter Milan and Sampdoria, which had previously spent heavily on players. These clubs are among those forced into emergency fundraisings, a fire sale of their best footballers, or a process of finding new club owners.Meanwhile, the value of Serie A’s broadcast rights has fallen, with media analysts suggesting traditional pay-TV companies have hit the limit of what they are willing to pay for live sports.In March, the league sold its domestic television contracts for more than €2.5bn, in a deal led by DAZN, the sports streaming service. But the overall amount raised by the sale of the country’s TV rights covering the 2021-24 seasons is less than Serie A’s previous deal, worth about €1bn a season.In March, the league said that it expected a significant drop in the future value of its international TV contracts, currently worth $170m a season. That was mainly because Qatar-based broadcaster beIN Sports declined to renew its contract to screen matches in the Middle East, complaining that Serie A had not done enough to tackle piracy of broadcasts.“Our biggest problem is beIN,” said Luigi de Servio, the Serie A chief executive at the time. “BeIN was worth 50 per cent of our [international TV rights] package.” A quick influx of cash to support clubs has been sought by the league — but has not been forthcoming.Last year, Serie A negotiated a €1.6bn deal to sell 10 per cent of its broadcasting and commercial rights to a consortium including private equity groups CVC Capital Partners and Advent International and Italian investment group Fondo FSI. But the deal appears to have been abandoned due to a lack of support among rival club owners who do not want to give up control over the league’s operations, according to several people familiar with the talks.Commisso is among those demanding better financial controls to limit spending. As is the case across Europe, most Italian clubs spend the majority of their income on players’ wages and transfer fees.There are few signs such spending controls will be forthcoming. And little chance for a quick return on investment from private equity suitors or TV deals. Facing a tough outlook for short-term growth, new overseas club owners will need to play the long game.
64  A lack of interest from international businesses has meant missed growth opportunities. Foreign investors, an important source of jobs, innovation, higher wages and economic growth, have largely neglected the eurozone’s second largest manufacturing producer.However, some experts say there are reasons for optimism in the €205bn investment from the NextGenerationEU recovery plan that Italy could receive over the next five years to build a greener, more digital and more sustainable economy.With reforms planned over the next five years, “foreign investors will come back,” reckons Emma Marcegaglia, chair of the B20 international business summit, a G20 business forum.She says foreign investment in Italy has been low because the country’s civil justice system is inefficient, there is too much red tape, and the fiscal situation is unattractive — contributing to a poor reputation overall.All of these problems are now being addressed under the recovery plan and with the leadership of Mario Draghi, the former president of the European Central Bank.Italy’s Resilience and Recovery Plan, which pairs funds from the EU with structural reforms, “has the potential to put its economy on a higher growth trajectory, therefore resulting in a much better environment for foreign investors,” says Nicola Nobile, an economist at forecasting company Oxford Economics.The chances of implementing the reform plan successfully are now “greater than on previous occasions,” according to the latest OECD assessment of Italy, reflecting the fact that the EU money is conditional on achieving targets — creating unprecedented incentives and a stronger political consensus to complete key reforms.But the gap with other advanced economies remains wide. Italy ranks only 33rd among the most-invested-in countries since 2003, below Germany, France, Spain, Romania and the Netherlands, according to data from fDi Markets, an FT-owned company that tracks greenfield investment.Greenfield investment projects are those where a company creates or expands a business in another country, rather than buying one. As such, they are considered more important for economic growth and job creation.Italy’s low ranking is a poor result given that the country is the eighth largest consumer market in the world, the seventh largest manufacturing producer, and can boast a diversified economy and skilled workforce.With an improved business environment, foreign investors could discover that “there are a lot of good companies in Italy and high savings,” notes Marcegaglia.Poor inward investment is also at odds with Italy’s key role as a global investor. It ranks 13th in outward greenfield investment since 2003, largely reflecting the appetite of Italy’s utility companies for both traditional and renewable sources of energy.Even combined with mergers and acquisitions and portfolio investment, the stock of FDI into Italy accounts for about 22 per cent of GDP, the second lowest proportion after Greece among developed European countries, according to the UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad), an international agency that tracks global FDIs.Italy’s attractiveness has improved over the past decade, though. The country has climbed the FDI Confidence Index compiled by management consultancy Kearney, reaching eighth place globally this year. It did not make it even to the top 25 a decade ago.All eyes on Draghi’s investment and reform planItaly’s economic development minister: ‘We are completely changing public administration’Foreign investors hindered by Italy’s sluggish legal systemLast year, accountancy firm EY’s annual foreign investment attractiveness survey registered an annual 5 per cent increase in the number of foreign investment projects, in stark contrast with a drop across Europe.Nearly half of international investors said they would like to invest in Italy and nearly two out of three expect Italy’s attractiveness to increase in the next three years, EY data showed.“These are positive signs for Italy,” says Massimo Antonelli, CEO of EY Italy — although he adds that the gap with other countries is still large as, despite the uptick, Italy attracted only 2 per cent of European incoming investment projects in 2020.The low value of greenfield FDI is partially explained by a concentration in the richer north. On its own, the wealthy region of Lombardy secured a quarter of all foreign capital invested in Italy’s 20 regions between 2003 and July 2021, fDi Markets data shows. That is similar to the amount invested in the whole of Norway.“Foreign investors have targeted Italy’s innovative industrial districts in the north of the country,” says Antonelli.The nearly 1,000 investment projects in Lombardy since 2003 have created about 42,000 jobs. This is a precious source of employment for a country where the unemployment rate is still above 9 per cent, the third highest in the EU after Greece and Spain.By contrast, Italy’s impoverished south — where unemployment is three times higher than in the north — accounts for only one-tenth of Italy’s foreign investment inflows, despite having one-third of its population.That largely reflects a smaller industrial base and poorer institutions. In the latest European Quality of Government survey, compiled by the University of Gothenburg, Italy’s southern regions and some areas in Romania and Bulgaria rank among the worst of more than 200 EU regions tracked.Those businesses that do invest in Italy are mainly from western Europe with a focus on logistics, traditional and renewable energy, and information and communication technology.Semiconductor producers and multinationals such as Amazon, Vodafone, Ryanair and the energy company Eon are among the top investors in the country, according to fDi Markets data.Of those investment projects for which fDi Markets gathers data on reasons for investing in Italy, nearly half cited the domestic market’s potential. The skilled workforce, the clustering of industry, the infrastructure and the quality of life were also among the top reasons to start or expand a business. You are seeing a snapshot of an interactive graphic. Boosting foreign investment is important for the country’s economic growth prospects. Foreign companies tend to be more productive than domestic businesses, pay higher salaries and often spur wider technological advancement than national companies.That could help turn the tide on decades of economic stagnation that have resulted in Italy’s living standards falling below the EU average over the past decade. You are seeing a snapshot of an interactive graphic. Italy’s poor economic performance has also weighed on the country’s public finances, pushing the debt-to-GDP ratio to above 155 per cent, the second highest in the EU after Greece.The government’s latest macroeconomic projections predict solid growth, with falling debt and shrinking unemployment. But that level of progress depends on how convincing Italy’s economic “renaissance” turns out to be for foreign investors.Progress depends on how convincing Italy’s economic ‘renaissance’ turns out to be for foreign investorsNobile thinks that the success of the reforms and spending plans “represents an upside scenario”, with the risk that they will be derailed in the years ahead by future governments, which may be less interested in reform than the Draghi administration.Nick Andrews, an economist at investment research company Gavekal Research, says that “there is still a lot to play for” before it will be possible to assess the effectiveness of the recovery plan.But he adds that “for the first time in decades, Italy does look to be headed the right way.”
65  Since Draghi took office, upgrading the justice system has been a critical part of his government’s ambitious multiyear programme of national reform, supported by more than €200bn in grants and loans from the EU.For years, the system has been blamed for hindering investment and growth in an economy that has barely increased its GDP in real terms since the turn of the century.For example, Italian courts are still a long way behind their peers in Europe in terms of the time taken to resolve commercial and civil disputes.According to the European Commission, the average Italian civil law case takes more than 500 days to resolve in the first instance, versus an average of about 200 days in Germany, 300 in Spain and 450 in Greece.In Italy, cases often go into a lengthy appeal process and have an uncertain duration as well as outcome.“The justice system needs to regain credibility, make the service of justice more effective and efficient, and provide more incisiveness and answers to the demands of the country,” said Marta Cartabia, Italy’s justice minister, earlier this month at Made in Italy — a digital summit on the country’s future.Cartabia, a former president of Italy’s constitutional court, was appointed by Draghi in February as part of the commitments Italy made to Brussels in order to receive grants and loans for its recovery spending.Interventions will be made on “personnel, offices and digitisation for a common goal: to strengthen the efficiency of the machine,” Cartabia said.She also stressed that Italy’s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR) would be well served by the goal of reducing by a quarter the time that criminal cases take to be heard within the next five years, and to reduce civil casework times by 40 per cent.This represents an opportunity for “a great change, for a common purpose that involves seizing the inefficiencies and cutting dead times in the processes,” she said.At the end of September, the Italian Senate gave the green light to the criminal trial reform, part of a broader set of reforms of the country’s justice system expected to be approved over the next few months.If the reform were to prove effective, it would certainly have an immediate effect on foreign direct investmentThis newly approved reform introduces a cap of two years on appeal trials and a cap of one year for proceedings before Italy’s court of cassation, the highest appeals court in the land.If these time limits are not respected, the proceeding is automatically annulled, unless the judge decides to extend it for special crimes such as mafia-type association, terrorism, sexual violence, and criminal association for the purpose of drug trafficking.“The very long duration of trials is a very serious problem for the country’s system, followed closely by the uncertainty of court rulings,” says Francesco Di Ciommo, professor of law at LUISS University in Rome.“This has so far represented a great uncertainty both for citizens and, above all, for businesses, which need certain timeframes to organise production, investments and obtain the best possible economic result,” he says.“Through this reform, the government is sending a very clear message: the system, as it is, is not sustainable in the long run. There is a strong determination to improve.”Cartabia has stressed on several occasions that one simple way to speed up Italy’s courts would be to recruit more judges — a process that the Draghi government has already begun. Another step would be to introduce the Italian equivalent of legal clerks into courts across the country. They would be tasked with assisting judges during cases.Remarkably, many judges in Italy work alone, meaning they must read every document pertaining to a case without help.According to Cartabia, the introduction of clerks would help reduce the caseload of individual judges and give valuable experience to a new generation of lawyers and judges who would witness the justice system close up from a young age.The reform is long overdue, but its success is regarded as crucial for Italy’s economic future.“This is among the most important reforms to unlock the country’s economy,” says Andrea Giuricin, a professor of economics at the University of Milano Bicocca.“For all international investors, wiping up uncertainty would be a dream. Lengthy trials in Italy have always been a huge question mark for them,” he says.“If the reform were to prove effective, it would certainly have an immediate impact on foreign direct investment, which has always been discouraged by the country’s Byzantine bureaucracy. This could finally be the right time to change things.”
66  Britain’s export performance is slipping behind other developed countries as the world recovers from the coronavirus pandemic, exposing what some economists are calling the “most worrying trend” in the UK economy.As chancellor Rishi Sunak celebrates sharp upgrades in growth forecasts within his Budget, trade data suggest that deep problems in UK businesses’ ability to attract foreign customers have emerged since Brexit.By August, global goods trade had rebounded strongly and international statistics showed that export volumes were well above pre-pandemic levels across advanced economies, according to the CPB world trade monitor. But the UK was an exception as its exports were still down sharply on pre-pandemic levels.Jonathan Portes, professor of economics at King’s College London, said UK export performance “has really been quite poor” compared with peer countries and relative to the wider UK economy, which has nearly recovered to pre-pandemic levels.This is possibly “the single most worrying thing about post-Brexit, post-pandemic developments in the UK economy . . . because it’s UK specific, unlike inflation, energy prices and so on”.In the three months to August, exports of UK goods were down 13 per cent compared with the same period in 2019, while services were down 14 per cent.UK trade data are inconsistent, with many different measures and distortions. But UK exports dropped by a similar amount after adjusting for inflation, the exclusion of volatile precious metals, or looking at the longer period of the 12 months to August.The UK is also bottom of most advanced economies when looking at exports over the past six years, both with regard to only goods or combined with services.Reduced exports to the EU — which in 2019 accounted for 46 per cent of UK goods exports — are not the only culprit of the UK’s underperformance. In the three months to August, UK exports to non-EU countries fell by more than 20 per cent compared with the same period in 2019 — four times the decline of exports to EU countries.However, this reflects the surge in UK exports to non-EU countries in the second half of 2019, before the initial Brexit deadline. The difference disappears when comparing the figures with the three months to August 2018, with real exports to both the EU and non-EU countries falling by about 13 per cent.This is partially because UK trade data have been volatile and complicated by a change in the way the Office for National Statistics records exports, which moved from the EU’s system to a customs declaration basis on January 1.UK exports to EU countries also show large variations across destinations, with strong expansions in countries with important ports such as the Netherlands, Belgium and Ireland. In contrast, UK exports to Germany were down nearly 20 per cent in the three months to August compared with the same period in 2019.But overall, there is little doubt that “UK trade growth has been sluggish this year”, according to Thomas Sampson, associate professor of economics at the London School of Economics.“Supply disruption associated with both Covid and Brexit has weighed on UK competitiveness in general, not just on trade flows with the EU,” said Benjamin Nabarro, senior associate at Citi Research.He added that UK trade weakness was also consistent with low investment during the post-referendum period, while there was also “longstanding evidence of EU clients pivoting away from UK suppliers”.Michael Gasiorek, professor of economics at Sussex university, said possible reasons for UK trade not recovering as strongly as other countries could include “slower UK economic growth, due to Brexit”. The underperformance could also be driven “by uncertainty, by lack of access to workers, supply chain complications, shipping costs etc, some of which may be Brexit and some Covid related”, he added.The result is that the UK is effectively losing global export share, according to Gabriella Dickens, senior UK economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics.This is visible in the imports of many partner countries. Germany registered a sharp annual fall in imports from the UK in August, in contrast with expanding imports from other countries. Preliminary data show a further contraction in September and British goods now account for less than 3 per cent of German imports — the lowest proportion on record.In the year to August, Italy and Malaysia overtook the UK in the US imports chart by value, compared with the same period last year.Chinese imports from the UK were down 3 per cent in September compared with the same month in 2019, in contrast with a double-digit expansion for all the other G7 countries, according to national statistics.A reduction in demand for UK exports means “smaller order books leading to downward pressure on profits, jobs and ultimately gross domestic product”, said Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors.The Office for Budget Responsibility, the fiscal watchdog, stated on Wednesday that the reduction in UK trade following Brexit is expected to drive a 4 per cent fall in the UK’s long-term productivity.Government business surveys confirm that UK exporters are facing myriad challenges, from additional paperwork and customs duties to rising transport costs and disruption at borders.Nearly half of businesses surveyed by the ONS link these disruptions to the end of the EU transition period on January 1 and Brexit-related uncertainty does not show signs of easing, according to data tracked by the Bank of England.Some economists have warned that the outlook for UK trade remained uncertain. Gasiorek did not see “sufficient opportunities to liberalise trade with third countries that can compensate for the rise in trade barriers with the EU”.This was particularly true because the US, the UK’s biggest non-EU trading partner, was not pursuing any new trade deals, noted Sophie Hale, an economist at the Resolution Foundation think-tank.Nabarro said that the UK government’s “adversarial approach” to relations with the EU over fishing, vaccines and Northern Ireland suggested “major uncertainty” about the sustainability of the EU-UK post-Brexit trade deal and left “little chance of it becoming a basis for new bilateral agreements”.
67  Russia’s Gazprom has emptied its gas storage facilities in western Europe to unusually low levels ahead of the winter, adding to fears that Moscow has exacerbated a shortage of supplies that has boosted prices to a record level.While European storage levels are low, an analysis of European gas industry data shows the largest shortfalls are at sites owned or controlled by Gazprom, in what critics say increasingly points to an attempt to squeeze European energy supplies.“The big deficits are where Gazprom facilities are,” said Domenicantonio De Giorgio, adjunct professor of finance at the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan, who has analysed data from Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE), an industry body.“Putin and Gazprom keep saying they have supplied all of their long-term contracts with customers. Well, they have supplied their customers, but they have not supplied themselves,” he said.Data from GIE show that in countries where Gazprom does not own storage facilities, such as in France and Italy, the level of gas in storage has reached near-normal levels for this time of year.Excluding Gazprom-controlled sites, European gas storage is just within the five-year average range, which the industry defines as a position of relatively comfortable supplies. Include Gazprom-controlled facilities, however, and the overall level in Europe is well below, at just above 75 per cent compared with 85 to 95 per cent in each of the past five years.Gazprom has influence over almost one-third of all gas storage in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands.The Gazprom-owned Rehden natural gas storage facility in Germany, which accounts for almost a fifth of the country’s storage capacity, is less than 10 per cent full, having been full in October 2019, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe data.The Haidach facility in Austria, also operated by Gazprom and one of the largest underground storage facilities in central Europe, is only 20 per cent full.Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that he had told Gazprom to pump more gas into its storage facilities in Germany and Austria after it finishes filling domestic storage on November 8.He had previously blamed record gas prices on European energy companies not pumping enough gas into underground storage ahead of the winter and denied that Moscow has restricted supplies to Europe.“This should certainly create a favorable situation on the European energy market, or at least a more favorable one,” Putin told Gazprom chief executive Alexei Miller.Putin’s comments come after German chancellor Angela Merkel told EU leaders last week that Russia had committed to increasing its natural gas held in storage in the country, according to diplomats familiar with the discussions.Critics of Gazprom believe that allowing its storage facilities to decline has amounted to a subtle but highly effective effort to influence European energy prices, which are threatening the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.The gas industry had been deeply divided over whether Russia has held back supplies from Europe, which it has been accused of doing to push for the quick start-up of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will bypass Ukraine to run directly through the Baltic Sea to Germany.Many analysts argued in late summer that Russian production had been maxed out while it has had to redirect more of its supplies to filling domestic storage after a long winter last year.But last week Gazprom declined to book the additional pipeline capacity that would allow it to increase supplies to Europe next month — when Russia’s efforts to fill domestic storage should have been completed.“If you were to ask me last month, I’d have said Russia is prioritising filling their own storage,” said Cuneyt Kazokoglu at Facts Global Energy, a consultancy. “But their storage is almost full now and structurally there seems to be nothing stopping them supplying more gas to Europe, and yet they’re not.”Sebastian Bleschke, head of INES, a German trade body for the gas storage sector, said that while European storage had been run down by a prolonged winter, it was difficult to say why Gazprom-owned facilities had not “been refilled again”.Putin has more overtly linked approval for Nord Stream 2 to the availability of increased supplies, last week saying Gazprom could increase flows by an extra 17.5bn cubic metres “the day after” an approval for the pipeline by German regulators.Nord Stream 2’s operator said last week that the pipeline had been filled with gas in preparation to start operation, in a sign that Russia does have gas available.Neither Putin nor Miller said the gas being pumped for storage in Europe would come from additional supply volumes, indicating Russia has not shifted its stance on Nord Stream 2 approval.Gas futures linked to TTF, Europe’s wholesale gas price, fell only 4.5 per cent on Putin’s comments, indicating the market believes Russia has not yet committed to supplying more gas.“Earlier in autumn, Russia’s tight domestic gas balance could have been the reason why flows [to Europe] were modest considering high prices,” said Kateryna Filippenko, principal analyst, European gas research, at Wood Mackenzie.“But now we believe the availability of gas has increased . . . Gazprom might be ready to supply more gas, but conditional on Nord Stream 2 getting a green light.”Germany’s economy ministry said on Tuesday it had come to the conclusion that allowing the new pipeline to start supplying gas to Europe would not endanger Germany’s or the EU’s energy security. The ministry’s analysis should now pave the way for Nord Stream 2 to receive certification by Germany’s Federal Network Agency.Politicians in western Europe have been slower to point fingers at Russia than their counterparts in eastern Europe. But in the past two weeks that has started to shift.Annalena Baerbock, the co-chair of the German Green party that is entering coalition talks, last week said Europe should not succumb to “blackmail” from Russia over the approval of Nord Stream 2, adding she believed the surge in prices had been “intentionally brought about”.Additional reporting by Max Seddon in Moscow
68  The EU is stepping up pressure on countries to comply with global trade rules as part of a more “assertive” trade policy.Some 66 countries, including many with trade deals with Brussels, have put up unjustified barriers, according to a report by the European Commission’s chief trade enforcement officer.The report said Denis Redonnet, who was appointed last year, would use new tools to force changes to rules restricting trade. These restrictions include health controls, customs administration fees and limits on the foreign ownership of companies.“Following a 10-year period of intensive, successful negotiations expanding the EU’s network of preferential trade agreements, the EU now needs to increasingly focus on their full and effective implementation,” said the commission document published on Wednesday.Most countries have progressively reduced import tariffs but often replaced them with non-tariff barriers that shut out foreign goods and services.Under pressure from member states and companies, the EU has increasingly focused on removing these, notwithstanding its €217bn trade surplus in 2020.“We defend our interests,” said an EU official. “The commission has adopted an open, sustainable and assertive trade strategy. This report is about the assertive part.”The report gives examples of how the EU has overcome such barriers, including ending a ban on feta cheese imports in Egypt. Cairo had declared that the Greek cheese was a health threat because of its yeast content but changed its rules after lobbying by the commission.Similarly, when Jordan announced plans to impose a 5 per cent customs “service fee” on EU imports, the commission pointed to economic support it could provide in other ways.“It is about leveraging our entire relationship with a third country,” the official said.In total, the EU found 462 barriers among 66 countries at the end of 2020. China had the largest number with 40, followed by Russia, Indonesia and the US.But there are problems even with longstanding partners. Norway, which is in the EU single market for goods, maintains high tariffs on processed foods.The EU has adopted several new tools in the past year to improve trade enforcement. They include a new complaints process for companies and industry associations which believe they face illegal barriers and retaliatory measures.It is also planning legal instruments to regulate trade. One will tackle distortions caused by state subsidies, aimed particularly at China, another intends to force open government procurement markets, and a third seeks to block imported products that rely on deforestation.Some lawyers fear countries affected by these rules will retaliate, further gumming up global trade.This story has been amended to clarify that the 66 countries identified in the EU report include some with which it does not have trade deals
69  France is threatening to take action from Tuesday against the UK in a dispute over fishing rights, which could include tougher customs checks on imports and cutting off electricity supplies.French government spokesperson Gabriel Attal on Wednesday said a full list of retaliatory measures would be released as early as Thursday.Tensions over fishing rights have been simmering for months after the UK rejected requests by some small French boats to continue fishing in British waters under the Brexit accord. The dispute is over the right to fish in waters six to 12 nautical miles off Britain’s shores, as well as in the seas off the island of Jersey, close to France.“Only about half of the licences that our fishermen are entitled to have been issued. Our patience is running out,” Attal told a press conference after the weekly meeting of ministers. “We will not let the UK wipe its feet with the Brexit agreement.”He added that if the first set of sanctions imposed on the UK did not work France could cut off electricity supplies to Jersey, provided through an undersea cable.Attal on Wednesday said France had furnished data and documents to support its requests for the fishing licences, but “roughly 50 per cent” of them had not yet been issued. He added that Paris had first turned to the European Commission over the issue as was called for under the treaty.The commission and EU member states have yet to back France’s call for action. Brussels, which has been examining evidence from French boats, on Tuesday said the UK had approved 15 out of 47 applications for French boats to operate in the six to 12 mile zone. Another 15 could be licensed if they provided more evidence, while 17 applications were withdrawn because of “poor evidence”.Just 66 out of 170 vessels applying to fish off Jersey received licences, the commission said, with a further 35 still being assessed and 69 rejected.Attal said measures could include stricter customs controls and health checks on trucks and boats coming into ports in northern France, as well as a ban on unloading seafood in French ports.He left open the possibility that if the UK changed its position France could back down.A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “It is important to stress that 98 per cent of fishing licences have been granted.”“We continue to work with the French government on granting more based on the evidence they provide, as you know a number of additional licences have been granted in recent weeks. We will continue to have discussions with them on that point,” the spokesperson added.Dimitri Rogoff, who heads a regional committee of fishermen in Normandy, said he was encouraged by the actions taken by the French government, adding that his group was waiting for responses on 20 fishing licences by the end of October. “We can only welcome their actions since we feel as if they have not forgotten us,” he said.Additional reporting by Domitille Alain in Paris
70  Brussels has defended its decision to grant European banks more time to implement new rules on bank capital, saying supervisors need longer to prepare while lenders focus on financing the post-pandemic recovery.The European Commission confirmed on Wednesday that the new EU rules to implement the final part of the Basel III agreement will come into effect in 2025. The reforms had been due to come into force by 2023 under the global accord.Valdis Dombrovskis, executive vice-president at the commission, said he was open to international discussion on the topic, but that Europe needed the extra time to pass the required legislation, some of which had to be enacted by individual member states.The Basel measures set new standards for how international banks should measure their capital so as to create consistency across national borders. They are the final part of a package of measures to try to make banks more resilient following the 2008 global financial crisis.“We are being realistic,” said Mairead McGuinness, financial services commissioner, in a press conference, pointing out that Basel III had already been delayed a year because of Covid-19. “There will probably be lots of international conversations, but our proposal is out today and we believe our timelines reflect the reality of how we legislate and how it is then put into practice.” Carolyn Rogers, secretary-general of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, told the FT last week that the new rules should be implemented “consistently and as soon as possible”. Other major jurisdictions have yet to set out their full plans for implementation.The new rules establish a “floor” for the capital that banks need to set aside against certain types of assets. This will restrict banks’ ability to use internal models to arrive at lower capital requirements.In the EU, this minimum will also be subject to special adjustments aimed at addressing certain asset classes, such as low-risk residential mortgages and smaller firms that are not rated by credit agencies.Under the EU’s new banking rules, the oversight of complex banking groups, including fintechs, will be enhanced. There will be minimum standards for the regulation and supervision of branches of banks headquartered outside the EU.EU supervisors will also have new powers to assess environmental, social and governance risks, as part of their regular review of lenders. However some MEPs and lobby groups criticised Brussels for not taking immediate steps to adjust capital requirements for fossil fuel investments.The commission said it is “exploring this idea” and has asked the European Banking Authority to assess if and how capital requirements might vary depending on the environmental and social impact of the assets held by institutions. This report is due in 2023.Sven Giegold, financial and economic policy spokesperson of the Greens/EFA group in the European Parliament, said it was welcome news that the role of sustainability in bank capital was being strengthened.“However, there is no clear and binding timetable for the overdue integration of sustainability risks into the hard capital requirements” of banks, he said. “Instead of waiting another two years for an EBA report, the EU Commission should present a new legislative proposal as soon as possible.”
71  Poland has been told by Europe’s top court to pay a fine of €1m a day for ignoring an order to suspend part of its contentious judicial reform.The European Court of Justice has imposed the penalty until Warsaw suspends an element of a regime for disciplining judges. It is part of a far-reaching battle between Brussels and Warsaw over reforms to the country’s judicial system that the EU says threatens the rule of law and the independence of judges.The stand-off has led to calls from other member states to cut tens of billions of euros in funding to the country, and even raised questions about Poland’s long-term future in the EU.Poland insists its reforms are needed to overhaul an inefficient system, and that the EU has no right to intervene in what it regards as a domestic matter.The ECJ ordered Poland in July to suspend several key aspects of its disciplinary regime — relating to the lifting of judges’ immunity from prosecution and their ability to examine the independence of other judges — “immediately”.Warsaw did not do so, however, and in response the European Commission asked the ECJ in September to impose fines. Poland’s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki told the FT this week that Warsaw would dissolve the disciplinary regime by the end of the year.The ECJ said in its order on Wednesday that Poland must pay €1m each day to the commission as a fine, and that suspending the contested provisions “is necessary in order to avoid serious and irreparable harm to the legal order of the European Union and to the values on which that Union is founded, in particular that of the rule of law”.Sebastian Kaleta, Poland’s deputy justice minister, said the ECJ ruling “completely disregards and ignores the Polish constitution and the rulings of the Polish constitutional tribunal”.“It is acting beyond its competences, and abusing the institution of financial penalties and interim measures,” he wrote on Twitter. “This is the latest step of an operation aimed at detaching from Poland influence on the system of our state. It is usurpation and blackmail.”The ruling comes days after EU leaders debated Poland’s rule of law crisis at a summit in Brussels. Some member states want the commission to continue withholding approval of the country’s €36bn Covid-19 recovery fund, and to deploy a new mechanism that could cut off tens of billions of annual EU funds to Poland.Morawiecki told the FT in a recent interview that any move to reduce EU funds promised to Poland would “start world war three” and that his government would “defend our rights with any weapons which are at our disposal”.Morawiecki also hit out at financial penalties such as that ordered by the ECJ on Wednesday, calling them “a gun to our head” that makes finding a compromise over the broader rule of law conflict more difficult.Polish officials have said they plan further reforms of the judiciary, including changes to the supreme court.The ECJ has also imposed daily fines of €500,000 on Poland in a separate case for refusing to suspend operations at its Turow mine in the south of the country, following a complaint by the Czech Republic about the environmental impact.The fines are the largest the ECJ has ever imposed in the case of interim measures, which the court can order to prevent damage stemming from EU law infringement.
72  The writer is a Stanton Nuclear Security Fellow at the Laboratory for Nuclear Security and Policy, Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyThere are conflicting interpretations of the news that China has tested a specialised new long-range missile, capable of carrying a nuclear weapon around the Earth. US officials claimed it was part of a fractional orbital bombardment system (FOBS) which could travel in Earth orbit and then release a manoeuvring vehicle to glide toward a terrestrial target. China’s Foreign Ministry objected to that description, calling the launch simply a test of reusable space technology.Details may be obscure, but a few things are clear. One, none of these technologies are new, and it should be no surprise that China is capable of fielding them. Two, while China’s nuclear arsenal remains much smaller than that of the US or Russia, Beijing is pursuing strategies to make it larger and more sophisticated. A nuclear arms race is on, absent a serious effort to stop it.So why is China building new nuclear delivery systems and modernising its weapons after decades of retaining a modestly sized arsenal? One core driver is to make clear to an unconvinced United States that it is vulnerable to Chinese nuclear retaliation despite enormous investments in missile defences. Many of the technologies China is pursuing, including those believed to have been tested this summer, are designed to overwhelm or evade such defences.If this sounds familiar, it should. This dynamic has echoes of the US-Soviet Cold War arms race. Many of the technologies — FOBS, hypersonic gliders, missiles equipped with multiple nuclear warheads — are even the same. It took years for the United States and Soviet Union to arrive at a shared understanding that unconstrained pursuit of missile defences was destabilising the strategic balance.However, having exited the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty designed to halt that race, the US has been developing a defence against intercontinental-range ballistic missiles for the past two decades. China’s new missiles hedge against the possibility that the United States may one day believe its technical advances permit it to strike China first while remaining invulnerable to a retaliatory nuclear attack.Nominally, US strategic missile defence efforts are aimed at defending the US against North Korea’s much smaller and less sophisticated arsenal of long-range missiles, as well as possible future weapons from Iran. Despite decades of effort and tens of billions of dollars, it has made limited progress. Existing Chinese missiles can easily overcome such defences.China’s concern is that the pursuit of highly effective defensive systems may reflect the desire of the United States to escape its own nuclear vulnerability, without necessarily giving up the ability to threaten others or doing the hard work needed to eliminate nuclear weapons entirely.Without intervention, this leads to a cyclical, expensive, and dangerous build-up of nuclear offence and defence. This is an arms race that the US and China as well as Russia all seem prepared to participate in. Each is modernising its arsenal at great expense. Russia is developing a number of new offensive nuclear systems, which also have the ability to overcome or avoid missile defences. The UK and France, who possess much smaller nuclear capabilities, are also modernising their technology.This one-upmanship will never provide a solution to the existential threat posed by nuclear weapons. The only winning move is to step off the track and return to the negotiating table. The parties to the 1970 nuclear non-proliferation treaty, including the P5 nuclear weapon states, are obliged to “pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race”. They will meet in January 2022 to take stock of their progress. Diplomacy, for all its certain challenges, is the only path forward.Letters in response to this article:Hypersonic histrionics over China have an upside / From Admiral Lord West of Spithead, House of Lords, London SW1, UKBasic tenets of cold war nuclear strategy need to be relearnt / From Ambassador Robert Hunter, Former National Security Council Staff, Former US Ambassador to Nato, Washington, DC, US
73  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
74  The last time Italy captured the attention of international speculators was in 2018 when hedge funds queued up to make huge bets against the country’s government debt following the election of an anti-euro populist coalition.Italian borrowing costs surged, markets trembled and the vast trading profits made by investors such as the billionaire Alan Howard had Matteo Salvini, the then deputy prime minister from the anti-migration League party, raging against what he claimed was a global financial conspiracy.Now Italy is once again grabbing investors’ attention, but for entirely opposite reasons.For two decades, during which Italy has not grown at all in real terms, it has paid to be pessimistic about the eurozone’s third-largest economy. Anyone who purchased Italian equities at the start of 1999, the year in which the country joined the single currency, has lost a fifth of their investment.Today optimism abounds. The rate the Italian government pays to borrow for ten years is near an all-time low. Many commentators have talked up the prospects of a prolonged boom in what was long regarded as the sick man of Europe.Much of this, of course, is down to the unexpected appointment of Mario Draghi as prime minister earlier this year. The celebrated former president of the European Central Bank is armed with an overwhelming parliamentary majority for his unity government, has won approval for an ambitious programme of national reform and is flush with almost €200bn of EU recovery money.After the dysfunctionality and scandals of the Berlusconi years, the shortlived promise of Matteo Renzi and the turbulence of the 2018 League-Five Star coalition, Italian politics has finally found something approaching stability.“I can’t remember the last time we saw this level of foreign interest,” an Italy-based banker reported recently. There was, he said, a surge in inquiries from outside investors about which stocks would allow them to bet on a possible Draghi boom.But in Rome’s corridors of power some are already fretting about the future of the Draghi project less than a year into its existence.The reasons are two-fold. The first is that the current government will last at most to June 2023, when new elections must be held and Draghi will step aside. Italian politics is then expected to return to its usual raucousness, potentially imperilling the programme of reform and investment. Suddenly, 20 months does not feel very far away.The second reason is approaching even more rapidly. At the start of next year the term of Italian president Sergio Mattarella, the man responsible for recruiting Draghi, will expire. Who will replace him, or if he can be somehow convinced to extend his term until 2023, is the topic of conversation among Italian pundits.Bookmakers are pricing Draghi as an odds-on favourite to become Italy’s next president. The probability of Mattarella deciding to extend his term is being marked at fifty-fifty. Marta Cartabia, the justice minister, is priced at 2 to 1.So far there have been no signals from the inscrutable former central banker of his intentions. Italy’s politicians, meanwhile, are divided. The centre left Democratic party led by Enrico Letta appears to favour Draghi staying on as prime minister through to elections in 2023, spearheading the reform drive, rather than take over as president early next year.One the other hand, Matteo Salvini’s League, like the PD part of the unity coalition, is more open to Draghi becoming president within a few months. A change could precipitate fresh elections that the right, including the League and the far-right Brothers of Italy, seem likely to win.But it is not just about retaking power from a technocratic premier. As president, Draghi would act as Italy’s ultimate political referee. Salvini remembers the international investor backlash in 2018 to the Eurosceptic-anti-establishment coalition in which he served as deputy prime minister.Italy’s nationalist right, says Francesco Galietti, a political risk analyst, “do not want to find themselves facing another shock of this sort, nor the ensuing wrath of capital markets, Brussels (and Frankfurt)”. As president, Draghi could lend respectability to a rightwing government.“With Draghi as president”, he says, “the idea is that, no matter who wins the next elections, Draghi could ‘normalise’ any force that makes it into parliament”.Will Draghi swap one last year of marshalling Italy’s recovery as prime minister in an attempt to safeguard the country’s long-term stability as president? All this sets up an awkward and looming choice for him and anyone else betting on Italy’s economic revival.
75  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.In the clash over Poland’s rule of law, the European Commission — as advised by Germany’s outgoing chancellor — is taking its time when it comes to any concrete action. The stalemate does mean that Warsaw won’t see any fresh EU funding anytime soon, which is in itself a form of punishment. We’ll bring you up to speed with what the latest thinking is after the escalating war of words in recent weeks.Meanwhile in a show of force, Russian state gas company Gazprom has proposed that EU neighbour Moldova change its free trade deal with the bloc and delay its energy market reforms agreed with Brussels, in exchange for cheaper gas.We’re also looking at Chinese social media app TikTok, which has come under scrutiny in the US and the EU for allegedly failing to protect teens and children on the platform.And with a new round of Brexit talks on Friday, we’re exploring the latest twists in the long-lasting saga most EU officials have little appetite left for.After weeks of an escalating war of words between Brussels and Warsaw, the dust is beginning to settle and the European Commission is showing no appetite to move fast and furious on the rule of law front, write Mehreen Khan and Valentina Pop in Brussels.In the aftermath of last week’s summit, attended by Poland’s Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, Europe Express has spoken to officials and diplomats on what happens next.Following the summit Morawiecki warned the commission against launching the “third world war”. But for all his sabre-rattling, there is little prospect of immediate legal action from Brussels, other than the routine step of launching an infringement procedure. (Poland has 146 active infringements, but other countries including France and Germany also each have more than 100 such cases of alleged failure to implement EU law).But lack of movement from Brussels is not necessarily a win for Warsaw. It also means the commission is likely to delay a decision to approve Poland’s €36bn in EU recovery funds.Officials say last week’s summit has helped tone down tensions after a marked shift from countries which had previously drawn a line in the sand when the constitutional tribunal in Warsaw declared parts of the EU treaties to be unconstitutional.After a conciliatory intervention from Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel and others, leaders agreed to let commission president Ursula von der Leyen handle the issue — with the emphasis on dialogue and delaying any immediate action on the rule of law conditionality mechanism tied to EU funding.The restive European parliament, which has criticised the commission’s approach, is expected to lodge an official lawsuit against the delay over the tool later this week. But the MEPs’ activism is likely to be in vain.Officials told Europe Express that the rule of law mechanism is unlikely to be triggered until the European Court of Justice delivers its verdict on the tool — a decision that is unlikely to come this year. A non-binding opinion from the court’s advocate-general is on course to be delivered at the start of December, according to officials, with the final judgment likely pushed into 2022.At the same time, Brussels is also expected to sit on its hands over approving Poland’s recovery plan worth €36bn in loans and grants from the bloc’s post-pandemic recovery fund. (Poland filed the plan in May.)The resulting impasse will hurt Warsaw, which could have accessed billions in pre-financing this year. (The money won’t necessarily be lost, but other countries which had their plans approved have been merrily tapping their pre-financing in recent weeks and months.)Poland’s state of purgatory can have other financial consequences, including the potential freezing of lucrative cohesion money over potential breaches of fundamental values, and an outstanding €500,000-a-day fine plus interest deducted from any future EU payments over Warsaw’s failure to close a mine on the border with the Czech Republic.Morawiecki’s retort that Poland will retaliate by disrupting EU legislation, including its landmark green policies, rings somewhat hollow in Brussels where most key proposals cannot be vetoed by a single country. Warsaw can solicit allies in the EU to muster up majorities needed to block laws, but even that is no easy feat.Germany is the ninth-largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world.

Those aged 16 and 17 can also select who can download their videos.But to US lawmakers, those measures are still judged to be insufficient. The company was grilled yesterday by senators alongside Snapchat and YouTube.“We need to understand the impact of popular platforms like Snapchat, TikTok and YouTube on children and what companies can do better to keep them safe,” said Richard Blumenthal, a senator from Connecticut.Just hours later TikTok was criticised by Europe’s umbrella organisation for consumer protection, BEUC, which complained to audiovisual regulators about their lack of action.BEUC’s researchers earlier this year said TikTok was subjecting children to hidden advertising and inappropriate content that could hamper their physical, mental or moral development. As a result, BEUC filed complaints with the European Commission and national consumer protection authorities in February this year over breaches to consumer law.BEUC complained that because the relevant audiovisual legislation has not been transposed in Ireland, where TikTok is based, the authority has said it cannot act. The deadline was a year ago and Dublin has yet to implement the EU’s directive and is subject to infringement proceedings in Brussels, the consumer organisation said.“It is a serious cause for concern that because of one country’s failure to act, children across the EU are not protected against inappropriate content on one of the most popular video-sharing platforms,” said Ursula Pachl, deputy director-general of BEUC.The body’s action comes against the backdrop of revelations by a Facebook whistleblower that showed the social media platform failed to respond to internal warnings about dangerous content, including on Instagram, a rival app to TikTok that is owned by Facebook and is popular with teenagers.TikTok was not immediately available for comment.It is two weeks since the UK and EU restarted serious negotiations to revise their post Brexit trade agreement. On Friday, the two principals, commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic and UK Brexit minister Lord David Frost, are set to meet for the second time since then — and neither a dramatic breakthrough nor a serious crisis is expected, writes Andy Bounds in Brussels.Yet the Brits have insisted a new deal must be done within weeks, and even Sefcovic has talked of concluding things by the end of the year. So the crunch is coming.The dispute concerns the Northern Ireland protocol, which kept the region in the EU single market for goods even after the UK left.To avoid a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which could reignite tensions with the Catholic nationalist community in the north, the UK agreed to checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea.But after the onerous nature of those checks became clear, the UK demanded a renegotiation. The EU on October 13 outlined proposals to cut checks on retail food products arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain by 80 per cent, and reduce customs paperwork by half.But the offer is conditional on the UK giving the EU access to customs data, and not diverging from some of its food standards.London has made it clear there are “big gaps” between the two sides. So far Frost has concentrated his fire on ending the role of the European Court of Justice, the EU’s top legal body, which Brussels insists must remain the enforcer of single market rules in Northern Ireland.But an appearance before MPs on Monday raised further media speculation that he is preparing a climbdown via a model where independent arbitrators assess complaints, with the ECJ only consulted if one side is unhappy with the result.There must be “no role for the court to be the final arbiter of disputes at the summit of a system that imposes EU law”, he told MPs on Monday. Asked if he would rule out submitting to the ECJ in any form, he declined to say a simple “no”, as my colleague George Parker noted. “You can’t have the court of one party settling disputes between us,” Frost answered.The EU refuses to discuss such a solution since the UK has not yet made any formal proposal about it.Frost also claimed the EU was taking retaliatory action in other areas. It was stalling on the UK’s continued membership of Horizon, the science research network under which Brussels funds cross-border research projects.The commission said yesterday that a transitional agreement meant UK universities could continue to bid for funds, in the expectation that Horizon membership would be extended by the time it came to disburse them.In EU capitals there remains little sympathy with the British position. “When you sign a deal you should stick to it,” said one EU diplomat. “We all thought Brexit was done. We have so many other issues to deal with.”

Plus, the FT’s eastern European correspondent, James Shotter, explains how Poland has become one of the biggest thorns in the EU’s side.  
77  Russian state gas company Gazprom has proposed that Moldova adjust its free trade deal with the EU and delay energy market reforms agreed with Brussels in exchange for cheaper gas for the country.The former Soviet republic has declared a state of emergency as it tries to secure enough shipments to make it through a winter gas crunch. Kremlin-controlled Gazprom cut supplies to Moldova by one-third last month following the end of a long-term contract and demanded more than double the previous terms to keep gas flowing.In negotiations this month, Gazprom told Moldovan officials it would reduce the price if the country was prepared to amend its tariff-free trade deal with the EU, said people briefed on the discussions.Gazprom also wanted Moldova to delay the implementation of EU rules that require gas markets to be liberalised and allow more competition, the people said.Two people briefed on the talks said the Kremlin saw the gas negotiations as part of a broader political settlement with Moldova after President Maia Sandu took office last year and her staunchly pro-EU party scored a landslide victory in elections in July.Market analysts have suggested that Russia is leveraging Gazprom’s position as sole supplier to Moldova to put pressure on the government in Chisinau, which has vowed to steer out of Moscow’s orbit and towards the west.It comes amid a wider global gas crunch that has pushed market prices to record highs.Russia’s president Vladimir Putin this month dismissed as “complete rubbish” suggestions that the Kremlin used gas supplies as a political weapon against other countries.Gas market liberalisation would adversely affect Gazprom and Moldovagaz, its subsidiary in Moldova that owns and operates the country’s gas network and buys and sells shipments.Moscow also would prefer Moldova to abandon the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area deal with the EU and instead sign up to its rival Eurasian Economic Union.Moscow sees Moldova as coming within its sphere of influence and regards itself as the protector of the Russian-speaking population in the breakaway statelet of Transnistria, where it keeps a small military contingent.Dmitry Kozak, a senior Kremlin official who leads Moscow’s relations with post-Soviet states, held negotiations last week with Moldovan officials that failed to reach a compromise over the gas price.Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesman, said Gazprom’s offer was “carefully calibrated, clear, justified, and, from the standpoint of pricing, extremely favourable to the Moldovan side”, according to Interfax.“Gazprom is holding negotiations with its counterparts on extending the gas supply contract to Moldova exclusively on commercial terms,” Gazprom said. “We do not consider it appropriate to comment on Moldova’s agreements with other suppliers.”Moldova on Tuesday received its first gas shipment from a non-Russian source, buying a trial 1m cubic metres from Poland’s PGNiG via Ukraine, in a debut tender that bypassed Moldovagaz.That, in addition to another trial shipment from neighbouring EU member state Romania, came after weeks of crisis talks with EU officials for Brussels to provide extra financial support and for member states to make gas available.Moldova’s government fears mass unrest this winter from either a shortage of gas or unavoidably high prices for heating and energy.“The Russians are hitting the country at its weakest point, at the worst possible moment,” said an official involved in the negotiations.Natalia Gavrilita, Moldova’s prime minister, will head a delegation to Brussels for talks on Thursday, amid discussions to increase the level of grants and loans provided by the EU.Moldovan officials will meet Gazprom’s chief executive Alexei Miller in St Petersburg on Wednesday. EU diplomats have urged the country not to sign a new long-term deal with the Russian company, and instead find short-term fixes to weather the winter.But industry analysts have questioned whether additional supplies from EU members will be sufficient to supplant Russian exports to the country of 2.6m people, while spot market costs are likely to be prohibitively high without significant subsidies.Pawel Majewski, chief executive of PGNiG, said the company was “ready to take part in the next rounds of tenders” for gas supplies to Moldova.“Independent from our business activities, by supplying gas to Moldova, we are also showing our energy solidarity,” he said.Additional reporting by David Sheppard in London
78  President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has backed away from his threat to expel the ambassadors of the US and nine other Nato allies or key trade partners. It would have sundered the fraying moorings Ankara still has with the west despite the erratic behaviour of the Turkish leader. The neo-sultan has come down from a new peak of wilful wrath.This crisis erupted after the 10, led by the US, France and Germany, called for the urgent release of Osman Kavala, a philanthropist and civil society leader, held in solitary confinement for four years on wholly unproven but endlessly recycled charges. Their statement said “continuing delays in his trial, including by merging different cases and creating new ones after a previous acquittal, cast a shadow over respect for democracy [and] the rule of law”.Erdogan said the signatories would not release “bandits, murderers and terrorists” in their own countries. Then he publicly ordered his foreign minister to declare all 10 ambassadors persona non grata — the diplomatic formula for expulsion.Kavala, a quiet-spoken man who has become a beacon of resistance, said he could not get a fair trial and would no longer attend court (although his lawyers will) to listen to the sub-Kafka charade of allegations against him.Erdogan declared victory over the US and Europeans, who re-endorsed their commitment to the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations — which bars interference in another country’s internal affairs.This may well persuade the already converted that their hero has forced great powers to back down. At worst, many will see it as a score-draw. The signatories say their démarche was consistent with the Vienna Convention. Those always opposed to Erdogan, swelled by the exasperation of former supporters with his mismanagement of the economy, will be looking further down the road.Sure, this diplomatic ceasefire has momentarily halted the collapse of Turkey’s currency. But the lira was already heading speedily south before this sound and fury accelerated it; and Erdogan keeps dictating cuts in the interest rates he believes cause rather than curb Turkey’s chronic inflation.Nor will this pause or halt New York courts prosecuting state-owned Halkbank for busting sanctions against Iran. It will not persuade Washington to relent on restricting jet-fighter sales to Ankara because it has bought Russian air defence systems it sees as a cuckoo in the Nato nest.Those who see all this as Erdogan marshalling his coalition of neo-Islamists and ultranationalists to distract from economic woes are only partially right. His national populism, as his poll numbers sink, is tactical. But the president’s antipathy towards Kavala is visceral.Kavala has always been more a cultural than a political activist, working to heal historical wounds with Turkey’s minorities, especially Kurds and Armenians. The charges against him, even Erdogan allies privately admit, are ludicrous.Erdogan accuses Kavala of organising the spontaneous civic demonstrations of 2013 across Turkey as a dry run for the violent but abortive coup of mid-2016, blamed by the regime on their former allies, a secretive group led by the US-based Islamist imam Fethullah Gulen, which had cadres in the judiciary, army and security services.Erdogan calls Kavala the “Red Soros” or the “Soros leftover”, a reference to the billionaire philanthropist George Soros on whose Open Society foundation Kavala was a board member. It was people like Kavala and his friends who first warned Erdogan against the Gulenists.When Kavala was acquitted last year for lack of evidence he was rearrested on the way out of jail on an even more baroque tissue of charges. This is a personal persecution.When Erdogan and his ruling party lost its majority in the June 2015 elections, the Peoples’ Democratic party (HDP), the first overtly pro-Kurdish group to enter parliament but then a rainbow coalition of the left, came third with more than 6m votes and 80 seats. Their victory celebration was in Kavala’s Istanbul restaurant. Erdogan convinced himself Kavala and Selahattin Demirtas, the HDP leader also in jail, were trying to block his path to the Russia-style presidency he now has.Erdogan has made Kavala an international issue just as his domestic opposition is starting to unite in the belief he might self-destruct. What the US and Europeans said about Kavala and the absence of rule of law in an allied state cannot be unsaid. They will be measured by what they do, not what they say.david.gardner@ft.com
79  Portugal’s six-year experiment with leftwing “anti-austerity” government will end this week in a political crisis leading to early elections unless António Costa, the socialist prime minister, can strike a last-minute budget deal with the radical left.The anti-capitalist Left Bloc (BE) and old-guard Communist party (PCP) have vowed to withhold crucial support in a budget vote on Wednesday unless the minority Socialist party (PS) government makes further concessions in a bill already seen as the most leftwing in recent history.“They are asking the impossible and I can’t see the PS giving way,” said Francisco Seixas da Costa, a political commentator and former secretary of state for European affairs. “The pact has exhausted its possibilities and the BE and PCP can see no further advantage in co-operating with the government.”Costa has offered a €40 increase in the national minimum wage to €705 a month and a €700m increase in investment in the national health service, alongside higher old-age pensions and public sector wages. The BE and PCP are pushing for bigger increases in these areas as well as labour reforms that the government fears would clash with EU rules.After offering hope to struggling centre-left parties across Europe and inspiring neighbouring Spain’s mainstream socialists to follow a similar path, Portugal’s broad left pact is foundering over the smaller parties’ dissatisfaction with their peripheral role, and the limits of EU policy.If the budget is defeated, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, Portugal’s centre-right president, has said he will immediately dissolve parliament and call a general election two years ahead of schedule. Costa, meanwhile, has stated he would remain in office at the head of a caretaker government until the ballot was held, probably in January.Analysts fear that a snap election may not resolve the impasse. “We could be heading for an Italian-style situation in which no party could form a stable government coalition,” said Seixas da Costa. The centre-right Social Democrats (PSD), the main opposition party, will also hold leadership elections in December, further muddying the outlook.After months of tense negotiations, Costa has warned the BE and PCP that the government has gone as far as it can to meet their demands while ensuring that fiscal policy and labour legislation do not breach its commitments to Brussels.The bill is designed to support Portugal’s recovery from the pandemic-driven recession that saw the economy contract by 8.4 per cent last year, Portugal’s worst slump since 1936. The bill envisages gross domestic product growth of 5.5 per cent in 2022, up from a projected 4.8 per cent this year.Rebelo de Sousa has alerted parties to the dangers of provoking a government crisis amid concerns over a potential winter surge in the Covid-19 pandemic and the delays it could cause to the investment of €14bn in grants that Portugal will receive from the EU’s €750bn coronavirus recovery package.It would be the first time since Portugal returned to democracy in 1974 that a budget has not been approved and it could take until April until a new government could draw up a new budget bill.Costa forged the alliance known as the geringonça, meaning “odd contraption”, with the BE and PCP in 2015 as a means of gaining power after the PS came second to the PSD in an inconclusive general election.He described the agreement with the PCP, a hardline Soviet-style communist party, as Portugal’s equivalent of toppling the Berlin wall. On the basis of long-term voting trends, the pact was in a position to win successive elections.“The BE and PCP gained some credit in the initial years for their part in overturning the austerity measures imposed during Portugal’s bailout from the sovereign debt crisis,” said Seixas da Costa. “But they have realised that the PS would never abandon its commitments to the EU.”António Costa Pinto, a politics professor at the University of Lisbon’s institute of social sciences, said: “One of the lessons to be learned from Portugal’s experience is that this type of alliance cannot last if there’s no convergence between the parties. Unlike in Spain, the more radical parties were never represented in government or entered into a coalition with the PS.” Nor have they seen any electoral gains for their co-operation with the government. “In the end, they have decided to remain protest parties outside the mainstream rather than converge towards the centre,” said Costa Pinto.
80  MoSuke is now one of the toughest reservations in town, which is why it was exciting when I snagged a table for two one evening in Paris. Sacko, who is very tall (6ft 5in), with dreadlocks neatly tied back with a black leather cord, looked across the counter of his open kitchen and greeted me with “Bienvenue!” And welcome was exactly what I felt at this restaurant whose young staff are proud to work for a chef whose highly original menu and relaxed hospitality have become a culinary sensation.“MoSuke is an amalgam of chef Mory Sacko’s first name and that of Yasuke, an emancipated Mozambican slave who was the first and only black samurai in Japan during the 16th century,” I overheard a waitress explain animatedly to the table next to mine. “But Monsieur Sacko’s parents are from Mali, not Mozambique. He chose this name because he loves Japan and Japanese food and cooking. He always says he’s French by birth, because he was born in France; African by ancestry from his parents; and Japanese by affinity, especially in the kitchen,” she continued. And then she took their order.Many of those arriving for dinner that evening appeared to already know Sacko from le petit écran. He was a popular contestant during a recent season of the hit cooking show Top Chef, and has more than 215,000 Instagram followers, his preferred method of social-media communication.Despite being unable to take full advantage of the surge in business that ordinarily occurs when a restaurant wins its first Michelin star, Sacko has nonetheless found himself unusually busy. In February, he debuted as the host of Cuisine Ouverte (“Open Kitchen”), where he visits a different region every week, discovers its signature produce, and then cooks it alongside a famous chef. One episode, for example, found him cooking alongside Emmanuel Renaut of Flocons de Sel in Megève, the ski resort in the Haute-Savoie which has been awarded three Michelin stars. The show was a huge hit, drawing more than 1.6m viewers.Building umami is often the goal of both Japanese and African cooking so there was a culinary logic I immediately understood”When we meet a few days later, Sacko talks about the sociological shifts that are happening in France now – to the culture and to the cooking. “Some may have been shocked to see a black man in the role of an exemplar of Gallic gastronomy, but for most younger French people, we’re kind of past that right now,” Sacko says. “When I was growing up in Seine-et-Marne [a département just east of Paris], my friends were white, Asian, black, Arab and other – from France but also other countries, Christian but also many other religions. So diversity is our reality in a way that it might not be for older people.”Sacko is proud of his heritage and the road on which he’s travelled. “It’s not often a kid from the suburbs wins a Michelin star. As a Parisian, you know that for so many young people in the suburbs the elegant city of Paris is as a distant as the moon,” says the cook, who grew up eating African dishes such as chicken yassa (with lemon and onions), and mafé (beef stew in peanut sauce) with his eight siblings. “My mother’s a great cook and we always ate really well at home,” he says, “but I knew almost nothing about French cooking because I didn’t have a Gallic granny making blanquette de veau for me on Sundays. The only cooking I knew outside of the house was American fast food, our special treat.” A school-leaver at 14, Sacko first went to hotel college after catching glimpses of the glamour at Paris’s grand establishments while watching television. But it was only when he started working alongside chef Hans Zahner at the Royal Monceau that he was drawn to the possibilities of a career in food. “I love the techniques of cooking, and also the poetry of creating taste,” he says. He found a mentor while working as a sous-chef for Thierry Marx at the two-Michelin-star restaurant Sur Mesure at the Mandarin Oriental. Marx (a Frenchman of Polish Jewish origins from the old Paris working-class district of Belleville and an ardent Japanophile) and Sacko bonded over their love of Japanese and French gastronomy. “Thierry shared his love of Japan, its culture and its cooking with me, and I fell in love with a faraway country I’d never really seen before,” says Sacko. “The rigour, elegance and honesty of Japanese cooking immediately made sense to me. Building umami is often the goal of both Japanese and African cooking so there was a culinary logic I immediately understood. I felt at home with the palate. This is what led to my cooking style, which is Franco-African-Japanese – a reflection of my culinary journey.”This summer, Sacko opened a street-food pop-up called Edo in Lyon and Marseille, offering a taste of his cooking, street-style (with menus affordably priced from €21 and €29). “We served Afro-Japanese street food, which was really well received in two French cities with very different gastronomic cultures,” Sacko says. A London version of the same pop-up is planned later this year, subject to finding a suitable location.The French pop-ups have been invaluable in helping Sacko understand how French gastronomy has been changed by Covid-19. “The French food chain was already evolving a lot before the pandemic, but the three lockdowns accelerated this,” he says. “I think that being deprived of restaurants made everyone finally understand just how important they’ve become to daily life in the world’s biggest cities. Whatever nightlife there is these days has mostly migrated to restaurants, which are where people not only go to eat but have a good time. This is why there’s been a major move away from formality in Paris towards more relaxed and fun places. I think this will continue too.”Back at my table at MoSuke, my friend had arrived and I could start my own exploration of Franco-African-Japanese cooking. It began with a superb starter of roasted lobster with lacto-fermented peppers, miso and tomato, a nonchalantly elegant dish in which the miso’s umami enlivened the sweetness of the crustacean and the peppers added some teasing punctuation. We also loved Sacko’s sole cooked in a banana leaf with shichimi togarashi (a Japanese mix of seven spices) and its garnish of attiéké, a dish of fermented cassava pulp popular in the Ivory Coast, and a brilliant dessert of marinated pineapple with bissap (hibiscus juice) sorbet and candied shiso leaves. The food at this fine-dining destination was unlike anything else I’d eaten in more than 30 years of living in Paris. The menus are designed seasonally and offered as three, four, five and seven courses, priced from €55 to €110, and the crowd is diverse, the restaurant attracting young and old – all interested in new gastronomy.I spot Sacko, pausing to survey the busy dining room. “When we go out we’re as hungry for conviviality as we are for good food,” he says, above the room’s ambient, friendly clatter. “What we want to eat now is healthy, environmentally sustainable food that tells a story that is honest, original and exciting. This is what I’ve tried to create at MoSuke,” he tells me. He’s certainly succeeded.
81  Critics of China have reacted angrily at the cancellation of events to mark the publication of a new German book about President Xi Jinping at the apparent behest of Chinese diplomats.Confucius Institutes at two German universities had planned online presentations of the book, Xi Jinping — The Most Powerful Man in the World by Adrian Geiges, Stern magazine’s longtime China correspondent, and Stefan Aust, former editor-in-chief of news magazine Der Spiegel.But the book’s publisher, Piper Verlag, said the events had been “cancelled at short notice, due to Chinese pressure”. The company said that the Chinese consul in Düsseldorf, Feng Haiyang, had allegedly intervened personally to axe one of the events, which was to be held at Duisburg-Essen University.Piper Verlag quoted an employee of the Confucius Institute as saying that “one can no longer talk about Xi Jinping as a normal person — he should not be touched or spoken about”.The controversy has refocused attention on the role of the Confucius Institute, an organisation run by an arm of the Chinese education ministry that offers language and cultural programmes overseas.China sees the organisation as a way to promote the learning of Chinese language and culture as well as providing educational and cultural exchanges with the aim of “deepening mutual understanding and friendship” between China and other countries.But critics see the institution as a way for Beijing to spread propaganda under the guise of teaching, interfere with free speech on campuses and even spy on students.Reinhard Bütikofer, a member of the European Parliament and an outspoken China critic, described the decision to cancel the book-related events as “outrageous”. “The Chinese bureaucrats [allegedly behind the move] have effectively demonstrated why it is incumbent on us to rein in and get rid of these Confucius Institutes,” he said.Thorsten Benner, director of the Global Public Policy Institute in Berlin, said: “This episode should make it clear to every German university president that Confucius Institutes should have no place at German universities or at any other academic institutions committed to academic freedom.” He added that they “are a massive reputational risk for German universities partnering with them”.In a statement, the Chinese embassy in Germany said events at Confucius Institutes “ought to serve the joint interests and concerns of both sides and must be planned and carried out on the basis of comprehensive communication between the partners”.It added that China wanted to develop the institutes into a “platform for better understanding China and getting to know it objectively and comprehensively”. “But we strongly object to any politicisation of academic and cultural exchange,” it continued.Felicitas von Lovenberg, head of Piper Verlag, described the cancellation of the book events as a “disquieting signal”.Aust said the situation confirmed the basic thesis of his and Geiges’ book. “Not only is a dictatorship trying to overtake the west in economic terms but also trying to push its values internationally — values which are aimed against our freedom,” he said.The events were supposed to be held this week at the Confucius Institute at Duisburg-Essen University and the Leibniz-Confucius Institute in Hanover. Piper Verlag said the presentation in Duisburg-Essen had been cancelled after Wuhan University and the Chinese consul in Düsseldorf allegedly intervened.In Hanover, it was the Tongji University in Shanghai, which jointly operates the Confucius Institute there, that had the event cancelled, according to Piper Verlag.The Leibniz University Hanover said in a statement that the cancellation of the event was “not acceptable, disconcerting and incomprehensible”.“The Leibniz University Hanover sees itself as a cosmopolitan university with room for critical scientific discourse and exchange,” it said. It added that it had invited Aust and Geiges to give a reading of their book at the university.In a statement on Tuesday, Duisburg-Essen University said it was “involved neither with the planning nor the cancellation of the book presentation”. “This decision is inexplicable to us and must not be repeated,” said the university’s rector, Ulrich Radtke.
82  The US reopens its borders to fully vaccinated Brits and Europeans in November after a frustrating summer of “No”, and the West Coast has some timely hotel debuts to mark the occasion. In the coffee and counterculture capital of Portland is a new address from Palisociety, one of the most creative hospitality purveyors around – its Palihouse hotels across California have the stay-at-a-cool-friend’s-house aesthetic down to a fine art (Palihouse Santa Barbara, with just 24 rooms in a sprawling Spanish-colonial mansion complete with courtyard pool and deep loggias, became that city’s most interesting address more or less immediately on opening last spring). The 57-room Hotel Grand Stark, a former warehouse in once heavily small-industry Central Eastside (now thick with cafés, bars and artisan workshops), captures Portland’s blend of urban grit and Pacific Northwest charm. The rooms capitalise on strip-wood floors and tall sash windows to bring the downtown-loft vibes; the deli handles the pastrami and salmon brief with aplomb; and the capacious lounges and “study hall” spread across much of the ground floor.Down in western Sonoma, a quiet investor is in the process of bringing a historic California hotel to new life. For decades, the Sea Ranch Lodge was the public face of the pioneering residential development of the same name, before beginning to gently give in to datedness. After two years of work by, among others, interior designer Charles de Lisle and West Coast architecture firm Mithun, the public spaces of the Lodge – home to the community’s post office and a small general store, as well as a series of bars, restaurants and gathering rooms, and a stunning indigenous-plant landscaped garden where once a stretch of bitumen dominated the view – are again receiving (very happy) guests. The furnishings are new (and fabulous), but architects and designers remained entirely faithful to the original materials – and to those Pacific Ocean views. The rooms are under way; look for an early 2023 opening for those.

83  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.France is gearing up for its upcoming EU presidency, with tech regulation flagged as one of its main priorities. So it is perhaps not surprising that French diplomats are actively pushing for a compromise solution on the stalled Digital Services Act that would grant Brussels more policing powers. We’ll explore where things stand and which countries Paris can count on.Meanwhile, a different set of allies — excluding France — has emerged on the energy front, as nine countries (with Germany on board) have put out a joint statement warning against any changes to the way the bloc’s energy market is constructed. Their position paper comes just as energy ministers are meeting in Luxembourg today, as we previewed here).And in Romania, the latest nominee to try to form a government is also struggling to cobble together a majority, at a time when the country really can’t afford early elections.A group of influential member states are seeking to give the European Commission more powers to scrutinise how Big Tech polices illegal content, writes Javier Espinoza in Brussels. The proposed move seeks to assuage concerns that too much power in the hands of regulators in countries with a questionable rule of law record — notably Hungary and Poland — could embolden a free speech clampdown.Brussels will be granted more powers as a “super regulator” over Big Tech’s efforts to police illegal content online, in proposals being drafted this week by member states and set to become part of their common negotiating position when the rules are ironed out with the European parliament and the commission early next year.The new proposals, led by France, would grant Brussels monitoring and supervisory powers over companies including Google and Facebook, said people with direct knowledge of the text, which is set to be added by the end of this week.French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday said this piece of legislation was moving “towards giving the European Commission a supplementary role to avoid the interminable discussion among origin and destination countries”. (This discussion is in large part what is holding up progress in adopting the new law).France’s apparent U-turn from previously seeking more enforcement powers at national level comes as some officials worry that even with the toughest laws in place there can still be lax enforcement by very large online platforms — as has been the case in Germany where the country struggled to contain a toxic online environment during its recent elections.Countries were still arguing over the fine print, but Germany was also backing the proposals, said two people with direct knowledge of the country’s position. The Netherlands is broadly supportive of the measure but diplomatic sources tell Europe Express the country wants to know whether the commission will have enough resources as it takes on new powers.Luxembourg, where Amazon is based, is also open to the move.“Giving more powers to the commission . . . is an interesting potential solution for Luxembourg,” said a person with direct knowledge of the country’s position. Its argument in favour of this proposal is that it would help with having a more streamlined enforcement across the bloc. “What matters most for Luxembourg is a well-functioning single market and therefore harmonised rules with a common interpretation and application,” the person added.However, Ireland, where Apple, Facebook and Google are based, still defends the “country of origin” principle and it is said to oppose this solution. Under current rules, only countries where large online platforms are based in Europe — namely Ireland and Luxembourg — have the power to fine or force platforms to take down content in the so-called country of origin principle. In the case of privacy infringements, this has led to significant inaction on the part of the privacy regulator.France needs a qualified majority in the council to get an agreement on more powers to the commission.If agreed, the new proposals will have the commission’s policing powers kick in only in big cases. “We want to avoid the paralysis of the European Commission with it dealing with micro infringements. We don’t want to flood the commission with complaints,” said a person with intimate knowledge of the proposals. Instead, the person said, Brussels would have powers to intervene when there were concerns that a platform was not tackling content in a systemic way.At a European Central Bank governing council meeting on Thursday, Christine Lagarde is likely to push back against a growing belief among investors that the ECB is underestimating future inflation. Lagarde said last month the central bank was still “pretty far away” from raising rates, in stark contrast with the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve, which have both indicated they plan to start tightening monetary policy. (More here)Romania’s prime minister designate Nicolae Ciuca tried in vain yesterday to gather support for a vote of confidence he must pass in parliament for the country to avoid its first snap elections in nearly a century, writes Marton Dunai in Bucharest.As of last night, Ciuca, a 54-year-old former general and politician of the conservative-liberal PNL party, who served most recently as defence minister, had the backing of no major party outside his own.Ciuca’s military career included stints in Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan, and he is often described as a stalwart ally of the US — a distinction that comes from a country that resents eastern influence in general.Having failed to restore a three-party coalition that fell apart earlier this month, Ciuca said he was seeking “support for a minority government” — lowering expectations about the ability of his potential cabinet to act beyond crisis management. This comes at a time when the country is battling the world’s deadliest Covid-19 surge, grappling with low vaccination rates and an aggravating energy crisis.Ciuca has also reached out to the Social Democratic opposition party to seek support for his cabinet. He said last night that discussions included 10 PSD proposals which he said were incorporated into his draft government programme.Florin Citu, who still acts as interim PM and has retained the leadership of the ruling PNL party, still enjoys the backing of President Klaus Iohannis and plays a strong part in the efforts to try to hammer out a coalition.Discussions will continue, but if no solution is found, Romania is facing a deepening triple crisis at the onset of winter.
84  European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde is expected this week to push back against a growing belief among investors that the ECB is underestimating future inflation and could raise interest rates next year.Rising inflation is relatively new ground for the ECB, which for much of the past decade has consistently undershot both its own 2 per cent target and its forecasts on inflation — the main factor determining the central bank’s decisions on interest rates and asset purchases.Yet the ECB governing council is not expected to change policy after it meets on Thursday. Instead the main focus will be on what Lagarde says afterwards about the inflation outlook and what this means for when it might raise rates.Lagarde said last month the ECB was still “pretty far away” from raising rates. Most economists expect her to say this week that the central bank is “vigilant”, while stressing that it still expects the recent surge in prices to fade next year.Propelled higher by global supply chain problems and rising energy prices, eurozone inflation reached 3.4 per cent in September and is forecast to hit a new 13-year high of 3.7 per cent in October.Although well above its inflation target, the ECB’s patient stance sets it apart from the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve, which have both signalled a move towards tightening policy.Investors, however, are betting the ECB could begin raising its deposit rate as soon as late 2022. These expectations helped lift Germany’s two-year bond yield from minus 0.78 per cent in August to minus 0.66 per cent on Monday.This prompted ECB chief economist Philip Lane to say last week that he did not think the market had “fully absorbed” the central bank’s new guidance on when it will raise rates.The ECB said in July that it must first forecast inflation will reach 2 per cent within 18 months and stay there for another 18 months. At the same time “underlying inflation”, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, must rise enough to indicate that overall price growth is “stabilising” at 2 per cent.Frederik Ducrozet, strategist at Pictet Wealth Management, said he expected Lagarde to reiterate the new rules and say they are not consistent with investors betting that rates will rise in 12 months. “We see no ECB rate hike before 2024,” he said.But Ducrozet added: “The problem is, markets may have absorbed the guidance to the extent that they disagree on the inflation outlook and believe that conditions would be set by end-2022 for the ECB to consider raising rates.” In his view it “all boils down” to who is right on the inflation outlook.Highlighting how investors are betting on persistently higher eurozone inflation, the five-year, five-year forward inflation swap rate — a measure of market expectations — has bounced to just above 2 per cent, its highest level in more than seven years.“As things normalise, inflation is becoming more persistent, so it will be harder for the ECB to justify continued stimulus,” said Lucrezia Reichlin, economics professor at the London Business School.The ECB has postponed its biggest decisions — such as on how much stimulus to provide next year via asset purchases and low-cost bank financing — until its meeting in December.Yet there are signs of growing divisions among its council members. At last month’s meeting, several complained it was underestimating future inflation, warned about the risk of a “regime shift” in prices and pushed for a bigger cut in asset purchases than was ultimately decided.Since then, Jens Weidmann has announced that he will step down as head of Germany’s central bank and leave the ECB council at the end of the year — a move his colleagues said was prompted by his belief that he will struggle to support the ECB’s next decisions.“Weidmann does not want to be blamed for supporting moves that he believes mean the ECB will not react quickly enough to the risk of higher inflation,” said Martin Wolburg, senior economist at Generali Investments Europe.Most economists, however, remain convinced that eurozone inflation will fade below 2 per cent next year, taking pressure off the ECB to act.“One of the reasons we are less worried about a tightening of monetary policy in the eurozone . . . is what is happening with wages,” said Jacob Nell, head of European economics at Morgan Stanley. “We just don’t see any sign yet of wages rising rapidly.”Even in Germany’s buoyant construction sector, trade unions recently agreed to a relatively modest pay increase of just over 2 per cent per year, despite complaints of labour shortages and German inflation surging above 4 per cent to a 29-year high in September.
85  European carmakers must cut their reliance on Asia for semiconductors or risk a repeat of the crisis that has led to factory shutdowns across the continent, the head of the region’s auto association has warned.Volkswagen, BMW and Renault are among those forced to idle plants because of fierce competition for chips — relied on by cars for everything from electronic windows to driver assistance systems — from a consumer electronics industry that boomed during the pandemic.Car sales across Europe fell 23 per cent last month to their lowest level since 1995 as carmakers were unable to meet demand.Oliver Zipse, who is chair of European carmakers’ lobby group ACEA and also chief executive of BMW, warned the industry is facing “severe and immediate consequences” of its inability to buy parts needed for its vehicles.Plans are in place to build more European chip factories, especially in Germany and France. Intel has announced it will spend €80bn to expand its semiconductor manufacturing capacity in Europe.But such new plants will take several years to be ready for production, leaving the continent exposed given much of the production of semiconductors has shifted to countries with cheaper labour costs.In a letter to the European Commission, seen by the Financial Times, he said a “concerted European initiative” is needed to establish sites in the region to rival the chip manufacturing strongholds in Asia.“This unprecedented crisis reveals how unexpectedly vulnerable today’s semiconductor supply chain is, and how urgent it is to minimise our dependency on overseas markets, especially Asia, for these vital components,” he wrote.Plants in Taiwan, China and Japan supply a large number of the industry’s chips. However, these have been hit by interruptions linked to Covid-19, as well as increased demand from smartphone and tablet makers, which traditionally pay more for their chips than hard-bargaining carmakers. Even after paying more, the auto industry is still being hit by factory outages at suppliers, and will take at least until next year to make up the shortfall.“We are living hand to mouth at the moment,” said one senior executive at a major European manufacturer. “The Asian brands are doing much better at the moment, because they have the relationships with their local suppliers. If there was localised supply in Europe it would really, really help.”The stakes for Europe’s carmakers are also rising in step with the increasing reliance of modern cars on chips. The total number of semiconductors needed in each vehicle now runs to several hundred.“I think it’s really clear that we are too dependent on one country, and I think people are willing to pay a little bit more to make sure there is enough supply,” ACEA’s director-general Eric-Mark Huitema told the FT.Renault last week blamed Covid shutdowns in Malaysia for its worsening chip outlook. Clotilde Delbos, the French carmaker’s chief financial officer, warned carmakers are unable to develop the knowhow themselves.“When we hear Europe say that they’re going to build factories that can produce these very advanced chips, you need to first have the technology . . . which is something we clearly don’t have in-house,” she said.Continental, one of the world’s largest car parts makers, last week pointed to “ongoing constraints related to semiconductor components”, as it cut its profit forecasts. Mercedes-Benz, whose sales dropped almost a third in the three months to September when compared with the same period last year, said it would use furlough schemes at its Rastatt plant.
86  A new highway that cuts through land Azerbaijan captured from Armenia less than a year ago showcases Turkey’s growing economic presence in a region that has long been seen as part of Russia’s domain.Crews pouring asphalt on the Victory Road work around the clock for two Turkish companies close to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.The road links Azerbaijan with the historic city of Shusha, the biggest prize Azerbaijan snatched from Armenia in a six-week war over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Thousands died in the 2020 conflict, in which Turkey supplied firepower to help Azerbaijan achieve a decisive edge.Now, Erdogan is reaching out to arch-foe Armenia as he tries to cement Turkey’s influence in the south Caucasus, where it vies with Russia and Iran. He has suggested diplomatic relations could be restored after a nearly 30-year rupture. Nikol Pashinyan, Armenia’s prime minister, has said he is ready for talks “without preconditions”.Turkey sealed its border with Armenia in 1993 to protest against Yerevan’s takeover of Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly ethnic Armenian region that is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan.Russia-brokered ceasefire terms in November 2020 handed Azerbaijan most of the land it had lost to Armenia in the 1990s conflict. Turkey has said the return of the territory eliminates the main obstacle blocking formal ties with Armenia, and in recent weeks Erdogan has said he could work to “gradually normalise relations”. Armenia says it is ready to reciprocate.“As there are positive signals coming from both sides, it gives the opportunity at some point in the near future to start talks . . . on opening the border, starting economic relations and relations between the governments,” said Armen Grigoryan, Armenia’s security council secretary.A thaw would allow trade and diplomacy to take root, but fully fledged reconciliation remains a distant prospect. The neighbours are haunted by the first world war-era genocide of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, which Turkey denies was a state-orchestrated campaign.Critically, Baku is now less resistant to a breakthrough between Ankara and Yerevan. Ilham Aliyev, Azerbaijan’s president, foiled their last attempt to mend fences in 2009, when Erdogan sought to appease him by stipulating that Armenia first resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.“The situation has changed tremendously since 2009 . . . Turkish-Armenian relations should be up to the two countries,” said Hikmet Hajiev, Aliyev’s foreign policy adviser. “We’d love to see a more inclusive process. Everyone should be in if you’re talking about long-term security and stability in the region.”Since last year, Moscow has largely sidelined Ankara in the post-conflict diplomacy, said Richard Giragosian, director of the Regional Studies Center, a Yerevan think-tank. “We have Russian stage management [on] all regional restoration of trade and transport without Turkey at the table. For Turkey, Armenia normalisation is the way to get back a seat.”Inserting Turkey into a regional peace initiative may help Azerbaijan counterbalance Russia, which maintains a military base in Armenia. “Allowing Armenia-Turkey normalisation and bringing Turkey back into the region is necessary to counter Aliyev’s vulnerability to the Russians,” Giragosian said.An enhanced role for Turkey in the region could serve Russia too.Erdogan and Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, support opposing sides in a series of armed conflicts but have crafted a complex security partnership, unnerving Turkey’s traditional western allies. On Saturday, the Turkish leader said he had ordered the expulsion of the ambassador to the US along with nine European envoys, threatening to send Ankara’s relations with western capitals plummeting to a new low.Thomas de Waal, a fellow at Carnegie Europe, said the distrust of the west shared by Erdogan and Putin might compel them to co-operate in the Caucasus to keep the US and Europe on the margins. “They are frenemies that disagree on so many issues but they also talk the same language and have the same Great Power conception that they should sort things out between themselves,” he added.Russia may also be persuaded by the opportunity to revive a Soviet-era direct physical link with Turkey on the railway it fully owns in Armenia, part of its push for greater control of commercial links in the region.For its part, Baku hopes the promise of trade with its neighbours will lure Armenia to open an overland corridor for Azerbaijan to reach its exclave of Nakhchivan and Turkey. “It’s for Armenians’ own benefit to transform from a landlocked country to a transit country,” Hajiev said.Armenia appears unswayed by economic enticements, arguing a peace agreement must come first. “The problem . . . between Armenia and Azerbaijan is not economic. It is the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict,” Grigoryan said.While Pashinyan and Aliyev say they want a peace process, they remain as divided as ever over the fate of the rest of Nagorno-Karabakh that remains in ethnic Armenian hands. Yerevan wants them to retain self-determination while Baku rejects any autonomy for the region.Both sides continue to reinforce positions along the new front line, and skirmishes flare despite the presence of 2,000 Russian peacekeepers.Even if Turkey is not at the negotiating table, its companies are snapping up contracts in reconstruction projects that could total $15bn over the next decade.Aliyev pledged that companies from countries that were “friendly” during the war would benefit, and Erdogan proved his closest ally. This week he is due to accompany Aliyev at the inauguration of an airport that Turkish companies helped build.Azerbaijan is rebuilding Shusha, the nearby former manufacturing centre of Agdam and other areas destroyed by three decades of hostility, to pave the way for the return of hundreds of thousands of Azerbaijanis to areas they fled a generation ago. Last year’s war displaced 35,000 Armenians.Emin Huseynov, the Azerbaijani official overseeing plans for an ultra-modern city to replace the ghost town of Agdam, believes prosperity will ultimately deliver peace.“Those are the villages where Armenians live in poverty,” Huseynov said, pointing to a cluster of houses visible across the Russian-patrolled ceasefire line. “Imagine when this city rises from the ashes. They will see it and come knocking for jobs and to be friends. It’s the best politics. You don’t even have to fight.”
87  All the girls in Paris are wearing mini skirts. Everywhere you look: legs, with summer tans in various states of fade. It’s quite a shift from the skinny jeans, structured blazers and high-heeled Isabel Marant ankle boot combos that have become a uniform for a generation of French women. But change is afoot. The cool-girl Parisienne has loosened up.At first, I found this a little unnerving. When I moved from London to Paris in September, I brought with me a capsule of sharp-shouldered trenchcoats, sleek black blazers, white cotton shirts, cashmere pullovers and slim-legged denim — in other words, the basic building blocks of what’s become “French girl style”.Successive national lockdowns had reinforced the merits of my boyish, uncomplicated wardrobe staples so I had a clear-out, sold my silver glitter Margiela party boots on Vestiaire Collective, and decided to double down on the classics. If I was moving to Paris, I reasoned, I may as well dress the part. (And no, I don’t want to hear any more Emily in Paris gags. You will never catch me in lime-green tweed, even if it comes with Chanel buttons.)But then I took a stroll down the Rue de Rivoli, pausing briefly to observe an American student get slammed off her bicycle by a trottinette électrique gone rogue (she was fine; her Bottega Veneta sunglasses were not) and began counting the mini skirts. Worn with ankle socks and penny loafers or heavy-duty black boots, no less, and often in leather. Then came a procession of leather shorts. Then cargo pants. Some crop tops. Some tie dye. Lots of bright blue. Yellow. Pink. And a series of very baggy jeans. Not a skinny fit or a tailored blazer to be seen.I WhatsApped my friend Eugénie Trochu, the newly installed head of editorial content at Vogue Paris. What’s up with French girl style? She sent a voice note back. “Especially since the pandemic, I have the feeling that Parisian style has evolved. When you are in the streets here, you don’t see any Jane Birkin, Inès de La Fressange or Brigitte Bardot clones. You see girls from everywhere wearing colours and power clothes and statement shoes. I think the French girl is not afraid any more to shine. She used sometimes to hide behind the effortless mood but I think it’s over.”Trochu includes herself in this cadre. “When I started working in fashion 10 years ago, I was trying to reproduce the fashion cliché of La Parisienne, wearing skinny jeans with a cute flower blouse and messy hair. I was not ‘me’ at all.” Her recent move from an apartment in the chichi 6th arrondissement to the more gritty 10th arrondissement has engendered a feeling of liberation. “I have adopted a more daring sense of style, more cosmopolite.” She’s also wearing a lot of mini skirts, mostly “vintage, Courrèges and Zara”.Time to go shopping, I thought to myself, and headed to Le Bon Marché. Rather than the power playlists that dominate London department stores and make everyone feel 80 years old, the Left Bank institution was playing classical music, the volume low. I drifted towards a selection of second-hand denim, curated by Imparfaite, a vintage clothing website with a brilliant Levi’s 501 calculator that many fashion editors swear by. I tried on an €89 pair that were snug at the waist, but with just the right amount of 1980s-esque roominess in the leg, purchased them, and left feeling new-gen French.Vintage is back in a big way in Paris. Collector Square is a popular preloved bag and jewellery platform with 350,000 active members where Parisians head for second-hand Chanel bags and Cartier watches. You have to be quick: an Hermès Kelly mini 20cm bag sold for €17,980 in a few seconds after going online recently.Last month, Printemps unveiled a new 1,300 sq m floor dedicated to “circularity”: alongside upcycled brands and repair stations, there is an attic’s worth of vintage and pre-owned exemplars, curated by Marie Blanchet of Mon Vintage. A black velvet Yves Saint Laurent haute couture cocktail dress from the AW83 collection tugged on my heartstrings during a browse one Sunday morning (though the price, at €4,500, made me balk).More tempting was a neat little Balenciaga coat from the pre-fall 2008 collection for €1,100; the hang tag provided photographic evidence that it was once worn by the actor and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg. (Gainsbourg is god in Paris, a living radiographie du casual chic, or blueprint for easy-chic style, as Vogue Paris once put it.)I resisted, but several days later experienced a bizarre and unexpected urge to buy a leather aviator jacket. I hadn’t seen one in the wild for years — not since Acne Studios’ hit Velocite style cornered the market in 2015. But I noticed a woman in Pigalle crossing the road wearing a brown shearling style, and now it’s all I can think about.A little bit 1970s, a little bit 1990s — fashion-wise, there appears to be a spirit of wildness in the air. Though the country is still in the grip of Covid-19, with proof of vaccination required in most places and mask-wearing indoors and on public transport mandatory, the French are cheerfully adhering to these small inconveniences. The bars and restaurants are full, and the streets are thronging. A mood of frivolity prevails.Perhaps it’s all the cycling. Last year, mayor Anne Hidalgo oversaw the inception of more than 100 miles of new cycle paths in her bid to make Paris a sustainable, cycling-friendly hub. Parisians have responded: today, a million people in a city of 10m are biking daily. Many of them take little heed of red lights, or helmets, or Lycra. Instead, they’re cycling in bright green trouser suits and platform heels, in hot pants and leather clogs, in jeans and strawberry-printed Crocs.This week, I joined them. In a black oversized Bottega Veneta silk shirt worn as a mini dress, I hopped on a Vélib’, the cheap bike-rental service, and pedalled across town, trenchcoat flaring out behind me. Freewheeling liberté — it feels pretty good.Follow @financialtimesfashion on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first
88  Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan stepped back on Monday from his threat to expel 10 western ambassadors who had called for the release of the businessman and activist Osman Kavala — avoiding what would have been his biggest clash with western allies since he came to power. The compromise is welcome. Yet the damage already done to ties with key partners, and the credibility of Turkey’s economic governance, will not be quickly repaired. The episode highlights, too, the alarming degree to which Turkish policy now hangs on the whim of an ever more authoritarian — and erratic — leader.Those seeking to give Erdogan some benefit of the doubt suggest his rage against the diplomats was designed to distract from the economic meltdown his idiosyncratic policies are causing. It may also have been designed to rally patriotic support as the president languishes in opinion polls ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections that must be held by June 2023. Like his fellow strongman in Hungary, Viktor Orban, Erdogan is facing a joint attempt by an alliance of opposition parties to dispatch him from office.The altercation also surely highlights the depth of the Turkish president’s personal loathing for Kavala, who Erdogan believes financed and encouraged the “Gezi Park” protests in 2013 and who he has accused of being involved in the attempted coup of 2016. Erdogan appeared to feel the risk of a backlash over the expulsion of 10 allied ambassadors was one worth taking in order to make his feelings clear.Even after Monday’s compromise, however, the affair is likely to widen the wedge between Turkey and Nato allies, and increase Erdogan’s reliance on Russia’s Vladimir Putin. It will complicate Ankara’s efforts to acquire 40 newer US F16 fighter jets — and kits to modernise almost 80 of its existing F16s — after Turkey was barred from receiving an order of next-generation F35s following Erdogan’s purchase of a Russian air defence system. Ankara is already under mounting US pressure after a US appeals court on Friday rejected a bid by the state lender Halkbank to dismiss a case accusing it of assisting Iran in evading US sanctions.While the lira bounced back from earlier lows, moreover, the impression of a wayward president increasingly surrounded by yes-men has further dented investor confidence. A hefty current account deficit and Turkish banks’ and companies’ sizeable stock of short-term external debt make the country one of those deemed most vulnerable to a tightening of US monetary policy. Flows of tourists, who provide foreign exchange earnings, are still stymied by pandemic restrictions, and Turkey is dependent on ever more expensive gas imports for energy.Erdogan’s behaviour has rattled investors, already deterred by his meddling in the central bank, who could finance the difference. That increases the danger of the long-foreseen balance of payments crisis finally erupting.Turkey’s western partners were wise to seek to calm the dispute by declaring their compliance with Article 41 of the Vienna Convention, which includes a duty for diplomats not to interfere in the internal affairs of host states. Erdogan craved a clash enabling him to blame the country’s woes on supposed foreign ill-wishers. But while respecting their commitments, US and European capitals should continue to press for the release of Kavala — against whom the charges are flimsy — and for respect for rule of law. The further Erdogan departs from that, the deeper he will lead Turkey into an economic and political black hole.
89  Good evening,“Sand in the wheels of the economy is holding back the recovery” was how today’s closely watched Ifo survey characterised a six-month low in German business confidence.Sentiment fell in every sector except for construction as supply bottlenecks hit manufacturing capacity and also dragged down confidence in retail. After a bounceback in the second quarter as pandemic restrictions were lifted, economists expect growth of 2.2 per cent in Europe’s biggest economy when third-quarter figures are published on Friday. However, after today’s data some are expecting a sharp slowdown in the final quarter of the year.Jeremy Nixon, boss of Ocean Network Express, which carries more than 6 per cent of global container freight, was the latest to voice the effect of the supply chain squeeze on international trade. Nixon warned that the crisis could last at least another year unless governments boosted investment in ports, railways, warehousing and road systems.Warehouse space in the UK could run out within a year as supply chain disruptions coincide with surging levels of online shopping, according to one property agent. More than a quarter of UK retail spend now takes place online, although this has fallen back from a peak of 37 per cent in January, according to official data.Fears of shipping delays are also driving growth in “buy online, pick-up in store”, or “Bopis” as it’s known among retailers. Although the trend has somewhat overwhelmed smaller retailers, it has helped big name US stores who have been able to turn their shops into distribution centres after years of being trounced by online-only rivals such as Amazon.The effects of the squeeze also continue to be a key feature of third-quarter earnings season, with Kimberly-Clark becoming the latest consumer goods company to warn investors of a hit to sales and earnings.Meanwhile, the advertising industry is having to rethink its big promotional campaigns in its most important period of the year — the run-up to Christmas.

We’ll let you know all the details in Wednesday’s Road to Recovery but in the meantime you’ll find full coverage here.Today’s Big Read examines Spain’s attempts to transform its economy. The country’s plans for spending EU recovery funds is seen as a litmus test for the bloc’s overall €800bn recovery programme, potentially paving the way for a more stable and integrated eurozone, with a permanent emergency borrowing facility and a banking union.Investor concern over Turkey’s economy sent the lira to a new record low after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan intensified his threat to expel western diplomats. The currency has already lost a quarter of its value since the start of 2021, as Erdogan has pressured the central bank to make rate cuts despite rising inflation.Coronavirus cases, hospital admissions and deaths are soaring across central and eastern Europe. Romania’s daily toll of 19 deaths per million as of October 20 is the highest in the world, just ahead of neighbouring countries Bulgaria and Moldova.The pandemic stimulus has backfired in emerging markets, says contributing editor Ruchir Sharma, with aggressive monetary and fiscal intervention doing little to help economic recovery. Covax, the UN’s scheme to make sure poorer nations get their fair share of vaccines, is still faltering, with FT analysis showing that wealthy countries have received more than 16 times more jabs per person.Americans are starting to dust off their credit cards after using government stimulus cheques and forbearance programmes to reduce their debts. Increased borrowing is good news for a banking industry that has had problems finding profitable uses for the cash piling up on its balance sheets.US Democrats say they are close to a deal on President Joe Biden’s spending bill. Biden hopes to finalise the bill before heading to the G20 in Rome this week.HSBC joined the string of banks reporting soaring profits as it announced a 74 per cent jump to $5.4bn and a $2bn share buyback, thanks to the improving UK and global economic outlook.Not everyone is convinced about the prospects for UK recovery though. Investors have pulled $9.4bn out of UK-focused equity funds this year as worries about slow growth, energy costs, high inflation and interest rate rises overshadowed good news about a well-run vaccination programme.

90  Poland is to boost the number of troops on its border with Belarus to about 10,000 in an effort to cope with a surge in migrants orchestrated by the regime of Belarus’s authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko.Mariusz Blaszczak, Poland’s defence minister, said on Monday that soldiers from the 12th, 16th and 18th divisions would be deployed to the country’s eastern flank to join the several thousand already patrolling the border.“We will increase the number of soldiers helping the border guard by 2,500,” he wrote on Twitter. “Soon, about 10,000 military personnel will be watching over the impermeability of the border.”Poland and the EU accuse Lukashenko’s regime of funnelling thousands of migrants to Belarus’s borders with the EU in an effort to destabilise the bloc in retaliation for the bloc’s support for the Belarusian opposition, which has been subject to a vicious crackdown over the past year.The number of attempted illegal crossings into Poland and Lithuania has jumped in recent months, with migrants from countries including Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and Yemen trying to enter the EU.In response, Polish security forces have already laid kilometres of razor-wire fencing along the country’s eastern flank, and the government is pushing through legislation that will pave the way for a €350m wall on the border.Warsaw has also passed legislation that human rights groups have condemned as an attempt to legalise pushbacks of migrants in breach of international law, and introduced a state of emergency along its border with Belarus.Several migrants have died this year during attempts to enter Poland. Human rights groups fear that the toll could rise as winter sets in and temperatures drop further, and have criticised the Polish government for not allowing NGOs into the border zone to provide help for the migrants who have arrived there.Poland’s border guard said on Monday that two soldiers had been injured at the weekend when a group of about 60 migrants tried to force their way into the country near the village of Usnarz Gorny, where a group was previously trapped between Polish and Belarusian forces for several weeks.“Among those trying to force the border, officials recognised Belarusian soldiers in civilian clothes, who, among other things, cut the wire coils with scissors,” the Polish border service said in a statement.Despite the Polish attempts to prevent entry, thousands of migrants have made it across the country to the border with Germany, which for many is the preferred destination.On Sunday, German police disarmed about 50 far-right German vigilantes who were trying to patrol the border with Poland to keep the migrants out.Germany’s interior minister, Horst Seehofer, said that there had been 6,162 “unauthorised entries” into Germany from Poland and Belarus this year.“We have already strengthened the border force on the German-Polish border with 800 police,” he said in an interview with the newspaper Bild am Sonntag. “If necessary, I am prepared to increase the number further.”
91  Following lockdowns on both sides of the Channel, Hélène Darroze at The Connaught only reopened this May. Her second Paris venue, Jòia, reopened in June. Marsan remained shut until September, in part because – this year of all years – Darroze had agreed to launch another restaurant at Villa La Coste in Provence.But what a restaurant. And what a place to open it. Set in the heart of the Château La Coste vineyard and looking out on a spectacular landscape of green slopes and distant mountains, Villa La Coste is both a luxury hotel and open-air museum. The 600-acre grounds are dotted with bold sculptures by leading artists such as Richard Serra, Sean Scully, Louise Bourgeois and Jenny Holzer, as well as pavilions by world-class architects including Frank Gehry, Tadao Ando and Jean Nouvel. Walking the grounds is exhilarating.I want to create a dish with vegetables and herbs that looks like a painting”Villa La Coste belongs to Paddy McKillen (co-owner of the Maybourne Hotel Group which includes the Connaught), who has a very good working relationship with Darroze. She first brought her team here for a pop-up in 2019, when the Connaught restaurant was being refurbished, and the residency proved so popular that McKillen suggested Darroze take over the restaurant – housed in a glass box suspended over a mirror basin – on a longer-term basis. Then came the extra stars – and with them raised expectations. Darroze began to question whether this was the right time to undertake the project after all. “When you get a second and third star, and are closed for a few months, you have to reopen everything and be organised. If it were not for Paddy,” she says, “I’m not sure I would have done it.” And yet the project remained hugely appealing. For Darroze, who runs a large team of “people who want to grow with me”, she says, Villa La Coste presented a fresh opportunity for her staff to develop. It also tapped into a longstanding ambition of hers. Having worked for Alain Ducasse at the Louis XV in Monaco at the start of her career, “I always had the idea to come back to Mediterranean cuisine one day”. At Villa La Coste, she can put her stamp on Provençal cooking (what she calls “the cuisine of women”), with a particular focus on vegetables. “For me, Provence is vegetables,” she says. “And sun.” Fruit and vegetables get top billing on her eight-course “Walk Into The Gardens of Provence” menu. Each course is headlined “Melon”, “Cucumber”, “Courgettes”, “Aubergines”, and so on, with meat or fish trailed as a garnish. During my visit in September, I wondered if this was merely a trick of labelling, as each course came with a fairly sizeable portion of protein. Were the meat and fish garnishes in name only? The “Melon” dish, for instance, comprised shaved ribbons of Piel di Sapo (Santa Claus) melon on plump oyster meat with an ample serving of Baeri caviar in a silky ponzu dashi. However, the oceanic flavours of the seafood and the fleeting snag of a few garlic flowers served mostly to draw out the perfumed sweetness of the melon. You’d think the fruit would be eclipsed. Instead, its melon-ness took centre stage and came through as brightly and exquisitely as a soprano’s voice.Elsewhere the balancing act was just as adept. On a plate that contained grilled red mullet and lemon verbena aioli – both insistent flavours – it was the courgettes (a ratatouille-stuffed flower and a crunchy seared pâtisson) that really held my attention. Paired with a thick puck of roasted lamb saddle, the confit, barbecued and lavender-honey-glazed aubergine somehow managed to dominate. “I never had such beautiful comments on my food,” Darroze says of the remarks she has already received from locals on TripAdvisor.But the menu is just the beginning. Darroze wants to develop the potager (kitchen gardens) on the estate so that more produce is grown on-site. She also hopes to bring more visual flair to the plate, as befits a restaurant at a world-class destination for art. “I want to create a dish with vegetables and herbs that looks like a painting,” she says. “I can see it a little already.” And what about securing another star? “Oh là là,” she demurs. “I don’t know about that.” But it would be nice? “For the team, yes. I think so.” @ajesh34
92  President Recep Tayyip Erdogan climbed down from a threat to expel 10 western ambassadors, pulling Turkey back from the brink of the worst crisis with the US and Europe in decades and easing the pressure on the lira.The Turkish leader said that a joint statement by the US, Germany, France and seven other European countries calling for the release of a jailed philanthropist had been a “great insult” to Turkey.But he said that a decision by the 10 nations to publicly restate their commitment to the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations on Monday had represented a step back.“Our aim was not to create a crisis, but to protect Turkey’s honour, pride and dignity,” he said in a televised statement. “With the statement made today by the ambassadors, their mistakes have been reversed.”He added: “I believe that, in future, they will be more cautious about Turkey’s sovereign rights.”The move followed 48 hours of behind-the-scenes discussions, diplomats in Ankara said, as senior figures in Erdogan’s government sought to talk the president down from a move that would have caused severe damage to Turkey’s already strained relations with the west and inflicted more pain on the lira.The threat of the expulsion sent the currency — already down by more than 20 per cent in 2021 amid investor concern about Erdogan’s economic management — tumbling to a new record low against the dollar, reaching 9.85 early on Monday. The lira reversed most of those losses after later signs of a detente.Erdogan was enraged by last week’s joint statement calling for a “just and speedy resolution” in the case of Osman Kavala, 64, who has become a symbol of a sweeping Turkish crackdown against journalists, activists and opposition politicians.The joint text said the case against the former businessman, who has spent the past four years behind bars, “cast a shadow over respect for democracy, the rule of law and transparency in the Turkish judiciary system” and called for a “just and speedy resolution” to his case.Turkey has accused Kavala of playing a role in large protests that rocked his government in 2013 and a 2016 coup attempt. Erdogan has described him as a “terrorist”.“Is it your place to give lessons to Turkey?” the Turkish president said last week in an angry response to the joint call, issued on the fourth anniversary of Kavala’s arrest. “Do you release bandits, killers or terrorists in your country?”On Saturday he said he had ordered his foreign minister to declare the 10 ambassadors “persona non grata.” Yet by Sunday night the envoys had still received no formal notification that they would be asked to leave.Diplomats in Ankara said the foreign minster, Mevlut Cavusoglu, and Erdogan’s spokesman and adviser Ibrahim Kalin led the efforts to talk the president down amid concerns about the fallout from a row with some of Turkey’s largest trading partners and most important Nato allies.On Monday afternoon, the US embassy published a tweet restating its commitment to Article 41 of the Vienna Convention, which sets out the duty of diplomats “not to interfere in the internal affairs” of a state where they work. The other nations either shared similar messages or retweeted the US post.Shortly afterwards, Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency said Erdogan “welcomed” the statements.While diplomats from the nations in question voiced relief at what they saw as the president’s volte face, analysts said the episode had still damaged relations between Turkey and its traditional western allies, especially the US.Turkey had been hoping to persuade the Biden administration to lobby Congress in support of its efforts to buy several dozen F16 fighter jets to fill a hole in its air force. Erdogan had been due to meet President Joe Biden on the sidelines of a meeting of the G20 in Rome this weekend.“Biden was already not excited about engaging with Erdogan,” said Soner Cagaptay, an analyst at the Washington Institute think-tank. “There were people [within his administration] making the case. That group is going to be further sidelined after today.”Additional reporting by Adam Samson in London
93  If something seems too good to be true, it usually is. A capital-enhancing takeover of parts of Monte dei Paschi di Siena would have been a coup for UniCredit’s Andrea Orcel. He may have overplayed his hand by demanding a reported €6.5bn from the state to patch up the holes in the smaller Italian bank. This price was too rich for politicians who walked away from a deal over the weekend.Orcel deserves credit for holding out for a big dowry. This was needed to compensate UniCredit minorities for the risks of integration and bad debts. He may have made some enemies along the way. The Italian establishment saw the former UBS banker as a man hired to do a deal, talk of which may recur.The state will now have to renegotiate an extension of its EU deadline to exit MPS by the end of this year. Taxpayers will have to provide a fresh cash injection. Orcel must, meanwhile, present UniCredit shareholders with alternatives.There are two main options. UniCredit could try buying Banco BPM if greater Italian exposure is still needed. If not, lower costs and higher capital returns should be priorities.The fact that UniCredit shares barely moved on Monday shows that investors are still giving Orcel the benefit of the doubt. MPS was never going to be an easy target to absorb, even with surplus equity. Summer stress testing showed the bank was the continent’s weakest by many magnitudes. Some assets are on life support. Many will be reclassified when debt moratoria come to an end this year.UniCredit is in better shape than it has been for years. A common equity tier one ratio of 15.5 per cent fully loaded leaves plenty of potential for buybacks. Trading at half their book value, the cheap shares reflect uncertainties around strategy even as the rate outlook improves.Jefferies thinks the stock should yield 8 per cent if M&A remains off the table. But that was pretty much the plan of Orcel’s predecessor Jean Pierre Mustier. Shareholders may be left wondering why a new chief executive was needed in the first place.
94  Hello from Brussels. All the talk here is of the EU’s big bust-up with Poland over money and the rule of law. As far as we’re concerned this illustrates how Brussels’ plans for becoming a geopolitical power and using trade to project European values abroad and so on are often rather feebly let down by events at home. It’s a bit hard to chunter on about promoting democracy and freedom in the Indo-Pacific when you’re struggling to get them respected in a country next door to Germany.Today’s main piece is on industrial subsidies, which are undoubtedly distorting global trade, but — and here’s a big part of the problem — we don’t really know by how much.Charted waters looks at how the UK’s supply chain is suffering from a lack of warehouse space.Sometimes it feels to us that the importance of something in trade is in inverse proportion to our ability to measure, or even define, it. We spend a lot of time going on about goods tariffs (steel, aluminium, agriculture) because you can put a percentage value on them and they affect trade pretty much by definition. Government subsidies to industry? Much harder to evaluate their size and effect. You can put numbers on cash handouts and tax breaks, assuming you can identify them, but the myriad ways in which the multi-layered Chinese state extends below-market lending to favoured companies is harder to pin down.To give a specific example: we’ve written before about how trade lawyers and the EU last year started to execute a cunning plan to go after Chinese subsidies to companies outside China, starting with a case in Egypt. We speculated this might open the way to a broad-spectrum legal campaign against the handouts that facilitate China’s Belt and Road Initiative. In the event it just hasn’t happened: no new cases since the beginning of last year, as far as we can tell. It’s apparently too hard to prove exactly how China is doing the subsidising.Into this vacuum canters Global Trade Alert, the analytical service run out of St Gallen university in Switzerland, which for more than a decade has done fine work documenting acts of protectionism that aren’t reported to the World Trade Organization or otherwise recorded. Global Trade Alert’s latest report, through combing official documents, finds that corporate subsidies officially notified by governments to the WTO are massively smaller than their real size.Even before the pandemic, more than 80 per cent of goods imports into China and the EU were in products where subsidies had been received by local rivals (the figure for the US is 66 per cent). Nearly two-thirds (62 per cent) of global trade was in products and trade routes where subsidised US, EU and Chinese companies compete.Now, we should give the familiar caveats with Global Trade Alert. It doesn’t directly measure how big the distortive effect of subsidies are, and is more useful in revealing a massive unrecognised problem than providing a definitive guide on measuring it. But the report is surely right to conclude there is a clear need for much better recording of subsidies and their economic effects, let alone discussions on new rules to constrain them.The debate about subsidies as a trade issue is getting more salient. Pandemic-related corporate bailouts are one thing, but the transition to a green economy has the potential for handouts to go on for much longer. Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner, told the Financial Times recently that the suspension of EU state aid rules would continue for longer and some might end up being permanently waived.Let’s not overreact and espouse a pearl-clutching libertarian disgust at all government subsidies. Technologies with potential to reduce carbon emissions have planet-saving positive externalities that justify state intervention. And of course it’s possible to design some of these subsidies to be non trade distorting: tax breaks for consumers to buy electric cars, rather than producers to make them, are one example. And there are subsidy rules in the WTO that cover which subsidies are outright illegal and which can be challenged through dispute settlement or met with countervailing duties.But working out what those rules apply to and how to calculate them is subject to considerable uncertainty, and writing new ones even harder. For example: we’re bigger fans of the EU-US Airbus-Boeing litigation than some, given its role in restraining subsidies. But it doesn’t create certainty about future spending programmes to come up with an unconvincing fudge to resolve 17 years of arguing about precise issues. (Whether it was an implicit state subsidy to Airbus to use public money to extend the runway at Germany’s Bremen airport to allow the A380 to land was perhaps our favourite wrinkle in the litigation.)Similarly, one of the ways the WTO dispute settlement process has annoyed the US is by drawing a narrow definition of what constitutes a “public body” — something that in turn limits what can be defined as a state subsidy. We have some sympathy for the US, given that this somewhat narrow definition lets China off the hook for plenty of the state support it provides.The US, EU and Japan have promised for years to draft a broader definition that they can suggest as a change to WTO rules, but they can’t even agree among themselves. In any case, the chance that Beijing will voluntarily sign on to a substantive new constraint to its industrial policy is close to nil.There’s a big test coming up of how subsidies can be defined, measured and dealt with. As we’ve noted before, the EU, as part of its general strategy of creating unilateral tools where the multilateral ones aren’t working, is designing a foreign subsidies rule that essentially extends its state aid regime to overseas companies operating in the European market. We’ll return in due course to how the plans are developing. But the fact that the EU feels driven to this point underlines the discontent about how the current global subsidies regime is working.The supply chain snags affecting the global economy are a many headed beast. One of those heads, so to speak, is a lack of warehouse space.When demand for consumer durables is so hot, this might sound counter intuitive. Surely warehouses would be empty as people buy up stock as soon as it becomes available right? However, it’s a little more complex in practice.What seems to be happening is this. Goods are made of many parts and a shortage of some of those parts has meant that the ones that are there are left lingering on shelves for longer than usual. A shortage of workers may also be exacerbating the problem.The chart below highlights the situation in the UK, where it seems all of the UK’s larger warehouses are now booked out. Claire JonesA rare good news story on supply chains. We’ve been keeping a close eye on Ryan Petersen’s excellent Twitter threads of late. The Flexport chief executive has been heading down to ports on the US West Coast to speak to workers about the delays in getting containers off ships and out of the port. One of the tweetstorms that’s resulted from that seems to have triggered a policy change that might save Christmas. If gloom’s more your thing and you prefer hearing about festive season shortages, here’s a piece from the New York Times ($).Nikkei reports ($) that China will restructure three rare-earths producers to create a state-owned company with a nearly 70 per cent share of the domestic production quota for metals critical to high-tech manufacturing. In Japan, chicken has become (Nikkei, $) the most visible example of the global supply crunch, with 7-Eleven halting sales of its popular fried chicken snack and restaurants limiting servings to one chicken skewer per customer.

95  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.After last week’s clash among EU leaders on how to deal with the power crisis, tomorrow it’s up for energy ministers to pick up the pieces and try to find a reasonable way forward. We’ll look at what the thorniest issues are and how things are likely to pan out.With all eyes on Russia and Vladimir Putin’s not-so-subtle solution to Europe’s energy crisis (approve Nord Stream 2, or else), the bloc’s second-largest gas supplier, Norway, has just had a change of leadership.Its newly elected prime minister, Jonas Gahr Store, told the FT in an interview that his country is not only helping in the current crisis with extra gas supplies, but is also looking at ways to be part of the EU’s transition to a carbon neutral economy.Meanwhile, the other EU fight — over Poland’s rule of law — is nowhere near resolution, with the country’s prime minister, in an interview with the FT, accusing the bloc of making demands at gunpoint.In policy news, the commission on Wednesday is set to give banks two more years to implement stricter capital requirements (read our story here).And with a few more weeks to go before the commission’s planned update of competition rules, we look at Big Tech’s last-ditch lobby attempt to water down some of the provisions.The EU’s energy ministers meeting in Luxembourg tomorrow might be in agreement over short-term measures they are already implementing to deal with the energy crisis, but the bloc’s dispute over how much state intervention and centralised power are warranted to avert future crises is nowhere near resolution, write Mehreen Khan and Valentina Pop in Brussels.During last week’s summit, a number of countries, including France, Spain, Poland and Greece, have advocated a full-blown overhaul of the bloc’s energy market rules — to allow long-term prices and mitigate volatility.In the opposing camp, the free marketeers — Germany, the Netherlands, Ireland, the Nordics and Baltics — insist that the current set-up should be maintained and want to steer clear of any radical ideas such as giving Brussels the power to negotiate contracts with Russia and other suppliers on behalf of the entire bloc. (In case you were wondering why Spain is rather lenient on Poland in the rule of law discussion, one explanation may be that they are both fans of joint EU gas purchasing — Madrid due to its politically explosive gas crunch, Poland because of its anxiety regarding Russian supplies).Ministers tomorrow will continue the discussion on the European Commission’s so-called toolbox, which for now only includes a passing reference to proposals for joint EU procurement and storage for natural gas, which it will table in December.Already last week, commission chief Ursula von der Leyen reassured the free marketeers that any common procurement would be voluntary, allowing only countries who want to pool their resources to do so.Other medium-term measures included in the toolbox are further investments in renewable energy, infrastructure that is geared towards more flexibility and storage and renovating buildings to improve energy efficiency. The commission also pledged to analyse the current design of the wholesale electricity market and to work on improving the functioning of retail markets.In order to streamline the ministers’ discussion — compared with the leaders’ four-hour back and forth on the topic last week — they were invited to prepare their country’s position on two questions:If ministers agree to disagree, there will be plenty more meetings to hash this out, including the next EU summit in December — which will be after the commission puts forward its proposed voluntary gas purchasing mechanism.Norway’s new prime minister Jonas Gahr Store is keen to underline his internationalist credentials, giving his first newspaper interviews not to local media but to the Financial Times, Le Monde and Der Spiegel, writes Richard Milne in Oslo.His message is clear — Norway has a lot to offer the EU. Not just in the current energy crisis, where Norway has found some extra gas and is exporting electricity both to the continent and the UK, but also in the future.Gahr Store, leader of the centre-left Labour party and a former foreign minister, thinks Norway’s enviable energy status — as the second-largest exporter of gas to the EU behind Russia and home to almost 100 per cent renewable electricity production thanks to extensive hydropower — is highly attractive at the moment as many in Brussels worry about this winter, let alone industry’s needs in the decades ahead.Despite some rumblings in Norway that the country should keep its green electricity to itself, the new prime minister made clear that power exchange was “necessary for Norway and necessary for Europe, and that will continue”.One of the new minority coalition’s stated goals is to help develop many of the new green technologies Europe needs to master to reach its climate targets. Gahr Store intends to visit Brussels to discuss how Norway can fit in with the EU’s Fit for 55 programme.“Norway has an opportunity as an energy nation, as an ocean nation, as a coastal nation to develop technologies and industries that can make big differences globally,” he said, in reference to carbon storage, hydrogen and offshore wind.Trickier issues however are likely to surface in Norway’s relation with the EU. (Norway is not a member of the bloc but has full access to the single market in return for adopting EU rules and regulations). Both Gahr Store and his Eurosceptic coalition partners, the agrarian Centre party, want to negotiate parts of the EU’s railway strategy, particularly on allowing foreign competition, he said.Romania is at the heart of a relentless wave of Covid-19 sweeping across eastern Europe and the Balkans that threatens to overwhelm health services. The country’s daily toll of 19 deaths per million as of October 20 is the highest in the world, while only one-third of its population is fully vaccinated. Distrust in authorities, disinformation and political instability are seen as the main reasons for the low uptake. (More here)EU regulators want to increase the level of scrutiny on foreign investments that may come to the bloc with heavy subsidies, but a new study commissioned by an association representing Big Tech argues why this move could prove counterproductive, writes Javier Espinoza in Brussels.For months Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition supremo, has been working on a regulatory tool aimed at clamping down on foreign public subsidies that many have interpreted as a challenge to China. She is due to publish in mid-November a review of the bloc’s competition arsenal (which will come into force next year), including this latest tool.Brussels has spotted a gap in its state aid rule book, which only applies to European companies who have often complained they are being undercut by non-EU (read, Chinese) state-backed companies when trying to acquire other entities or when bidding for public contracts. But US tech companies also feel targeted and are flagging concerns.A paper written by RBB Economics and commissioned by the Computer and Communications Industry Association, whose members include Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon, will outline later today what it sees as negative impacts of this upcoming stricter regime.“The commission’s broad approach can be expected to seriously discourage foreign investment in the EU — even if that investment involves no subsidy and results in no distortion — to the detriment of Europe’s economic recovery,” writes Benoît Durand, an RBB partner.The report lists three main reasons why it is against the planned changes to the competition rule book:It seems that despite all the recent buzz about transatlantic co-operation in trade and technology, one regulatory initiative on this side of the pond is being met with just as much pushback from Big Tech as the efforts on the US side have encountered . . and later this week
96  Poland’s prime minister has accused the EU of making demands with a “gun to our head,” Russian mercenaries are wreaking havoc in the Central African Republic. Plus, the FT’s Ed White discusses the global popularity of South Korea’s entertainment industry, and why China’s recent crackdowns might threaten its success. Poland’s prime minister accuses EU of making demands with ‘gun to our head’.
97  It was as if events took place in reverse. In March, Spain’s prime minister Pedro Sánchez and King Felipe VI visited the carmaker Seat, near Barcelona, to mark their support for the electric vehicle project the country hopes will modernise and preserve its vital automobile industry.The project is the showpiece of Spain’s plans to spend €70bn of grants from the EU’s coronavirus recovery fund. The visit felt like an inauguration. But it was only four months later that the government issued its formal approval for the scheme. Even now the rules for the consortium behind it have yet to be issued. The tender will not begin until the end of this year and the funds will only be disbursed in 2022.Spain is in a hurry to spend the money. But the delays to the electric vehicle project — and the lack of clarity about its rules — are one of several question marks hanging over what Sánchez says is the “most ambitious” economic transformation programme in the country’s modern history and the biggest opportunity since it joined the European Community 35 years ago.The Spanish plan is also a litmus test for the EU’s overall €800bn recovery programme — a gamble to modernise the European economy and deepen integration whose execution represents perhaps the biggest challenge the bloc now faces.The Spanish government says its national plan, involving 110 investments and 102 reforms, will create 800,000 jobs during the next three years through spending on green technology, digitalisation, education and training.“It is essential that we receive these amounts at this moment,” says María Jesús Montero, Spain’s budget minister, adding that the country is still coping with the “hangover” from the savage 11 per cent contraction in gross domestic product in 2020.But she adds: “For us the European funds are a fundamental help not just to accelerate the economic recovery . . . but to achieve a programme of transformation. We have agreed with Europe that these resources will allow us to carry out change.”In theory, the big benefits will come over the longer term and they hinge more on economic reforms than investment. Reforms in areas such as labour markets, taxation and pensions could boost the economy by 8-10 per cent over 20 years, according to rough estimates by the Spanish government and European Commission.There is much at stake for the EU too. Spain’s plan is the second biggest in the EU after Italy, amounting to €140bn, including €70bn in loans which Madrid is expected to request at some point in the next two years.If the €800bn recovery fund — which is financed by common EU debt issuance — is seen as a success, it could pave the way to a more closely integrated and stable eurozone, with a permanent facility to borrow in times of crisis and a banking union. If it is a failure, the forward march of the EU could come to a definitive halt. Spain is a crucial test case.Some critics are already warning that the country may be about to miss its historic opportunity because of politicised spending plans and halfhearted reforms. They charge that Spain is using the money to turbo-charge the recovery ahead of elections due in 2023 rather than finance long overdue reforms to raise productivity.“We need a reform plan and instead we are seeing a counter-reform plan,” Mariano Rajoy, the country’s former centre-right prime minister, said last month.Against the commission’s initial advice, Spain intends to front-load the funds, spending 77 per cent of its grants over the next three years.“We are trying to balance the long-term investment plans and transforming the economy with the bread and butter of today,” says Manuel de la Rocha, Sánchez’s main economic adviser, who oversaw the plan’s submission to Brussels. “We can’t wait so many years to spend the money, because people need jobs now.”While most of the resources will not begin to reach recipients until next year, the main spending priorities have already been outlined. They include €3bn in public funds for the electric car initiative, a €7bn programme to increase the energy efficiency of buildings, and €3.5bn on helping as many as 1m small and medium sized businesses go online.“The tenders are being launched and are on track,” says Nadia Calviño, deputy prime minister for the economy. “My assessment is that we have made enormous progress when one thinks that it was [only] in July last year that the [EU] leaders agreed to create the plan . . . in terms of historical timelines this is really remarkable.”She argues that the fundamental goal of the plan is to “undertake a transformative modernisation process” that boosts growth and increases its resilience over the medium and longer term, adding that the programme will “reach cruise speed next year”.But, in contrast with Italy, where the national unity government has forged a consensus around its plans, Spain’s hyper-partisan political debate means there is no national agreement on the use of the funds.Pablo Casado, the leader of the main centre right People’s party, has argued that the prime minister’s control over the resources could lead to “clientelism . . . that ends in corruption”. In an interview with the FT this year, he added: “Businesses are taking unprofitable projects out of the drawer — and the government is saying: ‘Give me projects so I can justify the European funds’ . . . It’s irresponsible.”The country’s regions will spend some €22bn of the €70bn in grants, but Javier Fernández Lasquetty, the PP politician who is the chief economics official for the 6.6m strong Madrid region, complains that his hands are tied right down to the smallest of programmes.In Madrid’s case these include €2m the central government has allocated for spending on becoming an “audiovisual hub” and €600,000 on the environmental and digital transformation of the agricultural and fishing system of the landlocked region.But while critics complain that allocation of the fund has been placed under the government’s direct control with little input from the opposition parties or Spain’s 17 regional administrations, the government and commission both maintain it will be subject to tough external controls.Spanish officials are all too aware of the resentment caused in Greece by the “men in black” — the EU and IMF officials who oversaw Athens’ austerity programme in the aftermath of the financial crisis. They add that they have resisted pressure from Brussels to micromanage the use of the funds.But they argue that the conditionality imposed by the EU is unprecedented all the same — “stripping governments naked”, in the words of one.Overall, the plan has 416 milestones and targets agreed with Brussels, three quarters of them in the period up to 2023. The key condition for the funds to keep flowing is for Spain to keep its word on carrying out reforms — particularly in some of the most sensitive parts of the economy.The Spanish plan was among the first to receive official approval from Brussels. Ursula von der Leyen, commission president, has hailed it as “ambitious [and] far-sighted”. Sceptics worry that the conditionality of the EU programme — which will include €70bn of loans in 2024-26 after the equivalent amount of grants for the first three years — will be weaker than expected.The EU’s northern member states, which initially tried to scale down the size of the recovery fund arguing grants would be wasted, are watching closely.Adriaan Schout, a senior researcher at the Netherlands Institute for International Relations and a former adviser to the Dutch government, says Spain’s plan compares unfavourably to Italy’s under prime minister Mario Draghi.“Spain impressed a decade ago with the way its banks were restructured. However, that was a decade and a crisis ago. Italy has now picked up speed under Draghi and the national reform plan is more concrete when it comes to milestones.”Zsolt Darvas, of the Bruegel think-tank in Brussels, says Spain will only receive disbursements of EU money if it meets the milestones for labour, pensions and other reforms which have been set in conjunction with the commission.“What will be really crucial will be to look into the details of reforms and investments to see whether they are doing what they are really supposed to do or whether they are just meeting the milestones,” Darvas says. “How transformative it is going to be is more difficult to assess than whether they meet the milestones.”Spain could face the risk of higher borrowing costs next year if investors perceive that the government has made little progress with reforms and is struggling to reduce its public deficit just at the moment when the ECB begins to pare back its purchases of eurozone government debt. Such a punishing scenario is his “worst nightmare”, one senior Spanish figure tells the FT.“This is the big risk the country faces,” the person says. “And if things go badly, the risk not just to Spain but to the European project could be considerable.” One big challenge has already been deferred to next year. With government debt that jumped from 95 to 120 per cent of GDP during the crisis, Spain will only take measures to put public finances on a more sustainable footing after a group of experts has prepared a report on the issue which is not due until February.But the commission has demanded progress on the two other showpiece reforms — pensions and labour rules — by the end of this year, while noting that changes the government has committed to so far, such as indexing pensions, “would increase pension expenditure in the medium to long term unless their impact is sufficiently offset”.“The government is giving out sweeties before serving up the spinach; they have got the order of the reforms wrong,” says Toni Roldán, a former centrist MP now at the Esade business school.The leftwing coalition responds that it is seeking agreement with business, unions and other political parties on increasing the effective retirement age through incentives, as well as alterations to how final pensions are calculated.“Pensions were a lifesaver for many families during the pandemic,” says Montero. “Any change has to be the result of a broad consensus; we cannot have a policy on pensions that changes with the political cycle, it has to last one or two decades to be credible.”Still more difficult is the biggest structural flaw of Spain’s economy: its dysfunctional labour market, which is plagued by sky-high unemployment, particularly among the young, and a two-tier system in which more than a fifth of the workforce ekes out a precarious existence on temporary contracts.The government is committed to rolling back 2012 reforms by the previous conservative administration, which watered down some protections for people on permanent contracts. But critics who argue that the 2012 reforms helped Spain recover from the financial crisis by keeping down wage costs say such a move will make the country’s labour markets more, not less, inflexible.The issue is causing a deepening rift within the government: Sánchez’s coalition partners in the radical left Podemos grouping are stepping up calls for the wholesale repeal of the 2012 legislation — pitting them against the prime minister’s Socialists, who favour more modest changes.“We should achieve a balanced reform that encourages job creation but also improves the quality of those jobs,” says Calviño. “We need to Europeanise the Spanish labour market, to provide flexibility but also end abuses and precariousness of contracts, which have increased inequality in Spain since the financial crisis.” She, like other ministers, emphasises the potential for change in other aspects of the recovery plan, such as training the 43 per cent of the population that lack basic digital skills, spending €4.5bn on renewable energy and, perhaps most important of all, revamping education and training regimes that have underperformed for decades.“The educational system is for us one of the big questions we have to push for the future, and so is everything connected to training,” says Montero.The scope of the plan’s ambitions is momentous, even though the timetable for both the spending and reforms have been contracted into a few short years. The coming months will do much to decide whether it will really transform Spain, and bolster Europe, or instead go down as a wasted opportunity.“The funds are going to be very significant,” Pablo Hernández de Cos, Spain’s central bank governor, has said. “But the big challenge is for the programme to change the country.”
98  The writer, Morgan Stanley Investment Management’s chief global strategist, is author of ‘The Ten Rules of Successful Nations’From the start of the pandemic, many emerging nations watched the US and other large developed countries “go big” on economic stimulus, and wished they could afford to follow. It turns out they were lucky if they couldn’t and wise if they chose not to. Emerging markets that stimulated most aggressively got no pay-off in a faster recovery, owing in part to the downsides of overindulging. The big spenders tended to suffer higher inflation, higher interest rates and currency depreciation, at least partly cancelling out the sugar high of stimulus. Scanning data on the top emerging and developed markets for a statistical link between the scale of their 2020 stimulus programmes and the strength of the ensuing recovery, I found none. Even after correcting for the deeper downturns, which often produce a higher bounceback in growth, aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus added nothing discernible to the recovery. This disconnect was sharpest in emerging markets, from China to Chile. Dividing the top emerging markets into the most and least aggressive spenders, the heavy spenders typically suffered weaker recoveries. Throughout the second quarter this year, the median recovery in the big spenders amounted to 12 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with 19 per cent in the light spenders. Among the heaviest spending emerging markets were Hungary under Viktor Orban, Brazil under Jair Bolsonaro and the Philippines under Rodrigo Duterte — all populist governments. Each of these nations spent at least 16 per cent of GDP on stimulus, including both new government spending and asset purchases by the central bank. At the top of the big spender list by far is Greece, which was demoted in 2013 from the developed to the emerging markets amid a run of financial mismanagement. It spent the equivalent of 67 per cent of GDP, apparently for naught. Like Hungary, Brazil and the Philippines, Greece got an unexceptional recovery, close to the emerging market average of about 16 per cent of GDP. Why is stimulus showing unclear benefits, and even backfiring in emerging markets? The impact of stimulus in any one emerging country may now be overwhelmed by factors unique to the pandemic, including the global impact of huge stimulus in the US and other developed countries, and the continued fight against the virus. Research by Goldman Sachs found a tight link between growth and both lockdowns and vaccines: the stricter the lockdown and the slower the vaccine rollout, the bigger the hit to growth. Moreover, overspending often backfires, particularly in developing nations. They lack the financial resources and the institutional credibility to ramp up spending without unbalancing the economy, and end up getting punished by global markets. Over the past year, in the heavy spending emerging markets, inflation has run above 5 per cent, nearly a point faster than in light spenders; bond yields are up more than 142 basis points, versus 43 points in light spenders. Currency values have drifted down, while holding steady in light spenders. Based on IMF forecasts, the government deficit at the end of 2021 will also be slightly higher in heavy spenders, at nearly 7 per cent of GDP, versus 6 per cent in light spenders. Comparing emerging markets on an index of these factors — inflation, currency, interest rates and deficit — highlights where the backfire effects are most pronounced. The heavy spenders that scored worst include Hungary, Brazil and the Philippines. Light spenders that scored best include Taiwan, South Korea and Mexico. The logic of stimulus campaigns may have more to do with politics than economic conditions. In keeping with their government traditions, East Asian nations tended to be light spenders, Latin American nations tended to be heavy spenders. Emerging or developed nations that suffered the sharpest downturns did not necessarily roll out the biggest stimulus packages. The developing world has faced these choices before. Many emerging markets went into the crises of the late 1990s in weak financial condition, were forced to reform rather than spend their way out of trouble, and reining in deficits and debt set them up for a boom in the next decade. By 2008 they were flush, and many responded to the crisis that year by spending and borrowing heavily, which contributed to one of the worst decades on record for emerging economies. Nations that spend in haste are often forced to repent at leisure. Those that attempted to “go big” during the pandemic probably got less added growth than they imagined and considerably more trouble, in the form of higher deficits and debt, which will leave them with less ammunition to fight the next battle.
99  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
100  Many British businesses that export to Europe are failing to comply with a key element of the EU-UK trade deal and could face a flood of disruptive enforcement actions by the bloc’s customs authorities next year, industry insiders and commerce experts have warned.Under the terms of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement that took effect in January, British exporters can send goods to the EU tariff-free, but only if they can prove their products are sufficiently “made in the UK” to qualify for preferential access to the bloc’s single market.These certification requirements on local content also apply to EU exporters wanting to send goods to the UK without incurring tariffs.The certification process, known as the “rules of origin”, is so complex that exporters on both sides were given a one-year grace period that reduced the required documentation, but this will expire in January 2022, leaving many companies facing a major new paperwork challenge.EU importers found to have brought in goods tariff-free that are later found not to have complied with the rules of origin must pay full duties, and vice versa.British trade groups have expressed fears UK companies will become less attractive as suppliers to EU businesses if they repeatedly fall foul of investigations by the bloc’s customs authorities, making it more reliable for European groups to source goods from inside the single market.Industry insiders said concerns about the issue were raised with UK ministers on a Brexit business task force conference call hosted by the cabinet office last week.During the one-year grace period, British and EU companies have been allowed to certify their goods did qualify for zero-tariff access under the rules of origin, even if they were unable to immediately obtain the supporting evidence from their suppliers.The precise rules of origin and the way “originating content” is calculated vary from one product to another, but typically an item must be about 50 per cent British or EU made in order to qualify for zero-tariff access under the trade deal.Customs and trade experts said many UK companies were still failing to understand the extent of their legal obligations.Anna Jerzewska, a trade consultant who advises companies on EU-UK trade, said many British businesses were simply attaching declarations stating they met the rules of origin automatically to their invoices.“It’s a known fact that many companies are providing ‘statements of origin’ when they have no idea if the product is originating or not,” she added.Another trade consultant who asked to remain anonymous said they had come across some UK companies that believed they were complying with the rules of origin simply by placing a union jack on products that were entirely manufactured and packaged in China.The Federation of Small Businesses said small companies were simply not ready to deal with the additional paperwork from January. It added that a fifth of its members that export had already temporarily or permanently halted sales to the EU since Brexit.Mike Cherry, chair of the FSB, urged the government to provide advice and cash to help companies.Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, a trade group, said rules of origin were “a particular area of concern” for the industry and urged authorities on both sides to show “flexibility” in January.“Companies have been working tirelessly to better understand their origin footprint, but with thousands of components and complex and far-reaching supply structures the situation is challenging,” he added.Trade experts said the extent of disruption from January would depend on how strictly EU customs authorities carry out rules of origin checks, but inspections are expected to increase.The Netherlands, which has recruited more than 900 new customs officers since 2016, said it would be enforcing the rules strictly and carrying out random checks.Sam Lowe, trade expert at the Centre for European Reform, a think-tank, said a further deterioration in EU-UK political relations following strains over Northern Ireland could trigger some governments in the bloc to take a tougher approach.“In practical terms, if the EU steps up enforcement, it becomes a way of imposing tariffs on UK exports,” he added.HM Customs and Revenue declined to comment, but officials said Whitehall departments were working to increase awareness of the issue among businesses.
101  Poland’s prime minister has accused the EU of making demands of Warsaw with a “gun to our head”, urging Brussels to withdraw threats of legal and financial sanctions if it wanted to resolve the country’s rule of law crisis.In a move to ease tensions in the long-running dispute, which has raised fears of a Polish exit from the EU, Mateusz Morawiecki promised to dismantle by the end of the year a disciplinary chamber for judges that the European Court of Justice found to be illegal.But he warned that if the European Commission “starts the third world war” by withholding promised cash to Warsaw, he would “defend our rights with any weapons which are at our disposal”.The commission has threatened Poland with sanctions after the country’s top court this month ruled that key elements of EU law were incompatible with its constitution.The ruling marked a major escalation of a legal battle over changes to Poland’s court system that Morawiecki’s ruling Law and Justice party says are necessary to increase efficiency. Brussels says they threaten judicial independence and the fundamental legal bonds that hold the EU together.The stand-off has already delayed approval of Poland’s €36bn Covid-19 economic recovery package from Brussels. Some member states and parts of the commission have also called for a new conditionality mechanism that could threaten tens of billions of euros in annual EU funds paid to Warsaw.Morawiecki said any move to reduce “cohesion funds” would be met with strong retaliation. He was speaking to the Financial Times after a week in which he held multiple meetings with commission president Ursula von der Leyen and participated in a two-day summit with his fellow EU leaders that included a debate on the Polish crisis.“What is going to happen if the European Commission will start the third world war? If they start the third world war, we are going to defend our rights with any weapons which are at our disposal,” he said when asked if Poland could veto critical decisions on legislation such as the EU’s landmark climate package.“[But] if someone will attack us in a completely unfair way, we will defend ourselves in any possible manner,” he added. “We feel that this is an already discriminatory and a diktat type of approach [from Brussels]. But if this is going to be even worse, we will have to think through our strategy.”Morawiecki said that talks with EU leaders including Germany’s Angela Merkel, France’s Emmanuel Macron and von der Leyen, in which he laid out Warsaw’s central argument that the EU was overstepping its legal competences, were “very satisfying”.But he said that if the commission wanted to find a compromise, it must reverse its September decision to seek daily fines against Warsaw until it implements a number of ECJ rulings related to its judicial reform.“Fortunately this is a political process. And political processes can be stopped by politicians,” Morawiecki said. “This would be the wisest thing they can do. Because then we are not talking to each other with a gun to our head. This very situation creates a relative lack of our appetite for any further actions.”However, Morawiecki said that legislation to dissolve the controversial disciplinary chamber was nearing completion.“We are now in the process of finalising the details of this legislation, and gathering a majority for this,” he added. “The legislation is being cooked, and over the next weeks, I believe until the end of the year at the latest, we will present this legislation and go forward with the procedure.”Morawiecki also said that the commission was in breach of EU law by not approving or rejecting the country’s Covid-19 recovery package, and said Warsaw was prepared to wait for its disbursement.“We will get this money sooner or later,” he said. “The later we get it, the stronger the proof that there is this discrimination treatment and diktat type of approach from the European Commission.”Some member states have demanded that the commission delay the approval of the recovery package, which Poland submitted at the beginning of May, because of the rule of law stand-off. The commission is meant to perform its evaluation within two months of its submission.“This money should have already been paid. This is a breach of procedure by the commission,” Morawiecki said. “They are in breach of rule of law.“We are not going to surrender, we are not going to relinquish our sovereignty because of this pressure,” he said, adding that Poland was already borrowing from private markets to fund its post-pandemic investment plans. “We will survive until the moment when we get the [EU] money.”The commission declined to comment.A number of MPs and ministers from Poland’s ruling coalition have suggested that the country could consider an exit from the EU if it sees no benefit from membership.But Morawiecki dismissed fears that the stand-off could provoke a public campaign that would see Poland — once the EU’s poster child for eastern expansion — leave the bloc.“Eighty-eight per cent of Poles want to stay in the EU, half of them are our [party’s] voters,” he said. “We are absolutely convinced that Poland has to stay . . . There are no risks of Polexit. We will fiercely defend Poland as part of the European Union.”
102  Tensions within the EU over Poland’s flouting of the rule of law are reaching new heights. Poland’s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki was hauled over the coals in the European Parliament in Strasbourg last week following a ruling by the Polish constitutional tribunal that parts of the EU treaties were incompatible with the country’s constitution. The ruling — issued at Morawiecki’s behest — strikes at the heart of the EU’s legal order. It has infuriated other member states, who raised their concerns at an EU summit last week, along with MEPs, who are piling pressure on the European Commission to punish Warsaw. In Strasbourg, commission president Ursula von der Leyen all but vowed retaliation, including financial, but refrained from immediate action.Rather than take that as an opening for conciliation, Morawiecki has chosen defiance and empty threats. In an interview with the Financial Times, he uses extraordinary bellicose rhetoric about the stand-off, warning Brussels against starting “a third world war”. He also demands the commission drop fines issued against Warsaw for failing to comply with previous rulings by the European Court of Justice.Morawiecki’s belligerence shows the commission should stand firm on infringement proceedings since they clearly matter to Poland. Brussels should also make Warsaw bear the cost of its transgressions. If nothing changes, Brussels must reject its plans for spending EU recovery funds and launch the new rule of law “conditionality” procedure that could result in the suspension of regular EU transfers as well.It is saddening that such financial measures should be necessary. But at least they may work. Recently, some Polish regions quickly withdrew anti-LGBT resolutions when Brussels warned it would cut off funding.Morawiecki has accused critics of double standards. Other countries’ constitutional courts have also asserted their ultimate right to assess how EU law is applied, he argued in Strasbourg. To this there are two things to say.The first is that while other national courts have also claimed a role in assessing the reach of EU law, none has ruled their constitution in conflict with the treaties. (Attempts such as the German constitutional court’s to second-guess the ECJ clearly encouraged Poland to go further, however — proving that critics of Karlsruhe were right to accuse it of paving the road to a constitutional crisis.)The second is that to the extent that some around the EU legitimately worry about the balance between the ECJ and national sovereignty, their cause is undermined when made in such bad faith. Poland’s government — which itself sought the incompatibility ruling — is not trying to work out a well-defined legal order. It is transparently trying to escape any limits the law places on what it can do, whether through national or European judges.If a national constitution really were incompatible with the EU treaties, then the burden would squarely be on the country in question to make it compatible — or give up EU membership. Ideally, the prospect of substantial financial losses will prompt Warsaw to undo the damage it has done. But deft diplomacy will need to complement overdue tough action on the EU side.Some member states are worried a conflict between Warsaw and Brussels could go too far and push Poland on to a slippery slope towards EU exit. Taking Morawiecki at face value and opening a discussion on the balance between treaty law, national sovereignty and the ECJ’s role might offer a face-saving compromise. Poland’s own actions and rhetoric have, however, made such a route harder.
103  Talks on resolving the EU-UK stand-off over post-Brexit trade rules for Northern Ireland resume in London on Tuesday, with the focus shifting to a row over the role of the European Court of Justice.Language used by allies of UK Brexit minister Lord David Frost suggested there could be room for a compromise on the issue, although British officials said he stuck by his position of seeking the removal of the ECJ’s oversight role in the trade rules.There has been media speculation that Frost could support a “Swiss-style” governance arrangement for the Northern Ireland protocol, the part of the UK’s withdrawal agreement that sets out the region’s trade rules and aims to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.Under such an arrangement, an arbitration panel would be set up to deal with disagreements about the protocol, with the ECJ retaining a role to interpret questions of EU law.UK officials said Frost’s formal position had not changed. “The role of the European Court of Justice in resolving disputes between the UK and EU must end,” added one.But that language left open the possibility of disputes being settled in the first instance by an arbitration panel.British officials noted it would still put the ECJ at the apex of the system, giving it a key role in ruling on disputes.The European Commission argues the ECJ must continue to play its role as the ultimate court for the EU single market. Under the Northern Ireland protocol, the region remains part of the single market for goods.The question is whether an arbitration system can be devised that leaves the ECJ’s role sufficiently arm’s length to allow Frost to claim victory, but satisfies Brussels that its fundamental legal order has not been breached.Without a compromise, Frost has threatened to activate Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol, which allows either side to suspend part of the trade rules in the event of severe disruption.He insists he does not want to do this, although EU capitals are urging the European Commission to prepare a range of retaliatory measures if Johnson acts unilaterally to suspend the protocol.The protocol mandates customs and regulatory checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, and business has complained of overly bureaucratic arrangements that have resulted in gaps on supermarket shelves.The creation of a trade border in the Irish Sea is also one of the factors that was blamed for violence in Belfast in April.British officials said the first round of technical discussions between the two sides last week on a possible compromise about the protocol were “constructive”, but the exact role of the ECJ remains the biggest obstacle.A negotiating team from the European Commission will travel to London on Tuesday for several days of talks on issues including customs checks and border rules for animal and plant products.“The talks this week were constructive and we’ve heard some things from the EU that we can work with, but the reality is that we are still far apart on the big issues, especially governance,” said a British official.Frost and European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic are due to meet in person at Westminster at the end of the week to take stock of progress in the talks so far.The talks are expected to run into November, although Frost’s team has warned that “solutions must be found rapidly” because trade disruption in Northern Ireland remains and “cannot be endured for much longer”.Frost’s team claimed the Northern Ireland protocol was now stopping Christmas crackers from reaching the region from Great Britain.
104  It’s not quite white smoke yet. But the written conclusions to preliminary coalition talks between Germany’s Social Democrats, liberals and Greens make it seem all but certain that the three will soon form a “traffic light coalition”. That makes the document compulsory reading for those wanting to understand how the end of the dominance of Angela Merkel and her CDU party at home will affect Europe’s economy.On the surface, it is easy for a European observer to feel disappointed. A commitment to work “within the framework of the constitutional debt brake” sounds like unwillingness to take off Germany’s self-imposed straitjacket on spending. Over the past 20 years, German restraint has produced destabilising capital exports, delayed Europe’s post-2009 recovery and led to under-investment at home and unprofitable investments abroad.This apparent continuity is echoed in the approach to European policy. The report adopts SPD leader Olaf Scholz’s “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” stance on the EU’s fiscal rules. It is an awfully hidebound signal to send just as Brussels reopens the debate on fiscal reform.Other important areas for the European economy are entirely neglected. Neither the EU banking union (to encourage cross-border banking) nor the capital markets union (to make corporates use bond and equity financing) receive a mention. Progress on both projects is largely stalled for lack of EU political agreement.Such paralysis is bad for Europe, but also for Germany. At both domestic and European levels, the status quo presents obstacles to the big ambitions the putative coalition has agreed on. Their document states: “We want to make the 2020s a decade of investments for the future. We therefore aim for a policy that markedly raises both private and public investments.” That is the right goal, especially as the investment boom is intended for badly needed decarbonisation and digitisation.But success in investing in a greener, more digital Germany will depend on other EU countries feeling able to do the same. One, let alone two, structural revolutions are much harder to pull off for any economy deeply integrated with others if they do not move in the same direction at a similar speed.Both banking union and capital markets union are essential to lift the quality of private capital investment across Europe, the need for which has rarely been greater. For a new German government to ignore this would be a wasted opportunity amounting to self-harm.Above all, the coalition ambitions will require more investment-friendly fiscal governance at home and in the EU. The partners promise no big tax rises. Given Germany’s “debt brake” constraint on borrowing it is not clear how they will finance “markedly” greater public investment, or incentives for private investment — for which their document contains many excellent ideas. The promise to free up funds by cutting “superfluous” and “climate-unfriendly” subsidies and spending is unconvincing, given the gap between recent investment rates and what is required. The vow to reduce planning bureaucracy is welcome, but it would be naive to think it relieves the need for additional funds.The dilemma — how to mobilise ambitious investments within rules that discourage it — is the same nationally and in the EU. If the incoming government does not want to be stymied from the start, it should seek similar solutions at both levels. Keeping the debt brake entails finding ingenuous ways to finance investment off the main public balance sheet, through specially designed institutions. It could also involve reinterpreting its technical workings: a strong case can be made that current methods take an overly austere view of Germany’s productive capacity.If the new government, and the liberals in particular, cannot accept such moves as being “within the framework” of the brake, their government will never succeed. But if they can, they should be able to show the same imagination for EU rules. After all, Scholz’s view seems perfectly compatible with reinterpreting those in a much more investment-friendly way, as Brussels may yet choose to do.It is too soon to despair that a change in Berlin means little change in Brussels. It will surely help the banking and capital markets union to have a German chancellor who worked on both as finance minister. It will smooth the way for reinterpreting EU fiscal rules if a German government has already done the same at home. But for that to happen, all coalition partners have to take their opportunity to support drastic improvements in EU economic policy — for Germany’s own benefit.martin.sandbu@ft.com
105  The EU is intending to reopen its diplomatic representation in Afghanistan within a month as the bloc seeks to deepen its limited engagement with the Taliban regime.The move means that EU diplomats will return to Kabul about 12 weeks after they fled the city, as Brussels seeks to co-ordinate aid efforts and the continued evacuation of Afghan citizens.The planned return comes as global powers attempt to work out how to deal with the country’s new leaders. Brussels has said it seeks a “calibrated approach” to the militants, pursuing engagement with the administration but stopping short of recognition.The bloc believes it needs a role in a Taliban-led Afghanistan in order to lobby for the protection of human rights, to hold the militants to their pledge to stop the country again becoming an exporter of terrorism, and to help prevent a humanitarian crisis.It is also responding to efforts by China, Russia and Turkey, which did not close their embassies when Afghanistan’s former government was overthrown, to build close ties with the new regime.The European External Action Service, the EU’s diplomatic and security arm, plans to reopen a representative office in Kabul that would house its officials and could be used by diplomats from member states, people briefed on the plans told the Financial Times, pending a final resolution to security concerns.“There is only so much you can do from Doha,” said one of the people, referring to the role the Qatari capital has played as a go-between for western states and Taliban militants.Brussels sent an exploratory mission to Afghanistan last month to assess the feasibility of sending diplomats back to Kabul, aware that without a presence on the ground, it lacked the access required to effectively implement a pledged regional aid package worth about €1bn.Over the past month Brussels has sought to strike an agreement with Kabul that would allow private security personnel or member state guards to protect the building. But it has reluctantly accepted that there is no alternative to abiding by rules that mean foreign diplomatic representations must be guarded only by Taliban security forces, one of the people said.EU spokesperson Nabila Massrali said that “a final decision has not been taken yet” on the security provision.“We can confirm that we are working on establishing a minimal presence on the ground. For security reasons, we cannot enter into the details,” she said in a statement to the FT.“At this stage, this would only be for the EU. Member states may decide to join, but this is at their discretion. As to whom will guarantee the security of our staff, available options are being explored.“As we have repeatedly said, this is not a sign of recognition. We want to be able to better assist the Afghan people who need our help by being closer and, inevitably, we need to engage with the Taliban,” she added.
106  The EU has been warned not to delay the next phase of global banking rules, as draft plans show that Brussels is suggesting giving European banks a two-year extension to an internationally agreed deadline.Carolyn Rogers, secretary-general of the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision, said the new rules were “a really important final chapter” in the overhaul of capital regulations known as Basel III. They had to be implemented “consistently and as soon as possible”, she told the Financial Times.The European Commission is set to reveal its plan to implement the final part of the Basel reform package on Wednesday. The reforms are due to come into force by 2023 under a global accord, but the commission is proposing a delay until 2025, according to a draft of the plans seen by the FT.Brussels’ proposal also includes phasing in some measures, such as for lower risk mortgages, so that they will not be fully in force until 2032.The measures to be implemented will set new standards for how international banks should measure their capital, to create consistency across national borders. They are the final part of a package of measures to try to make banks more resilient following the 2008 global financial crisis.A delay would be welcomed by banks in countries such as France, which would have been hit hardest by having to hold more capital to comply with the latest rules, but will risk a clash with global regulators.Rogers, whose organisation sets global banking standards, warned that a delay by the EU could prompt other jurisdictions to hold back on implementation so as not to put their banks at a disadvantage.The globally-agreed timeline, which was already extended by a year to deal with the fallout from the pandemic, “absolutely matters”, she said.“This is always the challenge, when jurisdictions want to deviate from a global standard,” said Rogers, who will join the Bank of Canada as a senior deputy governor in December. “When you know that [the standards] are there to create a level playing field, a single deviation is hard to keep as a single deviation.”An EU delay is also likely to frustrate European regulators. “We consider it of paramount importance that the outstanding Basel III standards are implemented in full, and in a timely and faithful manner,” Andrea Enria, chair of supervision at the European Central Bank, told members of the European parliament this month.The plans would still need to be agreed by the parliament and EU ministers before coming into force.According to the draft commission proposals, the European Banking Authority, which creates the EU’s banking rules, has estimated that ten large banks would have to raise their capital by less than €27bn to meet the new requirements under its preferred option.The other 89 banks in the EBA’s sample had no shortfall. The 99 banks have €1.44tn of regulatory capital.Enria told MEPs that ECB analysis had shown that “the short-term transitory costs pale in comparison with the long-term benefits of strengthening the resilience of the financial system”.Regulators in Basel are watching the European package to see whether it sticks to an agreement to establish a “floor” for the capital that banks need to set aside against certain types of assets. This would restrict banks’ ability to use their own internal models to arrive at lower capital requirements.The commission did not comment directly on the timetable for implementation. However it said the bloc’s proposals “will meet our international commitments to implement the Basel III standards, but adjustments to those will be made to reflect the specificities of the EU economy and banking sector.”The draft proposal also tightens regulations for branches of non-EU banks doing business in the region, including mandating reviews of networks of branches with more than €30bn in assets to see if those businesses should have to operate as subsidiaries — a measure that would force them to hold more capital and liquidity.
107  President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has ordered ten western ambassadors to be declared persona non grata, risking a new low in Turkey’s already deeply strained relations with Europe and the US.The Turkish leader has appeared to double down on a previous threat to expel the envoys, including the US and German ambassadors. The decision could torpedo Ankara’s recent efforts to repair ties with Washington and the EU and inflict more pain on the lira, which has fallen sharply in recent weeks amid worries about the economy.Erdogan signalled that the diplomats would be forced to leave the country after signing a joint declaration, published last Monday, that called for the release of the jailed businessman and philanthropist Osman Kavala.“I gave the order to our foreign minister and said what must be done: these 10 ambassadors must be declared persona non grata at once. You will sort it out immediately,” he said in speech in the north-western city of Eskisehir.“They must know and understand Turkey,” he added. “The day they do not know and understand Turkey, they will leave.”The joint statement by the ten ambassadors — from Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and the US — called for a swift and fair resolution to the case of Kavala, who has been behind bars for the past four years on charges of seeking to overthrow the government.Human rights groups, opposition parties and even members of Erdogan’s own ruling party have described the charges as flimsy and politically motivated. In 2019, the European Court of Human Rights ordered his release.But Kavala has remained trapped in a Kafkaesque series of trials. Last year he was acquitted of charges that he orchestrated the 2013 Gezi Park protests only to be rearrested hours later.Kavala, 64, has become a symbol of the sweeping crackdown overseen by Erdogan in the wake of a 2016 coup attempt.But Erdogan has maintained that he is a “terrorist”. Speaking on Thursday in response to the statement by the ambassadors, he said that they would not release “bandits, murderers and terrorists” in their own countries.The president’s decision risks inflicting further damage on the already ailing Turkish lira, which has set a series of record lows in recent weeks amid investor concern about Erdogan’s interference in monetary policy and his broader management of the $765bn economy.On Friday, the lira reached a new nadir of 9.66 against the dollar after the central bank on Thursday stunned markets by slashing its main interest rate at a time of rising inflation and growing financial instability.Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the country’s main opposition leader, accused the Turkish president of acting not in the national interest but rather of “manufacturing fake justifications” for the state of the economy following Erdogan’s remarks.Soner Cagaptay, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute, a think-tank, described the decision as “insane, even by Turkish standards”.He added: “I think [Erdogan] has digested the fact that the Turkish economy has gone bad beyond repair. Instead of trying to make things better, he is trying to blame the west.”The US state department said it was aware of reports of Erdogan’s comments and was “seeking clarity” from the Turkey’s foreign ministry.The Netherlands, Sweden, Norway and Denmark said they had not yet received any notification from the Turkish authorities.Several other affected countries said they had yet to receive any official notification from the Turkish authorities.Additional reporting by Stefania Palma in Washington and Richard Milne in Oslo
108  The Italian government and UniCredit are expected to call off negotiations for the acquisition of troubled lender Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), after attempts to reach a deal over a costly recapitalisation fell through.People involved in the negotiations on both sides said the Italian minister of finance and UniCredit failed to reach a deal over the acquisition of the Tuscan lender. The decision is expected to be announced officially over the next few days.One of the major stumbling blocks during the last round of negotiations was over how much capital the government would be required to inject into MPS, according to people involved in the talks.“The operation was seen as too costly by the Italian government. The capital injection required by UniCredit would have been too much of a stretch” said an Italian official.The Italian Treasury, which bailed out MPS in 2017, is required to sell off its stake in the world’s oldest bank by December 31 under conditions set by the European Commission.“It’s evident that the chances of a deal are now close to zero,” said another person involved in the negotiations.The fate of MPS has sparked infighting in the coalition government led by former European Central Bank president Mario Draghi.Earlier this week, the Treasury indicated it was unwilling to provide much more capital than its initial projection of €2bn to €2.5bn, which would be raised.First reported by Reuters and confirmed by people involved in the negotiations, Milan-based UniCredit would require up to €7bn, an unfeasible option for the Italian government.One negotiator said “at this point there is nothing left to do but walk way from the table for both parties. There no room for dialogue any more.”UniCredit plans to present a new business strategy in the fourth quarter of the year and told the Treasury that any deal over MPS will need to be agreed by the end of October as the protracted negotiations have held up its investor day.Earlier this week, the FT reported that the Italian government was attempting to push back pressing deadlines over its sale of Monte dei Paschi di Siena as negotiations with would-be acquirer UniCredit hit the major stumbling block of the capital injection.UniCredit declined to comment and Treasury did not immediately respond
109  When journalists at French weekly broadsheet Journal du Dimanche huddled at a newsroom meeting to discuss the sudden ousting of the title’s editor Hervé Gattegno this week, the atmosphere was funereal.Many of those present feared that Vincent Bolloré, the conservative billionaire who controls media group Vivendi, was putting his imprint on the newspaper even before his pending takeover of its parent company Lagardère had been finalised.They had reason to be worried: Bolloré, who made much of his fortune in logistics and transport in Africa and through savvy corporate raids, has a record of overhauling the staff, style and content of his media acquisitions. The tycoon, who comes from a family of traditional Catholics from Brittany, has long believed the French media is too leftwing and has sought to build a counterweight, according to people familiar with his thinking.At Vivendi, he tamed the irreverent satirical shows of pay-TV operator Canal Plus and then fired its CEO. He used a month-long strike at news channel I-Télé to cull one-third of the newsroom, paving the way to rebrand it as CNews, a news and opinion channel inspired by the US champion of rightwing issues Fox News.Changes at Lagardère’s Europe 1 radio station over the summer prompted a strike and mass departure of journalists. As Lagardère’s biggest shareholder, Vivendi parachuted in CNews stars to replace several veteran hosts at the once mainstream outlet. He also ordered that CNews be broadcast directly on the station’s airwaves on weekend mornings.“We share an office building with Europe 1, so we all know what happened there,” said a JDD reporter who spoke under the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. “People are very worried that the editorial line will change, just as it has at other media that have gone under ownership of Bolloré.”Coming as France gears up for next April’s presidential elections, the changes at Lagardère have taken on increased importance.The company’s media outlets — which include society magazine Paris Match as well as JDD and Europe 1 — are closely followed by the business and political elite and are seen as influential in shaping public opinion.Emmanuel Macron appeared on the cover of Paris Match eight times during his long-shot bid for the presidency in 2017, and his ministers frequently grace the cover of JDD on Sundays to make announcements that set the political agenda for the week.“The JDD is one of the strongest tools of political power in France, so it is no accident that these changes are happening just before the elections,” said one former employee.The paper has a circulation of about 150,000 but punches above its weight in terms of its influence, while Paris Match sells about 550,000 copies a week.Bolloré’s growing influence in the media could influence the course of the next election by showcasing cultural and identity issues rather than topics like the economy or environment, analysts say. CNews has already helped launch one of its star presenters, the far-right polemicist Eric Zemmour, into politics.Espousing an anti-immigration agenda and lamenting what he sees as France’s decline, Zemmour has come from nowhere since summer to poll in second place in behind Macron as a potential presidential candidate and pushed established far-right contender Marine Le Pen into third place.Bolloré, who has traditionally supported centre-right causes and is close to former president Nicolas Sarkozy, has not publicly backed Zemmour but is said to appreciate many of his ideas, including on crime, according to people familiar with his thinking.“Bolloré has gone step by step to furnish the radical right a place to express themselves, and they now have access to mainstream media outlets,” said Virginie Martin, a political-science professor at Kedge Business School in Paris. “They never had that before and that kept a glass ceiling over far-right politicians like Jean-Marie Le Pen and Marine Le Pen.”If regulators approve Vivendi’s bid for Lagardère, Bolloré will in effect control France’s biggest pay-TV operator, Canal Plus; its biggest book publisher, Hachette; the widely watched 24-hour news channel CNews; Europe 1 radio; JDD; Paris Match; and a dozen other magazines.Academics and historians have expressed concern about the concentration of media ownership in France, not only in Bolloré’s hands but also those of other wealthy proprietors. The Bouygues family own the biggest private broadcaster TF1 and are seeking approval to buy smaller rival M6. Telecom tycoons Patrick Drahi and Xavier Niel, and LVMH boss Bernard Arnault, also own key outlets.“Bolloré is not the first rich person to invest in the press but he stands apart for how he weighs on the editorial line of his outlets,” said media historian Christian Delporte. “There is a political project behind all this.”Officially the departure this week of Gattegno, who was editor of both JDD and Paris Match, was decided by Lagardère CEO Arnaud Lagardère, and the head of the news, Constance Benqué. But several people inside the group said Bolloré pushed for the change.Vivendi and Lagardère declined to comment.Gattegno was replaced by Patrick Mahé at Paris Match and Jerome Bellay at JDD, both of whom were named as general managers. Two deputies were promoted to editor in chief.People who know Gattegno describe him as a controversial but brilliant editor known for defending Sarkozy in his legal woes and taking a hard line against normalising the far-right in France.No reasons were given publicly for his departure. But some speculated that among the factors were his critique in an editorial of Zemmour as a “prophet of doom” and the decision to put the 63-year-old married father of three on the cover of Paris Match last month embracing his 28-year-old campaign adviser Sarah Knafo.“Bolloré wanted his head,” said one company executive. “And he got it.”Additional reporting by Domitille Alain
110  As ambulances carrying coronavirus patients queue outside Romania’s emergency units, hospitals are running out of beds, morgues are overflowing and doctors are becoming exasperated as well as exhausted. Most of the sick are unvaccinated, medics say. Some die waiting to be seen.“The situation is critical,” Radu Tincu, an intensive care specialist at Floreasca hospital in Bucharest, Romania’s largest emergency facility, told the Financial Times. “We’re frustrated . . . They refuse to be vaccinated,” he said. “[Even after] we tell them of the risk of severe Covid, they still refuse.”Romania is at the heart of a relentless wave of Covid-19 sweeping across eastern Europe and the Balkans that threatens to overwhelm health services. The country’s daily toll of 19 deaths per million as of October 20 is the highest in the world, just ahead of neighbouring Bulgaria and Moldova. Romania’s death rate is higher than at any point during the pandemic.Eastern and central Europe along with Russia account for the world’s 12 highest Covid-19 death rates. The figures contrast starkly with western Europe, where death rates are about a tenth of those in the east and stand at less than one per million in several countries.Infections have also soared to unprecedented levels, particularly in the Baltic states. Latvia’s 115 daily new cases per 100,000 people are 30 times higher than Spain’s, and Lithuania’s rate of 94 is 24 times higher.Health experts say widespread mistrust of government and officials dating back to the Soviet era, and resulting vaccine hesitancy and unwillingness to accept state-mandated coronavirus curbs, lie behind the surge.“People distrust the authorities,” said Octavian Jurma, a Romanian physician and health statistician. “Nobody cares about the rules.”Critics also blame corruption and political instability, notably in Romania and Bulgaria. The latter is heading into its third election of 2021, while Romania’s government is regrouping after a failed no-confidence vote last month.Andrei Baciu, the top official responsible for Romania’s pandemic response, denied turbulent politics was to blame. Curbs introduced on Wednesday should help bring infections under control, he insisted.Maria Ganczak, an epidemiology and infectious diseases specialist at Poland’s Zielona Gora University, cited mistrust in state institutions, lax enforcement of restrictions, inadequate testing and tracking, and low vaccine take-up as driving forces.“It’s obvious we’re accelerating in this wave,” she said. “We’ll put a huge burden on the healthcare system.”Romania has fully vaccinated just under a third of its total population, the second-lowest in the EU, behind Bulgaria at 20 per cent. This rises to half in Latvia and Lithuania but few central and eastern European countries reach the EU average of 64 per cent. Bosnia & Herzegovina, which is not in the EU, has fully vaccinated just 15 per cent of its population.The differences in coverage have a marked effect on the link between virus cases and deaths.In countries such as Bosnia & Herzegovina and Bulgaria, more than 4 per cent of people who test positive die from Covid-19. In Latvia and Lithuania, the case fatality rate drops to just over 1 per cent, and in countries such as the UK, France and Spain, where some 70 per cent have received two doses of a vaccine, the figure is about 0.5 per cent.Low inoculation rates in some member states have triggered alarm in Brussels, with leaders discussing rising infections at the EU summit on Thursday. “In order to further increase vaccination rates . . . efforts to overcome vaccine hesitancy should be stepped up, including by tackling disinformation, notably on social media platforms,” they said in a statement.The crisis has led to restrictions being reintroduced, ranging from mask mandates to full lockdowns, in several countries. Latvia this week became the first EU nation to bring back an almost full lockdown, switching to online education, closing all but essential shops and imposing a month-long curfew. Estonia has said it may impose a lockdown if the situation worsens.Romania also announced new measures including a two-week school shutdown, mandatory mask-wearing in public and restrictions on night-time movement for the vaccinated.Also this week, Adam Niedzielski, Poland’s health minister, warned of potential “drastic action” in the face of rising numbers, while Slovakia has closed restaurants and bars in five counties.Serbia has restricted access to nightclubs and bars to vaccinated people while Bulgaria has made vaccine passports mandatory for restaurants — provoking a protest with several hundred people in Sofia that highlighted continued scepticism about the jabs and other preventive measures in the EU’s least-vaccinated nation.Case and mortality figures will probably rise in Romania before they begin to fall again, health experts warn. Adrian Marinescu, medical director at Bucharest’s Matei Bals hospital, said reported cases were likely to be an underestimate because test rates were low. He estimated the probable level of daily new cases to be about 70,000-80,000 per day, or close to one in every 250 Romanians.Inoculation centres have had increased traffic since Romania’s restrictions were announced. On Thursday first vaccinations reached a daily record of 62,500, the government said. Over the summer the rate was consistently in four figures.At one Bucharest clinic, 47-year-old Camelia, who declined to give her surname, finally came for a first dose.“I’m sorry I didn’t get the vaccine before. I was afraid of side effects,” she said. “But as my daughter and my husband got vaccinated I decided I should do it too. Enough people have died.”Additional reporting by James Shotter in Warsaw, Richard Milne in Oslo and Sam Fleming in Brussels
111  On October 7, from a spartan courtroom in Warsaw, Julia Przylebska read out a verdict that echoed across the whole EU. In a few sentences, the head of Poland’s constitutional court declared that key elements of the union’s law were “not compatible” with her country’s constitution.The verdict brought to a head years of feuding between Warsaw and Brussels over a controversial overhaul of the Polish judiciary, and the backlash was immediate and sustained. Luxembourg’s foreign minister warned Poland it was “playing with fire”. When Poland’s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki joined a fiery debate in the European Parliament this week to defend his government’s actions, MEP after MEP took the floor to lambast him.“This is the first time ever that a court of a member state finds that the EU treaties are incompatible with the national constitution,” Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, told Morawiecki during the debate. “This ruling calls into question the foundations of the European Union. It is a direct challenge to the unity of the European legal order.”For a country once seen as the great success of the EU’s eastern expansion, it is a striking reversal. Poland’s entry into the bloc in 2004 helped drive an economic boom in the central European nation that became one of the longest growth streaks in the world. And it gave a country that had endured 40 years behind the Iron Curtain a chance to integrate itself firmly with its western peers.Yet rather than becoming one of the key cogs of European integration, Poland has in recent years become the EU’s most rebellious member. Since Jaroslaw Kaczynski’s conservative-nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS) came to power in 2015, Warsaw and Brussels have clashed repeatedly and bitterly. One of the first big fights was over migration. More recently they have scrapped over LGBT rights. But the longest, and most fundamental, battle has been over the rule of law. So inflamed has the conflict become that it has sparked questions over whether Poland could do something that was once unthinkable: follow the Brexit playbook and stumble out of the EU.During its six years in power, PiS has embarked on an overhaul that has progressively subjugated the judiciary to the executive. The constitutional court was neutered by 2016 in a series of manoeuvres that it itself deemed unconstitutional. In 2018, PiS attempted to purge the Supreme Court. It also set up a disciplinary regime that allowed judges to be punished for the content of their rulings.PiS insists that its changes are needed to overhaul a system widely seen as inefficient. But Brussels regards them as an attack on judicial independence, and over the past three years it has repeatedly taken Poland to the EU’s top court in a bid to reverse them.The ruling on October 7 was the culmination of that fight. Sebastian Kaleta, Poland’s deputy justice minister, says the case about the relationship between Polish and EU law was necessary because the EU’s top court had exceeded its powers in its rulings against Poland’s judicial reforms, which Warsaw insists are a purely domestic matter. “It stops the EU from unlawfully interfering in the Polish judicial system,” he says.Critics of PiS, however, see both the content and the form of the ruling — delivered by a court filled with government loyalists in response to a case brought by the country’s prime minister — as an unprecedented rebellion against the principles that hold the EU together.“It’s the most fundamental challenge to the EU’s legal order imaginable,” says Daniel Kelemen, a professor of political science and law at Rutgers University. “The issue at stake here is whether the EU can expect and require of its member states that they have independent judiciaries and adhere to fundamental rule of law principles. That is the very backbone of the EU.”As the temperature has risen, PiS’s opponents both at home and abroad have begun to question what the fight means for Poland’s long-term future in the bloc. France’s Europe minister, Clément Beaune, said in the wake of the ruling that it raised the risk of a “de facto exit”. At home, thousands of Poles took to the streets to rally in support of EU membership.Despite the inflamed mood in both Brussels and Warsaw, in the short term, there is little chance of Polexit. There is no way to expel a country from the bloc. More than 85 per cent of Poles support EU membership. And PiS’s leadership has repeatedly insisted that it has no intention of taking Poland out. “Polexit” was “fake news” and a “crude lie”, Morawiecki said last week.But even if there is no immediate risk of Polexit, on the Polish right, where many see the EU’s liberal values as a threat to Poland’s conservative social traditions, the clashes with Brussels have helped plant the seeds of a debate about the country’s position in the bloc. For now, says Pawel Lisicki, editor of the rightwing magazine Do Rzeczy, the debate is “more journalistic than political”. But he says this could change if tensions between Warsaw and Brussels continue.“If the European Commission or the EU really declares that the money from the recovery fund shouldn’t go to Poland . . . then who knows whether the idea of leaving the EU will not become something real, and whether there will not then be politicians . . . who will [support this] clearly,” he says.Some politicians are already making eyes at Eurosceptic voters. Even as PiS has insisted that it has no intention of leaving the bloc, its hawkish junior coalition partner, United Poland, has taken a more ambivalent stance. Earlier this year, the party’s leader Zbigniew Ziobro, said Poland should not stay in the EU “at any price”. And the party’s MPs have openly questioned the financial benefits of EU membership, particularly the costs of the green transition, which will be expensive for Poland’s coal-hungry economy.“Today Poland has to consider the British scenario,” says Janusz Kowalski, one of United Poland’s MPs. “It is not possible to rule out Polexit in this decade, if Poland stops being able to achieve its interests within the EU.”For some observers, the dynamic between PiS and United Poland has parallels with the pre-Brexit constellation in UK politics. “[Brussels] has gone through this all before,” says Radoslaw Sikorski, an MEP from Poland’s biggest opposition grouping, Civic Platform. “It’s Brexit in a nutshell. You have a governing party pushing a country towards an EU exit simply to appease the hardliners on the fringe.”But there are also crucial differences. Unlike the UK when it was a member, Poland is a net recipient of EU funds. Its history and location mean it is much more tied into the fabric of Europe than the UK. And, crucially, the support for EU membership is far higher in Poland than it ever was in the UK.Yet even if those differences mean Poland is unlikely to follow Britain to the exit, both legal and political tensions between Warsaw and the bloc are likely to remain. Several courts in other member states have already questioned whether, given the concerns over the Polish judiciary, they should comply with Polish extradition requests. Observers say that if the stand-off between Warsaw and Brussels continues, such ties could fray further.“If the Polish judiciary does not comply with the minimum standards of independent justice, European arrest warrants will not be executed, and judgments from Poland will not be executed in other countries,” says Kees Sterk, a senior Dutch judge and professor at Maastricht University.“Poland isn’t going to exit the bloc,” says Jakub Jaraczewski, a legal expert at Democracy Reporting International. “But what could happen is that it becomes a second-class citizen by its own decisions.”The politics are likely to be no less fraught. The European Commission has so far declined to approve Poland’s bid for €36bn of post-pandemic funding. But Polish officials make clear that they are prepared to retaliate if they are cut off. Kaleta says that if Poland does not receive its recovery funds, it could opt out of the EU’s flagship green deal. He also raises the prospect that Poland could sue Germany at the EU’s top court, claiming that if Poland’s processes for appointing judges are being scrutinised, Germany’s should be too.“In the EU we are all equal,” he says. “We will be active. We can veto anything until they stop blackmailing us.”This is exactly what European officials fear. “It’s entirely foreseeable that if [the commission] touches the money flow, then Poland will just come to the European Council and say no, no, no to everything,” says one senior EU diplomat. “And that’s obviously not where we want to be.”While such concerns have not deterred some countries, such as the Netherlands, from taking a tough line with Warsaw, others have sought to calm the situation. During a meeting of EU leaders on Thursday evening, Germany’s outgoing chancellor Angela Merkel reiterated pleas to resist aggressive moves that could isolate Poland, and urged her colleagues to find a political resolution to the stand-off.“We must find ways and possibilities to come together again on this,” she said before the summit.Merkel, Europe’s mediator-in-chief for a decade and a half, will not be around to help achieve this. Whether her successors will be able, and indeed willing, to do so is an open question. “There is less and less political space for [a compromise],” says a senior Polish official. “On both sides radicals are happy to make it harder . . . This is why I am pessimistic.”Letter in response to this article:Subjugating the judiciary is familiar in Britain too / From Louise Rowntree, London SW6, UK
112  EU leaders have raised concerns that a shortage of magnesium could force carmakers and other users of aluminium to shut down production within weeks unless China restarts its magnesium smelters.Germany’s outgoing chancellor Angela Merkel warned her fellow leaders of the potential crisis at their summit in Brussels on Thursday, diplomats told the Financial Times.Merkel said the rise in global energy prices was having unexpected knock-on effects, with China’s magnesium shortage hurting car manufacturers in Europe, according to diplomats familiar with the discussion. Her concerns were echoed by Andrej Babis, prime minister of the Czech Republic, another big car-producing country.Magnesium is an essential component for aluminium alloys used in cars, packaging, and other everyday products. Some 87 per cent of global supply, and 95 per cent of European consumption, comes from China, which has cut output drastically to save power as prices rise.Twelve business associations representing makers of cars, metals, packaging and other industries warned on Friday of an “imminent risk of Europe-wide production shutdowns” because they only have enough stocks of magnesium to last until the end of November.The price of scarce magnesium imports has jumped fivefold during the year, the groups said. They called on Brussels and national governments to work with China to “mitigate the short-term, critical shortage issue as well as the longer-term supply effects on European industries,”“Thousands of businesses across Europe, their entire supply chains and the millions of jobs that rely on them” were potentially at risk, said the statement, co-ordinated by European Aluminium, the lobby group. Industry bodies including Acea, the carmakers’ body, and Eurofer, the steel lobby group, also signed.The EU is drawing up a strategy to become less reliant on imports of raw materials, including magnesium, after fears have grown that China could choke off supply.The European Commission said it was aware of the situation. “We are raising this issue with our Chinese counterparts in order to address immediate shortages and are assessing long-term solutions to tackle this strategic dependency,” it said.Additional reporting by Guy Chazan in Berlin
113  Good evening,While not official data, the global nature of IHS Markit’s purchasing managers’ index offers us some useful comparisons on how business is recovering from the pandemic.Today’s “flash” initial readings for October paint a common picture of manufacturing growth being held back by rising input costs, supply chain problems and labour shortages, but balanced by improvements in the services sector.The most startling example of the slowdown in business activity came in the eurozone, where costs for manufacturing and services companies rose at their fastest ever rate, with much of this being passed on to customers. While any reading above 50 indicates growth, the fall in the composite PMI index from 56.2 last month to 54.3 this month shows momentum faltering.Particularly badly hit were carmakers and their suppliers, which are now facing the additional problem of shortages of magnesium, a key component of aluminium. About 95 per cent of European consumption comes from China, which has cut output sharply to save power.The survey results were “a warning signal” for the eurozone, according to Ralph Solveen, an economist at Commerzbank. “An end to the sharp rise in prices caused by supply bottlenecks is not in sight in the short term, and the economy should continue to lose momentum in the fourth quarter,” he said. The jump in selling prices also adds to pressure on the European Central Bank to tackle inflation when it meets next week to discuss monetary policy.More promising was the PMI reading for the UK, which jumped to a three-month high of 56.8, up from 54.9 in September, suggesting the economic recovery could be picking up speed again. It also strengthens the hand of those calling for a rise in interest rates, something hinted at by the new Bank of England chief economist Huw Pill in his first media interview. Pill said November’s interest rate-setting meeting would make a “live” decision, while suggesting inflation could hit 5 per cent early next year.The increase in the composite PMI index was driven by the services sector, which accounts for about 80 per cent of the UK economy, although this growth could yet slow if the recent jump in new coronavirus infections continues.There was progress in the US too, where the composite PMI reading rose to 57.3 from 55.0 last month. The increase was driven by a resurgent services sector, which rose from 54.9 to 58.2 as infections fell.Manufacturing however dipped to a seven-month low of 59.2 from 60.7 last month, as supply bottlenecks and staff shortages hit companies’ ability to meet demand, leading to the steepest rise in prices yet recorded by the survey.For the latest updates, visit our live blogNew developments in the energy crisis include Russian president Vladimir Putin’s declaration that Kremlin monopoly Gazprom could deliver 10 per cent more gas to Europe as soon as Germany approves the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Moldova, a small former Soviet state that is totally dependent on Gazprom, declared a state of emergency as its supplies were cut. And the head of ScottishPower, one of Britain’s biggest utilities, has warned of an “absolute massacre” among UK retail suppliers unless the government reviewed its energy price cap.Although today’s PMI survey for the UK was generally positive, other indicators struck a more gloomy note. UK retail sales fell unexpectedly in September for the fifth month in a row — the longest period of consecutive declines since records began in 1996 — as shoppers tightened their belts amid warnings of a cost of living crisis. The pessimistic outlook was also captured by the GfK consumer confidence index, which hit its lowest level since February, when most of the country was in its third lockdown.The Turkish lira hit a fresh all-time low today after yesterday’s interest rate cut of 2 percentage points to 16 per cent — a far deeper drop than markets had expected. The move follows president Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s firing of three members of the country’s nominally independent central bank.Russia’s central bank has increased interest rates for the sixth time this year by 75 basis points to 7.5 per cent, as it battles to contain surging inflation, which is now forecast to hit up to 7.9 per cent by year-end. Inflation is particularly politically sensitive in Russia, where the government has organised social support payments to mitigate soaring food prices.The resignation of four senior Treasury officials in Brazil has raised concerns among investors that the country is going to bend its fiscal rules to boost welfare payments. President Jair Bolsonaro, who faces elections next year, wants to expand cash transfers for the poorest families in Latin America’s most populous nation. A highly critical probe into his handling of the pandemic has called for Bolsanaro to face criminal charges.Labour shortages continue to bite across richer economies. In the UK, there are signs that businesses may increase wages in response, but in the US the idea that workers are now in a much stronger bargaining position may have been exaggerated, writes Taylor Nicole Rogers.Worries about inflation are driving gold investors towards bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Staffing problems are most acute in post-Brexit UK, where restaurants are no longer able to attract a steady stream of young European workers.Pandemic control: AY.4.2, a subvariant of Delta, has only recently been recognised but already accounts for 10 per cent of UK cases. Although early evidence suggests it may be the most infectious strain of coronavirus since the pandemic began, it is not yet clear whether its prevalence in the UK is a chance demographic event.In contrast with the rest of Europe, infections, hospital admissions and deaths in the UK remain at high levels, with data today showing infections in England at their highest number since January.However, ministers are resisting pressure from doctors and health leaders to activate “Plan B” and reintroduce pandemic restrictions, leaving the NHS facing an “extremely challenging” winter. The government’s scientific advisers have called for preparatory work on anti-Covid measures to begin immediately so that they can “be ready for rapid deployment if required”.India has now administered more than 1bn vaccines, with about 22 per cent of Indians now fully inoculated and 53 per cent having had at least one dose. The landmark was hailed as a major achievement, although independent epidemiologists believe the country’s toll from the pandemic is much higher than the official figures of 34m infections and 450,000 deaths.Jabs and boosters: French biotech Valneva’s vaccine was found to produce a stronger immune response than the directly comparable AstraZeneca jab, one month after the UK government terminated its supply contract with the company. The reasons for the cancellation are not yet clear.Early results from the first randomised, controlled trial on boosters showed BioNTech/Pfizer’s jab to be 95.6 per cent effective. The duration of protection is however not yet known.The US Food and Drug Administration has approved booster shots from Moderna and J&J, following earlier approval for the BioNTech/Pfizer jab. Americans will be allowed to “mix and match” the three shots. BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna will dominate the Covid-19 vaccine market next year, bringing in some $93.2bn in combined sales, according to new forecasts — almost double the amount in 2021.Treatments: The UK said it had secured deals with Merck and Pfizer for Covid-19 antiviral drugs for elderly and vulnerable groups to help ease pressure on the NHS over the winter.American biotech Regeneron said its Covid-19 antibody drugs might have saved ex-US secretary of state Colin Powell, who died this week.

114  German chancellor Angela Merkel has said she is “deeply concerned” about the “ever-widening spiral” of conflict between Warsaw and Brussels over the rule of law.In her last European summit in the role, Merkel gave an unusually gloomy assessment of the state of the EU.“We have a whole series of unresolved problems and a lot of unfinished business for my successor,” she told reporters after a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels. “We have an unbelievable amount to do.”Merkel, who is bowing out as chancellor later this year, was speaking after European leaders warned Poland that the EU was prepared to deploy further legal sanctions against Warsaw over its defiance of the bloc’s laws.Merkel has sought to mediate, holding bilateral talks this week with Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki, as did Emmanuel Macron, the French president. She said that in the discussions the two had expressed “our great concern that we must get out of this ever-widening spiral”.It was the first face-to-face talks between EU heads of government since Poland’s top court ruled that parts of EU law are incompatible with the country’s constitution. The European Commission pledged to hit back against Warsaw, and government leaders meeting in Brussels this week voiced strong support for its stance.“All the states are committed to the rule of law,” Macron said after the summit, who described his discussion with Morawiecki as “frank”. “We are now expecting concrete actions from the Polish government in order to avoid having to resort to all the pressure instruments at our disposal.”The constitutional court ruling is considered a direct challenge to the union’s legal order, and marks the latest escalation in a five-year conflict between Brussels and Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party, or PiS, over judicial independence.But as so often in conflicts between the commission and eastern European states, Merkel sought to strike a conciliatory tone. While acknowledging that the rule of law was a “core pillar” of Europe’s values, she insisted the dispute with Poland was “not just a judicial problem” and urged political talks to defuse the crisis.“You can’t resolve big political differences through court cases,” she said. She also criticised the negative “tone” towards Poland adopted by some in the European Parliament, saying it was “not good”.Merkel is retiring from politics after 16 years as chancellor. In elections last month her centre-right CDU/CSU bloc fell to the worst result in its history and will go into opposition. Merkel looks set to be succeeded by Olaf Scholz, the current finance minister, whose Social Democrats narrowly won the election and are trying to form a coalition with the liberals and Greens.Merkel was unusually downbeat about the state of the EU, identifying disagreements over migration as a problem for the bloc alongside the rule of law crisis. “Migration . . . is something that we’re still very vulnerable to from outside,” she said.She also said she was worried that Europe was falling behind the other big economic powers, particularly China. “The economic pressure, the fight over who is innovative, who is a world leader, has really intensified over the past few years,” she said.Germany’s GDP had been slightly larger than China’s in 2005, the year she became chancellor, and now China’s economy was at least four times larger than Germany’s, she said. Europe was, she said, “no longer the most innovation-friendly continent”.Echoing comments she had made earlier in the week, Merkel sought to deflect criticism from Poland, saying the rule of law conflict went to the heart of a much broader debate within Europe over “what should be in the EU’s competence and what in the competence of nation states”.Asked after the summit if her softly-softly approach to Viktor Orban of Hungary and PiS in Poland had encouraged the authoritarian drift in those countries, she said: “From my perspective I always tried hard to solve problems. If others see that differently, I have to live with that.”Additional reporting by Henry FoyLetter in response to this article:Merkel’s Polish intervention may be the catharsis the EU needs / From Ray Kinsella, Ashford, County Wicklow, Ireland
115  Moldova declared a state of emergency on Friday as the small former Soviet state seeks alternative gas sources after Russia’s state-controlled Gazprom slashed supplies amid a wider global energy crunch.Natalia Gavrilita, Moldova’s prime minister, said pressure levels in the country’s gas pipeline network had fallen to “critical levels” sufficient to damage Moldova’s supply routes. A state of emergency would allow it to buy gas from other sources, she said.The country of 2.6m people, wedged between Romania and Ukraine, is seeking emergency support from the EU after Gazprom cut supplies by a third last month following the expiry of a long-term contract, and demanded Moldova pay more than double the previous price to keep gas flowing.Though Moldova is in negotiations over a new deal with Gazprom, Gavrilita said its local subsidiary Moldovagaz was “not keeping its word” about maintaining pressure levels in the pipeline network.Some analysts have suggested Gazprom, which supplies 100 per cent of Moldova’s gas, is exploiting the energy crisis to put pressure on the country after pro-EU president Maia Sandu and her Action and Solidarity party won landslide victories in the country’s most recent presidential and parliamentary elections.Moldovagaz said Gazprom and Moldova had only agreed to extend the expired contract by a month a few hours before it expired, leaving the monopoly without sufficient time to book the required supply volumes to supply Moldova with gas for October.After Gazprom cut supplies, Moldovagaz said consumption had begun to exceed supply volume, forcing it to cover the deficit with gas from pipeline reserves and leading to the drop in pressure.Following crisis talks over the past two weeks between Brussels and Chisinau, the EU has resolved to do “whatever it takes” to help the country weather the crisis, one official involved in the talks told the Financial Times, including arranging emergency gas supplies via Romania, Slovakia and Ukraine.Under an EU-brokered proposal, Kyiv will supply Moldova from its reserves, which will subsequently be topped up by shipments from Slovakia. A recently commissioned pipeline between Romania and western Moldova will also provide gas.Talks on the initiative were complicated by concerns that EU nations themselves lacked enough gas reserves to make it through a cold winter without extra shipments, officials said.Amid fears over a financial crisis resulting from the surge in gas prices, Moldova on Thursday said it had secured a provisional agreement from the IMF for loans worth $564m over the next 40 months, with the first tranche set to be paid out by the end of the year.The EU is also in talks with Chisinau about a new medium-term macro-financial assistance package and was part of discussions with the IMF about adjusting the country’s financing streams.The EU’s foreign and security head Josep Borrell will chair a meeting of the EU-Moldova council next Thursday, where Gavrilita and European Commission officials will discuss the energy crisis alongside other bilateral issues.
116  The author is chief economist at the Centre for European ReformOn Wednesday, German negotiators received some unexpected news as they began hashing out a coalition government programme: Jens Weidmann tendered his resignation as Bundesbank president, citing personal reasons for ending his eight-year term prematurely. A former economic adviser to Chancellor Angela Merkel, Weidmann represented the more hawkish views in the European Central Bank’s governing council.Unlike some previous German central bankers, he did not resign to make a dramatic statement of dissent. But his departure marks the end of an era in which Germany’s concerns about government debt and inflation dominated its economic policies at home and in Europe. The incoming government’s appointment of the new Bundesbank head should reflect that change, without politicising the process.The simplest explanation for Germany’s changing views is a generational shift. The economists who dominated the debate in Berlin during the euro crisis have made way for a younger cohort grounded in the international mainstream rather than beholden to German economic orthodoxies. Ministry officials, think-tankers and commentators with no memory of the 1970s but plenty of scars from the post-2008 financial crisis are increasingly shaping the country’s policy discussions.Another reason is the effect of the past decade’s economic policies. Fears of ever-mounting debt in Europe, supposedly facilitated by the ECB’s bond-buying policies, have not materialised. European debt levels as a share of GDP stabilised before the pandemic even in Italy, before rising afterwards. Germany’s public debt came down fast until 2019 and is expected to return to its pre-pandemic levels by 2024.The fear of runaway inflation — another popular trope in the commentariat — has turned out to be almost comically wrong. Far from letting prices get out of control, the ECB failed for years to push inflation up to 2 per cent a year. When reality failed to live up to the hawks’ fears, they moved on to warn of financial stability risks, only to be disappointed again. The German public does not study these numbers in detail, of course, let alone the economics behind them. But conservatives have cried wolf a few too many times, and their influence is waning.Crucially, businesses are making their voices heard on fiscal matters. Increasingly alarmed by Germany’s low public investment, they have called on conservative parties to ditch their balanced budget “fetish” — as Merkel’s Christian Democrats put it — and improve Germany’s fraying infrastructure, which hurts businesses. Much of the public, observing the dismal state of Germany’s digitalisation during the pandemic, increasingly shares that view.More public investment is needed, too, in the fight against climate change, the topic at the forefront of Germans’ concerns. Now that Germany’s highest court is enforcing climate targets, there is no place left to hide for fiscal hawks. Either the next government acts by raising carbon prices and strengthening regulation — which is politically difficult, to put it mildly — or it ramps up subsidies for private investment, to help firms and households make the green transition. It is no surprise that conservatives are warming to the idea of more public support for investment.Finally, global tensions have convinced both politicians and a large part of the German public that an economically strong and united Europe is more important than a balanced budget. The populist shocks of Donald Trump’s presidency and Brexit, added to Chinese and Russian assertiveness, require EU countries to emerge from recession strong enough to resist economic blackmail from abroad. Enforcing austerity before economies have fully recovered is now widely seen in Berlin as a mistake. And selling European infrastructure to Chinese companies — like the Greek port of Piraeus — is no longer considered a smart way to raise funds to plug fiscal holes.There is a good chance that the incoming German government will put this new, cautious fiscal consensus into practice without making the issue politically divisive. The three parties likely to share power agree broadly on the need for investment and modernisation over the next four years. On Europe, the draft coalition agreement states that Germany should promote a strong recovery from the pandemic — on the basis of sustainable finances — and ensure climate investment is sufficiently high. Reforming Germany’s constitutional debt brake or Europe’s fiscal treaties has been excluded, but a flexible application of the rules can be expected.The current bout of inflation, temporary though it will be, will be more challenging for the ECB. Conservative commentators will no doubt do victory laps, even though the inflation is a product of the pandemic, not the ECB bond-buying they warned about for years.Germany needs a strong Bundesbank head willing to engage with the public on the new monetary consensus, without risking the bank’s standing as an apolitical, trusted guardian of stability. It would require taking that role out of the horse-trading of the coalition talks and settling on a modern, consensus candidate. Germany is changing in the way Germany always changes: a bit late and too cautiously, but in the right direction. The new Bundesbank president should be part of that change.

117  Another week, another shock to the Turkish lira. The currency plunged to a fresh historical low after Turkey’s central bank slashed its policy interest rate on Thursday by 2 percentage points.In making the cut, the central bank showed it is the world’s only major monetary policymaker that is neither raising rates nor thinking about doing so, but reducing them instead.We have been here multiple times before: faced with a choice between the orthodox and the unorthodox, Turkish authorities double down on the latter. Thursday’s cut was at least twice the size of what was expected on financial markets. But this week was not merely more of the same. Recent events suggest change may be on the way. The question for investors is how long it will take.One sign of movement came in a report from Tusiad, Turkey’s largest and most powerful business association, calling for “central bank independence and cautious monetary and fiscal policy” as the basis of lasting prosperity. It followed a critique days earlier by Omer Koc, chair of one of Turkey’s most prominent business groups, of the country’s “exhausting” inflation.Both can be seen as veiled but pointed attacks on President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his policy beliefs, in which high interest rates cause inflation rather than curing it, and the route to prosperity is through credit-fuelled consumption.Such comments, in fact, are not especially new. Business leaders have made similar remarks in the past without causing a stir. But now, analysts say, the momentum is moving against the government and the opposition is setting the news agenda.“It feels like the opposition are becoming confident they can actually win, and that the [ruling] AKP is increasingly desperate, that they see Erdogan as fallible,” said Timothy Ash of BlueBay Asset Management.One illustration of such opposition agenda-setting came on Thursday. Hours before the rate cut, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the biggest opposition party, the CHP, urged the central bank not to “take orders” on monetary policy — a reference to the widely held assumption that it is Erdogan, not the central bank governor, who sets interest rates.It was the latest such intervention of several. Last Friday, in a rare visit to the central bank, Kilicdaroglu reportedly warned the governor he had a legal duty to maintain the central bank’s independence. He then made a similar, public warning to civil servants that they would be held liable for carrying out “unlawful orders” after a change of government.Such threats are backed up by opinion polls, showing opposition parties moving into a lead over Erdogan’s AKP and its allies. The once hugely popular president, who did so much to energise Turkey’s economy after he took office two decades ago, risks falling victim to the inflation he has drastically failed to cure. Its damage is being keenly felt by voters, analysts say.But investors should not assume Erdogan will leave the scene any time soon. No election is due until 2023. Some analysts argue that the president will use the central bank’s already inadequate foreign exchange reserves to engineer another credit-fuelled bounce to the economy and call for a vote in the first quarter of next year, before things get irredeemably worse.But most expect Erdogan to tough it out, in the hope that Covid-19 will recede and next year’s tourist season will rescue both the economy and his electoral prospects.A little over a month ago, the Financial Times reported that investors were tiptoeing back into Turkey after fleeing instability earlier in the year. That has turned out to be a bad bet. In just a few weeks, global conditions have changed dramatically. The US Federal Reserve, which was previously content to “look through” rising inflation, is preparing to raise interest rates. Global growth is slowing, dragged down by the crisis in China’s property sector. Energy prices have soared — particularly bad news for Turkey, which imports much of its energy.It is a dangerous mix, says Ray Jian, portfolio manager at Amundi, Europe’s largest fund manager. “There’s a high oil price, a dovish central bank when everybody else is quite hawkish, and tightening global financial conditions when Turkey is one of the emerging markets that most relies on external finance.”Those tempted back to Turkey last month were drawn in by a period of relative currency stability and the prospect of high returns on local currency government bonds. But with this week’s plunge in the lira, that equation has turned against them. Any investors thinking of holding on for a change of government and a return to orthodox policymaking will need long horizons and strong nerves.
118  Business activity in the eurozone grew at its slowest pace for six months due to a further worsening of the global supply chain problems that are causing huge order backlogs in factories, growing congestion at ports and widespread shortages.Costs for manufacturing and services companies also rose at their sharpest-ever rate, with groups increasingly passing these costs on to customers, according to IHS Markit’s monthly purchasing managers’ survey. Selling prices advanced at the fastest pace for almost two decades.The composite purchasing managers’ index, an average for eurozone manufacturing and services, fell more than most economists expected to a six-month low of 54.3 in October, down from 56.2 in the previous month.The results indicate that the eurozone economy’s recent rebound after the lifting of coronavirus lockdowns is losing momentum in the final months of this year as supply bottlenecks take a greater toll on business activity and increase inflationary pressures.“A sharp slowdown in October means the eurozone starts the fourth quarter with the weakest growth momentum since April,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. “The ongoing pandemic means supply chain delays remain a major concern, constraining production and driving prices ever higher.”The steep rise in selling prices also adds to pressure on the European Central Bank when its policymakers meet next week to explain why it thinks the recent jump in eurozone inflation to a 13-year-high is “transitory”.“The combination of slowing growth momentum and building inflationary pressure could exacerbate divisions within the ECB’s governing council,” said Hussain Mehdi, macro and investment strategist at HSBC Global Asset Management.While the overall PMI score remained above 50, indicating a majority of businesses were still reporting improvements in activity from the previous month, the slowdown in services was more marked than for manufacturing, according to IHS.Even so, the survey’s measure of manufacturers’ output fell to a 16-month low, which IHS said reflected how “suppliers’ delivery times lengthened to an extent exceeded over more than two decades of survey history only by that seen back in May”. The drop was particularly pronounced among carmakers and their suppliers, causing a “near-stalling” of German factory production, it added.There were also signs that rising input costs caused by supply bottlenecks are spreading from manufacturing to the larger services sector. German services companies reported the fastest increase in overall operating expenses since records began in 1997, IHS said.In contrast, French services companies reported the strongest pick-up in growth for more than three years. IHS said: “Incoming new business rose at a quickened pace amid reports of new client wins, especially from overseas as looser travel restrictions boosted tourism.”French manufacturers, however, reported a hefty fall in orders as “severe delays on input deliveries had caused customers to cancel or postpone orders”.The survey results were “a warning signal” for the eurozone economy, said Ralph Solveen, an economist at Commerzbank. “An end to the sharp rise in prices caused by supply bottlenecks is not in sight in the short term, and the economy should continue to lose momentum in the fourth quarter.”Jacob Nell, head of European economics at Morgan Stanley, said the results “indicate a continued cooling of activity”. He forecast eurozone economic growth would slow to 1.3 per cent “with risks tilted to the downside” in the final quarter, down from 2 per cent in the third quarter — when those figures are published next Friday — and 2.1 per cent in the second quarter.
119  In a city of renters, 30-year-old Martin Rowe, who works for a music software company, considers himself one of the lucky ones. Thanks to a legal loophole known as Nachvertrag — “where you sign your name on an old rental contract from someone you know, which preserves the low rent price without handing the apartment back to the owner,” he explains — Rowe and his partner rent their two-bedroom flat near Treptower Park, “a quiet neighbourhood of families and chilled-out creatives”, for €730 a month, including bills.“My contract is about 15 years old and, in that time, it has been passed forward four times, which is not uncommon here,” says Rowe, who moved from the UK to Berlin as an Erasmus student in 2013.“I know everyone who has lived in this apartment over that time. We sometimes hang out and share stories about the neighbours. This domestic oral history is a unique side effect of the mind-boggling battles between house owners and tenants in Berlin.” For every fortunate renter like Rowe, though, many more are struggling to live in the German capital. According to research by Homeday estate agency, 17 out of 19 neighbourhoods are now unaffordable to the average earner, based on “rental burden” — the amount of someone’s net salary that goes on monthly rent. A rental burden of more than 40 per cent is deemed too high.Earlier this year, when a Berlin-wide rent cap was overturned by the federal courts, many tenants had to refund to their landlords the difference between what they were paying and the market rate in a lump sum. “Friends were suddenly hawking their valuables on Instagram to make up the thousands of euros they had to repay within a month,” says Rowe.About 85 per cent of Berliners rent, and it’s become part of the city’s DNA. Locals talk of how historically affordable rents have helped to cement a strong sense of community — and broaden the city’s appeal.“Berlin has a different mindset to other European capitals, with underlying socialist values and a resentment of outright capitalism,” says Ed Brooks, 28, a marketing manager who moved there from London two years ago. Now, it is lack of affordability that’s keeping communities together, “as finding a place to live is so difficult that it puts most people off moving,” adds Brooks, who pays €1,150 a month for his one-bed, 72 sq m flat in Prenzlauer Berg, previously part of communist East Berlin, “and now one of the most popular neighbourhoods for young families,” he says.Rents have risen by 36 per cent in the past five years, based on median asking prices, according to data by the property portals Immowelt and Immonet. In the most expensive areas, including Mitte, Wilmersdorf and Prenzlauer Berg, the average rent for a 59 sq m apartment is more than €1,200 per month, according to Homeday. In the more affordable areas of Steglitz and Rosenthal, the average is under €900 per month.Mitte — Berlin’s historic core, which includes the landmark Brandenburg Gate and sprawling Tiergarten park — is Germany’s second-most unaffordable neighbourhood, with someone earning the average Berlin salary needing to spend 62 per cent of their net income on rent to live there, according to Homeday. There is also still an east-west divide when it comes to median monthly net salaries: €2,199 in urban areas that used to be in West Germany, compared with €1,854 in those located in former East Germany, according to Homeday.“The situation is most challenging for young people moving to the city, particularly students, single-income households or anyone without ‘old’ rental contracts which command significantly lower rents,” says Meeri Rebane, co-founder and chief executive of INZMO, a Berlin-based insurtech company.“One issue is affordability; another is the availability of rental premises. The shortage is driving up rental prices,” adds Rebane, whose rental deposit guarantee product for tenants, starting from €3 a month, provides an alternative to paying a deposit upfront (typically of three months’ rent).When it comes to addressing the shortage of rental stock and spiralling prices, however, Berliners have spoken. In a referendum last month titled “Expropriate Deutsche Wohnen & Co”, 56 per cent of voters backed a move to place 240,000 corporate-owned apartments — about 15 per cent of Berlin’s total rented stock — back into public ownership and available at affordable rents.Berlin is not alone in proposing drastic measures to combat fast-rising rental prices. As one of Spain’s “tense housing markets”, Barcelona recently extended its rent cap to five years, “which has had many critics”, says Mark Stucklin, founder of Spanish Property Insight, an independent real estate data and analysis website. Data from Idealista, the Madrid-based property portal, suggests that the rent cap is reducing the supply of homes to rent, he adds, and keeping prices high.“The city’s on the way to becoming a no-go area for serious investors too, which won’t be good for the rental supply side in the long run.”Berlin’s controversial referendum proposal is not legally binding — and, if enacted, will come at a huge cost to the city, on top of nearly €2.5bn recently spent on buying 14,750 apartments from two large corporate landlords.“[The expropriation of properties] is unlikely to take place,” says property analyst Peter Rabitz, founder of Your Berlin Agent. “The cost of compensating these companies at market value is estimated to be €24bn- €30bn. It’s not practical and wouldn’t create any new living space within the city,” he says. “It also wouldn’t leave enough money to carry out much-needed refurbishments to these homes. Imagine what could be built with €30bn instead!”The referendum does, however, mark “the next stage of escalation” after more than 10 years of pressure on the rental market, says Clemens Paschke, chief executive of Ziegert estate agency. “There is a massive imbalance of supply and demand, and that’s going to get worse as the population is forecast to grow by 10 per cent in the next 10 years.”Adding to Berlin’s “challenges”, he says, are laws governing “milieu protection areas”, which prevent landlords from dividing buildings into condominiums. Building more houses is an obvious solution, “but it can take two years to get permits, up to eight years in total, from finding the land to completion”.What most agree is that Berlin needs to fast-track its building permit system to speed up construction. “Nationalisation is a short-term and rather populist approach and not a lasting solution,” says Steffen Wicker, founder and chief executive of Homeday. “The answer is to create more affordable living spaces in areas where people want to live. The state can contribute to this through re-densification in central areas, less bureaucracy, accelerated approval procedures and by creating better transport to the suburbs — as the commuter belt around Berlin is now experiencing even larger price increases, in properties for sale, than the urban areas.”Berlin’s lack of sale and rental stock means it is one of the few German cities where residential prices are still rising. The median asking price for existing buildings is currently €5,140 per sq m, up 4.8 per cent on October 2020, according to Immowelt and Immonet data.“At the high end, most of our sales are new-build as there’s very limited supply of existing buildings. We saw the €10,000 per sq m benchmark hit five years ago for the first time. Now it’s up to €25,000 per sq m for the very best penthouses in landmark projects,” says Paschke.Rabitz adds that in popular places such as Friedrichshain — a gentrified area once famous for its student feel — he has seen three large family apartments go over asking price.For most Berliners, however, ownership remains out of the question. And as a tenant in this rental capital, you’d better make sure you get on with the neighbours. You may find yourself living side by side for many years to come.Follow @FTProperty on Twitter or @ft_houseandhome on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first
120  To be specific, they are made mostly of discarded styrofoam, found in the streets of Athens by the Greek designer Savvas Laz. Laz shapes and glues the various pieces together, then binds them in fibreglass. He calls these pieces and interior elements Trashformers. They, like The Pink House itself, are more than just a provocative design project: they are an attempt to propose entirely new and sustainable ways of making and building that challenge perceptions both of what’s useful and what’s beautiful. And they’re all part of a greater, island-wide project to remake Kastellorizo’s built environment as a destination for culture and art that starts conversations about both. The project is the brainchild of Italian collector and patron Nicoletta Fiorucci, who is known for planting contemporary art and ideas within the landscape of diverse islands around Europe to provocative and experimental effect. She spends summers hosting young artists on the Li Galli archipelago off the Amalfi Coast; her Fiorucci Art Trust hosts the annual, artist-led Volcano Extravaganza on Stromboli. When she first visited Kastellorizo, a tiny dot in Greece’s Dodecanese, over 30 years ago, it didn’t immediately speak to her. Once a wealthy, thriving port – at the turn of the 20th century, still under Ottoman rule, it had a population of more than 10,000 – its maritime economy crashed when steamboats became the chosen mode of sea transport. Bombed by the Germans during the second world war, at one point it became completely depopulated. When Fiorucci arrived in the ’90s, there were a few hundred people living there for at least half the year; dozens of houses had been repaired and renovated, and many descendants of the island’s emigrants, who had ended up in Australia, were returning to purchase second homes. But Kastellorizo was still a wounded landscape, dotted with abandoned ruins and dilapidated buildings. “On other islands, I was happy to watch the sunset over the sea,” Fiorucci says, “but on Kastellorizo I felt almost from the beginning that it really needed my engagement and energy.” The more she learned, the more captivated she became.In the years since, she has purchased various ruins and plots of land and helped support the renovation of the island’s public and historic spaces. She’s simultaneously gathered an impassioned group around her, as committed as she is to the island’s cultural growth. In 2014 she met the Greek architect Fotini Chalvantzi, then restoring the island’s Monastery of St George of the Mountain; Chalvantzi had spent years researching a thesis that examined all Kastellorizo’s remaining historic buildings. Having someone so trusted by the local community as an adviser and an ally was important. “As an Italian in Greece, I’m sensitive to Italy’s historical impact – both positive and negative – on the island,” says Fiorucci. “I have no interest in coming in here as some kind of colonial force. I want to add a positive layer.”Nothing would be out of place in Kubrick’s 2001: A Space OdysseyShe has also taken advice from Sylvia Kouvali, the respected contemporary-art dealer behind the Rodeo galleries in London and Piraeus. It was through Kouvali that she was introduced to the Transformers project: Fiorucci was drawn to a large green chair by Laz on a visit to Kouvali’s Ampersand design agency in Athens.“I immediately understood his language,” recalls Fiorucci. Even though she didn’t know exactly how the chair was made, she gelled with the 36-year-old artist’s ethos and the idea of creating something out of other people’s waste (something Laz had absorbed as a student of Dutch artist Joep van Lieshout, a pioneer in working with styrofoam). What if, Fiorucci wondered, he could develop something beyond furniture. “If Savvas could create a chair, he could design an entire house.” The results of that first dialogue became the Trashformers Gesamtkunstwerk that is The Pink House. Purchased in 2016, the 150 sq m space also has a living area and kitchen, which extends outside to a terrace and rock garden. As a canvas for Laz’s Trashformers, it is the perfect space.Although almost all of the furniture was produced in Laz’s atelier in Athens, the designer finished and installed everything on site over a period of four months in the spring and summer of this year. The Trashformers pieces aren’t the only recycled ones. Broken taverna seats that Laz and others rescued from dump sites in Athens have been reassembled, embellished with decorative sculptural elements of styrofoam and painted white. The floor is a mosaic of black-and-white stripes, created via a traditional technique of laying smooth stones, one flush against the other (a dynamic visual anchor, since every piece of furniture and surface in the house is painted bright white). All the doors and wood elements are reclaimed or recycled. The entire top floor is a light-filled master bedroom, with a large Trashformers bed complete with abstract headboard in its centre and several smaller pieces: an asymmetrical sideboard with a watery green-hued mirrored surface and a bench-like chaise longue. Here Laz had fun, installing a swing in front of a large window overlooking the harbour as well as a bedside lamp – a combination of fibreglass, styrofoam, mirror and cast metal – in the abstracted shape of a sea turtle (“My ode to the turtles that swim in the port”).No space, from the bedrooms to the storage room, would be out of place aboard Discovery One from Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey. Still, the unique variety of asymmetrical shapes, and the fact that Laz dictated there be no straight lines in the house, impart a sense of something strongly handcrafted and human – as familiar as a Greek Ionic column in the Temple of Athena Nike on the Acropolis.When Fiorucci toured the house after it was completed, she was both delighted and inspired. “When you walk through you never once think, ‘This is built of trash.’ The space is stunning, harmonious – so much so it makes you realise how successfully waste can be transformed into objects and spaces of beauty. That is the message.”She hopes the project ends up being “a prototype that can be scaled in a bigger way and inspire real change”. Her plans on Kastellorizo reflect this intention: together with her team of advisers and collaborators, Fiorucci is inviting designers to experiment inside other houses she has acquired and restored, to transform used materials and establish new ideas of sustainable design. The designer Michael Anastassiades is already at work, collaborating with Studio Mumbai on the reinvention of a historic church garden. The renovation of a cultural centre that will host educational and cultural programming is being funded by the Stavros Niarchos Foundation. And not far from The Pink House is the family home of the legendary feminist American artist Lynda Benglis, who locals hope to involve with the cultural centre’s projects when she is in residence.Laz, too, says he hopes to spark dialogue; both on the island and beyond. He also believes Kastellorizo could become a sort of next-generation Hydra – a fashionable nexus of artists and contemporary-art happenings. But one, Fiorucci adds, that looks to past and future, and finds a balance that is light on the land, even as it captivates us one house at a time.
121  The summit wrapped up just before midnight, with EU leaders having to rush through their dinner after being locked in hours-long quarrels, mainly over energy and to some extent over Poland. We’ll give you the rundown of how discussions went and why the outgoing Czech prime minister, Andrej Babis, was the most difficult to convince in signing up to the summit’s conclusions on energy.Meanwhile, on the other side of town at Nato, defence ministers stuck to a more reasonable timetable and will resume their session today with some EU guests. We’ll explore what their overlapping diaries spell for future co-operation.And with digital policy on the agenda of today’s EU summit (along with migration), we look at an upcoming review of competition rules that will also impact tech companies. This article is an onsite version of our Europe Express newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every weekday morningThe EU leaders’ summit showdown with Poland was overshadowed in the end by the divisive issue of energy prices, writes Mehreen Khan in Brussels. Before the flare-up between Brussels and Warsaw over the primacy of EU law, this week’s summit was scheduled as the moment for leaders to debate the bloc’s common response to surging electricity prices. It lived up to the billing. More than four hours were devoted to the energy crisis, with the Czech Republic’s Andrej Babis taking centre stage in a debate that pit a group of free market countries against others demanding protectionism and energy price stability. Babis held up proceedings by initially blocking a summit communiqué over his claims that the bloc’s carbon market, known as the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), was responsible for driving up household energy bills and was rife with market manipulation. Energy is the world’s indispensable business and Energy Source is its newsletter. Every Tuesday and Thursday, direct to your inbox, Energy Source brings you essential news, forward-thinking analysis and insider intelligence. Sign up here.Other governments have also made similar claims about speculators forcing up the cost of carbon credits to records in recent months. The European Commission has repeatedly said they have no evidence of skulduggery and point out that the ETS price only contributes to about 15 per cent of the EU’s wholesale electricity costs. The impassioned debate was a foreshadowing of deepening divisions over the merits of Brussels’ climate proposals to come this winter, when the squeeze on gas supplies and ensuing price increases are set to worsen. The crisis has strengthened calls from the likes of France, Spain, Poland and Greece for an overhaul of the EU’s energy market rules, to help lock in long-term prices and damp volatility. Standing against those demands are the likes of Germany, Ireland, the Nordics, and Baltics who don’t want heavy-handed interference in an energy market that has moved towards greater liberalisation in the last decade. “I am a firm believer in markets,” said Estonia’s Kaja Kallas on arriving at the summit.The commission is caught between these competing demands for radical action on the one hand, and a wait-and-see stance on the other. Brussels has promised to come up with proposals for joint EU procurement and storage for natural gas in December. But Ursula von der Leyen, commission president, told leaders last night that any common procurement would be done on a voluntary basis, allowing only countries who want to pool their resources to do so. Leaders also heaped pressure on what is arguably Brussels’ most important climate proposal due in the coming months: the EU’s green labelling system, known as the taxonomy. Leaders including Babis and France’s Emmanuel Macron called for an explicit inclusion of natural gas and nuclear power in the forthcoming taxonomy draft. Germany, Austria and Luxembourg are among those resolutely opposed to nuclear being awarded a green label, on the grounds that it produces thousands of years of toxic waste.With last night’s debates largely unresolved, leaders are gearing up to do it all again in December. Spain has been at the vanguard of calls for more crisis talks at the end of the year, banking on the fact that a worsening winter crisis might help concentrate minds and push the cause of sweeping energy price reform.Should the EU freeze Poland’s funding? Tell us what you think and click here to take the poll. For those demanding greater co-ordination between the EU and Nato, this week’s parallel summits of EU leaders and Nato defence ministers was proof that the two Brussels-headquartered organisations could perhaps compare their diaries a little more in the future, writes Henry Foy in Brussels.Building on the overlapping calendars, Nato defence ministers today will strive to also draw up overlapping (but not duplicating) strategic objectives. Finland, Sweden and the EU’s foreign policy and defence chief Josep Borrell will join Nato member states to “discuss how we can further strengthen the partnership . . . with our closest partners,” said Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg yesterday.There is unanimity on the rhetoric, and the need to align approaches. But defining the details may need some work, amid tussles inside the EU regarding the “autonomy” in “open strategic autonomy”, and broader discussions within Nato as to its future after the Afghanistan withdrawal and the US pivot to China.In conversations with Europe Express, ministers involved in today’s talks stressed the need for the two organisations to complement each other and bring their individual capabilities to the table, rather than seeking to duplicate abilities or compete for resources.Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, dismissed a recent surge in chatter around the constantly re-emerging notion of an EU army as “a red herring”, instead explaining that the EU’s strength is in its ability to raise resilience among societies to new hybrid and cyber threats.“I do actually think that the best place for the EU to complement Nato is in the pre-conflict space, hardening the resilience of Europe, challenging hybrid efforts to disrupt our societies,” he said. “That’s actually where the EU can help corral its members and plug perfectly into Nato’s predominant role in conflict in war.”The UK is of course inside Nato but outside the EU. And in Sweden, a country inside the EU but outside Nato, the view is similar.The EU “must develop the capabilities” to counter hybrid threats, Sweden’s defence minister Peter Hultqvist said. “It is very important to have a situation where the EU and Nato are complementary to each other and not competitors.”Striking that balance will take more than just one day of meetings, but a new Nato-EU declaration in the offing before the end of the year should set the broad framework. Assuming that goes to plan, expect large overlap in the EU’s Strategic Compass (due in the spring) and Nato’s Strategic Concept (due in the summer). Borrell, who will have uniquely attended both summits this week, said yesterday that “intense discussions” had taken place on the Strategic Compass “in order for the European Union to act more and better as a security provider. To use all our forces, to spend better on defence and being a stronger partner.” Nato certainly hopes so.Turkey’s central bank has defied warnings from the business world and opposition parties by slashing its main interest rate despite rising inflation and an ailing currency. The lira, which had already lost about 20 per cent of its value against the dollar this year prior to the announcement, fell a further 2 per cent on the news. (More here)EU leaders today are set to discuss the bloc’s digital agenda, just weeks ahead of a proposed update to the competition rules that will also have an impact on tech companies, writes Javier Espinoza in Brussels.The point of today’s discussion, according to a senior official familiar with the meeting, is to give a nudge to the stalled regulation, bogged down in internal quarrels within the European parliament and among member states. According to the summit’s draft conclusions, leaders will call on all parties “to continue work on the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act proposals with a view to reaching an ambitious agreement as soon as possible”.While member states want to be seen to be tough on pushing for new tech regulation, the EU’s chief competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, is quietly ploughing ahead with an update to the bloc’s competition rule book that will also have an impact on the digital economy.Updates to the competition rules are expected on November 17 in three main areas:Foreign subsidies: The EU has been working for a while on new rules to curb foreign public subsidies, in what would be a challenge to China. The idea is to properly scrutinise investments and whether they are heavily subsidised and therefore distort competition. Some have complained that this may reduce the willingness from companies — even if not subsidised — to invest in the bloc.Killer acquisitions: Brussels is also exploring for the first time its ability to review deals even if the companies seeking to merge have no revenues in Europe or do not meet the current thresholds. The EU is looking at Illumina’s $8bn acquisition of Grail as the first test case of a transaction that may be bad for consumers. Opponents claim this will introduce more uncertainty for future deals.State aid revamped: Vestager also told the Financial Times earlier this week that the EU will look to extend the relaxation of state-aid rules because of the pandemic just one more time. In the future there will be special exemptions for those sectors, such as travel and hospitality, that were particularly hit hard by the health crisis. Vestager told Europe Express that it’s more about tweaks than a complete overhaul. She said Brussels was looking at gaps in their regulation and how to address them: “We figure out how to stay relevant, which is a much more evolutionary approach than a revolutionary approach.” Second day of EU summit, focused on migration and digital policyEU officials and non-Nato members join the second day of the Nato defence ministers’ meeting to discuss EU-Nato co-operation German corporate lenders: The pandemic has increased the net lending position of the country’s corporate sector — a trend that is set to continue in 2022, hinting that the unusual situation of net lending by companies could be the new norm in the German economy, writes Bruegel.Climate change impact: Chatham House has mapped 10 major impacts of climate change by 2030, including on food security and migration. Most at risk are communities that are already quite vulnerable, with adaptation measures urgently needed to avert a domino effect across the globe.

122  Jens Weidmann, head of Germany’s Bundesbank, has been a lonely voice among Europe’s central bankers for a decade.In 2012, just after then European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi committed at the height of the sovereign debt crisis to do “whatever it takes to preserve the euro” — including printing vast sums of money to buy government bonds — Weidmann had warned “we shouldn’t underestimate the danger that central bank financing can become addictive like a drug.”Since that point, the ECB has been locked in a bitter stand-off with the Bundesbank, which has repeatedly spoken out against the increasingly unconventional policies that have flooded Europe’s financial markets with cheap money.These tensions were in the spotlight again this week when Weidmann, the longest serving of 25 members of the ECB governing council, announced he would step down as Bundesbank president six years before his mandate was due to expire.The 53-year-old cited “personal reasons” for his decision. But colleagues say the Bundesbank boss had tired of fighting an often lonely battle against the ECB’s bond buying and negative interest rate policies and fears that more frustrating clashes lie ahead.His decision to quit only weeks before the ECB will make crucial decisions on how much post-pandemic stimulus to provide has prompted some German economists to warn that the country was losing one of its vital bulwarks against fiscal and monetary excesses.“The Bundesbank had to play this role as bad cop once the eurozone came into existence to ensure that the eventual compromise at the ECB ended up where it should be,” said Dirk Schumacher, head of European macro research at French bank Natixis and a former ECB economist. “But sometimes I think they got too caught up in that and it was perceived as being stubborn.”Once dismissed by Draghi as Nein zu allem — German for “No to everything” — Weidmann spent his early years as Bundesbank boss openly criticising the ECB’s ultra-loose monetary policies, including speaking out against them when they were challenged at the German constitutional court.Weidmann often voiced the fears of many in his country who suspected Europe’s monetary union risked becoming a transfer union, where taxpayers of rich countries in the north pay to bail out profligate governments in the south.Jürgen Stark, who himself quit as ECB chief economist in 2011 in protest over its government bond purchases, expressed sympathy with Weidmann. “Nobody can support a policy against their own convictions for more than a decade,” Stark told the Börsen-Zeitung.The two sides used to be on better terms. When the ECB was created in 1998 it was not only based a few blocks away from the Bundesbank’s offices in Frankfurt, but it was also modelled on the German central bank, which had earned widespread respect for avoiding the double-digit inflation rates that plagued most countries in the oil crisis of the 1970s. Otmar Issing, a highly regarded economics professor who joined the euro area’s fledgling monetary institution from the Bundesbank in 1998, is widely credited with shaping the ECB as chief economist in its early years, including its use of money supply measures to decide interest rate policy and contain inflation.Lucrezia Reichlin, a London Business School professor who was head of research at the ECB from 2005-2008, said: “When I was at the ECB it was a much more German institution. That changed under Draghi and now it’s much more independent.”Many analysts blamed the Bundesbank’s inflation-fighting orthodoxy for the ECB’s ill-judged decision to raise interest rates twice in response to a shortlived period of higher inflation in 2011, just as the sovereign debt crisis was unfolding.“The Draghi years [2011 to 2019] were the emancipation of the ECB from the Bundesbank,” said Carsten Brzeski, head of macro research at Dutch bank ING, adding that relations with the German central bank briefly improved after Christine Lagarde took over at the ECB in 2019.When the pandemic hit soon after, Weidmann even supported the launch of a €1.85tn bond-buying fund and backed the ECB’s new strategy to accept the potential for inflation to overshoot — an idea he had previously criticised.However, tensions resurfaced as the economy started to recover from the pandemic and inflation surged above the 2 per cent ECB target. Weidmann was one of two ECB council members who spoke out in July against new guidance on when to start raising interest rates, which he complained had raised the bar for such a move too high.Wiedmann will depart shortly after the ECB council meeting in December where it will say how it plans to wind down its €1.85tn Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) and the stimulus it will provide after that.Bundesbank officials have been unsettled by calls from some ECB council members for it to maintain a significant bond-buying scheme after PEPP ends and to loosen some of its self-imposed restrictions on asset purchases.Next year “could be the ultimate test of whether the ECB takes the goal of fighting inflation more seriously than the finance ministers’ interest in low interest rates and bond purchases,” said Friedrich Heinemann, an economist at the Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research. “This is where Weidmann will be missed.”Managing any fallout from this will fall to whoever the German government chooses to replace Weidmann once talks on forming a new three-way ruling coalition are completed — creating an opportunity to rebuild bridges with the ECB.“His successor will have the difficult task to reset relations,” said Klaus Adam, economics professor at the University of Mannheim. “But the troubles will start if the majority on the ECB council wants to keep asset purchases going and inflation keeps rising.”
123  When the tattooed Russian fighters arrived in Alindao, a town in the southern Central African Republic (CAR), the rebels fled — and the people rejoiced.“They were white. They were very big,” said Fatima, 32. “They looked so strange, they had tattoos everywhere — snakes, skulls, human heads . . .[but] they were going to help.”But soon stories began circulating from nearby villages — of looting and torture, killings and rape. Then one day last month they took Fatima’s brother from their home. The next, they took her to a nearby military camp, where she says three of them raped her until she lost consciousness.“They were very scary — we were all so scared,” she said. “We thought they came here to restore peace to our country. Now I wish they’d never come.”The mercenaries who attacked Alindao belong to a Kremlin-linked network of companies known as the Wagner Group that has helped president Faustin-Archange Touadéra beat back rebels and saved his government, according to security, humanitarian, diplomatic and opposition sources in the CAR.The US accuses Evgeny Prigozhin, a caterer known as Russian president Vladimir Putin’s “chef,” of bankrolling Wagner — accusations he has long denied. Sources say the group has up to 3,000 armed fighters in the country. Russia says it has some 1,100 unarmed military trainers in the CAR, part of a deal Moscow inked with Bangui in 2018.The deployment has given Russia a foothold in the region, seizing on widespread resentment at former colonial power France and using it as a template for its expansion into other troubled neighbouring countries such as Mali. But it has also prompted allegations of human rights abuses at the UN security council. The unofficial links to Wagner have given Moscow plausible deniability, analysts say.With a long history of instability, coups and armed insurrection, the CAR is for Wagner, as one diplomat in Bangui put it, “a perfect laboratory”. Here, said the diplomat, they could “show what they can do in order to sell it to other countries” eager to put down their own insurrections.Wagner’s involvement also allows Moscow to regain some of the cold war-era influence it has lost in Africa in recent decades, while antagonising the west at low political and monetary cost, according to experts who study the group.Along the way, the mercenaries have taken over gold and diamond mining areas, targeted Muslim and Fulani ethnic minorities, and had multiple altercations with members of the 15,000-strong UN peacekeeping mission, Minusca.“They have completely changed the equation on the ground,” said a security source in Bangui. “The operating environment is just ideal for them, there is no real state and you have quite a toothless government that was really looking for a way out and found it in these mercenaries.”In written answers to questions the Financial Times sent to Prigozhin’s catering company about Wagner’s operations in the CAR, Alexander Ivanov, head of the Officers’ Union for International Security, said that there were not “large numbers of Russian mercenaries” in the CAR and the Russian instructors — which the Kremlin says it sent — were not involved in any fighting or commercial activity.Wagner has already found willing customers for its services across Africa, including Mozambique, Madagascar, Sudan — and Libya, where the UN accused them of allegedly committing possible war crimes.Its next client may be Mali, an ex-French colony where the ruling military junta has suggested hiring 1,000 Wagner paramilitaries after Paris announced it would halve its 5,000-troop presence fighting the jihadist insurgency roiling the Sahel.The Malian junta fears that a French withdrawal or downsizing could make insecurity worse, and is seeking “other partners”. There are echoes here of the CAR’s experience. Bangui turned to Russia when France pulled troops out after a three-year mission that failed to quell a bloody civil war.France’s reputation in the CAR — and in other former colonies including Mali — is so low that even those who condemn the Russian presence see some small silver lining. “I’m very happy that the French influence has shrunk and is getting smaller,” said Gervais Lakasso, an artist and activist in Bangui. “[It is] one of the biggest things that makes Touadéra popular.”The Russian presence is visible in Bangui, where armed fighters dressed in fatigues ride around in bulletproof military trucks. Russian fighters help guard the president, whose national security adviser had long been Valery Zakharov, a former Russian intelligence officer.Yet prime minister Henri-Marie Dondra denied the presence of Russian mercenaries. “We have not signed a contract with private companies, we have a contract with Russia,” he told the FT. “We have a bilateral co-operation agreement which is very clear.”He added that to his knowledge “there are no other forces that are present” beyond Russian, UN or Rwandan troops also in the country on a bilateral agreement.Russia’s foreign ministry said Moscow’s instructors were operating in the country legally and had helped “the CAR’s army significantly increase its fighting capacity, as a result of which its units have inflicted significant casualties on fighters of various illegal armed groups”.But Sorcha MacLeod, member of the UN human rights council’s working group on mercenaries, said Russians and affiliated foreigners “are involved in human rights violations, they are potentially involved in war crimes”.Dondra insisted that “whenever there have been abuses, as soon as the government is informed, we immediately start an investigation,” noting that the majority are committed by armed groups.Last month, the CAR government released a report acknowledging for the first time that Russian instructors had committed human rights abuses. But Russia’s foreign ministry said it had not been informed: “If the insinuations about their atrocities had any real foundation, and the local population was actively protesting, the CAR’s leadership would hardly have insisted on the further presence of specialists from Russia,” it said.Foreign officials, opposition figures and civil society members argue that the government is, to one degree or another, captured by Wagner, which it depends on for its security and status in power. “I think [the government] made a deal with someone and now they don’t know how to handle it,” said one foreign official in Bangui. “They can’t control them.”It is unclear how Russian fighters are being paid for their services. Wagner-linked companies including the US-sanctioned outfits Lobaye Invest and others have made inroads in the CAR’s mining sector. Some opposition figures and foreign officials suggest it is one way the government compensates them.With international donors, led by the EU and the World Bank, providing roughly half of the country’s $400m annual budget, “we can’t rule out that donor money is going towards paying them”, said a foreign official in Bangui.“In a way, the [EU] and the World Bank are paying the mercenaries, which is a very awkward position to be in,” another diplomat in Bangui said.Ivanov said the Russian instructors had “no relation to seizing control of gold and diamond extraction”. Prigozhin’s Patriot media group said Lobaye Invest worked in the CAR legally and said the officials who suggested Russian forces were being paid from western donor funds “should be prosecuted for libel and expelled from the CAR”.On May 30, Denise Brown, the number-two UN official in Minusca, travelled to an area near the border with Chad to investigate alleged human rights violations by the national army.A public UN report notes only that “bilaterally deployed and other security personnel obstructed the access of a United Nations delegation led by” Brown.But four sources familiar with the incident said that when Brown and her delegation landed in a helicopter, the Russian paramilitaries trained AK-47s on the group — a sign of the impunity with which they operate in the CAR.“This is a shit show,” said one veteran security official in Bangui. “They have no rules. It’s completely different than anywhere else.”Ivanov said he was unaware of the incident but suggested that Brown had failed to inform the CAR’s defence ministry of her travel “due to her ignorance” of local regulations and that “her unapproved flight could have been interpreted as a life-or-death threat” by personnel on the ground.Multiple diplomats and humanitarians in Bangui warned it was only a matter of time before skirmishes between Russians and Minusca erupted into real violence.Meanwhile, civilians are bearing the brunt. In PK5, the Muslim enclave of Bangui, victims of Russian brutality are easy to find — more arrive every day.“We have experienced all sorts of rebellions over the years, from all armed groups, and then the Russians came in and made it even worse,” said a 66-year-old imam from the mining town of Bria. “It’s complete chaos — we had no choice but to flee.”Mercenaries had stolen his CFA Fr6m ($10,600) savings and were stealing anything they can get their hands on: old clothes, jerry cans, water bottles, the sundry possessions of the poorest people on earth. He wondered: “What do they need with our old trousers?”“The first time they came, I was very happy, we all were — finally our suffering from the armed groups will end because they’re here to help the government and save us,” he said. “But eventually we realised [what] they were doing . . . and we ran for our lives.”
124  In the scorched-earth aftermath of the financial crisis, regulators were looking for novel ways to avoid a repeat of the carnage they had just lived through. Capital buffers — war chests of reserves specifically designed to help banks navigate the highs and lows of their businesses — seemed to offer just that.A decade on, buffers are largely seen to have just failed their first test in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. They did provide some assurance to investors but did not unleash extra credit to the economy in a period of stress, leaving regulators scrambling to come up with a fix in an area fraught with market and political sensitivities.It’s easy to see why the buffers were attractive to regulators back in the day.One type, the countercyclical buffer, is specifically tied to crises. The idea is that banks build up a war chest during good times. Then, in bad times, their national regulator lets them dip into the vault by reducing or eliminating the buffer requirement, freeing up resources when they are most needed to absorb losses or support lending.Another one, the capital conservation buffer, is a different kind of safety net. It’s set at an industry-wide level and banks can use it whenever they need to. Dipping into this buffer does restrict banks’ ability to pay dividends and some bond coupons, but that penalty is a lot less severe than the forced-capital raises triggered by breaching core capital requirements.The buffers’ time to shine came last year, as the pandemic threatened the most dramatic cycle the world’s economies and banks had ever faced. The European Central Banks, the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England all played their parts, allowing banks to use their countercyclical buffers and encouraging them to dip into their capital conservation ones.And then, almost nothing happened. Research by the Bank for International Settlements showed the buffers — totalling more than $2.5tn heading into 2020 — had been mostly untouched right across the world.Some say banks did not use their buffers to lend money because credit demand from their customers was sated by the trillions spent by governments on both sides of the Atlantic in support of companies.Still, officials including Fed supervision head Randy Quarles and the BoE’s head of prudential regulation, Vicky Saporta, publicly lamented the buffers’ performance.Regulators have spent the best part of a year trying to work out how they might put things right.Last week, lobby group the Association of Financial Markets in Europe offered its two cents in a paper published ahead of the EU’s next deliberation on capital rules. The meat of AFME’s proposal is that the countercyclical buffer should be larger and the capital conservation buffer smaller.AFME argues that banks were reluctant to use their capital conservation buffers because of the stigma attached, the perception that markets and investors wouldn’t like it. The countercyclical buffers are easier to use, AFME says, because when regulators reduce them that actually increases banks’ capacity to pay dividends or coupons, so stigma of reducing capital doesn’t apply in the same way.In her July speech, Saporta noted that to avoid “investor and rating agency opprobrium” banks would consider cutting lending before dipping into buffers. “If a regulatory buffer is not practically usable in the sense that banks do not want to dip into it, then it has little value in helping firms to absorb shocks in ways that keep lending going in bad times,” she added.In a speech last week, Quarles spoke of the importance of research into banks’ reluctance to draw down buffers so the Fed could “improve” its tools for the next crisis.Corinne Cunningham, head of credit research at Autonomous, said European banks were sensitive about depleting capital conservation buffers since to do so would restrict their ability make coupon payments for additional tier one bonds, a non-issue for US banks, which do not use that type of debt.Rebalancing buffers in favour of the countercyclical type would solve some problems but risks creating new ones. Nicolas Véron, of think-tank Bruegel, points out that a bigger countercyclical buffer could mean that capital was lower through the cycle as reserves rise and fall. Michael Lever, prudential regulation head at AFME, says that would be a positive thing since “the whole purpose is to enable a greater drawdown of capital buffers” in challenging times. Investors might not agree.Another complexity is that national authorities set the countercyclical buffers. The gaps between different countries’ regimes could get bigger, since local regulators would be setting a bigger portion of the overall buffer.Such divergence might be unwelcome for investors. Having the ECB oversee buffers across the eurozone would help consistency, but would open an even bigger can of worms.laura.noonan@ft.com
125  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
126  In April 1895, Julie Manet, aged 16, returned to her journal after a short break. “Oh, what sorrow!” she began. “Since I last wrote, I lost Maman. I cannot even describe my grief, the depth of my sadness. In three years, both my parents have left me and now I am an orphan.”Maman was the great Impressionist Berthe Morisot; Papa was Eugène, brother of Edouard Manet, also dead. Julie called herself the last of the Manets, “one sad girl left to mourn them”. Vital consolation came from family mementos — which happened to be among the most famous, intimately subversive 19th-century paintings. Now, Paris’s Musée Marmottan Monet gathers many of them, from collections public and private, for the first time in its groundbreaking exhibition Julie Manet: An Impressionist Heritage.“Berthe Morisot with a Fan” is Edouard Manet’s tribute to a fellow painter — huge eyes in a slender, tense face; long fingers twisting like the spiky palm behind her. It is also a farewell to an unfulfilled love affair: Morisot, nervous, proud, mischievous, turns aside from Manet — she had just accepted the consolation prize of engagement to his brother.Compare this portrait, its grandly sumptuous blacks and Velázquez references, to “Woman with a Cat”, Manet depicting his wife Suzanne plain in pink — plump, comfortable, as unexciting as her pet. Or to Morisot’s “Eugène Manet and His Daughter in the Garden”, the gender roles of painter/model gloriously reversed, an artist radically painting her husband — as passive, neutral, a foil for luminous little Julie — amid luscious foliage and flowers.Manet learnt from Morisot’s plein air freedom. History is still learning about women’s pivotal yet nuanced roles, balancing creative innovation, emotional power, compromise and self-sacrifice in forging modern art. The Marmottan unpacks revelatory connections through ace after ace of iconic images.At 40 rue Villejust in the bourgeois 16th arrondissement, the Morisot-Manets offered “one of the most authentic centres of civilised Parisian life”, said Renoir — a place where “even Degas became more civil”. Like Julie’s mother and uncle, Renoir enjoyed privileged access to her as a model. His round-cheeked, pale “Child with Cat” on a chaise longue — precise contours, transparent soft effect, a triumph of his ingresque classicism — and the later full, sensuously rich depiction of the flame-haired, pouting teenager are contrasting highlights.Beautiful, self-controlled, with an adult seriousness, Julie the model was an apprentice painter herself — her watercolour renderings of Manet’s portraits of her mother, the erotic “Berthe Morisot Reclining” and “The Rest”, are accomplished, poignant. In 1898, Julie met artist Ernest Rouart, Degas’s sole pupil, while both were copying at the Louvre — Degas engineered the encounter. (Manet and Morisot had similarly met while copying there, in 1868.) Julie rarely painted after she married Rouart — a double wedding with her cousin Jeannie to modernist poet Paul Valéry. The two couples, inseparable, lived in adjacent apartments on rue Villejust (now rue Paul Valéry). The passage to modernity in French painting and literature was entwined in this family as in no other.Valéry was the protégé of writer Stéphane Mallarmé, who became Julie’s guardian. At her father’s death, Mallarmé gave Julie a greyhound named Laertes (after Polonius’s bereaved son in Hamlet). Morisot’s “Julie Manet and Her Greyhound Laertes” depicts the blank-faced girl as a silhouette in mourning, comforted by the alert dog. In the rose-blue interior, scrambled forms of Japanese screen and furnishings dematerialise — a blur of grief. This exquisite work, pushing impressionist haziness to its limit, pulses with restrained feeling. “Everyone dies with her secrets,” Morisot wrote. After Eugène’s funeral, she and Julie never mentioned him to one other again. Art expressed what could not be said.Mallarmé wanted his poems “to paint not the thing, but the effect it produces”. Morisot’s paintings, light of touch, pitch perfect — the instant a sail billows in “Au bord de la Seine Valvins”, a moment of complicity/separateness in the unfinished, unfinishable “Berthe Morisot and her Daughter Julie Manet” — have a similarly elusive brilliance. Manet’s stirring portrait of Mallarmé, laconically reclining with a cigar but mind leaping, celebrates the closeness between this poet and the painters. A Fauve sequel is Georges d’Espagnat’s portrait of Valéry: angular, uncertain features, penetrating eyes, torso thrusting forward anxiously yet defiantly against a decorative ground.This is one of several obscure marvels unearthed by the Marmottan. Another is Ernest Rouart’s eerie “L’Heure du thé” (c1913): four figures in burnt umber, faces mute white, seated on the same chaise longue as in Renoir’s “Child with Cat” decades before. Rouart arranges his wife and children in rhythmic pattern, arabesques of linked lines, yet each avoids the gaze of the others. The son buried in a book is Julien Rouart, future psychiatrist and collaborator with Jacques Lacan. Degas’ impact is in the picture’s fine modelling, but the mood is sinister intimiste, like Vallotton or Vuillard.“We must always apologise for talking about painting,” wrote Valéry. This family, however, seemed to talk to each other chiefly through paintings. Canvases hanging at the rue Villejust enveloped them in past joys, troubled memories: reassembled here are Degas’ spangled ballerina pastels and whiplash sketch of a nonchalant Manet; Renoir’s depiction of a widowed Morisot, suddenly white-haired; Manet’s delicious portraits with tragic undertows — “Boy with Cherries”, the innocent/provocative painting assistant who, at 15, hanged himself in the artist’s studio; charismatic bohemian Nina Callias, “The Lady with Fans”, who went insane.Propped on rue Villejust’s piano was Edgar Allan Poe’s musical poem “The Raven”, illustrated by Manet, recounting the bird’s mysterious visit to a mad lover. Webs of artistic and sexual liaisons also emerge here in books, letters, photographs documented in the Marmottan’s riveting catalogue (available in English). It reads like a Bergman script. Scenes from marriages unfold; complementing Julie’s journal, a familiar impressionist source, the museum now publishes Madame Valéry’s diary. She was a sparky musician who gave up the concert piano to support Valéry, beginning with his traumatised “great silence” following Mallarmé’s death. After nearly 20 years, Valéry broke that silence in 1917 with “La Jeune Parque”, an incantatory soliloquy of a girl daydreaming about love and estrangement, beauty and destruction. Appearing amid Europe’s carnage, it made Valéry famous and influential.TS Eliot likened Valéry to Poe, but a visual association is Morisot’s floaty “Julie Daydreaming” — an expression of the unstable adolescent mind. Julie and Jeannie, each orphaned young, grew up together and alike abandoned their vocations for devotion to their husbands’ art. But their voices came back, in Rouart’s taut painting, in Valéry’s enigmatic musical verse — just as Morisot had a liberating effect on Manet.The Marmottan excavates stories that triply fascinate: a fresh approach to the imaginative processes of dead white male genius; a consideration of women’s negotiations with cultural and social structures; and the psychological truth of how human relationships fuelled revolutions in modern painting and poetry.To March 20, marmottan.frFollow @ftweekend on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first
127  European leaders warned Poland that the union was prepared to deploy further legal sanctions against Warsaw in response to its defiance of EU law, as they urged the country to walk back its challenges to the bloc’s judicial foundations.In their first face-to-face talks since Poland’s top court ruled that key parts of EU law are not compatible with the country’s constitution, leaders voiced strong support for the European Commission’s pledge to hit back at Warsaw.However, numerous leaders also called for political dialogue to be prioritised alongside legal measures, as they sought to ease a bitter row that has triggered fears that Poland could ultimately exit the union.“There was a clear message from an overwhelming group of leaders around the table that we are highly worried about the situation in Poland,” Mark Rutte, Dutch prime minister, said after the meeting of EU leaders in Brussels, known as the European Council, adjourned on Thursday evening.“Tonight was dialogue. But at the same time, there is a clear understanding we fully support the commission, in putting forward the necessary measures and reacting to what the Polish government is doing.”Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, was prominent in calling for a calming of aggressive rhetoric that has characterised the dispute. Arriving in Brussels on Thursday before the summit, she said the 27 EU member states needed to find ways to “come together again”.EU countries voiced differing priorities as they consider how they should confront the Polish constitutional court ruling, a verdict considered a direct challenge to the union’s legal order.The dispute, after five years of back and forth between Warsaw and Brussels over challenges to judicial independence by the ruling Law and Justice party, or PiS, has raised questions over Poland’s future in the EU.During a two-hour discussion on the rule of law on Thursday night, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen reiterated that Brussels is weighing up using three tools in response to Warsaw’s behaviour.These include a legal challenge, a mechanism that could reduce EU funding for Poland and an extension to a sanctions process that could strip the country of its EU voting rights. The most important issue, von der Leyen stressed, was the threat to the independence of the judiciary in the country.That approach was widely supported. “It was good that so many expressed themselves more or less along the lines of the president,” said a senior EU diplomat, adding: “We would have liked this group to be bigger, but it is the way it is.”One EU official stressed that legal and institutional instruments were available and “could still be activated”, adding: “European Council members are convinced that the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary are absolutely fundamental.”However, many leaders also expressed their willingness to pursue political dialogue. One Polish official briefed on the talks said that they “appreciate the fact that serious leaders try to understand the sensitivity of the situation”.Asked to open the discussion on rule of law, Poland’s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki told his fellow leaders that Warsaw’s dispute with Brussels was not about ignoring EU law but challenging what he believes are examples of the bloc’s institutions wielding powers over member states that they have not been granted.While repeating many of his core arguments that Poland would not be “blackmailed” by the EU and that the commission had misinterpreted the Polish court’s ruling, he spoke in a far more conciliatory manner than in his belligerent speech to the European parliament on Tuesday, diplomats said.Merkel said the Poland issue was a symptom of a broader problem on how member states view the EU and how much sovereignty they are willing to hand over. “That is certainly not just an issue between Poland and the EU, it is also being discussed in other member states,” she said ahead of the talks.Her conciliatory tone was echoed by several other leaders. Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez said that while Poland needed to recognise the commission’s role as a guardian of the EU’s treaties, he was looking for a “constructive way to find a solution” to a very complex situation.Charles Michel, the European Council president, said the EU needed to be “firm” on rule of law principles, but also that “we need to engage in dialogue so we can achieve positive results”.The EU is far from united over what to do about Poland and there are also concerns over the respect of core union principles in several member states, including Hungary and Slovenia.Questions over the primacy of EU law have been raised in other countries, including Germany, where the constitutional court last year ruled that the European Court of Justice had acted beyond its competences in a case related to bond-buying by the European Central Bank.But Poland is the only country where the head of government has asked the constitutional court about the primacy of EU law.The summit also focused on the recent surge in European energy prices, the diverging trends in Covid-19 cases between EU member states, and the outlook for Europe’s trade policy. It continues on Friday with a planned discussion on migration and digital policy.Additional reporting by Guy Chazan in Berlin and Javier Espinoza in Brussels
128  Russia can increase gas supplies to Europe as soon as Germany approves the new Nord Stream 2 pipeline, President Vladimir Putin said, underlining Moscow’s conditions for help to resolve the continent’s energy crisis.Putin said Gazprom, the Kremlin’s gas monopoly, could increase flows by an extra 17.5bn cubic metres via the new pipeline “the day after tomorrow” if regulators approved it “tomorrow”.The amount, equal to roughly 10 per cent of the gas Russia shipped to Europe and Turkey in 2020, would provide significant additional supplies at a time of record prices in Europe, even before the pipe’s second line is fully filled in December.But it is also likely to provoke anger that Russia clearly believes it has gas in reserve but is making its delivery to Europe contingent on Nord Stream 2 being approved.The US and several eastern European countries say Russia wants to use the $10bn pipeline, which bypasses Ukraine, as a geopolitical weapon to increase the EU’s dependence on Moscow while costing Kyiv transit revenues from traditional supply routes.But Putin said EU energy policy was being made by “non-specialists” who were “deceiving voters” and said the world could avoid future crises if it focused on “fundamental projects” such as Nord Stream 2 instead of spot market trading.Russia has faced growing criticism in recent weeks because it has not made additional supplies to Europe available, despite hints from Putin that he would act to cool the crisis.Critics have blamed Russia for not making any additional sales of gas available to European customers this year, beyond those secured through long-term contracts. Gazprom has also let its own storage facilities in Europe fall to very low levels, heightening fears of shortages of supplies in the event of a cold winter.The surge in energy bills in Europe is expected to be high on the agenda at a summit of EU leaders that started in Brussels on Thursday.Putin blamed the gas crisis on what he said were short-sighted attempts by the EU to switch from long-term contracts to the spot market and increase the share of renewables in the energy mix.As a result, Putin argued, US and Middle Eastern liquefied natural gas producers had reduced supplies to Europe, which he claimed had created a shortage of 70bn cubic metres that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline’s planned capacity of 55bn cubic metres could help resolve.“When the Europeans set up their market principles, they were basing them on it being a high-end market. And it’s not — the gas went to Latin America and Asia,” he said. “What’s that got to do with Russia? This is the result handmade by the European Commission’s economic policy.”Putin said Gazprom had already increased supplies to Europe by 11bn cubic meters this year.Industry analysts have said that more Russian gas is flowing to Turkey, which Gazprom counts as Europe, than before the pandemic, but not into its main markets in western Europe, which have been traditionally supplied via Ukraine and lines through Poland.
129  Jens Weidmann, who this week announced his departure from the presidency of the Bundesbank after a decade-long term, played his role as the most prominent dissenting voice on the European Central Bank’s governing council admirably. Labelled by former ECB president Mario Draghi as nein zu allem, no to everything, Weidmann articulated the view of monetary hawks — that the ECB’s extraordinary policies were inflationary and damaging to market discipline — at the highest levels. He provided scepticism over the institution’s forays into areas such as preventing climate change.Yet during a decade of ad hoc responses to financial crises, the extension of extraordinary monetary policies and the creation of the joint EU recovery fund, at every stage the German establishment ultimately threw its support behind the single European currency and the policies embarked on by the ECB to keep it together. While chancellor Angela Merkel, who made those fateful decisions, will soon depart the scene as well, few now doubt the commitment of Europe’s largest economy to the single currency. That means Weidmann’s successor will matter a great deal less than the role once did to the future of the eurozone.Weidmann’s hawkish views, in keeping with many in his country and the reputation of the Bundesbank, meant he was often in the minority and would be passed over to become the next ECB president in favour of Christine Lagarde, with no prior experience of central banking. Still, to his considerable credit, he was a team player, often defending the ECB against unreasoned criticism in his home country. Critically, he rejected the potentially explosive assertion of the constitutional court that the ECB’s quantitative easing programme represented monetary financing.His successor is likely to be less hawkish. A decade of stubbornly low inflation in the eurozone, despite loose monetary policy, has damaged the case for monetary orthodoxy — in fact, in its latest strategy review the ECB integrated its “monetary analysis”, one of the last vestiges of the monetary targeting that built the German central bank’s reputation, with its “economic analysis”. The next Bundesbank president will be selected by a three-party coalition that includes the centre-left Social Democrats and the Greens alongside the pro-business liberals the Free Democrats. Negotiations over the future finance minister and the central bank chief are likely to be conducted in tandem.Whoever the coalition partners nominate as the next president of the Bundesbank, the most influential German monetary policymaker will instead be a member of the executive board of the ECB. That many are asking whether Isabel Schnabel, who currently has responsibility for the ECB’s market operations, would want to leave that role and become Bundesbank president reflects how power has fundamentally shifted between the Frankfurt-based institutions.Either way, Weidmann’s career showed that there was ultimately nothing for the eurozone’s institutions to fear from forceful dissent. Even while it annoyed Draghi, disagreement between members of the ECB’s governing board, which includes the head of the national central banks, did not prevent the ECB from acting decisively in moments of crisis. If anything, a loud voice reflecting the views of more hawkish member states, often in the north, helps build consensus and ensure that the institution — protected from political influence by international treaty — truly reflects the views of all it serves.
130  Turkey’s central bank has defied warnings from the business world and opposition parties by slashing its main interest rate despite rising inflation and an ailing currency.Bucking the global trend at a time when both developed economies and other emerging markets are adopting a hawkish stance, the bank lowered the cost of borrowing by a full 2 percentage points — a far deeper cut than the markets expected.The lira, which had already lost about 20 per cent of its value against the dollar this year prior to the announcement, fell a further 2 per cent on the news, hitting a fresh low of TL9.47 to the US dollar.Paul McNamara, a fund manager at asset manager GAM, said the decision to lower the one-week repo rate to 16 per cent was “either brave or foolhardy”, adding: “I strongly lean to the latter.”Thursday’s move came a week after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a notorious opponent of high interest rates who has asserted greater control over the nominally independent central bank, fired three members of its monetary policy committee. They included the only person to oppose a decision last month to cut rates.The Turkish president, whose view that high interest rates lead to inflation runs counter to established economic orthodoxy, has increasingly meddled in monetary policy as he consolidates his control over the Turkish state. He has pushed for rate cuts even at the cost of soaring inflation and turmoil in the financial markets.Ali Babacan, who served for years as Erdogan’s economy tsar before launching his own party in 2020, said on Thursday that the central bank had cut “under orders”.The bank has faced growing pressure from the country’s opposition, which has been buoyed by Erdogan’s declining poll ratings, to act in line with its independent mandate.Hours before Thursday’s announcement, Republican People’s party leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu reiterated a previous warning to the central bank that it must act in the public interest. “Dear bureaucrats,” he wrote on Twitter. “When taking decisions today, your guiding principle should be nothing but the welfare of our nation.”In the lead-up to the decision, Omer Koc, one of Turkey’s leading business tycoons, and the Turkish business association Tusiad issued public warnings of the harm being done by the spiralling exchange rate and runaway price rises.Meral Aksener, who leads a rightwing opposition party, described the latest move as “a great shame”, adding: “This great nation does not deserve this.”Viktor Szabo, an emerging markets portfolio manager at Abrdn, said that “the worst-case scenario” for the credibility of the central bank had played out. “There’s no one left there to stand up to Erdogan.”The decision to cut the interest rate for a second month in a row pushes the country’s real interest rate deep into negative territory, once annual inflation, which stood at almost 20 per cent in September, is taken into account.The move risks piling fresh pressure on the crisis-ridden lira and is likely to further deter vital foreign capital at a time when international investment in Turkey is close to its lowest point in the past 20 years, say analysts.In a further blow to the country’s ability to attract foreign capital, on Thursday the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global finance watchdog, added it to its “grey list” of nations subject to increased monitoring. Marcus Pleyer, FATF president, said Turkey had made “some progress across all areas of concern” in relation to its approach to combating money laundering and terrorist financing, but that “serious issues remain”.The central bank said in a statement accompanying its rate rise decision that there was “limited room” for further rate cuts before the end of the year.Haluk Burumcekci, an Istanbul-based independent analyst, said the statement signalled small reductions in the final two rate-setting meetings of the year but that “the door is open for additional rate cuts in the new year”.Phoenix Kalen, an emerging markets strategist at Société Générale, said the decision suggested Erdogan was planning to bring forward the next round of presidential and parliamentary elections, currently scheduled for 2023.Such a strategy might have short-term logic but the longer-term impact could be devastating to the Turkish economy and financial system, she warned.“If you’re looking at any longer timeframe . . . this decision is completely nonsensical,” she added. “You’re going to spur hyper inflation and dollarisation . . . You’re encouraging speculators to go after the currency. You’re going to hurt corporates, with all the FX denominated debt that they still have. From any medium-term perspective, it is really damaging to the monetary policy framework of the country and the financial stability.”
131  We are coming towards the end of the first year since Brexit came into force and the hunt is on to clarify the regulatory dividend from the UK’s departure from the EU.Lord David Frost announced in his Brexit opportunities paper in September that the government wanted to build on the work of the Taskforce on Innovation, Growth & Regulatory Reform (TIGRR) that was chaired by former Conservative party leader and arch-Brexiter Iain Duncan Smith.Among the areas listed for investigation were reforms to the agri-environment sector, including “the regulation of innovative genetic techniques following our departure from the EU”, which includes gene editing (not to be confused with genetic modification, or GM, gene editing speeds up only what could have been achieved through traditional breeding or which could occur naturally).The question now is how this big picture political commitment to re-regulating (if not de-regulating) plays out on the ground, in a multi-way conversation between scientific researchers, investors, industry, regulators and the government. The Britain after Brexit briefing took a sample of this conversation this week by attending an “innovation” lunch at the Palace of Westminster hosted by BASF, the German chemicals giant, and Owen Paterson, the former environment secretary and long-time critic of the EU.It was an instructive few hours, partly because it demonstrated how immature that conversation is, as the UK gropes towards that promised better future.Paterson opened with some crowd-pleasing bombast. “It’s not that our civil servants say ‘no’,” he roared. “It’s that they never — ever, ever, ever, ever — say ‘yes’.”There was some sympathy for this view around the table. Industry gets frustrated at the lack of speed in Whitehall and, almost as importantly, the lack of predictability in regulation. Industry often just wants to know what hoops it needs to jump through, even if it doesn’t much like the hoops. “Just tell us what we need to do,” as one boss put it. And the record isn’t great. One artificial intelligence company that uses satellite photographs to help farmers and businesses to audit green measures and better target pesticide usage reckoned the post-Brexit UK government had missed a “golden opportunity” to steal a global march in that field.An executive argued that if the government had taken a bolder, speedier approach to implementing its environmental land management schemes three or four years ago it would have made a big difference to their business, but the momentum dissipated in Whitehall bureaucracy.Former regulators also agreed that more speed was required. Dave Bench, the chief executive of the Crop Protection Association who until June last year was a veteran of the Health and Safety Executive leading on chemical regulation post-Brexit, was among those banging the drum for more speed.The UK needed to “fix the slowness” in its regulatory approvals, he said. That means the UK system should start to favour the “innovation principle” over the “precautionary principle”, which Bench said would require his former colleagues to shake off the “EU culture” that he said still deeply permeated the UK regulatory bureaucracy after three decades implementing edicts from Brussels.But for all the tub-thumping — and there are plenty of these kinds of conversations going on at the moment — it is still sometimes difficult to discern what, exactly, is the government’s overall strategy, and what it is intended to deliver.Paterson, an MP from Shropshire, which is a rural English county with strong farming traditions, cited the fact that BASF had moved its potato blight GM trials to the US and said it would be a “failure” of post-Brexit Britain if those trials didn’t return.And yet Thomas Birk, the BASF managing director for UK and Ireland, is doubtful that the British public will embrace GM technologies any time soon, given the antipathy of UK public opinion towards the subject. Paterson may be waiting for some time.More realistic is that the UK could approve chemicals faster than the EU, which might bring incremental benefits for UK farmers and the environment — and potentially increase the attractiveness of the UK investment climate at the margin. One concrete example of this in action was Revysol, a high-end BASF fungicide used in crop protection that entered into the regulatory clearance process in the EU and the UK at the same time shortly after Brexit but emerged much faster from the UK system, despite the same rules being applied to register it. It should be possible for the UK regulators to be faster than the EU in pushing registrations through the system — maybe up to two years faster, it was suggested — although it’s worth noting that during EU membership the UK regulator was already faster than other EU regulators anyway in approving chemicals, according to Bench.The other EU-sized elephant in the room, as far as Brexit was concerned, was the reality that companies such as BASF were going to have to regulate to EU levels anyway in order to access the single market. That ultimately places limits on the regulatory arbitrage opportunity for the UK. This is so even when the EU is about to make its own regulation of chemicals more onerous as it rolls out the implementation of its new Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability (CSS), which was adopted by Brussels last week.The UK could take a lighter touch as it considers how to regulate new chemicals coming on to the market, but chemicals are truly global products. If BASF is having to do the work to comply with EU standards anyway, the utility of a lighter UK standard is marginal.And indeed, to the point about needing speed and clarity, the UK chemicals industry is still waiting for Defra to clarify how exactly it must register existing chemicals after Brexit following the UK’s decision to quit the EU’s REACH chemicals database and set up its own copycat version, which the industry says it will take £1bn to build. So much for nimbleness.Ultimately for BASF’s Birk there will be some benefits out there for the UK, but to access them the government needs to think how it better integrates its international trade and domestic regulatory policy in order to achieve an end-goal that is still in need of some definition.Birk attended this week’s Global Investment Summit and listened closely to Boris Johnson’s typically ebullient but scattergun speech, which he observed seemed to want to be everything to everyone.He came away with the strong impression that while at a narrow tactical level (push for nimbler regulation) the UK approach might be clear, at the strategic level it was much harder to discern a grand plan.“The UK as a country needs to decide what it is we really want. What do we want to achieve, in order to create an environment that is positive and innovative?” he said, before adding as an afterthought: “Does that mean the manna will be falling from the sky? Probably not.”This week, as my colleague Valentina Romei reported, the Office for National Statistics injected some fresh statistical meat into the debate over UK lorry driver numbers.The ONS found that, since June 2017 when numbers peaked at 321,000, the profession has shed 53,000 drivers — of which 12,000 were from the EU.But the other half (or more accurately three-quarters) of the story is the number of older UK drivers that have come off the road — of the balance of 41,000 drivers that have left, 34,000 came from the 46 to 55 age group.What does this tell us? Well as trade group bosses told the BEIS select committee this week, it puts the UK industry in a pretty bad place. When you add EU departures (which are no longer being replenished because of Brexit) to the continued decline in UK driver numbers, it is clear that solutions are some way off.A very similar situation is happening in construction and the meat processing industry, where structural shortages of skilled labour that were visible before Brexit and Covid-19 have become acute, with no obvious shortcut to a healthy balance.Duncan Buchanan, director of policy at the Road Haulage Association, told MPs that things “are not visibly getting better at this stage”, and the government’s offer of 5,000 “Christmas” visas that expire on February 28 would make no difference. Indeed, as Buchanan observed of the scheme that is simply too short-term to attract drivers: “If you were designing a visa system to fail, you’d design it something like this.”There are solutions, but they require patience and strategic thinking. Clearing the backlog of driver tests, and expediting the route to driving an articulated lorry (announced this week) will help to a point. Logistics UK, the trade group, is hopeful some benefits from this will feed through towards the end of next year, although The Grocer reports that hundreds of HGV testing slots are going unused every week, which doesn’t inspire total confidence.But longer term, there are deep structural issues that will need to be addressed — like ending the snobbery over “level 2” qualifications that the government has arguably fuelled with its sneering attitude to “low skilled labour”. Little wonder that not many British kids want to sign up to be lorry drivers, and those that do, often don’t stick at the job, according to Buchanan.Remember, as Buchanan pointed out, the profession has to compete for drivers with other (often more attractive) day jobs, like being a delivery driver or refuse lorry driver, that get you home each night.Better truck-stop facilities are key to encourage those drivers to spend nights away from home. The government pays lip service to better truck stops, but has failed materially to back this with action, according to Sarah Laouadi, head of international policy at Logistics UK. As Buchanan observed, when it comes to planning, the truck parking stops are often the first thing to be chopped in any development, because they take up a lot of space and don’t bring in anything like the revenues that other elements do. As a result, the market alone is not delivering them — as this great exposition of the problem by Shane Brennan of the Cold Chain Federation explains.Laouadi of Logistics UK recalls that ministers announced in 2018 that they were launching a work programme aimed at delivering an additional 1,500 overnight parking spaces — but these have yet to be delivered.The industry says it is committed to addressing these issues, but it will take time, both to build the infrastructure and engineer a cultural shift in attitudes towards driving. Which is why the industry wants temporary visas to cover the shortfall, or an adjustment to the Shortage Occupation List that lowers the immigration bar for scarce jobs. But for now — as Tom Pursglove, the immigration minister, told MPs this week — the government remains unmoved.And, finally, three unmissable Brexit storiesAngela Merkel has intervened to ease tensions between the EU and Poland. Speaking ahead of today’s European Council meeting in Brussels the German chancellor said member states needed to find ways to “come together again”.Jonathan Powell, the former chief British negotiator in Northern Ireland, wrote in the FT this week that the UK and EU could be negotiating for years or even decades and that David Frost’s approach to the talks “is risking a full-scale trade war”.The only thing quicker than the rise of Sebastian Kurz was his downfall. As Austrian state prosecutors investigate corruption at the heart of his government, Sam Jones explains the events that led to the spectacular fall of the 35-year-old former chancellor in this big read.
132  Constructive ambiguity. Compartmentalisation. Knowing and not knowing. Benign fictions. Lies. Hypocrisy. These are just some of the themes of We Don’t Know Ourselves, Fintan O’Toole’s sparkling “personal history of Ireland since 1958”. In it, the writer and journalist charts his country’s “dilemma of modernity”: how to achieve economic transformation while maintaining the country’s distinctive culture. In short, how to gain the world without losing your Irish soul.This was the great fear of the 1950s and 1960s when many in Ireland realised something must be done yet were worried about the consequences. The country appeared in great peril: the safety valve of emigration had long siphoned off the malcontents and those without prospects, but now there were concerns that the “vanishing Irish” would emigrate themselves into oblivion. Emigration buttressed social conservatism. The economy, dominated by raw agricultural exports, was in a state of suspended development. But what would come of opening the Pandora’s box of economic change and progress?The connectivity of modernisation — European Economic Community membership, television, social liberalisation — brought seismic waves to Ireland’s shores that took time to fully break. When they did, everything changed. Even before the 1950s, Irish politics and society, as O’Toole shows, could only function through widespread cognitive dissonance. Modernisation only widened that gulf.Everyone knew there was a vast megalith of cruelty entombed in the industrial schools, Magdalene laundries and mother-and-baby homes. Everyone knew there were priests who abused children. By the 1980s, everyone knew there were corrupt politicians. Everyone knew a woman who had “gone to England” to have an abortion, even if they didn’t know they knew her. Everyone knew someone who was gay. Everyone knew the Celtic Tiger was unsustainable.What O’Toole shows, with precision, colour and empathy, was how it all broke down — slowly at first but then with bewildering speed. Ireland had to face the things it had always known, but never wanted to acknowledge. The apparent reversals of the 1980s — a resurgent religious conservatism, economic downturn, a new post-hunger strike phase of conflict in Northern Ireland — seem in retrospect a case of reculer pour mieux sauter, retreat in order to advance further later. The comfortable certainties of Irish nationalism, the protectionist economic impulses, the cattle-like exporting of people, the extraordinary place of the Catholic Church in all levels of Irish life: all of these were overturned by the Celtic Tiger years.This is not a memoir in any conventional sense, yet in the first half we encounter O’Toole as a Zelig-like figure with an amusingly personal chain of connections to the great events and characters — from serving as altar boy to the imperious and omnipotent John Charles McQuaid, Archbishop of Dublin, to a chance meeting with the composer Seán Ó Riada whose Cór Cúil Aodha choir revolutionised Irish music.One uncle served as a UN peacekeeper in the Congo, while his neighbours on the Crumlin housing estate of his childhood included Phil Lynott, Thin Lizzy frontman, and Larry Dunne, a survivor of the industrial schools and a drug dealer who brought heroin into 1970s Dublin. Irish readers will not be surprised by this, but for international readers it underscores the intimacies of Irish political, cultural and social worlds.The author as witness to history disappears somewhat in the second half of the book, with a few memorable exceptions. O’Toole is a helpless passenger as soon-to-be disgraced Bishop Eamonn Casey drove at 120mph in his Lancia sports car. He’s in the audience at Eurovision 1994, when Riverdance suggested, in a burst of national and diasporic joy, that Ireland had indeed achieved economic modernisation and maintained its distinctive culture. And then there is his first summer job, shifting stock at Dunnes Stores alongside the boss’s son, Ben Dunne, whose cocaine-fuelled meltdown in Florida in 1992 began the crumbling of the whole financial house of cards for Ireland’s most controversial Taoiseach, Charles Haughey.Northern Ireland is relatively absent. O’Toole is more interested in the impact of the conflict on the Irish political imagination, and largely echoes Conor Cruise O’Brien in his depiction of ghosts — hunger strikers especially — haunting Irish political life. Most of Ireland was pretty good at ignoring them, it must be said. He presents a scathing critique of the Irish body politic in the 1980s and 1990s, encapsulated by a Byzantine story of beef exports to Saddam Hussein’s Baghdad that brought down a government for reasons nobody seems really to understand.There are villains, for sure: the avarice of Haughey is almost incredible, while he castigated the Irish for “living beyond our means”. The Catholic hierarchy that moved abusive priests from parish to parish. Bishop Casey, who fathered a child, embezzled diocesan money for his son’s upkeep, and fled the country. The brazen bankers and useless regulators.But even there O’Toole avoids blanket condemnation or stern moralising. He is capable of constructive ambiguity himself. The quiet heroes of We Don’t Know Ourselves are the Irish people, who O’Toole shows to have been ahead of their political and spiritual leaders in being ready to face the contradictions that underpinned national life.This is an uplifting, almost playful read, with suggestive analysis lying beneath skilful vignettes. It is a story of a slow social and economic revolution; whether political transformation follows, remains to be seen. Ireland is now largely a multicultural, liberal, society. One wonders whether this liberalisation might in turn become the new myth underpinning Irish identity in the 21st century. O’Toole is slow to make any overt critiques of the “new Ireland”, but there are hints if one reads closely enough.We Don’t Know Ourselves: A Personal History of Ireland Since 1958 by Fintan O’Toole, Head of Zeus £9.99, 624 pagesCaoimhe Nic Dháibhéid is senior lecturer in modern history at the University of SheffieldJoin our online book group on Facebook at FT Books Café
133  For more than 10 years, Viktor Orban has provided a template for aspiring autocrats in the EU and beyond. Hungary’s prime minister has shown how to transform a liberal democracy into an illiberal regime by methods that fall short of outright violence, maintain a facade of pluralism and meet little effective resistance in or outside his country. Now, however, the Hungarian opposition thinks it has found a formula for reversing the process.Mobilising a melange of anti-Orban voters, six opposition parties held a two-round primary to choose a candidate to compete against the prime minister in next year’s parliamentary elections. The winner was Peter Marki-Zay, an independent conservative who until a few weeks ago was as little known as the southern town of Hodmezovasarhely where he serves as mayor. Yet the political experiment of which Marki-Zay is the unlikely symbol promises to hold lessons for lapsed or embattled democracies everywhere.Should it fail, it would secure a fourth consecutive term for Orban and intensify the EU’s dilemma of how to cope with strongmen rulers who cock a snook at its values and rules. Should it succeed, it would suggest that pro-democracy forces can get rid of autocrats without recourse to force or lawlessness, as long as they put aside their differences for this common goal.There are encouraging precedents for the Hungarian experiment. Earlier this month, in parliamentary elections that turned into a de facto referendum on the rule of Czech prime minister Andrej Babis, a disparate set of opposition forces formed two coalitions that did just enough to win a combined victory. In communist times, Poland’s pro-democracy opposition created the Solidarity Citizens’ Committee, which won a landslide victory in 1989 and triggered the end of one-party rule. One year earlier, Chile’s opposition parties formed a united front that defeated General Augusto Pinochet in a plebiscite.Hungary’s opposition itself has achieved some success with the tactics of a united front. That is how Marki-Zay won his mayoral election in 2018 and how, one year later, another opposition candidate was elected mayor of Budapest. However, any peaceful transfer of national power will depend on a free, fair vote and will require Orban and his ruling Fidesz party to respect the result. Neither condition is assured.Orban amended Hungary’s electoral law in 2012 in a way that tilts the scales towards Fidesz. According to independent pollsters, the united opposition is neck and neck with Fidesz in opinion surveys but, even if it edged ahead, would struggle to win a majority of parliamentary seats. Moreover, Orban has systematically undermined media independence, making it a forlorn hope that the opposition’s campaign will receive impartial coverage.Would Orban step down if the election were free and he lost? In a 2016 interview, he forecast: “I shall remain in politics for the next 15 to 20 years — sometimes in the front line, sometimes in the third line.” It was a prediction ambiguous enough to imply he might seek to pull the strings of power even if he were no longer prime minister. It may explain why Orban has taken steps to seal his control of Hungary’s media regulatory authority and the chief prosecutor’s office, both in loyalist hands, until long after the 2022 elections.All the same, Orban and his supporters appear rattled. They had hoped the opposition would select as its leader a left-leaning candidate such as Klara Dobrev, wife of Ferenc Gyurcsany, Hungary’s discredited former premier. Instead they face Marki-Zay, who will campaign as an anti-corruption outsider with ties neither to the Orban era nor to the socialist shambles that preceded it. Can he win? It is surely dawning on Marki-Zay that, even if he does, the task of de-Orbanising Hungary will be no less formidable than dethroning Orban in the first place.tony.barber@ft.com
134  The big story of the week in the EU is the showdown between Poland and the union’s institutions and other member states, especially those contributing to the communal budgets from which Warsaw is a net recipient. The long debate in the European parliament on Tuesday will be followed by a confrontation between country leaders on Thursday and Friday.The European Commission is under pressure by parliamentarians and many member states to get tougher on both Poland and Hungary, which are defying values they seemed to commit themselves to when they joined the EU. Commission president Ursula von der Leyen seems to have gotten the message — she toughened her rhetoric in her European parliament speech, which listed the three tools at the EU’s disposal: suing the governments in breach of treaty commitments, financial sanctions and the Article 7 procedure that can curtail a country’s voting rights in the EU.The general sense is that only the second tool has a realistic chance of making Poland’s de facto leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski and Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orban change course. The third can be blocked by two countries that support one another; the first takes time and Warsaw, at least, is increasingly showing a willingness to defy the European Court of Justice’s judgments. So it is useful to ask how vulnerable to financial pressure (the second tool) Poland and Hungary really are.To start, look at the economic record of both governments. The chart below shows Poland and Hungary’s impressive long-term catch-up with the EU average income per capita. This has been as quick under their current EU-bashing governments as under any previous one — indeed, in the case of Orban, his return to office in 2010 heralded the end of a period of relative stagnation. Both countries held up as well as the EU average during the pandemic.A second important point to note is how the fruits of this catch-up growth have been distributed. Both countries have reduced poverty rates since 2015. In Poland, inequality has gone down in the same period (but not in Hungary).Third, some of this has to be attributed not just to good luck but to economic and social policy, some of which has flown in the face of conventional policy thinking. In Poland, the signature policy of the Law and Justice party (PiS) was a very generous subsidy to poorer (and often rural) families with children — the party’s clear political base. Hungary, meanwhile, has pursued a policy of large minimum wage increases, partly compensated with cuts in social security taxes, in the hope of higher productivity as businesses adjust.In addition, both Poland and Hungary have reasonably strong public finances, with low public debt burdens compared with western Europe.At first glance, all this could be taken to mean that they can resist financial pressure from the EU should the commission withhold or curtail payments under the new recovery and resilience facility (RRF) or the pre-existing structural fund transfers. Both countries are certainly able to borrow to fill any budgetary gaps — indeed, Hungary issued a record amount of foreign currency bonds last month in part to bridge-finance RRF payments for a recovery plan that Brussels has not yet been willing to approve.But I think the better interpretation is this: the fact that these economies have been well-managed suggests that both Kaczynski’s and Orban’s support depends a lot more on economic performance than we tend to think. Their ideological appeal, which is what we pay most attention to, has not yet been tested. The pandemic was a shock, of course, but it was a shock that hit every country and, as the first chart shows, both Poland and Hungary have recovered from it as well as the rest of Europe.But the scale of EU transfers is so big that if they stop flowing, the effect cannot be staved off for very long. EU money spent in Poland amounts to about 4 per cent of its national income; for Hungary it is closer to 5 per cent. The one-off RRF grants will again amount to about 5 per cent of their annual national incomes. Will their strong electoral support survive a sustained underperformance because of a withdrawal of EU financial support? We do not know — again, this has not been tested. But we may be about to find out. There are good reasons to think Brussels’ financial weapon can hurt enough, and fast enough, to be as effective as opponents of Warsaw and Budapest think.
135  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.It’s an end of an era — and not just as today’s EU summit will most likely be Angela Merkel’s last one as Germany’s chancellor, after 106 such meetings she took part in over the past 16 years. Yesterday a second German figure, and Merkel ally, Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann announced he was stepping down. Bad news for fiscal hawks, as his successor is likely to espouse more mainstream views.We’ll look at how Poland has become a topic of discussion for EU leaders today, despite council chief Charles Michel’s assiduous efforts to avoid it — and what else will be on the menu tonight.In European parliament news, a small glimmer of hope for the bloc’s long overdue tech regulation update is emerging as lawmakers are tentatively agreeing on their position for upcoming negotiations with member states.And in Romania, Dacian Ciolos, who left his position as a leader of the liberal Renew group in the European parliament to return to domestic politics, has failed in his attempt to become prime minister, all while record-high Covid-19 infections and deaths have brought the country’s health system to the brink.The EU clash with Poland over judicial independence will hang heavily over the summit table in Brussels today, even if council president Charles Michel has insisted in his invitation letter to leaders that he wants only to “touch on” the rule of law topic.Member states are determined to air their differences over how hard to push Warsaw on its defiance of EU standards, writes Sam Fleming in Brussels. Benelux countries in particular have been arguing this week that the European Commission should make use of its conditionality mechanism, which permits funds to be withheld for rule of law violations that threaten the EU budget.Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel, on the other hand, has been among those counselling caution — and she will in what may be her final EU summit adopt her traditional role of EU healer-in-chief as she seeks ways of bringing Warsaw back into the fold.She won’t be alone in advocating caution. “It is not the case of ganging up on Poland,” insisted one senior EU diplomat. That said, “it’s difficult to see how action could be avoided at some point down the road”.It will be commission president Ursula von der Leyen who decides how to deploy the EU’s legal toolkit in the Polish case. While she talked a tough game at the European parliament’s Strasbourg session this week, in reality the commission president can be expected to spurn calls in the European parliament for a rapid escalation of the conflict.In particular, von der Leyen is likely to hold back from deploying the new conditionality mechanism anytime soon, preferring instead to wait for a European Court of Justice ruling on a challenge brought by Hungary and Poland before deciding to pull the trigger.Ahead of that, Brussels will turn to other, less-potent tools such as an infringement action over Poland’s constitutional tribunal ruling challenging the primacy of EU law.The focus of the opening hours of the summit is intended to be on other topics — namely energy prices and the Covid-19 crisis. Surging costs of electricity provide a menacing backdrop to the summit, as politicians come under intense pressure to ease the pain of soaring household bills. Energy prices are up more than 17 per cent year on year, according to the latest inflation data.The commission’s recent “toolbox” of options for an improved functioning of energy markets is up for discussion, as are national measures aimed at easing the pain. Some member states are likely to push for more favourable treatment of nuclear power and gas in the planned “taxonomy” of green energy, which as the FT reported yesterday looks likely to get delayed until at least the end of the year.Leaders will also discuss the surging Covid-19 cases in some EU member states, as they address sharp divergences in vaccination rates. Bulgaria and Romania are among the countries of concern, as both have cumulative full-vaccination rates that are less than half the EU total. The question here was how to address vaccine hesitancy and the role of disinformation, said one EU official.Later in the evening Michel wants to tackle another divisive topic — namely how to reinvigorate the EU’s trade agenda at a time when some member states, among them France, want to focus on enhancing the union’s “strategic autonomy” and reducing its dependence on other economies. It could be a long night.Global banks have extended a total of $119bn of financing to 20 major agribusinesses linked to deforestation over the past five years, according to Global Witness campaign group. Deutsche Bank, US and Chinese banks were among the biggest funders. (More here)There’s a glimmer of hope that the bickering among MEPs over the bloc’s new digital rules will come to an end soon, writes Javier Espinoza in Brussels.The EU has not updated the rules for tech companies active in the internal market in more than two decades and two pieces of regulation that would change that have been bogged down in discussions both in the European parliament and among member states.At stake are the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which would define and restrict the anti-competitive behaviour of big online platforms, and the Digital Services Act, which is looking into obligations tech companies have when it comes to illegal content and disinformation.But some progress was made when the European parliament’s committee on economic and monetary affairs struck a deal earlier this week on the competition aspects of the DMA.Stephanie Yon-Courtin, a liberal MEP from Renew and vice-chair of the committee, outlined the deal to Europe Express:The agreement still needs to be confirmed in a vote next week but it means that at least one of the stumbling blocks is now out of the way. As soon as member states also agree on a common position, negotiations on the DMA can begin between the European parliament, the commission, and member states.Still, don’t assume things will get sorted imminently.Andreas Schwab, the lead MEP leading the debate on the DMA, is still fighting with the Socialists over who the DMA should target. Schwab wants the regulation to target only the very large platforms (Google, Facebook, Amazon for instance), while the Socialists want the regulation to also include companies such as Booking, Netflix and Spotify.Even if the Socialists would get their way now, the criteria are likely to get narrowed down again once three-way negotiations between the EU institutions begin, most likely in the first months of 2022, as the French EU presidency has made digital regulation one of its highest priorities.Romania’s parliament yesterday voted against a tentative new government ran by liberal politician Dacian Ciolos, prolonging a political crisis that also hampers the country’s ability to handle Europe’s worst coronavirus outbreak, writes Marton Dunai in Bucharest.The government of now-caretaker premier Florin Citu lost a confidence vote last month just as the fourth wave of the pandemic began to ramp up in the country, leading to a triple crisis in which political uncertainty, rising energy prices and skyrocketing infections exacerbate an already precarious situation.Romania registered nearly 19,000 new infections on Tuesday and 574 deaths, the highest figures since the beginning of the pandemic as the country struggles to raise its vaccination rate which is just 36 per cent, while the EU average is above 70 per cent.Soaring energy prices and spiking inflation — which has topped an annual 6 per cent in September — are also creating a budding economic crisis, analysts warn. The central bank delivered a surprise quarter-point rate increase to combat that earlier this month.President Klaus Iohannis, who previously had strongly backed Citu, appointed Ciolos, leader of a small liberal party, who failed yesterday to gather a majority in the parliament — leading to speculation that Iohannis wanted him to fail and is planning to give Citu a second chance.Iohannis called meetings with all major parties today and he was expected to name another premier-designate. If that second candidate fails to form a government, Romania for the first time since the second world war will hold early elections — a process that is likely to drag out the political uncertainty for several more months.Analysts question the wisdom of reappointing Citu. “The incumbent prime minister is not part of the solution, he is part of the problem,” said political analyst Ion Ionita. “To resolve the crisis, the president must give up his favourite.”
136  The European Central Bank is pushing banks to add hundreds of extra staff and billions of extra capital to their post-Brexit operations in continental Europe.One of the big surprises of the UK leaving the EU was how few jobs moved from the City to the European mainland, with Financial Times research showing only a minimal reduction of London bank jobs in recent years against predictions that tens of thousands of jobs would have to relocate.But bank executives, lawyers and supervisors all told the FT that the ECB is becoming increasingly forceful in its demands that lenders move more resources to the continent to run their European businesses.The demands affect banks from across the world which have traditionally used London as their hub to provide key services to clients across the EU.The fresh push is partly linked to the ECB’s recent decision to end temporary pandemic-era reprieves it granted banks on their timetable for moving staff and capital to the EU. One person familiar with the change said the ECB had been “realistic in light of the impediments to geographic moves, and granted extensions, but now that is over”.Disparities in different banks’ approaches — and shortcomings in some — have been highlighted by a continuing “desk-mapping” review of the beefed-up continental offices that banks are using to serve their EU clients after Brexit.Bankers and lawyers also said the ECB was taking a tougher approach than expected to the longstanding issue of the location of risk management staff overseeing EU trades, and how much capital the EU entities must have.One executive said his bank would have to move hundreds more people than they expected because of the approach the ECB was taking to back-to-back models, which allow banks to offset EU trades with their London entities and effectively manage the risk from the UK.“We’re ramping up our European model enormously,” he said, adding that capital would also be increased as the ECB got “more directive”. A director of the EU entity of another large bank said the ECB’s approach was “certainly stricter” than expected.“It’s not stricter than the letter of what was agreed, but there was a perception that, ‘surely they can’t mean that, surely they’ll see reason once we get under way’,” he said. “Turns out they did mean that, and they’re pretty good at enforcing it.”One lawyer said the ECB’s approach to his clients was so severe that some smaller banks would probably have to re-evaluate the business they did in Europe, since the cost of their operations would be so much higher than expected. A second lawyer said his clients were seeing similar pressure.The renewed demands risk increasing tensions with the Bank of England, which earlier this year asked lenders to seek its approval before relocating more jobs or operations to the EU, the FT reported. The BoE is concerned its European counterparts are asking for relocations that are not necessary for financial stability in an attempt to poach business from London.The ECB declined to comment, but a person familiar with its approach said the build-up of banks’ EU operations was “a journey”. “There’s a constant discussion with banks to get them to follow through on their commitments,” the person added.The supervisor’s uncompromising position was underlined by Edouard Fernandez-Bollo, an ECB supervisory board member, who said last month that “empty shell institutions are not acceptable in the euro area”. He added: “Activities and services involving EU clients should be carried out predominantly within the EU.”Another bank executive stressed that the ECB’s reviews were continuing and that his bank was arguing the importance of not “compartmentalising” its EU and UK businesses in a way that was inefficient. “It’s very sensitive,” he said, adding that there could also be a political dimension to what the banks are ultimately asked to do.Additional reporting by Owen Walker in London
137  As Europe hurtles towards an angry showdown with Poland over the primacy of EU law, one politician is trying harder than most to slam on the brakes — Angela Merkel.Speaking on Monday, the German chancellor said the bloc must find solutions that “everyone can live with”. The task of the coming weeks was to reach a compromise that embodies “respect for all member states while not allowing any deviation from our founding principles”.The stance represents a typical exercise in Merkel emollience, just as Europe faces an increasingly bitter confrontation of law between Brussels and Poland’s conservative-nationalist government.The EU is preparing to act against Poland in the wake of a ruling by the country’s top judicial tribunal saying parts of EU law are incompatible with the country’s constitution. With many in the European Parliament calling on the commission to withhold money Poland is due to receive from the Covid-19 recovery fund, the country’s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki accused the EU earlier this week of speaking the language of “financial blackmail”.Merkel will reprise today the role of mediator she has often played in her 16 years as chancellor when EU leaders gather in Brussels for a meeting that is likely to be dominated by the dispute with Poland. But there is a big difference this time — Merkel is on the way out and this is likely to be the last EU summit she will ever attend.Governments across Europe are wondering what her retirement means for the future of Europe and what changes the new government in Berlin will bring to German policy.Many in the new coalition now forming in Berlin — an unprecedented alliance of social democrats, greens and liberals led by the current finance minister, Olaf Scholz — have been eager to emphasise continuity. But there are also calls for change and for a fresh approach, especially on eastern Europe.Some accuse Merkel of appeasing the “illiberal democracies” of the east and deliberately shielding strongmen like Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban.“The way Merkel spent years cosying up to the Orbans of Europe and playing down their kind of politics has wrought long-term damage on the EU and its foundations in the rule of law,” says Franziska Brantner, the German Greens’ spokeswoman on Europe.There are also leading voices among the coalition parties calling for Germany — and Europe — to be less conciliatory in its approach to Russia and China than has been the case during the Merkel years.Yet there are also fears that a tougher German stance could end up deepening divisions between east and west and increase the risk of conflicts escalating into crises.Merkel’s admirers say her diplomatic skills were often vital to warding off damaging clashes and healing divisions. She has “exactly the qualities you need to bridge the different points of view and different biographies of nations,” Jean-Claude Juncker, the former president of the European Commission, tells the Financial Times. “She never made a difference between east and west, south and north — she listened to everyone, which explains part of her success in Europe.”Some worry about the gap she’ll leave behind. “I’m afraid there’s no one to replace her, be it in the EU or Germany, and that’s a problem,” says Linas Linkevicius, Lithuania’s former foreign minister.Nevertheless, others play down the impact of Merkel’s departure. Juncker insists that her successor as German chancellor is likely to continue the role she played in EU affairs, and avoid a sharp change in European policy. “The EU is never led by one single person,” he insists.There is one region, however, where Merkel’s absence will be felt especially keenly — eastern Europe. She always fostered close ties to Orban and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, leader of Poland’s Law and Justice party (PIS) and the country’s de facto leader, despite deep disagreements over policy.Merkel also strongly resisted attempts by some in the EU — particularly the French — to create a kind of two-speed Europe, with a vanguard of like-minded nations moving ahead towards closer integration and leaving more Eurosceptic countries like Poland behind.“She understood the sensitivities and the mentality of the east Europeans better than anyone,” says Dalia Grybauskaite, the former president of Lithuania. “She understood that after the Soviet occupation we’re very sensitive to any demonstration of force — we’re ready to talk but we don’t just fulfil orders.”Within Germany, however, many think Merkel was too indulgent towards Hungary and Poland. It’s a view held by many in Scholz’s SPD, which narrowly won last month’s election. Katarina Barley, a leading Social Democrat and vice-president of the European Parliament, says she now expects a change of direction on relations with Poland.Merkel’s approach — “dialogue, building bridges, no confrontation” — was out of date, she told news magazine Der Spiegel. “The new German government will recognise that dialogue is important, but . . . in this case it’s not enough,” she said. “We now need tougher measures.”But it might take some time for Germany’s new leaders to agree a coherent approach on eastern Europe. The SPD, Greens and liberal Free Democrats (FDP) are strange bedfellows with fundamental disagreements over fiscal policy, the role of the state and climate change. Some in Berlin worry that they will be too wrapped up with resolving their ideological differences to engage with the outside world.“The new government will have three parties, two of which haven’t been in power for years, and their focus will very much be on domestic issues,” says Christoph Heusgen, Merkel’s senior foreign policy adviser from 2005-17.The change of guard at the chancellery comes with Germany facing multiple global threats — an increasingly assertive China under Xi Jinping, a bolder Russia, and a US administration that is pulling back from several regions to focus on restraining Beijing.“Germany must play a more active role in the world, and Merkel has been doing that,” says Heusgen. “But will the new government do the same? Do they know what huge tasks await them on the international stage, the expectations from around the world? Are they prepared to engage?”The new coalition partners insist they are, but have signalled they will have different priorities to Merkel. The Greens, for example, favour a foreign policy less driven by Germany’s economic interests and the needs of big business: they want a much more robust approach to China, confronting Beijing over human rights abuses in Xinjiang and the crackdown in Hong Kong. They also want Berlin to stand up more to Russia, which they accuse of “endangering democracy, stability and peace in the EU”.According to Heusgen, that’s not enough. Other parts of the world like the western Balkans, eastern Europe, Libya and the Sahel will also require Berlin’s urgent attention. “Germany must take on this active role in the world, because no one else in Europe will,” he says.Meanwhile, Merkel’s departure comes with elections fast approaching that could prove fateful for the European project. Emmanuel Macron will seek a second term as president in April and polls suggest he has a good chance of victory — although he’s no shoo-in with French politics in such a volatile state. Defeat for Macron would deprive Germany of one of its closest allies.Italy will elect a new parliament by 2023, and the fear in Berlin is that with no party behind him, Mario Draghi, the former head of the ECB and current prime minister, may be eased out of power, ushering in a new era of instability in the EU’s third-largest economy.Already, some in Berlin are worrying about Germany’s relationship with its allies in the Baltics and the Visegrad group of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, one of the main pillars of German foreign policy under Merkel. “[Those countries’] biggest concern will be: “Who’ll worry about us when Merkel goes?”” says one German official.Relations between Germany and the EU’s eastern member states were not always as cordial as he suggests. Hungary, Poland and others accused Merkel of splitting the EU in 2015-16 when she tried to persuade them to take in some of the 1m asylum seekers that had crossed into Germany during the refugee crisis. Her support for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline has also proven divisive, with eastern European states accusing her of selling out Ukraine and increasing the continent’s dependence on Russian gas.But for Grybauskaite, none of that detracts from the positive aspects of Merkel’s approach to Europe. “The younger generation of politicians in Germany and the EU see politics in terms of single issues, like climate change,” she says. “Merkel represents a generation who really saw the big picture.”Part of that big picture is now a dispute between the EU and Poland that risks spiralling out of control. The disagreement over the Polish constitutional court’s controversial ruling earlier this month is just the latest twist in a conflict that has been dragging on for five years. It has its roots in legal changes introduced by PiS that include a new disciplinary regime allowing judges to be punished for the content of their rulings.The stand-off could hardly be more sensitive for Germany, given the fraught history of conflict between the two countries. The prospect of Poland quitting the EU and the German-Polish frontier becoming the bloc’s external border is viewed with horror in Berlin. It is an outcome Merkel would see as an enormous personal defeat.“She doesn’t want to split Europe — it’s the same perhaps for any German chancellor,” says one senior EU diplomat.But Europe is already split over Poland. Though the European Commission and its president Ursula von der Leyen, a close Merkel ally, are keen to tread softly, the European Parliament and some member states are pushing them to take a tough line on Warsaw over the alleged rule of law violations. On Wednesday, the parliament started a legal action against the commission for allegedly dragging its feet in sanctioning Poland.Von der Leyen said she was examining three options in the Polish case: bringing an infringement action in response to the Warsaw court’s ruling; withholding EU funding; and bringing a fresh procedure under Article 7 of the Treaty, which permits sanctions for rule of law violations.According to German officials, Merkel worries that the EU’s actions could deepen the confrontation with Poland, leading to potentially disastrous consequences. “We don’t want to look back in 10 years’ time and say that was the moment when we pushed Poland to quit the EU,” says one. How to deal with the Polish dispute without escalating the situation “is now the greatest challenge the EU faces”.Resolving the conflict may prove harder without Merkel. The current situation has echoes of a similar stand-off late last year, when Poland and Hungary threatened to veto the EU’s budget and recovery fund over the new rule of law conditionality mechanism which the package contained. The budget eventually went through, but in March Hungary and Poland challenged the rules in the European Court of Justice. Merkel had played a key role in urging them to drop their veto.“She is a bridge-builder,” says one EU diplomat, who wonders whether Macron can play that kind of role after Merkel’s departure. “Does his character allow it? We hope so.”“We shouldn’t be trying to isolate or punish Poland, but to solve the problem,” says one senior German official. Dialogue, not confrontation, is needed, he says, to “get things back on track”.Europe’s leaders are now taking a long, hard look at Scholz and the green and liberal politicians who could sit round his cabinet table, as they assess how the next German government will handle the stand-off. A pragmatic centrist, Scholz himself has been praised by EU colleagues for his role as German finance minister in driving the €800bn post-pandemic recovery fund and the international deal on a minimum effective corporate tax rate which 136 countries signed up to earlier this month.A paper released last Friday, which will serve as a basis for the three parties’ formal coalition negotiations, was careful to promise continuity. It said Germany would remain committed to Nato and the transatlantic relationship, and to the “rules-based international order” which Merkel came to embody.The SPD, Greens and FDP, the paper said, would seek to “strengthen the EU”, “increase Europe’s sovereignty” and pursue a “values-based” foreign policy that could herald a tougher line on China and Russia.“We are determined to make the EU more effective and democratic, and will press for an EU that protects its values and rule of law both at home and abroad,” it said.What that means for the dispute with Poland is still unclear. But some senior officials in Brussels play down the idea that Merkel’s departure will leave a vacuum in EU leadership.“Germany will always be Germany,” says a senior EU official, referring to Berlin’s intrinsic heft in the European Council. “And don’t underestimate the influence exerted by the [EU] institutions.”“Rumours about the imminent death of the union have been exaggerated before,” the official says. “It’s the same on this occasion.”
138  The choice of who will succeed Jens Weidmann as head of Germany’s central bank will send an important early signal about the balance of power between the three parties negotiating to form a new coalition government in Berlin.Analysts said that selecting the next Bundesbank president could form part of a package covering several other personnel decisions to be decided by the Social Democrats, Greens and liberal Free Democrats (FDP) as they prepare to start coalition talks, including the vital decision of who becomes finance minister.The SPD, which narrowly won last month’s election, has first claim on several top jobs. Olaf Scholz, SPD finance minister, will be Germany’s next chancellor, while Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a former SPD foreign minister who is the country’s president, is likely to have his wish granted to serve a second five-year term.Just this week, an SPD MP, Bärbel Bas, was put forward by her party’s parliamentary caucus as the new president of the Bundestag.However, the decision on who becomes Germany’s next finance minister will not be as straightforward. Two men are vying for the job, the second-most important in the German government — Christian Lindner, leader of the FDP, and Robert Habeck, co-leader of the Greens.The two men have fundamentally different views on fiscal policy: Lindner opposes tax increases and any changes to Germany’s constitutional cap on new borrowing: Habeck wants massive government spending on the green transition.Their differences over tax and debt could also have implications for the decision over who takes over from Weidmann, who announced this week that he would step down on December 31.Lindner is a fiscal hawk who wants to see a swift return to Europe’s pre-pandemic rules on debt. He praised Weidmann fulsomely on Wednesday, saying that he stood for a “stability-oriented monetary policy, the importance of which is growing in the light of inflationary risks,” adding: “With him, the Bundesbank was an important voice in Europe.”The implication is that the liberals will push to have an equally conservative economist replace him at the Bundesbank.Florian Toncar, the FDP’s finance spokesman, was more explicit: “Weidmann was critical of the increasing politicisation of central banks and the ultra-loose monetary policy of the last few years,” he told the Financial Times. “I hope there will be continuity [with this approach] in the future.”Lindner has repeatedly laid claim to the finance ministry. But a few days ago Green politician Danyal Bayaz, the finance minister of Baden-Württemberg state, said he could imagine “no one better” than Habeck in the role. “He’s been preparing very thoroughly for this responsible job, and not just since yesterday,” he tweeted.Others are trying to rein in the speculation over jobs. Volker Wissing, the FDP’s general secretary, said personnel questions were not yet being discussed between the three partners. “We will clarify such things at the end of successful coalition negotiations,” he said. “At the moment only policy issues are relevant.”That is the approach Scholz’s team is also taking when it comes to Weidmann’s replacement. A person close to the prospective chancellor said there was “no great time pressure” because Weidmann would remain in the job until the end of the year. Asked who was in the frame to replace him, he said: “It’s completely open.”Analysts say the choice of the new Bundesbank boss is unlikely to have much short-term impact on the direction of monetary policy in the euro area.After all, Weidmann spent much of the past decade as an isolated figure criticising the European Central Bank’s increasingly loose monetary policy, but doing little to curb the flow of ultra-cheap money before he lost out in the race to become its president when Christine Lagarde was chosen to replace Mario Draghi two years ago.In the longer term, however, the choice of Weidmann’s successor could play a key role in marking out one of the leading contenders to replace Lagarde when her term expires in 2027. A German is yet to run the ECB, making this likely the next time the job comes up.“The next appointment to the Bundesbank could well be the probable next in line to take over from Christine Lagarde in six years’ time, so the importance of this decision should not be downplayed,” said Katharina Utermöhl, senior economist at Allianz.Another consideration for the incoming government is whether to make Germany the first eurozone country to have a woman at the helm of its central bank.For this, there are two obvious candidates: Isabel Schnabel, an economics professor who was appointed by Berlin to the ECB executive board two years ago, and Claudia Buch, another economist who has been Weidmann’s deputy at the Bundesbank since 2014.However, analysts said Schnabel might not want the Bundesbank job because she arguably has more influence as head of ECB market operations, while Buch is considered too low profile by some.Most economists have predicted that Scholz’s new government will choose someone with less hawkish views than Weidmann in an effort to reduce the tension over eurozone monetary policy and give Germany a more constructive voice.Several candidates would fit this profile, including Jakob von Weizsäcker, chief economist in the German finance ministry; Jörg Kukies, a finance ministry official and former Goldman Sachs executive; and Marcel Fratzscher, head of the German Economic Institute for Economic Research and a former ECB official.But if these raise objections from Lindner for being too dovish, the FDP leader may push for someone with more conservative monetary policy instincts, such as Volker Wieland, a finance professor at Frankfurt University and former official at the US Federal Reserve.
139  The ECB is pushing banks to add hundreds of extra staff and billions of extra capital to their post-Brexit operations, and Turkey could be ‘grey-listed’ today by a global financial watchdog. Plus, the FT’s Middle East editor, Andrew England, explains that Saudi Arabia is turning to women to boost employment. 
140  The UK has brokered a trade agreement with New Zealand that will cut tariffs on clothing, buses and wine, and, it hopes, lay a foundation for joining a trans-Pacific economic bloc of 11 countries.The deal, which was agreed in principle on Wednesday after 16 months of negotiations, will also see British professional qualifications recognised in New Zealand.As with the UK-Australia deal struck this summer, it will open up the UK’s agriculture markets. Tariffs up to 10 per cent on cars, buses and textiles will be removed and 5 per cent tariffs on metal will also be cut.The agreement’s full legal text has yet to be finalised and this process can take months: the Australia deal, which was approved in principle in June, has yet to be signed.The Department for International Trade said the UK-New Zealand deal would “pave the way” for the UK to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the trade group of 11 nations that includes both Australia and New Zealand.Ministers in London are hopeful to conclude negotiations to join CPTPP by the end of 2022. Liz Truss, foreign secretary, told the Financial Times that the group could also be a stepping stone to improving trade relations with the US, a long-term ambition of the Johnson government.But the New Zealand deal is expected to have almost no impact on the UK’s gross domestic product. According to the Department for International Trade’s internal assessment, the deal at most would boost the economy by 0.01 per cent. In another scenario, it would make the country poorer by 0.01 per cent.Sam Lowe, senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform, said the deal should be judged on its strategic aims. “The benefits of this deal are less about the economics, which are negligible and more about the signal it sends about the UK’s intentions in the region, and as a stepping stone towards a big push for CPTPP accession next year.”UK prime minister Boris Johnson said the agreement would drive “green growth” and strengthen the UK’s Indo-Pacific relations. “It will benefit businesses and consumers across the country, cutting costs for exporters and opening up access for our workers,” he said.Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand prime minister, added: “This world-leading free trade agreement lays the foundations for even stronger connections as both countries embark on a new phase in our relationship. It is good for our economies, our businesses and our people.” The deal was welcomed by business groups. Mike Cherry, chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, noted the dedicated chapter for smaller businesses. “New Zealand has long been a priority market for the UK’s small exporters — more than a quarter of which already sell there — and we welcome efforts to build on existing trade ties that go back many decades.”Dominic Goudie of the Food and Drink Federation said the UK’s food and drink manufacturers would benefit from being “more competitive” in New Zealand. “Our manufacturers will benefit from an ambitious trade deal with New Zealand that removes a range of tariffs that currently constrain exports.”But the agreement was criticised by the UK’s opposition Labour party. Emily Thornberry, the shadow international trade secretary, said the agreement would cut employment in Britain’s agriculture sector.“It is a deal whose only major winners are the mega-corporations who run New Zealand’s meat and dairy farms, all at the expense of British farmers who are already struggling to compete. But for British jobs, growth and exports, this deal is yet another massive failure,” she said.
141  Jens Weidmann has decided to step down after a decade as head of Germany’s central bank, only weeks after the country’s general election and shortly before a crucial decision on the future of eurozone monetary policy.The president of the Bundesbank has been one of the most vocal critics of the ultra-loose monetary policy pursued by the European Central Bank, where he fought an often lonely battle against its bond buying and negative interest rate policies.The 53-year-old said in a statement on Wednesday that he was leaving for “personal reasons”. But colleagues said he was tired of opposing ECB policies and expected these frustrations to increase as the economy recovers, inflation rises and the ECB’s generous stimulus becomes harder to justify.Weidmann told Bundesbank employees in a letter that he had decided to step down at the end of the year, adding: “I have come to believe that more than 10 years is a good time to start a new chapter — for the Bundesbank but also for me personally.”His planned departure, less than two years after his mandate was extended for another eight-year term, comes as the ECB prepares for a vital meeting in December when it is due to decide how fast to wind down the €1.85tn bond-buying plan it launched in response to the pandemic and how much stimulus to maintain after that.Weidmann’s move also comes as German political parties are locked in negotiations to form the country’s first three-party ruling coalition since the 1950s. Weidmann worked as an adviser to chancellor Angela Merkel before his appointment to run the Bundesbank in 2011. His decision to resign means they look set to leave office around the same time.Steffen Seibert, a government spokesman, said Merkel had noted Weidmann’s decision “with regret and respect”, adding that it would be up to the next government to choose his successor “to continue the stability-orientated legacy of the Bundesbank”.If the new government, likely to be a left-leaning coalition led by Olaf Scholz, currently the finance minister, cannot agree on Weidmann’s successor by the end of this year, Claudia Buch, Bundesbank vice-president, would become interim central bank chief.Weidmann, who lost out in the race to replace Mario Draghi as ECB president in 2019, made the decision to step down earlier in the year, but waited until after the election to avoid the impression that it was a politically motivated move, according to a person briefed on the matter.He also felt he should quit before Germany takes over the G7 presidency in January. The Bundesbank is due to move into a new office in central Frankfurt at the start of next year.As the longest-serving member of the ECB’s governing council, and one of its most “hawkish” voices who upheld the Bundesbank’s traditionally orthodox views on monetary policy that draw on Germany’s experience of hyperinflation in the 1920s, his departure opens the door to a potential further shift in favour of the ECB’s “dovish” majority.Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, said: “The new German government will probably appoint a less hawkish successor,” adding that it could choose Isabel Schnabel, Germany’s recent appointment to the ECB executive board, “or somebody with similar mainstream views”.Buch would be another contender if the new government wanted to make Germany the first eurozone country to appoint a female head of its central bank.Other potential candidates include: Jakob von Weizsäcker, chief economist in the German finance ministry; Jörg Kukies, a finance ministry official and former Goldman Sachs executive; Rolf Strauch, chief economist at the European Stability Mechanism; and Marcel Fratzscher, head of the German Economic Institute for Economic Research.However, many of these candidates are likely to have a more moderate approach to monetary policy than Weidmann, risking opposition from the liberal Free Democrat Party, which is in talks with the Greens and Social Democrats to form the new government and has more hawkish instincts.Christian Lindner, head of the liberal party, hinted at this when he tweeted that under Weidmann’s leadership the Bundesbank had “an important voice in Europe,” adding: “The FDP recommends German continuity.”Hans Michelbach, outgoing finance spokesman of Merkel’s CDU party in parliament, summed up these fears by saying that Weidmann’s departure was a “disastrous signal for the future [of] monetary and fiscal policy in Germany and Europe”.The Bundesbank boss has frequently warned that the ECB is underestimating inflationary pressures, and its independence could be eroded because of how reliant heavily indebted governments have become on its bond-buying programme to keep their borrowing costs low.Resurgent consumer demand, soaring energy prices and supply-chain bottlenecks drove inflation in the euro area up to a 13-year-high of 3.4 per cent in September. German inflation, meanwhile, rose to a 29-year high of 4.1 per cent.“It will be crucial not to look one-sidedly at deflation risks, but also not to lose sight of prospective inflation risks,” Weidmann said in Wednesday’s letter. “And crisis measures, with their extraordinary flexibility, are only proportionate in the emergency situation for which they were created.”He also stressed the importance that “monetary policy respects its narrow mandate and does not get caught in the wake of fiscal policy or the financial markets”.Bundesbank officials have been unsettled by recent calls from some ECB council members for it to maintain a significant bond-buying scheme and to loosen some of its self-imposed restrictions on asset purchases, even after it judges the pandemic crisis to be over.With Weidmann due to step down on December 31, days after the ECB’s last council meeting of the year, analysts said he may decide to be more vocal than usual in his opposition to any potentially “dovish” shift.“The fact that Weidmann often did not get his way may have played a role in his resignation,” said Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank. “A new federal government is unlikely to appoint a Bundesbank president who is again at odds with the majority opinion in the ECB council.”Once dismissed by Draghi as Nein zu allem — German for “No to everything” — Weidmann spent his early years openly criticising the ECB’s increasingly unconventional policies that flooded markets with cheap money.Yet after Christine Lagarde took over as ECB president in 2019 and was confronted with the Covid-19 crisis, Weidmann became less confrontational and even accepted its recent strategic overhaul, which allowed a temporary overshooting of its inflation target.Lagarde said in a statement that she respected Weidmann’s decision, “but I also immensely regret it”, adding: “Jens is a good personal friend on whose loyalty I could always count.”The conservative monetary doctrine of Germany’s Bundesbank formed the bedrock of the euro’s creation. But over the past decade the ECB has steadily drifted away from this orthodox stance to establish a more expansionary policy approach.This created tensions that caused several German representatives on the ECB council to quit before their term expired in frustration at the dovish shift.Sabine Lautenschläger resigned as an ECB executive board member in 2019, three years before her term expired and shortly after Draghi caused uproar in Germany by announcing another cut in interest rates and a restarting of bond purchases.In 2011, Jürgen Stark quit as ECB chief economist in protest at its purchases of government bonds in response to the eurozone debt crisis. Earlier that year, Axel Weber quit as head of the Bundesbank after fiercely opposing the ECB’s strategy.
142  President Vladimir Putin has approved a proposal to keep workers at home for at least a week, the closest Russia has come to introducing lockdown measures since the early months of the pandemic, as case numbers and deaths soar while its vaccination campaign stalls.Putin told a cabinet meeting on Wednesday he would back the workplace shutdown nationwide from October 30 to November 7 and allow individual regions to extend the measures in either direction as they saw fit.Cabinet officials said regions would probably be expected to limit access to shops, theatres and restaurants, but added they would compensate businesses with low-interest loans and one-time payments equal to a monthly minimum wage per worker.The Kremlin is scrambling to stem the spread of coronavirus amid widespread apathy over the disease, even as Russia posts some of the worst Covid-19 statistics in the world and officials warn that several regions are running out of hospital beds.On Wednesday, Russia recorded its worst-ever infection numbers and death tolls, with a record 1,028 dying from the virus.But the government has admitted in recent days that its vaccination campaign has flopped, with only 45m — or 32 per cent of the population -fully vaccinated with both doses of one of the three domestically produced jabs on offer.Putin, who took the Sputnik V vaccine in the spring, said even some of his close friends had been reluctant to get inoculated.“The vaccine really reduces the risk of infection and serious complications from illness, including the threat of death,” he said at the cabinet meeting. “There are only two ways to get through this period: to get sick or get vaccinated. It’s better to get vaccinated — why wait for those consequences?”He added: “This is about protecting you, at the end of the day — your life and the health of your loved ones.”The workplace shutdown is the first nationwide measure Russia has taken since the early months of the pandemic last spring, when a lockdown sent the economy into a recession and made a dent in Putin’s approval ratings in the midst of a campaign for constitutional changes that could potentially extend his reign until 2036.Russia rapidly lifted the lockdown measures in the weeks leading up to a vote on the changes and avoided repeating them even as cases shot up during last autumn’s second wave. Lockdown measures and vaccine mandates were instead delegated to local authorities.Most Russian regions have some form of compulsory vaccination for the working-age population, while Moscow moved this week to ban unvaccinated elderly people from leaving the house until February.Despite that, restaurants, bars and shops in the capital are heaving with customers and mask mandates on public transport are widely ignored.Experts have blamed Russians’ lackadaisical attitude to the dangers posed by the virus on mixed public messaging about vaccines and a widespread belief among the more than 8m who have had the disease that they are not at risk of getting it again.Putin has restricted his own public appearances in recent months despite getting the vaccine. He self-isolated for about a week in September after a mass Covid-19 outbreak among his entourage.The Kremlin said that he would not attend the G20 meeting in Rome next week or the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November, damping hopes for a breakthrough in US-Russia relations or climate change policy.
143  Brussels will delay long-awaited proposals on how to classify nuclear power and natural gas under the EU’s landmark labelling system for green finance, as member states demand looser rules to help counteract the continent’s energy crisis.EU financial services commissioner Mairead McGuinness told the Financial Times that Brussels would take more time before deciding how to deal with the controversial energy sources under the so-called “taxonomy on sustainable finance” that had been due this autumn.The debate about how to classify low carbon natural gas and nuclear energy, which produces no CO2 but whose waste byproducts are toxic for the environment, has been supercharged by surging electricity costs that have prompted EU governments into emergency financial action to protect households.European leaders are due to debate the taxonomy and how to mitigate soaring prices at a summit in Brussels on Thursday.“As we come to the end of the year there will be more pressure to resolve this,” said McGuinness. “We don’t have a ready-made solution because this is, both technically but politically . . . one of those issues where you have very divided views.”Europe’s pro-nuclear countries, led by France, and pro-gas member states in the south and east, are demanding the taxonomy rules do not penalise technologies they say are vital in securing the transition to net zero emissions.Environmental groups, however, want the system to abide by scientific criteria to ensure the rules stamp out, rather than encourage, so-called “greenwashing” in the investment industry.McGuinness said it was “still the objective” to propose the rules by the end of the year. “But who’s to know what the twists and turns will be”, she added, referring to elections in EU countries and government formations that had yet to be settled. France holds presidential elections next April while in Germany three parties are in coalition talks. The taxonomy proposal will need to win support from member states and MEPs.“We’re hearing from citizens and businesses about higher energy costs and keeping the lights on. We must make sure we don’t create fears that this transition is a problem because the transition is the solution”, she said.Europe’s energy crisis is the latest challenge to the credibility of the EU’s green labelling system which was designed to be a “gold standard” for investors to know what counts as truly sustainable economic activity.But the rules have been mired in controversy as Brussels struggles to balance science with sensitive political decisions about whether to award some activities the highest green label — penalising those that do not.Ten countries, including France, Finland, Poland and Hungary this week said it is “absolutely necessary that nuclear power was included in the taxonomy framework”.McGuinness said it remained an “open question” as to whether the green label would be expanded to “accommodate nuclear and gas”. She said possible compromises included creating an “amber” label for activity that did not win the green label but would still secure a place in the bloc’s transition and not discourage private sector investment.The commission is also exploring how to redefine so-called transitional activities that have a lower environmental impact to prevent the taxonomy from becoming “too binary”, said McGuinness.“If all the money flows towards green [activities] today, there will be bucketloads of money that would have no room to go to. We will have made zero difference to our move towards climate neutrality”. The taxonomy has become an early litmus test of the EU’s ambitious climate goals, which involve the bloc reducing average carbon emissions by 55 per cent in 2030 (compared to 1990 levels). The rules are being closely watched by investors and regulators in the US and UK, who have also said they will come up with their own classification systems. Within the EU, the taxonomy will be used to judge whether investments made by member states are truly green and will form the basis for an EU “green bond standard” that will be used to issue €250bn in sustainable debt under the bloc’s recovery fund.This story has been amended to clarify the commissioner’s position on the timing of the proposals
144  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.Go to Strasbourg, they said, air it all out and maybe things will get better. Not when it comes to Poland and its ever-deepening dispute with Brussels over the rule of law. The Polish PM went, spoke, and dug his heels in. We’ll unpack the commission’s pledge to use all the sticks it has (even a revival of the comatose Article 7 proceedings), while the carrots (EU grants and loans) are stowed away in the freezer.On the climate action front, opposition is brewing in Greece against the commission’s proposed inclusion of maritime transport in the bloc’s emissions trading system. We got our hands on a letter the Greek PM wrote to the commission to complain.And in fiscal reform news, there may not be much action yet, but we have a better idea of what the commission plans over the next year.Much like the European parliament does every month, the EU-Poland dispute travelled from Brussels to Strasbourg and back again with little in the way of tangible progress, writes Henry Foy in Strasbourg.Those hoping for signs of compromise were left disappointed by unequivocal speeches by both commission president Ursula von der Leyen and Poland’s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki. Those who had expected the former to announce immediate action against Warsaw for a recent court ruling challenging the supremacy of EU law were proved wrong.But von der Leyen did make clear what her three options for action are — and vowed to do at least one of them. The first, taking Warsaw to court, is both the most likely to happen and the least troubling for Poland — it would not be the first time.Her two other options are more muscular, but also trickier to execute. Triggering the rule of law conditionality mechanism, which could see Poland lose access to EU funds, would certainly focus minds in Warsaw.The new tool has never been used before, and its progress if triggered would likely stretch over several months before coming to a vote among member states — a qualified majority, not unanimity, is required to approve those.Poland may also have a case in arguing that the mechanism is designed to protect the proper use of EU funds, not penalise court rulings, and that this would be an example of using a legal tool in a political manner.Reviving Article 7 is another quandary entirely. On paper the toughest weapon Brussels has, with potential sanctions including the stripping of member state voting rights, it is almost impossible to see it applied to Poland given the requirement for unanimous support among member states.Poland is already in an Article 7 procedure which the commission triggered in 2017 and which has amounted to pointless group sessions among EU affairs ministers ever since Hungary pledged to veto any sanctions. Even a new government in Budapest might not change the situation, given that their pact is mutual: Poland protects Hungary from its own Article 7 procedure. And even if Hungary changed its mind, other member states feel queasy about it being used.One tool that remains unnamed but that is already being used is the delay in approving Poland’s €36bn slice from the EU’s post-pandemic recovery fund, after Warsaw submitted its plans in May.In her speech in Strasbourg yesterday, von der Leyen did not mention the delay but also did not suggest she was anywhere near approving the plans. She said Warsaw now needs to “explain to us how it intends to protect European money, given this ruling of their constitutional court”, in light of future multibillion-euro investments from the post-pandemic fund and the EU budget.“This is European taxpayers’ money. And if our Union is investing more than ever to advance our collective recovery, we must protect the Union budget against breaches of the rule of law,” von der Leyen said.Just 100 miles north, at EU affairs ministers’ meeting in Luxembourg, ministers from Belgium, Netherlands and the Grand Duchy did make that connection, saying they stand opposed to any approval of that cash disbursement until Poland implements rulings from the European Court of Justice currently being ignored.For the time being, the lack of cash — a delay which Polish officials are increasingly concerned about — serves as the commission’s message to Warsaw, and mollifies restless member states that want Poland punished. But as von der Leyen made clear yesterday, more active steps are coming soon.The belligerence on display in Strasbourg — both from Morawiecki and from von der Leyen — made it clear to many involved that de-escalation and compromise is further away than ever.“On both sides radicals are happy to make it harder,” said one official briefed on a short meeting between von der Leyen and Morawiecki before they addressed lawmakers.As the stand-off moves back to the EU summit in Brussels tomorrow, the question of how it can be resolved lingers: much like with Brexit, most officials want it to just go away so they can move on to other things. But as with London, playing for time may not help here, either.The EU’s CO2 reduction plans may have come under fire amid the current energy price crisis, but a new front is opening in Greece — and it’s about the shipping industry, writes Eleni Varvitsioti in Athens.The Greek government has sent a letter to Ursula von der Leyen calling for “more realistic and constructive solutions” when it comes to the targets the shipping industry would have to reach by 2030.Prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis wrote the letter after consulting with Greek shipowners who account for 58 per cent of the EU-owned merchant fleet. Seen by Europe Express, the letter politely tells the European Commission president that the “Fit for 55” goals for the maritime transport are not realistic.Under the bloc’s plans announced earlier this year, shipping would be added to the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) gradually from 2023 over a three-year period. Shipowners would have to buy ETS allowances for each tonne of CO2 they emit, or else face possible bans from EU ports.According to the International Maritime Organization, maritime transport emits about 940m tonnes of CO2 annually and is responsible for about 2.5 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.The Greek letter is the first nudge, but it could mark the beginning of a brutal battle, considering the size of the Greek shipping industry.Mitsotakis proposes adopting the same model the aviation sector got in terms of pollution permits allocated to member states. Because of its large size, the Greek-owned commercial fleet will be responsible for a considerable share of the cost from the extension of the ETS to maritime transport. This “is not justified and results in a disproportionate transfer that needs to be rebalanced”, the letter says.He also opposes the commission’s proposal to make shipowners liable for polluting. This is because in a large segment of shipping, the owner of the vessel and its commercial operator, who is responsible for the fuel used, are different entities.Because shipping is a global industry, Mitsotakis stresses that the EU should strive to ensure a level-playing field with other regions and countries and proposes that the review clause for how the maritime sector is performing in ETS should be brought forward from 2028 to 2025. “The risk of regulatory fragmentation . . . in terms of the disruption they would cause in supply chains is too high,” the letter says.Mitsotakis also calls for the creation of an EU research centre for alternative marine fuels and technologies. With the post-2030 path towards decarbonising shipping still in uncharted waters, the goal of zero emissions in this sector “will not be feasible in the absence of mature and available-at-scale technological solutions”, Mitsotakis writes.The commission could not be reached for comment last night when the letter was sent.EU finance ministries can mark up their calendars, writes Sam Fleming in Brussels. The European Commission’s relaunched consultation on economic governance gives a much clearer picture of how Brussels sees the fiscal policy timetable for the year ahead.Yesterday’s communication launched an intensive period of consultations with member states and other parties as Brussels seeks to identify some landing zones when it comes to reform of the EU’s byzantine deficit and debt rules (Stability and Growth Pact). Here’s what happens next:It is also possible to draw some early, tentative conclusions on where the commission’s reform priorities lie. The commission is determined to avoid excessively draconian fiscal consolidation from 2023 onwards, preferring growth-friendly reductions in public debt ratios, according to the consultation.That means the existing debt-reduction rule, which requires debt-to-GDP ratios that exceed the 60 per cent mark to be reduced by 1/20th a year, will have to be disregarded in the coming years (or preferably rewritten). The commission is also interested in examining ways to incentivise certain types of public investment in the framework, for example green investments, though it is hard at this stage to see what that regime might look like. Finally, there is a clear appetite to simplify the rules given their reliance on hard-to-measure metrics such as the structural balance.So there’s the commission’s game plan. Now let’s see how it lands with the national capitals.
145  Turkey is set to be “grey listed” by a global finance watchdog this week for failings in its approach to combating money laundering and terrorist financing, according to two western officials.In a move that risks further denting Turkey’s already limited ability to attract crucial foreign capital, members of the Financial Action Task Force were likely to approve the decision during discussions in Paris on Thursday, the officials said.They said an FATF review had recommended that Turkey should be subject to special monitoring by the taskforce’s International Co-operation Review Group — a process known as “grey listing” — joining 22 other states including Albania, Morocco, Syria, South Sudan and Yemen.The 39-member plenary was “very likely” to endorse the recommendation, according to one of the officials. The other said that approval was expected to be a mere formality. The decision is due to be formally announced on Thursday.The move comes as foreign investment in Turkey is already close to the lowest level reached during President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s almost 20 years at the helm.Political instability and concerns over political interference in monetary policy and rule of law have served to scare away foreign money vital for financing the country’s chronic trade deficit and fuelling economic growth.A grey listing could strike a further blow at a time when the Turkish lira, which has lost about 20 per cent of its value against the dollar this year, has hit a succession of record lows and could fall further on Thursday if, as markets expect, the country’s central bank cuts its benchmark interest rate again.Turkey’s grey-listing will heap pressure on the EU to add the country to its own money-laundering list, which identifies high-risk non-EU jurisdictions that threaten the bloc’s financial system.An IMF study published in May this year found that FATF grey listing had “a large, significant negative effect” on a country’s capital inflows.Its authors estimated that it caused a reduction in portfolio flows — a form of short-term investment sometimes referred to as “hot money” — equivalent to 3 per cent of gross domestic product, plus a similar reduction in foreign direct investment. A 3 per cent decline would be equivalent to about $23bn in Turkey’s case.The impact is likely to be limited, however, by the exodus of foreign capital that the country has already suffered in recent years. Total foreign investment in stocks and bonds stood at just $30.6bn at the start of August, according to central bank data. Foreign direct investment totalled $5.7bn last year, compared with more than $19bn at its peak in 2007.But even small outflows could strike a blow to a country whose currency is under heavy pressure and whose foreign exchange reserves are already widely considered by analysts and investors to be too low. The sliding lira has led to spiralling inflation and an erosion of living standards that has sent public support for Erdogan’s ruling party to historic lows.The FATF was founded in 1989 to combat money laundering, terror financing and other similar threats to the integrity of the international financial system.Turkey was put on notice by the body in a report published in December 2019. While it said that Ankara understood “the risks it faces from money laundering and terrorist financing”, it found “serious shortcomings in the country’s framework to combat these crimes”. The Turkish government introduced controversial new legislation, passed by parliament in December last year, that it said was a response to the FATF recommendations.The move was criticised by opposition parties and civil society activists who said the FATF recommendations were being used by the Turkish authorities as an excuse to target the non-profit sector and further hamper freedom of expression and association.A Turkish official said it was inappropriate to comment before Thursday’s vote, but added: “Despite full lockdown measures taken due to the [Covid-19] pandemic, Turkey has achieved significant progress in terms of compliance with FATF standards, and fulfilled its responsibilities regarding legislation.”The FATF said that its plenary discussions, which began on Tuesday, were under way but that the talks were confidential.
146  The medieval town of Cáceres is a UN World Heritage gem where production crews this month started shooting a prequel to Game of Thrones. Less than 3km away, foreign investors want to create one of Europe’s largest lithium mines.The proposed project, so close to one of the jewels of Spain’s past, has set off ferocious local opposition. It highlights the challenges to the country’s plans to use unprecedented EU funding to develop a whole industry around lithium — the main input for batteries to power electric vehicles and for large-scale energy storage.Development of this next generation technology is a priority across Europe at a time when carmakers face ferocious competition from manufacturers in China and elsewhere — and when China also controls most global stocks of lithium.“Lithium batteries won’t just be a need for the next 10 years; it’s something requiring huge investments by the car sector [and] that will be necessary for the next 30 to 40 years, minimum,” said David Valls, country manager for Infinity Lithium, the Australian-listed group seeking to develop the mine.But the ambitions to secure a resource vital for clean energy are themselves falling foul of environmental objections. In Cáceres, José Ramón Bello, the city’s head of urban planning, is adamant that Infinity’s plans will go no further.“The project is dead,” he said from his office near a 12th-century Arab tower in the heart of the city, adding that 22 out of the town’s 25 councillors opposed the plans and that local rules excluded a mine on the site.“Rather than a mine that could pose a threat to our heritage, we’ve opted to revitalise our tourism and focus on clean, sustainable industries,” Bello said, noting that hotel occupation is now beating pre-pandemic records. “We are not against lithium; we are against this mine, because of where it would be.”Another opponent is Montaña Chaves — named after the Virgin of the Mountain, Cáceres’ patron saint. The mine’s entrance would be just below the sanctuary devoted to the saint.The mountain “is where you go with flowers when you are betrothed, where you pray when your daughter is doing her exams”, she said. “My mission is to protect this little part of the world.”Opponents of the mine are winning. It has lost its research permit and faces a lengthy battle in the courts. But the battle over lithium deposits in Cáceres and elsewhere in the surrounding region of Extremadura highlights the environmental and economic trade-offs in the transition to cleaner energy.Extremadura’s government says the mineral could transform the fortunes of a part of Spain that has lagged behind the rest of the country since the conquistadores of Mexico and Peru abandoned the region to seek their fortunes in the Americas 500 years ago.The region hopes that aid from the EU’s €800bn recovery fund will help bring not just lithium mining but also foment a modern industrial cluster.“Continental Europe is poor in lithium and this is a competitive advantage for Extremadura,” said Olga García, the regional government’s top environmental official. “Since we have the raw material, it is logical to have the value chain too.”She and other officials in Extremadura are championing a project that if anything is even more ambitious than that proposed in Cáceres — a mine in the Cañaveral district 40km to the north. It would be accompanied by new industrial infrastructure across the region, including a battery cell factory and a cathode factory.Overall, this project would involve more than €1bn of investment, including €85m for the mine and €200m-plus for associated facilities to process the lithium.“Companies from all over Europe are in contact with us; they know one of the EU’s big worries is getting control of raw materials,” said Ignacio Baños, the chief executive of Lithium Iberia, the company developing the Cañaveral mine. He said it had even more lithium than the Cáceres site.In the neighbouring village of Cañaveral, houses are abandoned, jobs are scarce, and the mayor backs the scheme. But support for development is far from unanimous.Yolanda Ruiz, a campaigner against the mine, pointed out it would be between two protected bird reserves and beside ancient woodlands. “We have kept all this nature, because the government has stayed at a distance throughout the history of Extremadura,” she said.The mine’s administrators hope to win approval for commercial operations next year and begin production by the end of 2023. That could be cutting things close. Seat, Spain’s leading carmaker and part of Volkswagen, wants to start mass-producing cheap electric vehicles in 2025 — one of the many EU manufacturers hoping to survive a transition away from traditional petrol and diesel vehicles.Mario Celdrán, the chief executive of Phi4tech, the company that is planning to build the battery cell and cathode factories, said his group would be focusing more on demand from renewable energy producers and data centres.But Phi4tech — which has KKR co-founder Henry Kravis among its shareholders — will only account for some 10 per cent of the Cañaveral mine’s production. The rest will largely depend on the vehicle industry. The next few months are set to prove crucial in terms of business contracts, as well as government decisions over the rules and allocations of the EU recovery funds.Such issues will determine if the mine can start in time to play the strategic role that national and EU authorities envisage.“It is certain that without the support of the European funds the project would not be so ambitious,” said Celdrán, who hopes up to a fifth of financing will come from the state. “You have to believe that these vast deposits of lithium will strengthen the region . . . But it is an enormous challenge.”
147  The FBI has searched a Washington residence connected to Oleg Deripaska, reigniting US enforcement action against the Russian metals tycoon who was placed under sanctions in 2018 over alleged links to the Kremlin.The agency on Tuesday said in a statement it was “conducting court-authorised law enforcement activity” at a DC address, declining to elaborate further.A spokesperson for Deripaska said: “The FBI is carrying out a search at two houses — located in Washington and New York — belonging to Mr Deripaska’s relatives. The searches are being carried out on the basis of two court orders, connected to US sanctions. The houses do not belong to Mr Deripaska.”Deripaska and 23 other prominent Russian oligarchs and government officials in April 2018 were hit with the toughest measures imposed by Washington in response to Moscow’s 2014 invasion of Crimea and alleged meddling in the 2016 US election.The oligarch at the time said the claims were groundless and sued the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Treasury division overseeing US sanctions policy. The lawsuit was dismissed by a US district court judge in June.The US Treasury last year justified sanctions against Deripaska — whose fortune sits at nearly $5bn, according to Forbes — by citing reports that he helped Russian president Vladimir Putin launder money. The allegations were denied by Deripaska and Putin’s spokesman at the time.He also came under scrutiny from US investigators for his business dealings with former president Donald Trump’s campaign manager Paul Manafort, who was convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud in 2018 following Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Manafort was among dozens of people pardoned last year by Trump in his final days in office.Deripaska built an aluminium, energy and industrial empire from previously state-owned assets privatised after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and before the 2008 financial crisis he was Russia’s richest man.The mansion stormed by the FBI remains one of the hottest properties in Washington’s real estate market. Deripaska in 2006 reportedly paid $15m for the 23,000 sq ft home, which includes seven bedrooms and Italian marble floors.Formerly owned by Herbert Haft, the late discount store tycoon, the white stone house is steps away from Embassy Row, the central Washington area featuring diplomatic missions, embassies as well as senior government officials’ homes.Additional reporting by Joshua Chaffin and Max Seddon*This article has been updated to reflect a statement from Deripaska’s spokesperson after initial publication in which they said the house belonged to his relatives
148  The Chinese-lettered banner hanging over the entrance is one of the few signs that Beijing now controls Europe’s fourth-biggest container port.Yet this month the Piraeus Port Authority handed a further 16 per cent of its shares to Cosco, cementing its control by the Chinese state-backed shipping group, which bought 51 per cent of the Greek port in August 2016.The deal has intensified unease in the EU over China’s increasing involvement in European infrastructure and met a wall of opposition over environmental and social concerns, and China’s unmet investment pledges.“I want the Chinese, but I want them to invest in the right way,” said Vassilis Kanakakis, president of the Greek shipbuilding and ship-repair contractors’ union. “Stay in Greece but work with us.”The transfer of the additional shares caps five years of negotiations that frequently hung in the balance amid pushback by local interest groups, Greek bureaucracy and diplomatic tensions. Under a preliminary 2016 agreement, Cosco was to receive the extra shares if it completed 11 investment projects worth about €300m by 2021. The list included expanding the port’s capacity to receive more cruise ships and improving its shipbuilding infrastructure. But most remain incomplete.China has blamed the delays on Greek bureaucracy and local opposition. Piraeus residents have launched a series of lawsuits, claiming Cosco has failed to follow environmental protocols and damaged the marine environment.“I was born and raised in Piraeus, and this investment is going to destroy my city,” said Anthi Giannoulou, a lawyer and one of the citizens involved in the lawsuits.Local interest groups say investments that have not faced legal challenges have also remained incomplete. “They haven’t spent a dime here; even when they need to change a lamp, they bring it from China,” said Kanakakis.The port deal has come under wider EU scrutiny at an awkward time in its relations with China. Faced with an increasingly assertive Beijing, the EU has sought to better protect strategic sectors from Chinese influence. Analysts say the Piraeus deal is frequently cited by officials as a cautionary tale when pushing states to privatise assets.“This deal with Cosco is concerning. Not only do we now have a much clearer view of the risks that such Chinese investments in strategic infrastructure entail for the EU, but we also know that Cosco is not living up to its contractual obligations,” said Raphaël Glucksmann, a member of the European parliament who chairs a committee to assess foreign interference in the EU’s democratic processes.Last year Brussels tightened procedures for screening foreign direct investment by foreign subsidised companies making acquisitions or bidding for public tenders in the EU.Cosco first acquired its shares in the port in 2008 during the series of sell-offs pressed on Athens by international creditors, including the EU, following the €300bn international bailout of the country after the global financial crisis.“Looking back it would have been better for the Piraeus port not to be sold,” said Werner Hoyer, president of the European Investment Bank, during a visit to Athens in June.For China, the port is important to its Belt and Road Initiative, which seeks to build infrastructure linking Asia, Africa and Europe. More than a dozen EU member states have signed up to the BRI, with China betting on making Piraeus a regional distribution centre. During a visit in November 2019, Chinese president Xi Jinping said: “I have seen in the port today that the [BRI] is not a slogan or tale, but a successful practice and brilliant reality.”Relations between Greece and China have cooled, however, with the conservative Greek government that came to power two years ago steering a narrow course between western allies and Chinese investors. The US government is following the developments. It has no influence over the Piraeus deal but has worked to ensure important investments, such as ports in the north of Greece and 5G projects, remain in the hands of western allies.During the past year, Greece has eased out Chinese state-owned enterprises from public tenders and has refused to host a summit in 2022 for the “17+1” grouping of China and central and eastern European countries. Greece joined EU partners in March in condemning China’s human rights violations against its Uyghur minority, and backed sanctions against Beijing. The Chinese ambassador abruptly left Athens shortly afterwards, with a replacement not arriving until September. “This deterioration in relations might explain the Chinese ambassador’s sudden departure that many see as . . . a clear sign of Beijing’s displeasure,” said Plamen Tonchev, from the Athens-based Institute of International Economic Relations.With the deal now signed, Cosco has been given five more years to complete the expected investments. Athens will reclaim the shares if it fails to do so. “How could a giant like Cosco not be able to make a single investment in the port for five years?” said Dimos Bakopoulos, former head of the Public Ports Authority. “The only thing that changed with this new deal is just the timetables and not the obstacles that created the delays.”Athens has defended the arrangement, saying it protects Greek interests while showing the country welcomes foreign investors. “Greece is a credible investment partner and does what should be done, [and] we are offering a safe environment for foreign investments,” said George Gerapetritis, minister of state in the Greek cabinet.Officials also point to the boost to the local economy since Cosco took a stake in the port. Since 2008, the company has invested €1.2bn and increased the facility’s container capacity five-fold, according to the Greek government.Cosco declined to comment.Yannis Moralis, Piraeus’s mayor, said Cosco paid 3.5 per cent of its turnover to the four different municipalities where it operated: “Piraeus receives about €3m each year. The more the port’s turnover increases, the more the municipalities will receive.”But, he warned, money was not the only issue for locals. “That’s what the Chinese need to keep in mind: the port can’t grow against the interests of the citizens, otherwise the investment makes no sense.”
149  Italy’s Democratic Party has taken control of the cities of Rome and Turin in a revival of the fortunes of the country’s centre-left and a blow to both the populist right and the struggling Five Star Movement.After the final votes were counted in elections held this month in multiple Italian cities, former economy minister Roberto Gualtieri won the contest to become mayor of Rome, seizing the capital from Five Star, which also lost Turin to the Democratic Party.Five Star’s losses are a symbolic blow for the one-time radical group which stunned Italy’s political establishment by winning the cities in 2016. Five Star later became Italy’s largest party on a campaign to root out corruption and improve public services.The local polls, which were delayed from the summer due to the pandemic, mark the first indication of voter sentiment following prime minister Mario Draghi’s unexpected entrance into national politics last year.The Democratic Party, Five Star and Matteo Salvini’s League are part of a national unity coalition backing the former European Central Bank president, who has embarked on a multiyear reform and investment plan intended to relaunch Italy’s economy following the pandemic.Lorenzo Codogno of LC Macro Advisors said the election results showed Five Star was in “free fall” that would likely be reflected in a crushing defeat for the party in national elections that have to be held by or before 2023.“The parabola of the Five Star Movement appears to have come to an end. It lost all the major cities where it was in government,” he wrote in an analysis of the results. “It will be hard for Five Star to reach 10 per cent of the votes at the next political elections, which is far less than opinion polls currently suggest”.The centre left also took control or kept hold of Milan, Naples and Bologna this month, leaving the Italian right with only a victory in the north eastern city of Trieste in spite of previously having had hopes to win multiple cities.The success of the Democratic Party, now under the leadership of former prime minister Enrico Letta, comes as Matteo Salvini’s League has suffered from a loss of momentum within Draghi’s unity government.Three years ago, after the League and Five Star took first and second place in national elections, the pair formed a coalition government that repeatedly clashed with Brussels over spending limits.But the 2018 general election in which it won almost a third of the total vote marked a high point for the Five Star Movement. Likewise the League, which won more than 30 per cent of the national vote in 2019’s European elections, has since been narrowly overtaken by Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy as the country’s most popular party.The right’s poor results in the local elections are not currently reflected in national voting intentions, with recent polls showing that the Brothers of Italy and League remained the country’s largest two parties and would be expected to form a coalition government.The defeated centre-right candidate for Rome, Enrico Michetti, had won the largest share of the vote in the first round but suffered from a string of scandals and gaffs in the run-up to the run off against Gualtieri.This included an article written by Michetti last year that came to light where he claimed victims of other genocides did not get as much attention as Jewish holocaust victims because they “did not own banks”. Although he apologised for the remarks, he caused further controversy by defending the fascist-associated “Roman salute” arm gesture.
150  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
151  Online betting company 888 will take a $10m hit to earnings after it stopped offering its services in the Netherlands following a change in policy by the Dutch authorities.The group plans to apply for a local licence in the coming months but said the timing of that award within the Netherlands “remains unclear”.“The group aims to be operational within the country during the second half of 2022,” it said in a statement on Tuesday.It anticipated the Dutch closure from this month would cut $10m from its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for 2022.New rules were introduced in the Netherlands in April that required gambling operators to apply for a new licence to offer online services to customers in the country from October.A total of 29 licence applications have been made to the Netherlands Gambling Authority, with 10 being successful.René Jansen, chair of the gambling authority, said: “Other providers may also be interested, but are waiting to submit an application because they are not ready yet. Strict conditions must be met and rigorous testing is carried out. But there will certainly be more licence holders.”The authority allows a “cooling-off” period for operators, which means they must wait 33 months before applying for a licence, if they were found to have been non-compliant in the past.Willem van Oort, a gambling regulation expert and founder of Gaming in Holland, said it “usually takes six months to process applications, but the period can be extended if the regulator has questions on an operator’s compliance”.Gambling companies Kindred Group and Betsson expect to receive their licences in 2022.888, which is based in Gibraltar, posted a 7 per cent rise in revenues to $230m for the third quarter to September 30, compared with a year earlier, driven by increased activity at its casinos. The gambling group last month signalled its interest in buying William Hill’s European business should it be sold as part of the bookmaker’s proposed £2.9bn acquisition by Caesars. 888, founded in 1997, offers casino games to customers as well as providing gaming products to other providers. In 2020, it signed multiyear agreements to launch its 888sport brand in Colorado, Indiana and Iowa as sports betting regulation was relaxed.
152  The European Commission will take steps to punish Poland for challenging the supremacy of EU law, its head has vowed as she condemned Warsaw for “calling into question the foundations of the European Union”.Ursula von der Leyen, commission president, said on Tuesday that Brussels had three tools to hit back at Poland, ranging from a legal challenge, to a formal sanction that could withhold tens of billions of euros in EU funds, and a political process that has the power to strip the country of bloc membership rights.“We cannot and we will not allow our common values to be put at risk. The commission will act,” von der Leyen told the European parliament in a strongly critical speech, as Poland’s prime minister listened in the chamber. “This ruling . . . is a direct challenge to the unity of the European legal order.”Brussels is under increasing pressure from European lawmakers and some member states to harden its stance against Poland and punish the country’s government for a court ruling this month that declared parts of EU law were not compatible with the Polish constitution.That ruling significantly escalated a five-year-long struggle between Brussels and Warsaw over rule of law concerns, related to sweeping judicial reforms by the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) that have included an attempt to purge the Supreme Court, and the introduction of a disciplinary regime that allows judges to be punished for the content of their rulings.Addressing a debate devoted to the Polish crisis, von der Leyen said the commission was “carefully assessing” the ruling, adding: “But I can already tell you: I am deeply concerned.”Responding to her with a bellicose and counter-attacking speech of his own, Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki insisted that his government was part of the “pro-European majority in Poland”.He accused the EU of double standards in its treatment of Warsaw, and dismissed criticism of his government as “unfair and biased”. He also argued that EU institutions had overstepped their powers in trying to force Poland to roll back its reforms.“It is not acceptable to force on others decisions which have no legal basis. And it is even less acceptable to use the language of financial blackmail, talk of fines . . . I reject the language of threats,” he told MEPs.The debate in Strasbourg, which saw dozens of MEPs take the floor to lambast Morawiecki and his government, precedes a European Council summit in Brussels beginning on Thursday where a number of EU leaders are expected to confront the Polish prime minister.Some member states have demanded the commission initiate a so-called conditionality mechanism with the power to withhold EU funds — worth tens of billions of euros each year for Poland — if Brussels believes the legal spending of that cash is at risk.France’s European affairs minister Clément Beaune said at a separate EU ministerial meeting in Luxembourg on Tuesday that “budget solidarity cannot continue if there is no respect for the fundamental values inscribed in the EU treaty”.His German counterpart Michael Roth said he did not “see any room for compromises” with Poland. “There can be no special deals,” he said.Von der Leyen said the conditionality mechanism was one of three options on the table. Another less aggressive move would be a legal challenge to the Warsaw ruling. The final option is the EU’s Article 7 procedure, which allows the bloc to suspend a member’s rights if it believes EU values are being consistently endangered.“This is the powerful tool in the Treaty. And we must come back to it,” she said.A previous attempt to apply the procedure against Poland in 2017 was shelved after Hungary vowed to veto it, and that obstruction would need to be overcome to resurrect the process and apply sanctions.Polish government officials said the commission had misunderstood the court ruling and was both responding to its most extreme interpretation and taking a political approach to a legal issue. “With this approach to the ruling it will be hard to de-escalate,” said one.Morawiecki told lawmakers: “If the institutions created in the [EU] treaties exceed their powers, member states have to have a tool to respond . . . The EU is not a state.”
153  Central bank independence is “essential” for Turkey’s long-term growth and development, the country’s largest and most powerful business association said, ahead of a critical interest rate decision by the embattled central bank this week.The Turkish Industry and Business Association (Tusiad), in a 230-page report, called for fundamental reform of economic policymaking amid growing concerns about the economy’s health under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.In a thinly veiled critique of Erdogan’s fixation on high economic growth at all costs, including soaring inflation and financial instability, Tusiad said long-term trends such as “central bank independence and cautious monetary and fiscal policy” were more important for lasting prosperity.It added that, while a narrative about a fast-paced growth “occupies an important role” in public discourse, “the most important, fundamental thing for the country’s prosperity is not short-term developments but the long-term trajectory”.The group’s unusual critique comes amid growing worries in Turkish business circles over the slide in the lira, which has continued to plumb new lows: this year the currency has fallen by a fifth.The country’s nominally independent central bank, which has come under continued pressure from Erdogan to keep rates low despite high inflation, is expected to cut rates again when it meets on Thursday. Last month the bank slashed its benchmark interest rate to 18 per cent even as annual inflation rose to more than 19 per cent.Tusiad rarely criticises government policy — a stance that has frustrated the country’s opposition parties. Founded in 1971, it represents 4,500 companies and its members generate 85 per cent of Turkey’s total foreign trade, according to the association’s website.While its report made no direct mention of Erdogan or his Justice and Development party, which has governed Turkey for the past 20 years, the intervention will be seen as an attack on the president and his increasingly erratic management of the country’s $765bn economy.The report said that, after witnessing improvements in the 2000s at a time when Turkey was working towards EU membership, indicators on rule of law, accountability and political stability had gone backwards.It obliquely criticised the government’s polarising rhetoric, calling for an approach to solving problems “from the perspective of ‘all of us’ rather than ‘us and them’”. As well as urging for reform of the institutions and laws, it called for a fundamental overhaul of education.The Tusiad report comes just days after Omer Koc, one of Turkey’s top business tycoons, made a rare public intervention to warn of the damage being done by the country’s “exhausting” inflation and spiralling exchange rate.The same day, Turkey’s main opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu visited central bank governor Sahap Kavcioglu to express concern about political interference in the bank.Kilicdaroglu, who over the weekend warned public servants that the opposition would hold them to account for their decisions if they won the next election, said the slide in the lira was harming the country’s businesses and its citizens.“I am clearly and openly calling on Erdogan from here: please respect the central bank’s institutional identity,” he said after their meeting.
154  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.Poland’s Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki will speak in the European parliament today after sending a scathing letter, accusing the EU of mission creep and of “financial blackmail, punishment, and ‘starving’ of unsubordinated states”.The mood in Strasbourg will be awkward, to say the least, particularly as Morawiecki will speak just after European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen — who is under pressure to show a more muscular response to Poland’s rule of law transgressions. And in just two days, Morawiecki will hear the music from fellow leaders, including the Netherlands’ Mark Rutte, who has shown no restraint in taking on several central and eastern European colleagues.In German politics, with Chancellor Angela Merkel on her way out and her finance minister Olaf Scholz on track to succeed her — we’re looking at rising tensions within the nascent coalition over who should inhabit the finance ministry in the new government.And on the insidious practice of online targeted advertising, we’ll unpack arguments of a growing group in the European parliament seeking to ban the practice and what this will mean for the already delayed tech regulation.Mark Rutte, the Netherlands’ long-running prime minister, will be back at the Brussels summit table later this week and has fresh fights to pick with two of the bloc’s eastern member states, writes Mehreen Khan in Brussels.With familiar faces such as Austria’s Sebastian Kurz having departed and Germany’s Angela Merkel on the way out, Rutte is on course to remain a fixture of EU summitry for a while yet. His right-leaning VVD party is leading talks to form another four-party coalition, with Rutte almost certain to retain his job as prime minister.His consistent presence on the EU stage makes him the second longest-serving head of government after Hungary’s Viktor Orban, who is seeking re-election next spring.Rutte’s continued presence is sure to make for some testy encounters with the union’s avowedly illiberal leaders. Orban has been involved in high-profile spats with the Dutch politician, who he claimed “hates” him and Hungary during 2020’s fractious budget negotiations. The pair were at loggerheads again at a summit earlier this year over Budapest’s anti-LGBT+ legislation. Rutte openly told Orban to leave the union if he refused to stick to fundamental values.In line for Dutch ire this week are Poland and Slovenia. Rutte will arrive in Brussels on Thursday after a majority of the country’s MPs said they wanted the Netherlands to block the EU’s approval of more than €36bn in recovery cash until Warsaw could ensure the independence of its judiciary and full compliance with the supremacy of EU law.Although a formal veto is not possible in the recovery fund, Rutte can trigger the “emergency brake” he fought hard to secure in the fund, that would delay approval and force the European Commission to reassess any country’s recovery plan.The most dramatic summit showdown this week might, however, involve the head of the EU’s rotating presidency, Slovenia’s prime minister Janez Jansa. Last week, Rutte made an uncharacteristic Twitter intervention, calling out Jansa for “tastelessly” tweeting a conspiratorial image accusing a host of Dutch MPs for being “puppets” of philanthropist George Soros. Among them was a close Rutte ally, Hans van Baalen, who died earlier this year.Rutte’s appetite to pick public fights with his Visegrad counterparts reflects near overwhelming domestic support in the Netherlands for defending the rule of law and the EU’s fundamental values from attack. With the exception of the Netherlands’ fringe far-right, Rutte’s defiance against Hungary, Poland, and now Slovenia is being cheered on at home.It has become one of the few areas of domestic consensus that Rutte enjoys after months of uncertainty about his future at the apex of Dutch politics.Concerns about greenwashing have grown as sustainable finance has gone mainstream. In this special report on responsible investing, the FT explores how environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing is losing credibility as funds are still holding shares in oil or even coal companies. Loose definitions of ‘sustainable’ are also resulting in investment products that are not as green as they claim to be.“Habeck and Lindner are now in a clinch,” the reporter asked. “Who’ll win?” Christian Lindner declined to answer. But the questioner had a point. One of Germany’s top jobs is now in contention, with two of the country’s most powerful politicians laying claim to it, writes Guy Chazan in Berlin.The job is finance minister.Lindner, leader of the liberal Free Democrats, has made it clear he wants it. But Robert Habeck, co-leader of the Greens, does too — or so many in Berlin believe. A power struggle between these two alpha males looks preprogrammed.Yesterday, Lindner announced that his party had agreed to start formal negotiations with the left-of-centre Social Democrats and the Greens on forming Germany’s next government, making it ever more likely that Angela Merkel will be succeeded by Olaf Scholz, the current finance minister and the SPD’s candidate for chancellor.It’s unclear at this stage what the policies of the “traffic light” coalition will be: the three parties came up with a 12-page summary of agreed policy positions last Friday, after about a week of exploratory talks, but details are sketchy.Still, discussions have broken out over which party should get which ministry. Speaking to Bild Zeitung on Sunday night, Lindner said there were three key departments the SPD, Greens and liberals had to divvy up between them — finance, environment/climate and labour/social. He himself had “expressed [his] willingness” to head up the finance ministry, he said.Lindner’s problem, though, is that the SPD and Greens did better than the FDP in the Bundestag election, so have first dibs on the juiciest jobs in government. Lindner begs to differ. “I wouldn’t deny anyone the competence, but it can’t be the deciding factor what share of the vote you achieved” in the election, he told Bild.Meanwhile, the other parties yesterday tried to squelch the debate about ministerial jobs. “I think you have to talk about personnel,” said Michael Kellner, the Greens’ chair. “But honestly: you do it at the end of the negotiations.”A coalition of members of the European parliament has called on the 100 largest advertisers in Europe to stop tracking users online for the purpose of advertising, writes Javier Espinoza in Brussels.You may not have realised it but you were almost certainly shown ads online based on your address, your age, events you said you attended on social media and even lists of your favourite music you’ve built online.The controversial practice is called targeted advertising and it has grown enormously, thanks to the vast amount of data available on what you get up to online.MEPs are fighting over whether the practice should be banned altogether. The largest group, the European People’s party, and the second-largest — the Socialists and Democrats — are leading the discussion with the latter pushing for a total ban in the upcoming Digital Markets Act, a draft legislation aimed at curbing the power of Big Tech.In the meantime a coalition of MEPs want the chief executives of the largest advertisers in Europe, including Unilever, Procter & Gamble and Volkswagen to “stop contributing to the highly opaque and toxic ecosystem of tracking advertising”. Instead, they want companies to switch to the “less harmful” options already on the market.The legislators argue targeted advertising aims to gather vast amounts of data, often without users consenting or even being aware that they are sharing their personal information and in turn violating their rights to privacy. On top of this breach, the practice is used to manipulate people with targeted ads, for instance during elections, the letter adds.The MEPs argue the practice is “blatantly harming our society” and called on business leaders to adopt alternative models, like the ones implemented already by the New York Times and privacy-focused search engine DuckDuckGo. Both companies have banned targeted advertising as a way of getting new customers.While MEPs may still have to wait for a response from the companies, the letter is indicative of disagreements which are likely to further delay the implementation of the EU’s updated tech regulation.
155  Brussels is seeking to extend its relaxation of state aid rules beyond the end of the year as it comes under pressure from businesses to keep the temporary measures introduced to help them survive the pandemic.Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition chief, said the bloc was looking to extend the relaxation deadline, “hopefully” just one last time, but that arrangements for certain industries would remain after special exemptions were phased out.Her comments come as some governments across the EU try to extricate themselves from the costly support schemes they used to prop up businesses struggling in the face of Covid-19 lockdowns.Speaking to the Financial Times, Vestager said: “We want to present what we are doing with hopefully the last version of the temporary state aid framework,” but that there would be “tools that will help the recovery in these sectors that are still struggling”.She said future state aid would target industries particularly badly hit by the pandemic, such as airlines and the hospitality sector. But she warned that, rather than “pouring in” taxpayers’ money, the bloc needed to use “a little bit of taxpayers’ money to incentivise private investment”.Last June, the European Commission approved a €9bn bailout to help Lufthansa, Germany’s largest airline, survive a dramatic drop in demand.The extraordinary state aid measures needed to be tapered off gradually, Vestager said, while businesses grappled with a drop in demand. “We will phase out the temporary framework but with a relationship to reality . . . we have new challenges coming up that may have a relationship with the pandemic.”She added some of the new features (such as enabling small and medium-sized businesses to access private funding instead of a bank loan) might be given a longer life, “because we consider them to be pro-innovation, pro-competitive”.Since the pandemic, Brussels has granted exceptional aid in more than 650 cases, totalling €3.09tn. So far, however, only a quarter of that amount has been spent because companies in some countries have not needed to use all the funds available. But the commission has also faced criticism that support from the state is distorting competition across the EU.Ryanair has filed legal complaints against the commission’s approval of state aid for airlines, including Germany’s Condor and Austrian Airlines. Some member states, including the Netherlands, Sweden and Finland, are opposed to the extension, according to multiple people with direct knowledge of the matter. Despite the opposition, the commission is expected to extend the relaxation of state aid rules until spring next year, according to two people with knowledge of the plans. “The picture points to a targeted limited prolongation,” said a person working on the extension. “The plan is to extend it just one more time unless the situation changes.”Asked about the difficulties of removing temporary aid, Vestager said: “When there is a crisis you spend more and in good times you have to spend less. That is something you need to realise in these kinds of jobs. People don’t like that [but] it comes with the job description.”An official announcement of the extension is expected in the next few weeks, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter.
156  France has used digital assets and blockchain technology in a series of bond transactions, marking one of the most significant trials to date of cryptocurrencies in a leading established market.A consortium of France’s biggest financial market participants utilised a digital currency issued by the Banque de France as part of the 10-month experiment in the country’s debt market.The trial was led by the securities depository Euroclear and included many of France’s largest banks, as well as the French public debt office and the central bank, and used a system developed by US-based IBM.The pilot was part of a scheme commissioned by the Banque de France in March last year to explore how central bank-issued digital currencies would exchange and settle if they had been turned into tokens, with deals recorded on a digital ledger. Typically deals are reconciled between parties, recorded and assets transferred at a single authority such as a central bank or securities depository.It comes as global regulators are urging central banks to act in the face of the growth in crypto assets this year. Policymakers are worried that private sector initiatives around payments and cryptocurrency issuance could lead to central banks losing control of monetary policy.The consortium included BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole CIB, HSBC, and Société Générale. The groups traded the government bonds as securities “tokens” and settled them with cryptocurrencies supplied by the central bank.The project tested the usefulness of a central bank currency on a range of everyday activities, such as issuing new bonds, using them in repurchase agreements, as well as paying coupons and redeeming deals.The experiment ran almost 500 instructions in both primary and secondary markets. Euroclear declined to disclose the value of the trades.“We have together successfully been able to measure the inherent benefits of this technology, concluding that the central bank digital currencies can settle central bank money safely and securely,” said Isabelle Delorme, deputy chief executive of Euroclear France.Veteran policymaker Benoît Cœuré warned central banks last month to act more quickly to develop official digital assets because new technologies such as decentralised finance posed a threat to depository institutions and intermediaries such as banks and depositories. But central banks’ efforts to create digital currencies are uneven.While China, Sweden and the Bahamas are at an advanced stage, leading policymakers in Europe and the US have committed only to exploring the possibility of launching their own.“We are rapidly moving towards fundamental change in the post-trade market infrastructure,” said Soren Mortensen, global director of financial markets at IBM.“This project went well beyond previous blockchain initiatives because it successfully tested most central securities depository and central bank processes whilst eliminating current interim steps, such as reconciliation between market intermediaries,” he added.
157  Peter Marki-Zay, the small town mayor turned opposition leader, was such a long-shot to win Hungary’s first-ever national primary contest that supporters had set up his victory speech at a Budapest craft beer pub.His shock result in Sunday’s run-off vote has catapulted Marki-Zay to the helm of an opposition coalition that came together late last year with a single aim: to unseat veteran strongman premier Viktor Orban in elections due in the spring.“We won the battle, but we need to win the war,” Marki-Zay told a jubilant crowd, who on Sunday evening filled the street outside the Madhouse venue. He went on to describe Orban and his rightwing Fidesz government as “the most corrupt in Hungary’s thousand-year history”. Marki-Zay, a conservative who campaigned on a shoestring without the backing of a political party, until recently trailed better-known names who also sought to lead the coalition, such as Gergely Karacsony, liberal mayor of Budapest, and Peter Jakab, leader of the centre-right Jobbik party.But after securing his place in the second round of the primary, he convincingly beat the centre-left candidate Klara Dobrev thanks to a successful grassroots campaign that canvassed voters door to door.“He promises a cleaner public life,” said Katalin Lukacsi, a former member of Fidesz’s Christian Democratic alliance who became disillusioned with its cronyism and rightward drift and now works for Marki-Zay. “Of course in top-level politics that’s not enough but it gives us tremendous motivation.”Mujtaba Rahman, analyst at Eurasia Group, said the primary contest, where turnout topped 600,000 votes in each of the two rounds, “had given a huge boost to the entire opposition” that was “unprecedented” since Orban became premier in 2010.“They’re now in their most competitive position since Fidesz took office,” he added, estimating that their chance of securing a majority in the parliamentary election likely to take place in April had doubled to 40 per cent thanks to Marki-Zay’s breakthrough.But even with momentum on his side, the 49-year-old will have his work cut out to defeat an incumbent who holds a firm grip on politics and business in Hungary and controls the vast majority of the traditional media.As Rahman pointed out, Marki-Zay also had “virtually no power in parliament without cross-party support” as he is not a member of any of the parties in the opposition alliance.Marki-Zay, a devout Catholic father of seven, is a political outsider who mixes old-fashioned views, such as intolerance for corruption and fiscal prudence that borders on thrift, with liberal positions, notably an embrace of minority rights.A powerful speaker with a PhD in economic history, he worked mostly in the private sector, including a stint in North America as manager in a car parts company, before returning to Hungary in 2009. His first political office came only in 2018, when he ran successfully to become mayor of Hodmezovasarhely, the southern town where he grew up.Marki-Zay’s budget primary campaign — which was a vivid contrast with the glitzy Orban election rallies — was on view on Sunday, when he climbed out of a battered Skoda to greet supporters and give media interviews, before withdrawing to a corner of the pub to finish his speech on an old-fashioned leather-bound note pad.Zoltan Miklosi, a political scientist at Central European University, described Marki-Zay as an “unusual populist” in part because he has been a vocal supporter of the LGBTQ rights issue at the centre of one of Orban’s numerous disputes with Brussels.“Something extraordinary just happened,” Miklosi wrote on Twitter. “Hungary’s politics became highly unpredictable. Buckle up, we are in for a bumpy ride.”Orban’s government has been threatened with legal action unless it drops anti-LGBTQ legislation that the European Commission has labelled discriminatory, a dispute that has also delayed critical EU recovery funds.Marki-Zay has drawn a clear line between himself and Orban, telling supporters on Sunday: “We will always stand beside homosexuals, like we support Jews or gypsies. Equal rights to all Hungarians.”Speaking to the Financial Times just before his victory was confirmed, he said that if he became prime minister he would steer the country on a firmly pro-western path and reverse Orban’s policy of seeking close ties with Russia and China.“For us the EU, Nato and western values are more important than the eastern opening,” he said. “We want to be faithful citizens of the EU.”Gabor Torok, a political analyst, said there was no doubt that Marki-Zay posed a challenge for Fidesz, which had expected to face a traditionally leftwing or liberal candidate. Observers agree it will be more difficult for Marki-Zay to be labelled a leftwing puppet, which Orban often calls his challengers.Although the coalition spans the liberal left to the greens and the centre-right, few in Hungary have any doubts such a broad alliance will hold for the duration of the election campaign — although what happens after that is less clear.The parties are so interdependent until the vote “that only a fatal explosion of irrationality could blow this apart”, Torok noted in an article on the news website Index.hu.Gabor Kerpel-Fronius, Budapest’s liberal deputy mayor, agreed that now was the time to put aside political and ideological differences to focus on removing the prime minister.“Orban has made it impossible for us to pursue democratic politics. We united to restore that,” he said. “We can only pursue our individual politics once we’ve completed what we created this alliance for — victory in April.”
158  Russia has ordered Nato to close its liaison office in Moscow and recalled diplomats accredited to the western military alliance, the foreign ministry said, in effect severing diplomatic ties as relations between the two continue to sink to their lowest level since the cold war.The measures, which cut off the main channel of communication between Moscow and the alliance, will come into effect on November 1, Russia’s foreign ministry said in a statement.Nato earlier this month expelled eight members of the Russian delegation to the alliance that it described as “undeclared intelligence officers”, reducing the maximum size of the Russian delegation to 10 diplomatic staff.“We do not have the conditions for even basic diplomatic activity as a result of intentional steps by Nato,” Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said at a briefing on Monday.“In response to Nato’s actions, we are suspending the work of our permanent mission to Nato,” Lavrov said. The accreditations of Nato staff in Moscow would also be withdrawn, he added.If Nato officials needed to contact Moscow, they could do so via the Russian ambassador to Belgium, Lavrov said. Diplomatic representatives of western Nato members could serve a similar function in Moscow, the foreign ministry statement said.“We regret these steps,” Nato spokesperson, Oana Lungescu, said in a statement to the Financial Times. “Nato’s policy towards Russia remains consistent. We have strengthened our deterrence and defence in response to Russia’s aggressive actions, while at the same time we remain open to dialogue, including through the Nato-Russia Council.”Relations between the Kremlin and western capitals are at their lowest point since the end of the cold war, after Moscow’s invasion and annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, allegations of Russian meddling in western elections, and the attempted assassination attempt of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.The invasion of Crimea led to the suspension of all practical military co-operation between Russia and Nato, first formalised in 1997. After the attempted assassination of double agent Sergei Skripal in the UK in 2018, Nato reduced the maximum size of the Russian delegation from 30 to 20 diplomats.However, Nato had previously said that channels of communication remained open for the two sides to “exchange information on issues of mutual interest and concern, reduce misunderstandings and increase predictability”.Moscow’s decision to suspend its Nato mission and halt the work of Nato staff in Moscow formally closes those final channels.
159  German banking watchdog BaFin has imposed a draconian cap on N26’s client growth in a rare intervention that will slow down the expansion of the Berlin-based online bank. The measure was imposed by BaFin in early October after the regulator became increasingly dissatisfied with organisational flaws at the fast-growing bank.As a result, N26 will only be able to accept 50,000 and 70,000 new customers a month until it has fixed a number of specific issues flagged by BaFin, down from the average of 170,000 clients it had been taking in this year.The move is the latest escalation in a long-running tussle between BaFin and N26, which has been criticising the lender’s controls for more than two years.In 2019, BaFin ordered the lender to remove backlogs in IT monitoring, establish written descriptions of processes and workflows, and to check the identity of some of its existing customers for a second time.Six months ago, the regulator parachuted a special supervisor into the bank tasked with monitoring improvements in anti-money laundering controls that BaFin has ordered. In September, N26 was fined €4.25m for belatedly flagging suspicious transactions of clients to the regulator. BaFin’s cap on new clients -- painful for a bank that has emphasised client growth since its founding in 2013 -- will be officially announced by BaFin early next month after a four-week time for appeal has expired.It was pre-emptively disclosed by N26 on Monday alongside a new funding round of €780m which drove the company’s value to €7.8bn, a record level for a German fintech. “N26 has agreed with the German regulator to temporarily onboard a maximum of 50,000 - 70,000 customers per month,” the lender said in a statement on Monday, adding that it wants to “lay even stronger foundations for sustainable future growth.”N26 added that it may have to turn away new clients, which would then be “temporarily redirected to a waiting list” given the “tremendous interest and demand for the N26’s banking products”. The lender stressed that its existing customers will not be affected.In a separate statement to the FT, N26 said that its “teams have already implemented a number of measures to strengthen governance and compliance structures over the course of this year”.The lender added that although the measures would have an impact on growth in the short run, “we don’t expect a significant impact of this temporary change on our business plan”.BaFin declined to comment. Valentin Stalf, chief executive and co-founder, said in a press release that the latest funding round puts N26 “in pole position to become one of the biggest retail banks in Europe, all without a single branch”.US-based tech investors Third Point Ventures and Coatue Management led the latest funding round while existing investors also took part, the company said.
160  The EU risks becoming a “centrally managed organism run by institutions deprived of democratic control”, Poland’s prime minister has warned amid an escalating battle over the rule of law between Warsaw and Brussels.In a letter to EU heads of government published on Monday, Mateusz Morawiecki insisted Poland remained “a loyal member” of the union, which it joined in 2004. But he warned against penalising member states financially — as the commission is considering doing in its stand-off with Poland — and said that EU institutions exceeding their power was “dangerous to the continuation” of the union.The Polish prime minister was writing ahead of an appearance on Tuesday before the European Parliament in Strasbourg at which he is expected to reiterate his defence of Poland’s handling of rule-of-law issues. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, is due to speak in the same debate.Warsaw and Brussels have spent much of the past five years at odds over changes by Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) that give politicians sweeping powers over the judiciary, and which the commission regards as posing a fundamental threat to judicial independence.In recent weeks, those tensions have hit a new level after the Polish constitutional court ruled that key parts of EU law are not compatible with the Polish constitution, issuing a direct challenge to the EU’s legal order, and sparking questions about Poland’s long-term position in the bloc.“Unfortunately, today we are dealing with a very dangerous phenomenon whereby various European Union institutions usurp powers they do not have under the treaties and impose their will on member states,” Morawiecki wrote in the letter.“This is particularly evident today as financial tools are being used for such a purpose. Without any legal basis, there is an attempt to force member states to do what the institutions of the union tell them to do — irrespective of any legal basis for imposing such demands. Such a practice cannot be accepted. ”Morawiecki’s letter and his speech to a chamber of what will probably be mostly hostile lawmakers on Tuesday are a response to what one Polish official said was “the language of open blackmail” from those calling for financial penalties against Warsaw.“We are treated unfairly. [He] will defend principles and Poland’s status in the EU,” the official said. “It is up to our opponents how it will go.”In a sign of the hardline mood in Warsaw, Poland’s justice minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, said on Monday that he would ask the government to submit a request to the ECJ to assess the independence of Germany’s judges.“Since the EU is based on the equality of all its states and citizens, it is necessary to assess the situation in Germany, where the choice of judges to their equivalent of the supreme court is of a completely political nature,” he wrote on Twitter.“If EU institutions are casting doubt on the independence of judges in Poland, what is there to say about German judges[?]”The commission has a number of tools at its disposal as it seeks to hold the line on rule-of-law matters. These include bringing a new infringement action over the Polish tribunal ruling. It has also thus far withheld approval of Poland’s €36bn bid for EU recovery fund money, which Warsaw submitted in early May.Brussels is also debating when to take initial steps in deploying a new conditionality mechanism permitting the commission to withhold funding to member states where breaches of the rule of law affect the budget or financial interests of the union.The parliament’s legal affairs committee last week recommended that the commission be taken to court for failing to act despite several alleged rule-of-law violations.Rasmus Andresen, a German Green MEP, said the commission’s approach had been “quite disappointing”, as he called for von der Leyen to go beyond “strong words” on Tuesday. “We need to see a tougher line,” he said. “The commission has already waited too long. Now it is time to act.”
161  The writer is a hacker and head of IBM X-ForceFor more than 20 years, businesses around the world have been hiring hackers. They want us to find exploitable loopholes in their “armour” and break in as far as we can before they’re able to figure out we’re there. “Are we impenetrable?” is the universal question. You may well be asking the same about your organisation. And I can answer with confidence that you most certainly are not. There is always a way in. Always.The best security advice for government and business leaders is to simply “give up” on trying to keep me out. Assume I’m already in, finding my way to your most prized possessions. What you actually need to trouble yourself with is, what can you do to stop me?The Biden administration’s recent cyber security executive order provides guidance to federal agencies, namely to establish a “zero trust” relationship with their supply chains to protect data. Zero trust is not just a buzz phrase, single action or tool the industry is marketing. It is a set of principles upon which to build a security strategy, and it’s largely founded on the assumption of compromise. Last year, the US was the number one target of cyber attacks while Europe also experienced an onslaught of ransomware attacks. We need a radical new defence.There is a misconceived notion that the security arena is a battlefield. It is not. It is a chess board and requires foresight and calculated pawn placement to protect the king — your data. If your main focus lies on keeping me out of your environment, then it’s already check mate. Your mission should be to buy time, slow me down and ultimately contain my attack.Businesses must therefore make it as hard as possible for adversaries to exploit the relationships that allow them to move laterally through the corporate network. They can do this by distrusting anyone within their data’s environment and repeatedly corroborating that all users are who they say they are, and that they act like it too. That last part is crucial, because while identities are easy to compromise and imitate, behaviours are not.The real red light is the unchecked privileged access that governments and companies grant their supply-chain partners via passwords. Think of this as an identity badge that lets third parties enter a company’s building, except the building is the corporate system. In the past year, in nearly 99 per cent of the cloud networks that my team were hired to hack, password attacks got us initial access.Why not double down on hardening these systems and better detection strategies? Because relying on stronger authentication and better prevention tools is what got us to the current state. Adversaries have found their ammunition in the complexity maze that businesses have built around them. This is how Russian threat actors were able to remain undetected on government networks for nearly nine months during the 2020 SolarWinds breach.The mindset that I’m advocating is strategic, not defeatist. Business must realise there is no constant state of security, but they can be prepared. This will look different for each organisation, but it starts with knowing precisely what your most critical data is and where it lies. Who has access to it, who could get access to it and who really needs access to it — how much and for how long. It’s about cutting off unnecessary pathways that an adversary could exploit.Government agencies such as the National Security Agency and Department of Homeland Security in the US or the National Cyber Security Centre in the UK already realise that the game has changed. Leaders across industry and government who commit to a culture shift in which trust becomes just as much of a currency as data will gain a strategic advantage — limiting the moves an adversary can make, forcing them to make more noise and ultimately leaving them less room to execute their attack.
162  Germany’s Social Democrats, Greens and liberal Free Democrats (FDP) are to launch formal talks on creating a coalition government after the FDP gave the green light to negotiations.The move comes three weeks after national elections, which were narrowly won by the SPD and saw Angela Merkel’s ruling Christian Democratic Union slump to the worst result in its history.If the talks go according to the parties’ plan, Olaf Scholz, Germany’s finance minister and Social Democrat candidate for chancellor, will succeed Merkel, who is stepping down after 16 years as Germany’s leader.Christian Lindner, FDP leader, said a joint meeting of the party’s parliamentary caucus and its national executive on Monday had voted unanimously to start talks with the SPD and Greens.“Germany needs a stable government, Germany can’t be leaderless,” he said. “Germany needs a sweeping modernisation of its society, economy and state.”The so-called traffic light coalition — named after the three parties’ traditional colours — will be the first such combination in Germany’s postwar history. It could prove awkward — the FDP and Greens, in particular, disagree strongly over fiscal policy, the role of the state and how to tackle climate change.However, the three overcame some of those differences over eight days of exploratory talks after the election. These resulted in a 12-page paper published last Friday summing up policies they could all agree on, that will now form the basis of formal coalition negotiations.The paper reflected some of the key demands of each party. The SPD won a commitment to raising Germany’s minimum wage, the Greens a suite of environmental measures to fight climate change, including a much earlier phaseout of coal power than is currently envisaged. The FDP was able to fend off all attempts by the other two to raise taxes or soften Germany’s strict rules on new borrowing.Lindner said it was “no surprise that there are still big policy differences” between the FDP, Greens and SPD. At the outset, he said, it was a “marriage of convenience”: “it’s up to all the participants to see if something can come of it”.He said the three would all have to exhibit “a great deal of tolerance” and “be prepared for new thinking”. Then there was a real chance that a new, reform-minded government could be created that would make Germany “freer, more sustainable, more digital, more modern and more competitive”.The FDP, which was last in government in Merkel’s second cabinet between 2009 and 2013, was the last of the three partners to give the green light to coalition talks. The SPD did so on Friday and the Greens on Sunday.
163  Countering the security threat from the rise of China will be an important part of Nato’s future rationale, the alliance’s head has said, marking a significant rethink of the western group’s objectives that reflects the US’s geostrategic pivot to Asia.In an interview with the Financial Times, Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said that while China was not an “adversary”, it was having an impact on European security through its cyber capabilities, new technologies and long-range missiles. How to defend Nato allies from those threats will be “thoroughly” addressed in the alliance’s new doctrine for the coming decade, he said.The military alliance has spent decades focused on countering Russia and, since 2001, terrorism. The new focus on China comes amid a determined shift in the US’s geopolitical orientation away from Europe to a hegemonic conflict with Beijing.“Nato is an alliance of North America and Europe. But this region faces global challenges: terrorism, cyber but also the rise of China. So when it comes to strengthening our collective defence, that’s also about how to address the rise of China,” Stoltenberg said. “What we can predict is that the rise of China will impact our security. It already has.”Nato will adopt its new Strategic Concept at a summit next summer, which will outline the alliance’s purpose for the following 10 years. The current version, adopted in 2010, does not mention China.Nato is seeking a new direction following the end of its 20-year deployment in Afghanistan, while discussions over the future of the US military presence in Europe are ongoing.Stoltenberg, the former Norwegian prime minister who is set to step down next year after almost eight years at the helm, said Nato allies would seek to “scale down” activities outside of their borders and “scale up” their domestic defensive resilience to better resist external threats.“China is coming closer to us . . . We see them in the Arctic. We see them in cyber space. We see them investing heavily in critical infrastructure in our countries.“And of course they have more and more high-range weapons that can reach all Nato allied countries. They are building many, many silos for long-range intercontinental missiles,” he said.China tested a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile in August, the FT reported over the weekend, demonstrating an advanced long-range weapons capability that surprised US intelligence and underscored the rapid military progress Beijing has made on next-generation weapons.But any suggestion of a shift away from deterring Russian aggression would meet protests from eastern European member states that view Moscow as an existential threat and the alliance as their sole security guarantor.Stoltenberg said Russia and China should not be seen as separate threats. “First of all China and Russia work closely together,” he said. “Second, when we invest more in technology . . . that’s about both of them.”“This whole idea of distinguishing so much between China, Russia, either the Asia-Pacific or Europe — it is one big security environment and we have to address it all together. What we do on readiness, on technology, on cyber, on resilience matters for all these threats. You don’t put a label,” he added.Stoltenberg said the hasty withdrawal of Nato forces from Afghanistan in August was “an obvious choice” after the US decision to leave the country. He said that while European militaries might have been able to remain without US support, political leaders could not justify a continued presence.“It was partly a military aspect: capabilities. But I think fundamentally more important was the political aspect: we went into Afghanistan after an attack on the United States,” he said. “Militarily it would have been possible [to stay]. But politically, I regard it as absolutely unrealistic . . . that was the main reason.”
164  This is the edited transcript of a conversation between Jens Stoltenberg, Nato secretary-general, Roula Khalaf, Financial Times editor, and Henry Foy, FT European diplomatic correspondent, which took place on October 14 in Brussels.Financial Times: The US economic and security focus is on China — and little else. But where does Nato fit in? Does Nato have to also pivot? If not, how do you maintain Nato’s relevance?Jens Stoltenberg: If anything, the rise of China makes Nato more needed, more important, also for the United States. I’ve been many times in all my discussions with American politicians, Congress members and so on. The message is that they are concerned about the rise of China, but they also then realise that, if anything, it is a great advantage for the United States to have friends and allies. It’s good to have friends.That was one of the main messages in my speech to the US Congress back in 2019. It was that in a more unpredictable or more uncertain world — and where the global balance of power is shifting — then for great power to have 29 friends and allies is a huge advantage. I feel that the United States understands that. So, it’s in the security interest of the United States to build alliances.Nato’s not something that they do to be nice to Europe. Nato is in the interest of the United States, as it is in the interest of Europe to stand together with North America.FT: But for the rest of Nato, the significance of what we’re referring to as the new cold war is completely different. The primary concern is still Russia.JS: Of course, we are 30 allies and there are differences on many issues, including on analysis and assessments about China. At the same time, we have come a long way on China in Nato. The first time we mentioned China is in the communique, the statement from the Nato summit in London in December 2019. Before that, China was not mentioned in any policy document.There is one sentence saying that the rise of China poses opportunities and challenges for Nato, which we have to address together.That was a significant step for Nato. Then, this summer we actually agreed a lot of common language and I expect that when we meet in Madrid the rise of China, the impact of China and the shifting the balance of power has on Nato will be thoroughly addressed in the new strategic concept, among other topics. China is not mentioned in one single word in Nato’s current strategic concept.FT: What do you mean by “thoroughly addressed”?JS: I expect that China will be an important part of the strategic concept . . . China’s coming closer to us. The 5G discussion demonstrates that. In the beginning, most allies regarded 5G as a solely commercial issue. After discussions among allies at Nato, all allies realise that this is something that has security implications. This also happened just over the last couple of years. That was something that happened in Europe, in our own countries.FT: Will China be elevated to one of or THE biggest challenge?JS: No, because I’m very much against this kind of ranking effects and challenges because they are so different. Secondly, because we have all been very bad at predicting the next crisis before, so why should we be able to do that now?We have to be prepared for the unforeseen, but to try to see the unforeseen I think is a very difficult task. So, hardly anyone predicted the fall of the Berlin Wall, or 9/11, or the annexation of Crimea. These have been pivotal things for all of us. So, I’m not saying we shouldn’t try to look into the future, but that’s a very difficult task, regardless of whether you try to look into the security environment or [otherwise].What we can predict is that the rise of China will impact our security. It already has. What is hard to predict is exactly in what way and what will be the next precise or concrete challenges we will be faced with. But Nato has come a long way in recognising that China matters for our security.We don’t regard China as an enemy or an adversary. We strongly believe it’s necessary to engage with China. There are opportunities. The rise of China has been important to lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. It’s important for our economies. We need to engage with China on issues like climate change or arms control.But at the same time, they now have the second largest defence budget in the world. They have the biggest navy in the world. They will soon have the biggest economy in the world. They coerce their neighbours. We see how they are behaving in the South China Sea and they actually bully countries which are not behaving as they want.You have seen the way they have treated Canada, Australia and my own country, Norway, when the Norwegian Peace Prize committee awarded the Peace Prize to a Chinese dissident.FT: And Lithuania.JS: Yes, Lithuania. So, we need to find that balance between seeing the opportunities but also the challenges and prepare for both of them.FT: What can Nato bring to the table?JS: So, first of all, this is what we do together — North America and Europe. So, it’s not about we supporting the US. I don’t like this idea of pivot because that sounds like we’re moving away from something. The reality is that Nato is moving home to address global challenges. Nato is an alliance of North America and Europe, but this region faces global challenges. Terrorism, cyber, but also the rise of China.So, when it comes to strengthening our collective defence that’s also about how to address the rise of China. When we, for instance, now make technology an important thing for Nato it’s about addressing almost all the challenges we see, but also including that China is investing heavily in new disruptive technologies . . .Part of what we do to strengthen Nato, part of this fundamental shift from focus outside, also combat operations out of area, to building security at home.Also, I mentioned technology. China is coming closer to us . . . for instance, in Africa. We see them in the Arctic. We see them in cyber space. We see China investing heavily in critical infrastructure in our countries. Of course, the fact that they have more and more longer-range weapons that can reach all Nato allied countries . . . They are building many, many silos for long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles.So, again, I think this whole idea of in a way distinguishing so much between China, Russia, either Asia-Pacific or Europe, it’s one big security environment and we have to address it all together. What we do on the readiness, on technology, on cyber, on resilience matters for all districts? We don’t put the label. It’s about strengthening our alliance to any potential threat.FT: It must frustrating for you to hear Nato described as being in existential crisis, or — as some say — braindead. What is Nato’s relevance today?JS: To protect all allies and, in uncertain times, it’s even more important to have strong international institutions like Nato. “One for all, all for one” has been the core message, the core policy of Nato for more than 70 years. But of course, the success of Nato is that we have changed when the world changed.We have been the most successful alliance in history for two reasons. Our ability to stand together and to change. For 40 years, we did one thing and that was to deter the Soviet Union. I grew up in the Cold War and Norway bordered the Soviet Union and it was very well-defined.Then actually, after the Cold War ended and then it was stated that either Nato has to go out of business or out of area. And we went out of area. Nato helped to end the two ethnic wars in the Balkans. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo. That was not obvious in ’89, but we went in the mid-90s and then we did something we had never done before. It was the first time we had ever fired a shot, it was in the Balkans.Then we changed Nato fundamentally. We helped to stabilise our closest neighbourhood and end two ethnic wars. Then 9/11 changed Nato totally again. Because since then we have been at the forefront fighting terrorism. Not only Afghanistan, but in Iraq and many other places. In the global coalition to defeat Daesh. Now, we are changing again.FT: To what?JS: We are reducing, we are scaling down what we do out of Nato territory. We are significantly scaling up what we do within our territory. Meaning we have since 2014 implemented the biggest reinforcement of our collective defence since the end of the Cold War.For the first time in many years, all allies are investing more in defence. We have to remember that until 2014 all allies reduced defence spending. Now, for seven consecutive years allies have increased defence spending. That adds a lot to our collective defence. We have tripled the size of the Nato response force.For the first time in our history, we have combat-ready troops in the eastern part of the alliance, in the Baltic countries and Poland. Then we invest in technology. We change our command structure. We do all of this. We have established cyber as a military domain alongside air, sea, land and space.All of that is a fundamental shift for Nato, away from crisis management outside our borders to collective defence in Europe.That collective defence responds to many threats and challenges. Because this whole idea that we either look to Russia, or to China, or to somewhere else, it’s the wrong way. Because it goes together. First of all, China and Russia work closely together. Second, when we invest more in technology, when we increase our collective defence and develop technology, that’s about both of them.FT: Europeans are talking a lot more about strategic autonomy and building up European defence. Sometimes that sounds to me as something that would be parallel to Nato. Is it needed?JS: There are many different interpretations of European defence. Since 2014, we have been able to lift Nato/EU co-operation to unprecedented levels. I strongly believe in Nato and the EU working together. We meet. I have a very close working relationship with President Ursula von der Leyen, with President Charles Michel, with a lot of European leaders. I participate regularly in different EU meetings, including with the EU Commission or the European Council and we invite them to Nato meetings.We are working on cyber. We have a Nato presence in the Aegean Sea. In Kosovo, we are working more closely with the EU now than ever.FT: So, you don’t consider this a concern?JS: No, but it depends on what you mean by European defence . . . Any meaningful strengthening of European defence has to mean more defence spending. There is one institution that has pushed for more defence spending and that is Nato. The good news is that European allies are spending more.FT: Isn’t there a problem that the French are building more French tanks, the Italians are building more Italian helicopters, the Poles are building more Polish rocket launchers and they don’t talk to each other unless Nato is there?JS: But these are national defence budgets, so they are available for all kinds of operations and missions. But of course, European defence is about what European allies do and how much they invest. There’s no way you can have strong European defence without more European defence spending. That was a Nato decision in 2014. Nato has been not only welcoming, but actually actively pushing for that.The other part of European defence I strongly welcome is of course new capabilities. Nato has precise capability targets where we agreed [on] so many planes, so many drones and so many battle tanks and so on. Of course, we urge all allies to meet those targets and we develop them together.I also welcome EU defence efforts on capability developments and therefore, I suppose for instance, the European Defence Fund, PESCO. These are instruments to develop new nationally-owned capabilities.You’re right, there are challenges. For instance, the United States, they have many battle tanks, but they have one type. In Europe, there are many fewer battle tanks and nine different types. So, of course, the cost per unit is so much higher. It’s the same for frigates, for planes, for armoured vehicles.This is a message not only for me, but also from the European Union. They need to address the fragmentation of the European defence industry. Of course, whatever the EU can do to help us to increase defence spending, provide new capabilities and address the fragmentation of the European defence industry. Again, strongly support it and called for by Nato for years.The good news is we are moving in the right direction. Nato and the EU are working together and we should not create any kind of contradiction, actually this is something we actually work on and address together.What we should avoid is duplication and competition. Therefore, what we need is not new structures and increased demand for existing capabilities. We need more capabilities. More new capabilities. It doesn’t help in a way to just move around the same capabilities. But I have been assured many times by European leaders that they don’t want this.FT: Do you trust them when they say that?JS: There’s not any meaning in the EU competing with Nato because more than 90 per cent of the people living in the European Union, they live in a Nato country. So, I’m confident that European allies see the need for complementarity.FT: But the problem eastern countries have with this talk of autonomy from [Emmanuel] Macron and others is that they ultimately don’t trust a Brussels Franco-German-led defence as much as they trust an American-led one.JS: The whole idea with Nato is that we should all come and defend Latvia, Riga, or Lithuania, but of course the United States being the biggest ally will carry the biggest burden. But one of the reasons why we have deployed battle groups in the Baltic countries is that, of course, there are around a thousand in each battle group. But perhaps the most important thing is that they are multinational.Nato is already there. One US-led, one UK, one Canadian-led and then one German. So, of course, that makes a huge difference and the idea is that we should all come to assist one ally under attack.Of course, 80 per cent of Nato’s defence expenditures come from non-EU allies. That is how it is today. We would like European allies as EU members to invest more and that will of course change that ratio. We have been pushing for better burden share for a long time, but currently 80 per cent.FT: What do you make of the debate over a European army?JS: There are different interpretations of what that means. I’ve seen that Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer and also Ursula von der Leyen when she was defence minister, she spoke not about a European army, but an army of the Europeans.If this means more European soldiers, battleships, drones, fighter jets then it’s something we strongly welcome and urge. If it means new structures competing for the same capabilities then it will undermine our security. But I have been assured that is not the plan.So, we don’t need new structures. What we need is additional new capabilities and the way to address that, to get that, is more spending and address the fragmentation of the European defence industry. I hope that PESCO and the European Defence Fund can do that . . . Let’s discuss the concrete proposals.FT: What lessons did you draw for Nato from the Afghanistan withdrawal?JS: We have started a lessons-learnt process at Nato. We had to be clear and honest and I will not prejudge that process . . . Of course, one lesson is that it is easier to start a military operation than to end it. So, there then has to be always a high threshold for any use of military force.At the same time, we have to be prepared for situations in the future where we use military force outside of our territory, as we, for instance, did recently in the fight against Daesh. Nato allies, Nato as part of the global coalition, defeated or liberated the territory that was controlled by Isis in Iraq and Syria by the use of military force. There was no other option.We should have a high threshold. We have to realise that if we go in with military force there is always a difficult challenge about how to end that operation. But the conclusion cannot be that we never use military force because as late as Iraq and Syria we saw the need.Our main task was to fight terrorism and for 20 years we have prevented any terrorist attack being organised from Afghanistan. We degraded al-Qaeda and we will continue to stay vigilant to prevent Afghanistan from once again becoming a safe haven for international terrorists. That was the main task — to fight terrorism.Something we did together with the UN, the EU and allies was to try to build a democratic, stable Afghanistan. That was much harder, but then we need to learn some lessons together as a whole international community. Because when it comes to democratic reform, fighting corruption, we helped the international community to do that by providing security, but that was something we all did together.FT: There was nothing that you could do about the US decision and timing of the withdrawal even if you disagreed, so aren’t there lessons there?JS: We had close consultations on the decision to end our military mission in Afghanistan. We had three ministerial meetings. I chaired them. We had many ambassadorial meetings. Of course, there were different views, but because we all realised we were faced with a very hard and difficult dilemma, either to leave and risk the Taliban coming back — we were clear about that — or stay but then risk an open-ended military mission with more casualties.FT: Europeans would have stayed?JS: The reality was that I think we all realised the risks with both options, but when the United States — after consulting with allies — decided to end the US presence in Afghanistan it was obvious that also European allies also would come to the same conclusion. Partly because, of course, the US has the strongest and most capabilities . . . Of course, European allies and Canada have capabilities. But I think fundamentally more important was the political aspect . . . Politically, I regard it as absolutely unrealistic if I was a national decision maker to go to my parliament and my people and to say that the United States have left, they have ended their mission, we went in there to protect the United States — who invoked Article 5, the United States — they have now left.FT: What should Nato be doing on climate change?JS: We have decided to do is to make climate change an important task for Nato because climate change fuels conflicts. So, it increases competition over scarce resources . . . Climate change matters for our security therefore it matters for Nato.We will help to reduce emissions from member states. We see that member states are investing in everything from biofuels for their jet planes to solar panels to power camps and equipment and many other energy-efficient vehicles and so on.At the end of the day, nations have to decide the precise numbers. But of course, there is no way to reach net zero without including the military or armed forces.In Paris, we agreed to include the different fuels and so on used by the military. The military is — at least in theory — part of the Paris Agreement. But what we need is actually proper systems for mapping military emissions . . . We are now in the process with the best experts to develop a system for mapping military emissions. The statistics have not been easily available.In parallel with that . . . some work is done to also help to develop new and greener technologies. The important message is we need green technologies that are not undermining the effect or the strength of our military capabilities. We cannot have green battle tanks that are not moving fast enough, or jet planes that don’t reach a sufficient speed.FT: What was your reaction to the Aukus deal that unnerved France so much?JS: I understand that France is disappointed . . . But at the same time, this is an agreement which is not directed against Europe or Nato. Nato allies have agreed to work more closely with their Asia-Pacific partners on technology, on cyber, on maritime.We should do so for many reasons. France is a key ally. As I said, they are part of the UK-led battle group in Estonia. They do air policing in the Baltic region. They spend 2 per cent [of their GDP] on defence. They have high-end capabilities. They have the willingness to deploy.
165  The Italian government is attempting to push back pressing deadlines over its sale of Monte dei Paschi di Siena as negotiations with would-be acquirer UniCredit hit a major stumbling block.The Italian Treasury, which bailed out MPS in 2017, is required to sell off its stake in the world’s oldest bank by December 31 under conditions set by the European Commission.But negotiators for the Treasury and UniCredit are “significantly apart” over how much capital the government would be required to inject into MPS, according to people involved in the talks.“There is a material distance between what UniCredit is now presenting as a deal that could work for them and what is acceptable for the Treasury,” said a person close to the negotiations.The fate of MPS has become a fierce battleground in Italian politics, sparking infighting in the coalition government led by former European Central Bank president Mario Draghi.The Treasury has indicated it is unwilling to provide much more capital than its initial projection of €2bn to €2.5bn, which would be raised through a rights issue. But a person close to UniCredit said the Milan-based lender would require “much, much more capital” than even €5bn, which would “only just help MPS to survive in the short term”.People involved in the negotiations on both sides said the size of the capital injection was proving a major stumbling block and that each party would be prepared to walk away from a deal rather than conceding ground.One negotiator said “the chances of a deal at this point are 50 per cent or less”, adding that there was just a 5 per cent possibility of an agreement being announced by UniCredit’s third-quarter results on October 28, a deadline both parties had been striving to meet.UniCredit plans to present a new business strategy in the fourth quarter of the year and has told the Treasury that any deal over MPS will need to be agreed by the end of October as the protracted negotiations have held up its investor day.“Negotiations were expected to last until September, so now we are really running short of time,” said a person close to UniCredit. “This market is expecting a strategy update from us — we cannot postpone it any further.” The impasse has led the Italian government to make inquiries to the EU over whether its deadline to sell the stake in MPS could be pushed back into next year. While finding a single buyer for the 64 per cent stake would prove tricky should the UniCredit deal collapse, Treasury officials are confident they can recapitalise the business and reduce the MPS holding over time in smaller sales.The ministry of finance is also considering extending another deadline that runs out on December 31 over the treatment of deferred tax assets in takeovers. This benefit was introduced to make the MPS takeover more palatable to buyers.“This is a very clear signal that more time is needed and that the Monte dei Paschi operation cannot be closed in a month,” said a person with knowledge of the ministry’s discussions.The government had struggled for several years to attract interest in MPS, but the prospect of a deal was boosted in April with the arrival of Andrea Orcel as chief executive of UniCredit.In July the former UBS and Merrill Lynch dealmaker announced that UniCredit had entered exclusive talks with Rome over acquiring parts of MPS, but crucially on Orcel’s terms.Orcel set out five conditions for the deal to go ahead, including that it had no impact on UniCredit’s capital position and that it would not be weighed down by MPS’s bad loans and legal risks.UniCredit and the Treasury declined to comment.
166  Russia’s Gazprom has damped hopes for additional gas exports to Europe next month as the continent struggles with record prices, despite recent hints from President Vladimir Putin that more could be forthcoming.UK and European gas prices surged as much as 18 per cent on Monday after a keenly awaited pipeline capacity auction showed no increase from Russia either through the Ukrainian pipeline system or lines passing via Poland to north-west Europe.Traders and analysts say the auction’s result is the latest indication that Russia is in little rush to send additional gas to Europe, leaving supplies tight as winter begins and raising the prospect of shortages if the weather is marginally colder than normal.While Putin and Kremlin officials have hinted at sending more gas, they have also alluded to Germany’s approval of the start-up of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline — which bypasses Ukraine — as being key to boosting supplies, alongside companies being willing to sign more long-term contracts.“Gazprom is undoubtedly assuming that Nord Stream 2 will be approved in the relatively near future, and positioning itself accordingly,” said Ron Smith, executive director at BCS Global Markets in Moscow.The level of concern over supplies in Europe sent the benchmark gas contract for November delivery up after the auction results, rising 18 per cent to €104 per megawatt hour, while the equivalent UK contract jumped more than 15 per cent to £2.71 per therm.Prices are more than five times higher than a year ago, posing a threat to the economic recovery from the pandemic, with energy-intensive businesses warning they may need to curtail production.While gas supplies have tightened globally as demand rebounds from the pandemic, with Asian consumption soaring, the International Energy Agency said this month it believed Russia had the capacity to boost exports by about 15 per cent to Europe.Putin last week denied playing politics with gas supplies but indicated additional sales would need to be on Russia’s terms. Gas industry executives and analysts have said that, while Moscow has fulfilled its long-term contracts, additional top-up sales have not been made available as they were in previous years.Gazprom has also let its own storage facilities in Europe fall to very low levels.Russian gas flows on the three main pipeline routes into western Europe had already declined in October to average 261m cubic metres a day compared with 302m cubic metres in September, according to Tom Marzec-Manser of consultancy ICIS.“If all existing routes were fully maximised then western European flows would be closer to 360mcm [a] day,” he added.The operator of Nord Stream 2 said on Monday that it had pumped about 177m cubic metres of gas into the line in preparation for future sales.The result of the auction came as Naftogaz, Ukraine’s state gas company and a longstanding opponent of NS2 — believing it is designed to weaken Ukraine — said on Monday that it had filed a request with German regulators to participate in the months-long process of certifying the pipeline.“Our request for intervention is based on our assessment that the Nord Stream 2 project is in breach of EU law,” said Yuriy Vitrenko, Naftogaz’s chief executive.“Nord Stream 2 is designed to increase Europe’s reliance on Russian gas and weaken European energy security and competitive gas markets . . . the fight to stop Nord Stream 2 is far from being over,” he added.Additional reporting by Roman Olearchyk in Kyiv and Tom Wilson in London
167  Hello from Brussels. There’s a summit of EU heads of government here this week. It’s going to hold a strategic discussion on EU trade policy in general but seems more likely to be dominated by issues of the rule of law in central and eastern Europe. There will, however, also no doubt be further chewing over of the gristle-filled issue of transatlantic relations. France has continued to make the argument for more European autonomy in the production of goods such as semiconductors while insisting this is not a threat to the EU-US relationship. Hmmm.Today’s main piece is what trade policy can and should be doing about climate change, while Charted waters looks into the slowdown in Chinese growth.For once, the “most pressing issue of our generation” description is probably right, and also for the generation before, had enough people been paying attention, and generations following. It’s hard to think of anything that will in retrospect seem as important as climate change and the world’s abject failure, so far, to stop it.As far as trade and trade policy are concerned, the debate tends to fall down pre-determined lines on issues such as long-distance shipping. Those who didn’t like globalisation anyway say that it’s carbon-intensive because of the fuel used in transport. Those who were instinctively in favour say that transport is a small part of carbon emissions for traded goods, and that trade helps disseminate carbon-light technology. We at Trade Secrets tend towards the latter view, while of course always letting our view in any given sector or product be determined by the data. On that subject we’d very happily jettison the deeply misleading and unhelpful concept of “food miles” somewhere over the ocean and watch it sink.In theory, you don’t really need a trade policy approach to carbon emissions, at least as far as trade in goods is concerned. You simply price emissions for production and transport effectively and uniformly and then let market forces work. Easy. Problem solved. World Trade Organization director-general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, one of the world’s 100 most influential people, according to Prince Harry and Meghan, says so. Next?In practice that’s obviously not the case, and it’s a bit dispiriting that the head of the WTO has moved so quickly to the stage of calling for other people to do impossible things because the possible ones are improbably difficult. As the EU is demonstrating as it develops and implements its carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), not only is there not one carbon price, but even working out what a country’s implicit emissions price is will be a very difficult exercise.So what can trade policy do? Bilaterally, the EU in particular has been loading up its deals with environmental conditions with increasing degrees of bite. But it’s distinctly unclear whether that actually changes behaviour in partner countries, and apart from instituting a rule that they have to sign up to the Paris agreement, it’s hard to write in detailed and binding commitments on carbon emissions. The EU is still working out its somewhat conflicted views on the issue. The ratification of its deal with Mercosur is on hold until Brussels can work out a side agreement with Brazil about Amazonian deforestation, but the EU so far failed even to make a proposal.A commentary from the Chatham House think-tank looks at how trade ministers are addressing climate change in multilateral forums (usual disclaimer: today’s Trade Secrets author is an associate fellow at Chatham House and attended a seminar on the paper from which this commentary is drawn, but is not responsible for it). The conclusion: not very well. There’s hardly any systematic way in which trade policy, whether in the WTO or the UN, is systematically organised to deal with climate change, and the paper calls for some ministerial structure to be created to address the issues.In the meantime, the usual progressives are doing their usual progressive thing and hoping that the rest of the world joins in. New Zealand is pushing for a joint ministerial statement on phasing out fossil fuel subsidies at the WTO ministerial in late November/early December. It has already put together a deal with a small group of like-minded countries aiming to end fossil fuel subsidies and ensure free trade in goods that benefit environmental sustainability.The problem with these kind of initiatives, though, is that they don’t have the kind of reciprocal benefits that would persuade a reluctant carbon-pricer to sign on. They’re basically a way for countries that have already decided to do something to bind themselves in to doing it. That’s not nothing, but it’s not a lever that’s going to induce big subsidisers to stop the money flowing. A past attempt at a more traditional reciprocal trade deal, on environmentally friendly goods, failed a few years ago amid the usual claim and counterclaim of mercantilism masquerading as greenery. There’s probably more work being done on fossil fuel subsidies at the OECD than at the WTO.We don’t have very cheering news. Multilateral trade governance in general and the WTO in particular — US trade representative Katherine Tai said nothing encouraging, in fact nothing substantive at all, when she spoke there last week — doesn’t seem robust enough to burden with another big issue. Sabine Weyand, head of the European Commission’s trade directorate, made a rather more judicious and tactful version of our downbeat argument in The Economist last week, saying there’s a clear limit to what trade policy can do about climate change, particularly when governments act on their own.We’ll keep watching, but it seems more likely that any substantive collective efforts to deal with greenhouse gas emissions and climate change will come from other policy forums than trade.The big global economy news today is that China’s GDP growth slipped to 4.9 per cent year-on-year during the third quarter. At least some of the blame lies with troubles at the world’s most indebted property developer, Evergrande. However, as the second of the two charts below shows, another big factor has been the fall in industrial production.The reason for this is that Covid-19 outbreaks and power shortages have closed factories, weighing on trade in the process. While some economists are optimistic that industrial output will pick up in the coming months, the threat of a property crash is expected to continue to weigh on people’s spending. Claire JonesTwo of the great brains of the trade world, Chad Bown and Douglas Irwin, set out in the New York Times what an intelligent industrial policy for managing supply chains would look like.China’s energy crisis threatens a lengthy disruption to the global supply chain.As supply chains shift to south-east Asia, Japan is preparing to unveil (Nikkei, $) a framework at COP26 to help Asean countries track industry greenhouse gas emissions. China’s application to join CPTPP, meanwhile, is a win for Beijing regardless of the outcome, either gaining trade concessions or disrupting the unity of member states, writes Nikkei’s Bangkok bureau chief.
168  The EU’s financial services chief has pledged to avoid market instability or a “cliff edge” over a decision on European banks’ ability to access UK clearing houses, comments that will raise investors’ expectations that Brussels is preparing an extension to its temporary permit.Mairead McGuinness said the European Commission would not engage in “any sudden twists and turns” on a decision over the licence that allows European banks to clear deals worth billions in London until the middle of next year. A decision on the matter could come within weeks, she said.However, the Irish commissioner also urged market participants to take seriously the commission’s demand that more euro-denominated derivatives business move to the EU over the longer term, following the UK’s decision to quit the single market.“We have to make sure that there is no instability in the short-term, but we also have to look at our long-term interests,” McGuinness said in an interview with the Financial Times. “They should read my lips and hear what I am saying. We do view this as a strategic issue for us in the medium, long term.”European and US banks and asset managers have been urging the commission to again extend its “equivalence” decision for access to UK clearing houses beyond next June given the huge amount of liquidity in the City of London market. Last month they called on the EU for a “longer-term approach” to the issue, to give the market more time to prepare.The commission, however, wants to see business shifted back to the EU because it is unhappy about the financial stability risks of seeing up to €80tn of open contracts being handled in a market that is no longer subject to its direct oversight. Clearing houses sit between deals and prevent defaults from ricocheting through the rest of the market.The problem for the commission is that there has been little sign of any shift in business towards EU financial capitals since the UK’s exit from the single market at the start of the year. London’s LCH still handles about 90 per cent of all euro-denominated derivatives, according to data provider Osttra.Users can net their positions by concentrating them in one place, saving them millions of dollars a day on the insurance required to back their deals.McGuinness acknowledged the lack of movement, saying it was not a surprise because “there is no incentive, there is no bonus for them to do anything. They may only be looking at the cost.”However, she insisted: “Whatever happens around movement, which is still a point of discussion with us, will not happen overnight, but we believe can happen over time.”While the EU valued London’s strength in clearing when the UK was part of the single market, the situation was now different, she said. “We need to take account of that, while not making any sharp or rash decisions — so no cliff edge,” she said, adding that the commission was “getting close to some public announcements, but we are not there just yet”.Tensions have been rising again between the EU and UK because of the wrangling over trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. McGuinness insisted the EU was not seeking to embroil financial services decision-making in the dispute over the UK withdrawal agreement.“At the moment we are not, if you like, using or will use financial services as a reaction,” she said. “But then we don’t exactly know what the UK are going to do next”.Nevertheless, she confirmed that a planned memorandum of understanding over regulatory co-operation, which was finalised earlier this year by the two sides but never signed, was being delayed by broader tensions with the UK.“It is technically there, the memorandum,” she said. “I think it is fair to say that had everything run smoothly and the day-to-day trauma of Brexit was not in the headlines, this memorandum would be put into practice and we would have dialogue.”Among the other matters looming in McGuinness’s portfolio is the launch of new bank capital rules implementing the global Basel III accord.France has been leading a push to soften the implementation of Basel III via a so-called parallel stack approach, which would help prevent a big uplift in capital requirements by subjecting two versions of a bank’s balance sheet to different rules.But McGuinness said the commission would spurn that approach, in favour of a tighter “single stack” regime.“We are at a place now where there is an understanding that the parallel stack — we have talked it through — isn’t appropriate,” she said. She added that the commission would ensure there would not be a “significant increase in capital requirements” for banks as a result of the new rules.
169  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express. We’re off to quite an eventful week.EU leaders, commission officials and members of the European parliament over the coming days will be dealing with the continuously aggravating issue of Poland — now complete with a constitutional law conundrum. The country’s PM will be front and centre to those discussions in Strasbourg tomorrow and then in Brussels, at an EU summit on Thursday.We’ll give you a rundown of the latest thinking among European officials and explain why Polexit is a spectre every EU policymaker dreads.As Poland and the rumbling energy crisis dominate the headlines, the European Commission hopes to quietly launch a public consultation over an equally explosive topic — tinkering with the bloc’s debt and deficit rules.Brussels is bracing for a painful escalation in the coming days of its bitter debate over the rule of law in Poland, as Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki prepares to defend his country — and its place in the EU — in the European parliament tomorrow, write Sam Fleming and Henry Foy in Brussels.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen is also due to speak to MEPs gathering in Strasbourg over the way forward after Warsaw’s constitutional tribunal ruling found that parts of the EU treaty were incompatible with Poland’s constitution, in a case brought by Morawiecki himself.The ruling brought to a head years of tensions between Warsaw and Brussels caused by the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) pushing reforms that gave politicians sweeping powers over judges. It also prompted mass protests in Poland against a potential exit from the EU, an outcome many have started to fear.The Strasbourg debate comes ahead of an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday where the situation in Poland (as well as Hungary) will be aired by leaders who are increasingly anxious about the depth of the divisions being exposed between member states.Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte, last week told his parliament that his caretaker government opposes the approval of Poland’s €36bn tranche due from the bloc’s €800bn Next Generation EU plan, which is still being analysed by the commission.However, Polish officials believe Brussels has been unfairly harsh in making an example of Warsaw and failed to respond to potential compromise opportunities. “It’s not only our job to de-escalate,” said one, ahead of a council summit that many in both camps fear could be overly confrontational.Von der Leyen has come under criticism both within Brussels and in some member states for her cautious approach to the dispute, opening the door for outspoken member states to instead fill the radio silence. Before the tribunal’s ruling, she was more inclined to approve the Polish recovery plan, but some diplomats now see it as politically impossible for her to give the green light any time soon.The commission can also launch infringement proceedings over the constitutional tribunal’s ruling — a step that some see as a bare minimum. In addition, the commission needs to decide how to enforce so-called enabling conditions on fundamental rights when it comes to agreeing payouts of cohesion funding.And MEPs are pushing Brussels to deploy its new rule of law conditionality mechanism, with the parliament’s legal affairs committee last week recommending that the commission be taken to court for failing to act despite several alleged rule of law violations.EU officials are deliberating when to send the first preliminary letters under the mechanism. Any action against Poland is unlikely to be founded on the constitutional tribunal’s ruling, as it would have to be based on a specific threat to EU taxpayer money because of fraud or misuse.Von der Leyen is likely to continue to tread carefully, for fear of further emboldening the rightwing anti-EU wing of the Polish coalition and cornering the country’s prime minister. But if a compromise is to be reached, Morawiecki will have to offer concrete steps to address the commission’s deep concerns about the decaying state of the rule of law in his country.The problem, as one diplomat puts it, is that the Polish government has a habit of shutting the doors that might offer a way out.Scientists are urging the British government to follow European countries that are more cautious in their opening up despite having high vaccination rates. In Spain and Italy, for instance, obligatory wearing of masks has remained in schools and both countries have been more cautious in reopening nightclubs than England. (More here)Brussels aims to quietly relaunch a consultation on reforming its budget rules tomorrow, but the ensuing debate is likely to be anything but tranquil, writes Sam Fleming in Brussels.As a reminder, the commission in early 2020 suspended the bloc’s debt-and-deficit-rules under the Stability and Growth Pact given the economic nosedive provoked by the Covid-19 crisis. The rules are likely to be reimposed from 2023 onwards, and in advance of that capitals have agreed to debate possible reforms.As its starting point, the public consultation will highlight the dramatic transformation in member states’ budget positions since the crisis struck. Public debt-to-GDP ratios in the euro area are up by more than 15 percentage points compared with 2019. The question is how to rebuild stronger public finances while recognising the massive public investment required to rebuild economies and invest in the green transition, the document will say.Accordingly, it will open the door to a rethink of the SGP, inviting respondents to offer views on what needs to change.The consultation will not, however, offer firm indications as to where the commission wants this process to land next year, given the decision to seek consensus among member states in the coming months.Nor will it impose hard deadlines: the debate is unlikely to be settled by next spring, when the commission puts forward its regular fiscal policy recommendations for 2023. But there are already some early signs as to where the discussion will focus:As the consultation will make clear, there are now far more questions than answers when it comes to the future of the EU’s fiscal policy framework. The debate will not be an easy one . . and later this week
170  Ever since Emmanuel Macron was elected French president in 2017, opinion polls have predicted that in next year’s contest he will again meet far-right leader Marine Le Pen in a second-round run-off. But the emergence of an insurgent newcomer has suddenly thrown the race wide open.Only six months before the April election, another far-right figure — anti-immigration polemicist Eric Zemmour — has repeated a trick performed by Macron in the 2017 contest, coming from nowhere to storm up the opinion polls and eye the Elysée Palace. In little more than a month, he has started to outrank every potential candidate except Macron himself in the polls.The two are very different. Although Macron campaigned last time as a revolutionary who was “neither right nor left” and who wanted to shake up French politics, he is an establishment figure. A former banker, he graduated from the elite Ecole Nationale d’Administration, served as finance minister and has governed from the centre as a liberal internationalist.Zemmour looks like a typical member of the French intellectual elite — the 63-year-old writer and commentator has written more than a dozen books on history, politics and society. But critics see him as a dangerous, Donald Trump-style provocateur — a TV talk-show star who rails against Muslims, immigration, feminism, crime and the supposed decline of France, and whose views are more extreme than those of Le Pen.Of Algerian Jewish and Berber origin himself, Zemmour has twice been convicted of religious or racial provocation.It is still early days, and not all the potential candidates have officially declared they will run, but Zemmour’s popularity has already played havoc with their electoral calculations.His rise “worries [the centre-right] Les Républicains, the main ideological competitors of Macron”, said Chloé Morin of the Fondation Jean-Jaurès think-tank. “It worries Marine Le Pen, who was high in the polls for the past five years. And it worries the left because it polarises the debate on immigration and law and order while the left is more inaudible than ever.” But Zemmour’s rise also offers some candidates an opportunity. If he and Le Pen both remain in the race, the split in the rightwing vote could cut the percentage threshold for candidates hoping to qualify for the second round. Assuming Macron maintains his lead, instead of competing against Le Pen he could come up against Zemmour, a centre-right candidate or even one from the left if the parties agree on a unity candidate.The latest opinion poll of first-round voting intentions from Harris Interactive for Challenges magazine showed Macron in the lead with 24 to 27 per cent, followed by Zemmour with 17 to 18 per cent. Neither has yet officially declared their candidacy. The poll put Le Pen — who had been expected to win a similar vote share to Macron — on 15 to 16 per cent.Polling suggested voters were unexcited by the prospect of another second-round duel between Macron and Le Pen, said Morin. “So as soon as a new player emerges . . . the terrain is favourable for them.”Zemmour’s early success is measurable not only in opinion polls but in the buzz online.There were four times more Google searches last month for Zemmour than for Macron and 16 times more than for Le Pen, according to David Dubois, associate professor of marketing at Insead and an expert in digital analytics.Searches for Zemmour accounted for 53 per cent of the total accrued by the 10 leading potential candidates, with Macron drawing 16 per cent, Jean-Luc Mélenchon of the far-left France Unbowed at 13 per cent and Le Pen at just 4 per cent. “Obviously, there’s a novelty effect, but it’s still impressive,” said Dubois.His findings suggest that the media-savvy Zemmour, like Trump, has focused on topics that attract intense interest from voters — especially immigration and crime — and packaged them in ways that favour the viral spread of his message.His call for a ban on foreign first names such as Mohammed or Kevin immediately became a hot topic, as did a cover photograph of him in Paris Match embracing his 28-year-old campaign adviser Sarah Knafo in the sea off a Mediterranean beach.Macron’s supporters are in a dilemma, reluctant to attack Zemmour for fear of increasing his prominence but eager to challenge what one member of the government called his “pseudo-historical” vision of a declining France. “It’s a very divided country and tempers are running high,” the person said.Meanwhile, the French electorate, from middle-aged voters weary of “woke” politics to young people turned off by the traditional parties, are taking a close interest in what Zemmour has to say.“I share some ideas with Eric Zemmour and I’ve started to follow Génération Z [a support group of young militants] on social networks,” said a 22-year-old master’s student on the outskirts of Paris. “I immediately liked that the young are engaging with ideas not represented in traditional media.” Zemmour was a Gaullist who stood up for French culture and identity and could unite the right, he said.Zemmour’s enemies are hoping his attraction will wane once he declares himself a candidate and has to explain exactly what he would do if elected. He might also find it hard to muster the millions of euros in campaign financing he needs and the 500 signatures from elected officials across France required to stand in the election.“The difference with Trump is that he had the Republican party behind him, while Zemmour is pretty much alone,” said political scientist Benjamin Morel. “But if he gets the money and the signatures — then he becomes a serious candidate.” Additional reporting by Domitille Alain in Paris
171  Hungarian conservative politician Peter Marki-Zay emerged on Sunday as the surprise challenger to premier Viktor Orban in elections set for April 2022 after he won the country’s first national primary contest against the centre-left candidate Klara Dobrev.Marki-Zay is a 49-year-old conservative father of seven and mayor of the small southern town of Hodmezovasarhely — a post he won as the candidate of a unified opposition against the political machine of Orban’s ruling Fidesz party.Before the two-round primary Marki-Zay, who is not a member of any of the parties competing in the selection process, had widely been considered a long-shot behind Dobrev, Budapest mayor Gergely Karacsony and Peter Jakab, leader of the centre-right Jobbik party. But after a late surge in the initial polling, he dominated a run-off campaign to face Orban.Well over 600,000 Hungarians participated in each round of the primaries, a level of engagement in a country of 10m that Marki-Zay said afforded him a great level of legitimacy.Marki-Zay told the Financial Times that the result and the voter participation would allow him, as a civic candidate, to work effectively with all six parties of the opposition.“I am very optimistic that the parties — which all have sought me out already — will co-operate with the civic forces outside formal politics,” he said at the concluding rally of his campaign in a pub in central Budapest.He said his candidacy was a strong message to the European Union, and his campaign would continue to focus on a markedly pro-western attitude contrasting with the “eastern opening” policy pursued by Orban, who has moved closer to Russia and China and often locked horns with Brussels during his 12 years in power.The maverick populist Orban has stabilised Hungary’s economy during his time in office but also built a self-styled ‘illiberal’ regime that Freedom House, the political freedom and human-rights organisation, no longer considers a full democracy.“Keeping the interests of our country front and centre we want to be faithful citizens of the EU,” he said.Dobrev, who was Marki-Zay’s only opponent after Karacsony stepped down, conceded defeat after she was behind 60 to 40 per cent with just about two-thirds of the votes counted.“The situation has crystallised tonight,” Dobrev told a brief press conference. “From tonight onwards, he is the premiership candidate of the six opposition parties. I will support him with everything I have to replace the government of Viktor Orban, then unwind his system.”
172  The European Central Bank is exploring raising its limit on purchases of EU-issued bonds, in a move that would enhance its flexibility in asset-buying schemes and boost the status of the bloc’s groundbreaking joint debt programme launched this year.Four ECB governing council members told the Financial Times they would support increasing the share of public sector bond purchases that target debt issued by international bodies such as the EU, from the current cap of 10 per cent. They expect to discuss the idea at two special council meetings starting in November to decide how much support to provide for financial markets from next year. The plan would need majority support from the ECB council’s 25 members. The ECB declined to comment.The mooted shift in ECB strategy comes as the European Commission plans to expand the amount of bonds it issues next year under its €800bn NextGenerationEU recovery fund — the vehicle agreed in the summer of 2020 to fund the pandemic response with debt backed jointly by member states.Brussels aims to issue €80bn of bonds for the fund this year and almost double that amount next year, transforming the EU itself into one of Europe’s biggest bond issuers. Any extra support from the ECB would be likely to cut the EU’s funding costs and help to boost the status of the bloc’s bonds as a regional benchmark — a role previously dominated by German Bunds.A tilt towards buying more EU bonds would also help the ECB to support financial markets without butting up against rules that bar it from owning more than a third of any individual country’s government debt. Some analysts think it could hit those limits on German and Dutch debt by 2023.“Lifting the limit on supranational purchases would be a way for the ECB to generate more room for manoeuvre on government bond purchases and to also show support for this important EU programme,” said Elga Bartsch, head of macro research at the BlackRock Investment Institute.The ECB is expected to announce in December that its pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), the €1.85tn bond-buying scheme that it launched in response to the Covid-19 crisis, will end in March.The four council members said they expected the central bank would examine ways to retain at least some of the extra flexibility that came with PEPP, which is exempt from the limit on national government purchases.One of them said the ECB was also working on ways to continue buying Greek government debt, which would otherwise be excluded by its rule against buying bonds with credit ratings below investment grade — another restriction lifted under PEPP.However, the idea of expanding asset purchases is likely to meet opposition from more conservative members of the ECB’s governing council, including Germany’s Jens Weidmann and Klaas Knot of the Netherlands.These so-called hawks are typically uncomfortable with the ECB snapping up bonds, especially outside of acute periods of crisis, worrying about the over-reliance of governments on the purchases to support high debt levels.A crucial factor in the debate will be whether the ECB continues to forecast that inflation will fall back below its 2 per cent target next year and stay there over the next two years. The central bank is due to update its inflation forecasts and issue a new prediction for 2024 in December.Soaring energy prices and supply chain bottlenecks have prompted some ECB policymakers to fret that the bank is underestimating future price growth. Nonetheless, few analysts expect a hard stop in the ECB’s debt-market support once PEPP expires. Instead, they widely forecast that the central bank will expand its traditional asset purchase programme, which has been buying €20bn of bonds a month alongside PEPP purchases.“I expect they will continue to revise up their inflation forecasts until the second half of next year,” said Frederik Ducrozet, strategist at Pictet Wealth Management. “But I still think the asset purchase programme will continue to the end of 2023.”Several of the council members said the ECB could shift from buying a fixed monthly amount of debt in the traditional asset purchase programme to targeting a total of overall purchases. They said it could also create a new “backstop fund” on top of the asset purchase programme, to be used only in response to disruption in financial markets.François Villeroy de Galhau, the French central bank governor and an ECB council member, said last week that the bank could maintain capacity for extra asset purchases in emergencies, adding that “the theoretical possibility of their use, would mean that we would probably not have to actually use them”.
173  The writer is special adviser to the Institut Montaigne and a visiting research professor at King’s College London In the Suez crisis of October 1956, France and the UK were punished like misbehaving adolescents by the US and the Soviet Union, the superpowers of that era. The Franco-British attempt to reset the imperial clock in the Middle East was at once futile and anachronistic.Sixty-five years later the UK and France are at it again, but this time lashing out at each other in a no less childish game of blackmail, deceit and retribution. Should London and Paris really apply the kind of pressure against each other that one would expect from Moscow and Beijing? Have we lost our common sense and the ability to prioritise the larger challenges that face us both?To borrow language used during the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962, it is high time to “de-escalate”. As the world confronts the prospect of a new cold war between China and the US, Paris and London need each other more than ever. But neither seems aware of the irresponsible nature of the skirmishes in which they are indulging.These squabbles range from irregular migration across the Channel to fisheries, from the British effort to rewrite the Brexit agreement on Northern Ireland to the secretly planned Aukus pact between Australia, the UK and the US that so offended the French. Each side appears more determined to feed a growing appetite for confrontation than search for compromise.The international context makes plain the immaturity of London and Paris. Chinese pressure on Taiwan intensifies by the day. President Vladimir Putin’s Russia blackmails Europe on energy. Yet the British and French are engaging in a war of words, if not of deeds, that seems to duplicate the tensions between western democracies and their despotic rivals to the east.To put it bluntly, France ought not to threaten to deprive the Channel island of Jersey of electricity when Putin does the same with gas towards the entire European continent. For its part, the UK should not be playing populist cards in a blatant and offensive manner that leaves Paris with little choice but to reply in kind.How can London and Paris not be ashamed of the ridiculous and totally irresponsible deterioration of their bilateral relationship? When the building is on fire, differences among the tenants are less important than the urgency of addressing the broader causes of the conflagration. France and the UK still describe each other as cousins and neighbours. What has happened to common sense, rationality and pragmatism on both sides of the Channel?And why now, precisely when geopolitics demands a stronger sense of unity and solidarity between nations that share common democratic values? Doubtless it is an unfortunate coincidence that the UK happens to be governed by Boris Johnson, a provocative and confrontational prime minister, just when France is preparing to hold presidential elections in April. It is a case of the wrong man at the wrong time.Or rather, the wrong men — for President Emmanuel Macron also likes to play with fire, and he too can be unnecessarily provocative and confrontational, as demonstrated recently in his dealings with Algeria. As London escalates its provocations, Macron and his government do not want to be seen as soft by French citizens.It is so easy in our time of social media, fake news and professional political agitators to resuscitate the worst in the complex bilateral relationship between the two most traditionally arrogant countries of Europe.Seen from Paris, the British provocations seem all the more out of touch with reality, given that London’s absolute reliance on Washington is viewed as a dangerous wager. Should the British really put all their eggs in the American basket, when the former superpower looks so fragile and so domestically polarised — in short, so untrustworthy?During the Brexit negotiations, London tried to apply a strategy of “divide and rule” in its dealings with the EU. It failed then. Can it succeed now?In his recent speech delivered in Portugal — the UK’s oldest ally on the continent — Lord David Frost was at it again, implying that the countries of central Europe were closer to London and Washington than to Paris and Berlin on critical strategic issues. He may have a point there. Macron’s France, in its firm stance towards the UK, may be more isolated in the EU than it was a few years ago.At the end of the day, however, only Moscow and Beijing will benefit from these “divide and rule”, short-term political tactics. It is therefore urgent for London and Paris to return to sanity in their dealings with each other.Letters in response to this article:Britain and France can overcome their tantrums / From John M Jones, London N19, UKAn oddity exists in the media’s approach to Russia / From Sir Anthony Brenton, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, UK
174  I know you’re hearing a lot about something called ‘supply chains’,” said US president Joe Biden last week, in a speech explaining to Americans why their sneakers, toasters, bicycles and bedroom furniture were taking so much longer to get to them these days.It is highly unusual for the leader of the free world to spend so much time talking about logistics and value chains to the general public. But this is an unusual moment, in which supply-chain snags and labour squeezes have resulted in port backups for weeks or even months not only in the US, but the UK, Europe and many other places around the world.Much of it is down to the Covid-19 pandemic, of course, and the asynchronous national recovery cycles that have led to a mismatch between supply and demand for various products. Those cycles should eventually smooth out as the virus abates. But port disruptions have shed light on bigger problems in the global economy, from incompatibilities of skills and jobs, to an over-reliance on China as the provider of any number of crucial goods.The Los Angeles and Long Beach port backups have quickly become a major political issue in the US, given that they represent 40 per cent of the country’s entire cargo shipping imports. But many people are taking the wrong lessons — that dock workers cannot be found because of government stimulus cheques providing a disincentive to work, or that we are headed back to a decade of stagflation, or that the trade landscape will end up looking either like the laissez-faire 1990s or the beggar-thy-neighbour 1930s. I doubt any of that will turn out to be true, but there are several different, better lessons to be learnt from the current troubles.First, supply-chain glitches are not solely responsible for the problems finding labour in some sectors. Technology disruption and policy choices have also played a role. Jobs such as dock work and truck driving, for example, were in short supply in the US well before Covid, in part because many training programmes had been shuttered in recent years, and people were moving away from these positions after being long warned that automation and self-driving cars would take their jobs.Despite the slower-than-expected rollout of autonomous vehicles, they are right to think that their jobs will be disrupted by technology. Many tough, physical jobs have been filled by machines and robots in recent years, and many more still will be. The economic and political fallout of the pandemic only fuels the trend. Witness Italian winemakers, who can no longer find immigrants to work their fields, buying automated grape pickers, or French farmers investing in agri-bots to harvest crops. Other white-collar work won’t be immune from automation either, as countries and companies hit by the pandemic look for ways to save costs.Indeed, with the exception of very high-end knowledge work and lower-end, close-contact care work, it’s hard to see where long-lasting labour leverage lies unless there are bigger structural shifts in the US economy.While some market watchers fret about a small amount of wage inflation, a new Cornell study argues that, in the US, underemployment is likely to continue to pose challenges in years to come. Its author, Daniel Alpert, reasons that unless more goods production for the country is done locally, having humans at the high and low end of the market, and software in between, is the new normal.Of course, if US policymakers and businesses had been smarter, they’d have set up German-style work councils and a furlough system so the public and private sectors and labour could work together to share the benefits of the recovery, but also to deal more quickly with the downside risks of Covid-related disruptions. Germany hasn’t been immune to port disruption, but its Kurzarbeit short-time working scheme has done better at smoothing the ups and downs of recession and recovery over the past couple of decades than the US model. As it is, the Anglo-American labour model of quick hiring and firing has led to a situation in which the president has to mitigate fights between business and unions to get ports running 24/7. This model clearly fails the post-pandemic resiliency test.So do highly complex global supply chains, which had been pushed to their obvious limits even before Covid. Years before Biden’s “Buy America” or Donald Trump’s tariff wars, a number of big multinationals were scaling down complex global supply chains and restructuring production to be “increasingly concentrated in regional and local hubs closer to end markets”, as a 2016 OECD report put it. This was for many reasons, from changing emerging-market cost structures, to the growing digitalisation of manufacturing to the innovation benefits found in co-locating research and development within factories, and a realisation of the former underestimation of the costs of globalisation.One of those costs stems, of course, from too few countries and companies controlling too much value. One of the best things that we could do to avoid port pile-ups in the future is to institute what anti-monopoly advocate and Open Markets Institute founder Barry Lynn has dubbed a “rule of four” — that no more than 25 per cent of any crucial supply should be sourced from one place, or come into one port.It’s an easy-to-understand rule free from any nationalism. And it might help us get our Christmas presents on time in the future.rana.foroohar@ft.com
175  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
176  While EU officials have argued in Brussels this month over the relative merits of nuclear energy and gas, residents of a small town 60km east of the Belgian capital had a more pressing concern: if Belgium gets rid of nuclear power, where will it get its gas from?“Everyone around us is stopping gas. Where are we going to get ours from? Putin? What will we do if he switches the tap off?” said Heidi Haesevoets at a protest this month against a planned gas-fired power plant in her home town of Tessenderlo.Belgium, sandwiched between pro-nuclear France and pro-gas Germany, epitomises one of the problems the EU faces in its energy supply as it moves towards a carbon-neutral future.The transition is increasing Europe’s reliance on gas as it moves away from dirtier coal. But at a time when Europe faces soaring gas prices, the Belgian government is also about to embark on a long-delayed full exit from nuclear energy — which is zero-carbon but produces harmful waste. It plans to build more gas-fired plants to provide the energy that cannot yet be covered by wind parks and solar panels.The move has attracted criticism from the regional government in Flanders, Belgium’s northern and more industrialised region, and from an unusual alliance of pro-nuclear and climate activists.“We have gas prices already going up and on top of that, taxpayers would have to pay for more gas plants — it makes absolutely no sense,” said Haesevoets.Belgium’s seven nuclear reactors, which generate half of the country’s electricity, are set to come offline by 2025 under a commitment enshrined in the national government’s coalition agreement. The government has also approved a multibillion-euro subsidy scheme to build and run gas-fired power plants, which would fill the energy gap.This puts the country in stark contrast with neighbouring France, which is going to step up the use of carbon-free nuclear energy, and the Netherlands, which is moving away from gas-powered plants. The Dutch government is also shutting down Europe’s largest natural gasfield, which was supplying almost half of Belgium’s gas imports.“Belgium remains reliant on fossil fuels and is facing energy security challenges,” said the International Energy Agency in its country report.The pro-business regional government in Flanders has come out against Belgium’s nuclear shutdown and is questioning the timing of the bet on more gas.“If you look at carbon prices rising and the price of gas going up, if you build more gas plants, you’ll only be more dependent on gas and the cost will eventually be transferred to the consumer,” said Flemish energy minister Zuhal Demir.She has blocked the construction of one gas-powered plant and the residents of Tessenderlo hope she will reach the same decision in their case. Demir said each construction permit was granted or rejected on a case-by-case basis.Climate activist Ike Teuling, from the action group Tegengas/Dégaze (Against gas), said any approval of the Tessenderlo plant would face a challenge in court. The group is already preparing a legal challenge against a construction permit granted in the French-speaking region of Wallonia, where the regional government favours gas.Pro-nuclear activists in Belgium agree with many of the pro-climate arguments regarding the country’s commitment to cut carbon emissions.“Nuclear should be part of the energy transition to decarbonise the whole economy,” said Arnaud Paquet, co-founder of the pro-nuclear group Horizon 238.At the federal level, energy minister Tinne van der Straeten dismissed the idea that the recent gas price surge would have much of an influence, given that the subsidised gas-powered plants would not go online until 2025.She has left the door open to keeping two reactors online if Belgium’s overall energy security appears at risk. But she said the ultimate goal had to be to renew the country’s dependence on external factors for its energy needs.“Belgium is a net energy importer either way. My first crisis meeting as a minister was about nuclear fissile material imports. We have no gas, no oil, no uranium,” van der Straeten said. “The only way forward is 100 per cent renewable energy.”
177  After Mikheil Saakashvili met members of the European parliament last month, they urged the former Georgian president turned exiled oppositionist not to return to a country where he faced arrest and risked inflaming already febrile political tensions.Saakashvili went anyway on the eve of local elections, smuggled inside a milk truck, and now he languishes in a Tbilisi prison on hunger strike — the latest in a long line of Georgian politicians ignoring advice from Brussels in recent years.The Black Sea country was once held up as an example of how the EU could export its liberal, western principles to its neighbours, including in the former Soviet Union.But it has fallen sharply from grace, beset by allegations of democratic backsliding and creeping authoritarianism of the ruling Georgian Dream party that have given its western benefactors pause for thought. This month’s vote was marred by irregularities that unnerved many in the EU and US who fear Georgia is drifting from the pro-western orbit.“The continued blurring of the line between state and party resources is deeply disturbing,” the US state department said of the ballot. “This type of abuse has occurred too often in Georgian elections and is wholly incompatible with Georgia’s democratic and Euro-Atlantic ideals.”Yet the west is in no position to turn its back on Tbilisi. Its highly strategic location between Russia and Turkey, key role in the transit of oil and gas from the Caspian Sea to Europe and unique position as a pro-EU parliamentary democracy in a region of strongman-led autocracies complicate the geopolitical calculus.“Georgia is a really important [EU] partner . . . I do sincerely think they want to bridge the gap to Europe,” said Katalin Cseh, an MEP who took part in the EU’s election observation mission. “But internal divisions and recent political events have deepened that distance.”Relations with Brussels began to deteriorate in 2019 as the country was gripped by sustained anti-government rallies. Citizens waved EU flags in protest against what they said was pro-Russian moves by Georgian Dream, founded by Russian-made billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, and a failure to deliver promised electoral reform.Popular unrest returned in February when police arrested the country’s opposition leader over his role in the protests, prompting the EU to step in and broker a deal between the two sides.After Georgian Dream’s withdrawal from that accord a few months later prompted an EU warning that it may cut off a financial aid package, Tbilisi responded by saying it did not want the cash anyway.“When the Georgian Dream government said preemptively that we don’t want that assistance, I think that was a slap in the EU’s face and basically saying: ‘you don’t really have power over us’,” said Salome Samadashvili, an opposition MP and former ambassador to the EU.“Even though of course it’s completely crazy. They need all the money they can get with the economic crisis here.”There are numerous other flashpoints. Files published last month in local media alleged that Georgia’s secret services had spied on the EU envoy to the country and US diplomats. And Saakashvili’s arrest, under existing convictions for abuse of power while in office, presents another irritant: he is still lauded in Brussels for his efforts as president to shift the country towards the west, and claims the charges are politically motivated.Temuri Yakobashvili, deputy prime minister under Saakashvili, said that having a political prisoner had exacerbated the “already seriously undermined democratic credentials of the current government”.That “is harmful for Georgian democracy, it’s harmful for Georgian political process . . . and it definitely harms relations” with the west, he added.Relations with Nato appear stronger. The military alliance sent a delegation to Tbilisi this month that its senior official said showed its “unwavering commitment to Georgia”. Ties with the western defence community are viewed as integral to Tbilisi since a short 2008 war with Russia that resulted in the country losing about a fifth of its territory to pro-Russian separatists.Nikoloz Samkharadze, a member of Georgian Dream who chairs the foreign policy committee in the country’s parliament, denied that western ties had soured, asserting that relations with the EU and Nato were “progressing and very good”.He added: “Unfortunately, some political forces, including opposition, and also some MEPs in the European parliament, have politicised this issue further. I should say that this does not serve the Georgian nation and neither the interest of the EU.”Opinion polls show a majority of Georgians are in favour of the EU and Nato. And despite a growing sense of pessimism in western capitals about the country’s direction, most would judge that the geopolitical implications of downgrading ties with Tbilisi were more important, said Zach Witlin, a senior analyst at risk consultancy Eurasia Group.“There’s obviously a national security priority for the west,” he said. “[But] the impetus is on Georgian Dream regarding the pace of restoring the relationship.”For as relations drift, pro-European Georgians fear the ultimate beneficiary is Moscow.“The Russians are of course very happy with this government, because Georgia has not really had any progress on the EU or Nato integration front,” said Samadashvili.“Yes, we don’t have expectations that we’ll join the EU tomorrow. But in this kind of geopolitical context, losing Georgia means giving the winning hand to the Russians one more time.”
178  Spain’s version of Elena Ferrante has been revealed to be three middle-aged men.Late on Friday night the €1m Planeta prize — the world’s highest paying literary trophy — was awarded to Carmen Mola, an author who until now has been presented as a female university professor who writes under a pen name because of her desire for anonymity.Although Mola’s books are decidedly gory, the writer has been publicised as the “Spanish Elena Ferrante” — a reference to the reclusive, and also pseudonymous, Italian literary novelist.But when the main prize at the Planeta awards ceremony was announced in the presence of King Felipe VI in Barcelona, three people stepped up to the podium — and none of them was a woman.Neither Jorge Díaz, Agustín Martínez nor Antonio Mercero are academics, but in fact television scriptwriters in their 40s and 50s who have worked on Spanish shows such as On Duty Pharmacy, Central Hospital and No Heaven Without Breasts.Their story could barely be more different from past examples such as Mary Ann Evans, the 19th century English author who wrote as “George Eliot” to protect her privacy and avoid being stereotyped as a female light novelist.“Carmen Mola is not, like all the lies we’ve been telling, a university professor,” said Díaz on winning the prize. “We are three friends who one day four years ago decided to combine our talent to tell a story.”Martínez suggested in an interview with Spain’s EFE news agency that the authors chose to write under one name because “collective work is not as valued in literature [as in] other arts such as painting or music”.In retrospect Planeta tipped its hand to more than one person winning the prize on Thursday, when it announced the main award would be increased from €600,000 to €1m, so outstripping the Nobel Prize for literature, which at current exchange rates is worth just over €100 less, at 10m Swedish krona. Each of the authors will take away a third of the €1m total.Carmen Mola is best known for a trilogy of violent novels starring police inspector Elena Blanco, a hard-charging police inspector with a fondness for karaoke, grappa and casual sex. The books, published by Penguin Random House, have sold more than 200,000 copies, been translated into 11 languages and are being adapted for television by Endemol Shine and ViacomCBS International Studios.But the Carmen Mola book that won the Planeta prize — beating 653 other contenders — is a historical thriller, The Beast, dealing with the murder of children during a cholera epidemic in Madrid in 1834.The prize is also a way of securing and publicising works of fiction for Editorial Planeta, Penguin Random House’s great rival in Spain. The award is reserved for unpublished work, and the winner’s acceptance of Planeta’s publishing rights is a condition of entry. The conditions also state that all pseudonymous authors must include their details in a sealed envelope, which will only be opened in the event that they win.In the case of Friday’s win, as the prize’s organisers said, there was a “pseudonym behind a pseudonym”, since The Beast was submitted under the pen-name Sergio López, which was then revealed to be Carmen Mola, and subsequently unveiled as Díaz, Martínez and Mercero.The book is due to be published by Planeta under Carmen Mola’s name next month, although Mola is still listed as a Penguin Random House author.
179  Scientists have urged the UK government to impose fresh coronavirus restrictions in England over winter, as high hospital admission and fatality rates outstrip the rest of western Europe.The UK’s weekly death rate stands at 12 per million, three times the level of other major European nations, while hospitalisations have risen to eight Covid-related admissions a week per 100,000 people, six times the rate on the continent.The decision to end compulsory mask-wearing and to pause plans for vaccine passports in England has made the British government an outlier for its management of the pandemic and could account for the worsening trends, according to scientific experts.By contrast, western European countries such as France, Italy and, in particular, Spain have brought down infection rates to their lowest level since the summer of 2020.Martin McKee, professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the better picture on the continent showed England “should immediately be activating” its winter “Plan B” of work from home orders, vaccine mandates and legally-enforced mask-wearing indoors.“These small measures like mask-wearing, distancing, ventilation and an emphasis on homeworking are greater than the sum of their parts,” McKee said. “It really doesn’t take an awful lot to bring this down, as France, Italy and others have shown.”In Spain, which as recently as July endured the highest infection rate in mainland Europe, case rates have come down 17-fold in the past three months to among the lowest in the continent, even as infections in the UK stay stubbornly high.In the week ending October 9, more than 1m people were infected with Covid-19 across the UK, the highest level since the end of January, the Office for National Statistics said on Friday.Professor Ravi Gupta, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), called on the government to “learn lessons” from European countries that were “more cautious in their opening up”.“We’re just far too reliant on our relatively modest vaccination coverage as our only line of defence,” said Gupta, who added that faster teen vaccination rollouts and more restrictions in classrooms had contributed to other countries’ success in containing an autumn wave.In Spain and Italy, for instance, obligatory wearing of masks has remained in schools and both countries have been more cautious in reopening nightclubs than England.In Italy, clubbing restarted last week with strict capacity limits and vaccine certification required for entry, while in Madrid, clubbers must wear masks. Since mid-July nightclubs in England have had no restrictions.A report by a cross-party group of MPs suggested this week the government’s mishandling of the early stages of the pandemic was due in part to British exceptionalism. The same problems continue to blight the UK’s pandemic response, according to EU onlookers.Philippe Douste-Blazy, a former French health minister, told the Financial Times that Britons’ “sense of individualism” explained the patchy use of masks and the higher level of transmission that resulted from it. “In the UK, the attitude is ‘if I don’t want the mask, I won’t use the mask’,” he added. “In France, we have a very different mentality.”José Ramón Arribas, head of the infectious diseases unit at Madrid’s La Paz hospital, concurred. “The difference with the UK is striking because it has a respectable vaccination rate,” he said. Covid-19 patients now only take up 5 per cent of intensive care places in Spain, compared to 15 per cent in England.About 15 per cent of UK adults now say they never wear a mask in public spaces, according to a YouGov poll from mid-October. The figure compares with below 2 per cent in Spain and Italy, and about 4 per cent in France.Britons were also less cautious about using public transport, attending large gatherings and entering crowded spaces than their European counterparts, the poll said.The UK’s greater reliance on the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine could also be a factor in higher infection rates, adding urgency to the need for booster shots, according to Prof Neil Ferguson, a leading epidemiologist at Imperial College London.“The UK has used a lot more AstraZeneca, which particularly against [the] Delta [variant] is much less effective at blocking infection and reducing transmission than the mRNA vaccines,” he said. “On that functional level of immunity . . . we’re a considerable way behind many western European countries.”“From that point of view, the booster programme will be invaluable in terms of boosting [protection against symptomatic infection],” he added.Ferguson said the latest modelling suggested that if booster uptake was high enough and the rollout was fast enough, additional measures might not be necessary. But he added that if cases continued to rise over the next two weeks, “then clearly I’m sure the government will be re-evaluating the measures in place”.Boosters have been given to 41 per cent of people in England who received their second dose at least six months ago, compared to 45 per cent in France, 23 per cent in Germany, and 12 per cent in Spain and Italy.François Balloux, director of the University College London Genetics Institute, said a high infection rate over autumn could stand the UK in better stead for winter when hospitals are under even greater strain.“The virus circulating now might actually relieve pressure during the winter because people who are infected . . . won’t be infected again, or at least have a serious illness,” he said.Despite the vaccination drive, Ferguson estimated that more immunity was being gained in most age groups by natural infection than from the vaccines.“Certainly immunity is helpful but I’d prefer to accumulate it through vaccination,” he added. “If we can get immunity up sufficiently to properly start driving down case numbers, we’ll be in a much better place . . . in two months’ time.”Letter in response to this article:Stop penalising those with natural Covid immunity / From Luis A Robles Macía, Uccle, Belgium
180  After Tesla chief executive Elon Musk proposed building the electric carmaker’s first European “gigafactory” in a forest outside Berlin, chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed it as proof of “how things can be achieved in a short time” in Germany’s former communist east.Almost two years on, environmental protests and bureaucratic battles have frustrated the Tesla chief executive’s hopes to shake up Germany’s staid auto industry, delaying the grand opening by several months and leaving Musk pleading for an “active process” to speed up such tasks.Yet there was a carnival atmosphere as the public was given a sneak peek inside the factory last weekend as part of a “county fair” aimed at engaging locals — with 9,000 people entertained by street performers, balloon artists and food trucks offering everything from empanadas to currywurst.But away from the giant Ferris wheel and dodgem cars, there was stark evidence of Tesla’s struggle to match its record-breaking feat from 2019 of building its entire Shanghai gigafactory in just 168 days.Empty halls where assembly lines will sit were compensated for with whirring red and yellow robots, their mechanical movements occasionally accompanied by pulsating techno music from a nearby DJ. Strategically placed LED lighting and video installations plugged other gaps, such as in the half-finished paint shop.Other areas, such as the innovative casting section, were devoid of life, save for the handful of staff clad in branded black jackets shepherding visitors. Placards promoting the economic benefits that the multibillion-dollar plant would bring to Brandenburg, one of Germany’s poorer states, were prominent.Although Tesla said it prioritised locals when it came to giving out tickets, the Financial Times met enthusiasts who had travelled from Greece, Norway, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and Austria for the event.For many, the highlight of the fair was an appearance from Musk himself, who came by private jet to tell the enthusiastic crowd that he would create “12,000 jobs, maybe more”.“In fact, I’m a little worried we won’t be able to hire enough people,” he admitted. “We really need great talent to come here from around Europe — or anywhere — and help us create the new future.”His concern was matched by some of those who had come to see the new plant, and how it compared with the dozens run by Germany’s traditional carmakers.“I don’t know where he’ll get qualified workers,” said Michael Thomas, who worked at Daimler’s factory in Stuttgart for decades until he retired. He wondered aloud whether Musk would “poach them from other companies or train them himself, following the apprenticeship system in Germany”.Tesla, the world’s most valuable car company, has pledged to establish 10 study programmes and become the largest apprenticeship employer in the state.But such assurances have done little to calm Germany’s powerful trade unions, who have repeatedly warned Musk not to circumvent the country’s traditional co-determination system, in which workers are represented at boardroom level.“Tesla must comply with environmental laws, building codes and, of course, labour and union laws,” Birgit Dietze, head of the Brandenburg branch for IG Metall, Germany’s largest union, said recently. Others have raised concerns about the company recruiting from Poland, which critics say could undercut salaries at the likes of Volkswagen and BMW.Equipment at the new factory has been installed under provisional licences, as the manufacturer waits for local authority approval.Despite teething troubles, Musk told the crowd, the facility would begin manufacturing in “November or December”, about six months behind schedule, before adding that this was the “easy part . . . the hard part is reaching volume production”.After a disappointing 2020, Tesla’s fortunes in western Europe improved in the last quarter, according to analyst Matthias Schmidt, with the company delivering a record 45,900 cars in the three months to the end of September.Official Austrian data showed that almost all Teslas sold in the country “came from Chinese production lines”, according to Schmidt, highlighting the need for the German plant to come online.Neither Tesla nor Musk responded to an FT invitation for comment.When it came to its European manufacturing plans, the company was characteristically bold. Tesla would “produce as many electric cars here as were sold in the EU last year”, the company insisted on placards, which would roughly translate to a car body rolling off the production line every 45 seconds.Yet although elements of the body shop, stamping and casting processes were in place, the halls that will house the final vehicle production lines contained almost no equipment, save for a few machines to assemble and install seats.“There’s a lot of empty spaces. It was more about the show,” said Hubert, a 32-year-old local. Another visitor from Berlin praised Tesla for “showing a lot of transparency” by opening the factory to outsiders.Thomas, the retired Daimler veteran, said there was “nothing that new” on show, but given how little of Germany’s car industry was based in Brandenburg “it’s definitely very good for the area”.Graffiti scribbled on a wall of the factory echoed the sentiment: “Wunderbar, Elon!”
181  Russia’s promise to tackle ransomware hackers operating within its borders has yet to result in concrete action, according to one of the US’s top cyber security officials. Anne Neuberger, deputy national security adviser to the White House on cyber threats, said the US was “looking to see near-term progress in actions” after sharing information with Moscow on ransomware gangs operating in Russia.Ransomware attacks, in which hackers lock up the computers of their targets until a ransom is paid, have risen dramatically in recent years, and US organisations are now paying an average of $102.3m a month in reported ransoms, according to a US Treasury report on Friday.After an attack on Colonial Pipeline, a major conduit of refined oil products on the US east coast, President Joe Biden warned his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin against any cyber attacks on critical US infrastructure in June.Neuberger said there had been a “lull over the summer” in attacks and that Russia had taken “some steps”, but that it was “too early to really tell” how much had changed. Neuberger, who previously headed the cyber directorate at the National Security Agency, is involved in what she said were “direct, candid” discussions with the Kremlin over ransomware.“We shared information with Russia regarding criminal ransomware activity being conducted from their territory, and that they have committed to act against that.“A larger government system then has to take those steps and ensure that that occurs and that’s where we’re looking to see those actions,” she said, adding that the US would continue to monitor “the most significant Russian groups” and that cyber security companies had reported some changes in the ranks and make-up of those groups over the summer.She declined to comment “at this time” on Ilya Sachkov, the head of a Russian cyber security company who has repeatedly urged Moscow to take a harder line on hackers and who was arrested for treason last month.Experts said Russian ransomware would continue expanding at pace, given the proliferation of both cyber hacking tools and cryptocurrency payment channels that facilitate hard-to-detect ransom payments. Paul Nakasone, commander of US Cyber Command, told a conference earlier this month he expected such attacks to occur “every single day” in five years’ time.But John Hultquist, of cyber security company Mandiant, told a conference last week his company had seen “a lull in activity from several high-profile actors” and a reduction in activity from some ransomware groups that had previously had the most impact. In the meantime, the US is attempting to spearhead a new international coalition of more than 30 countries to tackle the ransomware threat emanating largely from Russia as well as China and elsewhere. Neither Russia nor China was invited to join the coalition. In two days of virtual meetings, India, Australia, the UK and Germany agreed to lead working groups designed to co-ordinate and tighten the global response to ransomware. Other participants included Ukraine, Estonia, Nigeria, Kenya, Brazil, Mexico, Switzerland and the EU.“This meeting was really the first time ever we took that domestic strategy international,” said Neuberger, adding that the coalition aimed “to fight what is essentially a transnational criminal organisation”. She said that connecting “the dots around the world” would help disrupt money laundering networks in part by linking those who track cryptocurrency transfers with law enforcement efforts.The group also wanted to establish a real-time, automated joint warning mechanism that would be faster than existing ad hoc methods, she said. “Because ransomware criminals repeat their activities, more robust and real-time communication across governments can not only enhance banking capacities to mitigate the impacts of a ransomware incident, it can potentially be useful to warn countries who may then have enough time to prevent some of them,” said Neuberger. One participant, the Czech Republic, said it had received a warning about a potential attack against 30 hospitals, following a previous attack against the country’s second-largest hospital, that had enabled it to take preventive measures. She said participants had also wanted to know more about the process that led the US last month to identify virtual currency exchange Suex as a target for sanctions.
182  Ben Munster is a freelance journalist covering the dubious dual beat of blockchain and Italian politics. He has written for The New Yorker, Esquire and Private Eye, and is the semi-regular author of the Zero Knowledge column at Decrypt, a crypto news site. (One of the good ones, he swears!) He lives in Rome.In local elections over the past few weeks, Italy’s once mighty Five Star Movement has suffered a series of catastrophic defeats, resulting in widespread declarations that Italian populism is not long for this world. Against a resurgent centre-left, Five Star’s base collapsed, and it lost the mayorship of two key cities: Rome and Turin. Still in government by a taut thread, the party — or the Movement, as its adherents prefer to call it — faces only the indignity of another election before it’s booted from office. Five Star, the analysts say, is moribund. The poor showing was partly the result of the Movement’s having propped up the coalition headed by unelected former ECB President Mario Draghi. But the cause of its terminal decline has a longer, and more curious history: its years-long obsession with a utopian, tech-enhanced vision of politics that ended up being derailed by the very forces it sought to harness.It all began with a man named Gianroberto Casaleggio. Before Five Star, Casaleggio — bespectacled, angular, longhaired — was a developer at an Anglo-Italian tech consultancy called WebEgg. There, using his colleagues as guinea pigs, he trialled a primitive form of “e-democracy”: a forum-based voting system through which members could, supposedly, enjoy participation in the company’s operations.Around 2005, Casaleggio met Beppe Grillo, a comedian looking for an outlet for his political invective, and the developer decided to build Grillo a blog: beppegrillo.it. Politically disenfranchised Italians soon flocked to the blog, and Casaleggio built a community voting software called Rousseau to accommodate an e-democratic experiment of considerably larger scope. Five Star soon emerged and became a major political force, unique among modern political movements in that its infrastructure had been created, in part, by a multinational tech company. The founders’ notions of e-democracy served as a tech-based, populist-oriented solution to the traditional Italian grievance: that the political class was corrupt and compromised, and should be replaced with something else. In the past that something has taken the form of fascism, Masonic lodges, and unelected “apolitical” technocrats like Mario Draghi. (Hence Italy’s longtime position, as one political analyst argues, as a “laboratory for all sorts of reactionary experiments”.) In Five Star’s case, this role would be assumed by the internet, which the founders saw as a “mythical panacea … leading the nation towards a more desirable future”, according to a 2014 paper by Birkbeck scholars Andrea Ballatore and Simone Natale. The new web-based politics would be more transparent. It would be more secure. It would be thoroughly non-partisan: a pure tEcH-bAsEd sOlUTioN! It could even, it seemed, be used to encode a peculiarly Italian form of liberty: the freedom to delegate control over one’s life to an abstract disciplinarian. Grillo and Casaleggio believed, for instance, that the web’s “eternal memory” would keep its denizens in line. They were beguiled, too, by its apparent decentralisation, arguing that as the internet age progressed, a “large part of the hierarchical structure which rules our society will disappear”.In 2016, Five Star won control of Rome and Turin, then in 2018 it became the largest party in government. In doing so, it became a one-off case study of e-democracy, an idea that for years had been gaining traction across Europe. But it soon became clear that the purportedly supra-political nature of the founders’ mission was mere cover for a techno-utopian ideology that was no less partisan or doctrinaire than any other, and that was influencing the way the Movement was being run.Indeed, a slew of problems emerged as it became apparent, as one academic put it, that Five Star was “closed, rigidly vertical and more tailored to the hegemonic interests of Grillo and Casaleggio than to those of its members”. Early on, two of Five Star’s elected officials were ousted for dubious reasons (engaging with mainstream media; disagreeing publicly with Grillo). Voter data was hacked. Ascension from mere member to Five Star political leader could be arbitrary, and the turnout for successful candidates was sometimes absurdly thin. (Di Maio, now Italy’s foreign secretary, won with a total of 189 votes.) E-democracy was good for viral engagement but bad for intellectual heft and Five Star, beyond its tech innovations, offered few concrete policies. Poor moderation of Rousseau’s debate function helped, ironically, to preserve an internal hierarchy. “The management of the comments is … totally abandoned to the unavoidable background noise of a web site with high traffic levels,” wrote Italian blogger Massimo Mantellini. “You see participation pulverised in a few moments into useless confusion.”The problems only compounded when, in 2016, Casaleggio died and stewardship of Casaleggio Associati, the company responsible for maintaining Rousseau, passed on to his son, Davide. Over that period, critics began to argue that Five Star was being compromised by the younger Casaleggio’s influence. While the Rousseau platform ostensibly allowed for direct democratic participation, it became clear the software itself was in the hands of a private company controlled by a single man. Casaleggio seemed to blithely feed the suspicion: he gave preference to particular members and used Grillo’s own blog — to which he had access — to post political diatribes.The catastrophic decision to join a coalition with Draghi was ratified through a laughably lopsided poll: “Do you agree to the Movement supporting a technical-political government with a Super Ministry for the Green Transition, which defends the main achievements of the Movement, with the other political forces indicated by nominee-premier Mario Draghi?”I spoke to Casaleggio the Younger earlier this year, when his company was under growing scrutiny. Besuited and lightly stubbled, he had the manner of a browbeaten Silicon Roundabout marketing lead pressed between interminable conference calls. The son of a British mother, his English was Home Counties variety: soft, if a little irritable. Like his father, he was raised in Ivrea, the former site of the once vast Olivetti company, which had fed and housed all of its employees — an earlier (failed) attempt at a tech-driven utopia that, Casaleggio said, inspired his work at Casaleggio Associati.It was a bad time for him. Five Star MPs, increasingly acting like normal politicians, were threatening a split with Rousseau, and by extension Casaleggio Associati. They accused Casaleggio of undue influence. They didn’t like that he was demanding €450,000 in back payments from current and former MPs for maintenance of Rousseau, the lack of payment of which had made the software unusable. There was a battle over masses of voter data supposedly held in Rousseau’s database, which Casaleggio was eventually compelled to hand over.But he was reluctant to talk about all this, initially offering up some circuitous tech-talk of the Northern California variety — “We focus on disruptive technologies and how they disrupt business models … things like artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the internet of Things.” He didn’t really want to talk politics, it seemed, because he was trying to rebrand himself as a pure tech entrepreneur, with the stewardship of a political movement merely one of many competing projects. “I am moving more to technology and smart working,” he demurred.Casaleggio had, evidently, always seen the Movement as more of a vehicle for his inherited interest in tech-utopian experimentation (he said he is now big on “digital citizenship”). So he was dismayed that those plans had been derailed by the emergence of a class of increasingly entrenched politicians who were intent on using the Movement to keep themselves in power and enact policy goals — at the cost of Casaleggio’s own influence. Those politicians, who had risen from the Five Star rank-and-file and now commanded influence beyond the bounds of a mere voting application, had removed key rules enshrining term limits, without approval from the lowly membership. Casaleggio’s continued power had relied on fealty to his software; this was disappearing. There was almost a recursive, blockchain-y “code is law” gleam to his resentment. “There are some rules that we defined to use this platform,” he said, “and we created the Five Star movement on these rules.”Exhausted by infighting, Five Star’s grassroots members began to agitate for a rebrand, culminating in a decision that would set the Movement on its present path to obsolescence. In February, they voted overwhelmingly to join Draghi’s grand coalition and install Giuseppe Conte, the premier replaced by Draghi, as the Movement’s new leader. Conte, who presided over the recent electoral collapse, had ascended to power as a League-Five Star compromise candidate in 2018, having been plucked from his relatively obscure day-to-day life as a law professor. He was the exact kind of unelected nonentity that the original Five Star had wanted to expunge from Italian politics, and yet here he was, supplying stale breath to its dying gasp. Under Conte, Five Star was quick to split with the politically toxic Rousseau. Relieved of his operational duties, Casaleggio the Younger continued to tread the fine line between building a web-based democratic system beholden to nobody while also being beholden to a specific set of statutes that he happened to agree with. When I spoke to him, he seemed to have already moved on, and was in the midst of an experiment with, inevitably, blockchain, having completed various trial runs of an alternative Rousseau on the privacy-focused Monero blockchain. What better way to remove himself from the equation? In the event of Rousseau migrating to such a platform, Casaleggio said he would surrender his own influence, too – or at least the perception of it. “That’s obviously my objective,” he said. The irony of moving to a blockchain, of all things, seemed to escape him: to cede the appearance of control, Casaleggio would first have to make the executive decision to decentralise Rousseau. That would mean imposing on its members yet another wild experiment, an experiment they didn’t necessarily ask for — or vote for — and whose encoded principles, laws and bylaws would be at his discretion, and his alone.Today, Casaleggio mostly rhapsodises about tech from the safety of his LinkedIn page. He seems to have basically absconded from politics, except for one curiosity: last month, he announced that an organisation called the Solonian Democracy Institute had bestowed upon him a fairly rarefied honour: it was an award, given out once a year, for achievements relating to “Digital Democracy Impact.”
183  The writer was chief British negotiator in NI from 1997-2007There could hardly be a starker contrast in negotiating approaches than we have seen this week over the Northern Ireland protocol. The EU put forward a series of detailed compromises; David Frost tried to pre-empt them by moving the goalposts as far back as possible.After consulting businesses locally, the EU has tried to address the practical problems caused by the implementation of the protocol, spanning sausages to medicine. Meanwhile Frost raised the purely ideological issue of the role of the European Court of Justice, a body that has not caused any practical problems and is not germane to unionist complaints about the border in the Irish Sea.The EU has also suggested ways of involving Northern Irish politicians in decisions affecting the province. This is intended to meet objections around the lack of consent to the protocol. It would have been good if the British government had discovered its interest in consent earlier: the vast majority of Northern Ireland’s population would have voted against Johnson’s Brexit deal, the Unionists because of the protocol and the majority because of Brexit itself.The EU proposal now offers the basis for a negotiated solution to the gaps on the shelves that have riled ordinary people in Northern Ireland, but it does not solve the underlying problem of identity. Hard Brexit requires there to be a border somewhere, and the Unionists have a valid point in complaining that by putting it in the Irish Sea the government is undermining their British identity. But the only alternative is to put it on the island of Ireland and that would affect the identity of nationalists and Republicans. No one — not even the Unionists — has called for that. The border was always the insoluble problem of Brexit and it continues to be so.Given that the British side has not put forward an alternative suggestion, we must assume that all the noise coming from their camp is just a negotiating tactic. Invoking Article 16 is not an alternative to implementing the protocol, it is just a route to yet more negotiations. Frost may be right when he says there are no dividends in endlessly talking about Brexit, but I am afraid we are condemned to many more years — probably decades — of Sisyphean negotiations with the EU.We have seen this particular movie before. The recently published diary of Michel Barnier, the EU’s former Brexit negotiator, is replete with examples of Frost huffing and puffing and the EU staying calm and carrying on. Chances are that this is happening again and the outcome will be the same. In fact the history of the negotiations clearly demonstrates that such histrionics are completely counter-productive. They simply destroy trust, result in a worse agreement than would otherwise be possible and eventually force an embarrassing climbdown on the British side.But there is another possibility. If the British government is really serious about refusing to implement the protocol and the border in the Irish Sea, then they risk tipping us into a full-scale trade war — and one in which the EU would retaliate against the UK as a whole. To pile this disruption on top of the existing fuel crisis, missing lorry drivers, backed up ports and shortage of agricultural workers would be an act of political suicide. I find it hard to believe that even Johnson’s government would ultimately opt for that course.What I really object to however is the casual vandalism of the Northern Ireland peace process, something a previous generation of British politicians on both sides spent decades constructing. Dominic Cummings’ tweets reveal how little regard Johnson had for the Good Friday Agreement when it came to signing up for the Withdrawal Agreement. The prime minister continues to play politics with the peace process by using the DUP as a battering ram in negotiations with the EU. Having marched Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP’s leader up to the top of the hill, Johnson is now going to have to find a way to march him down again without humiliation and the risk of losing votes to his right. Donaldson will remember that Johnson left his predecessor, Arlene Foster, standing at the altar with disastrous consequences for her leadership.The threat Brexit posed in Northern Ireland was always more political than one of returning to the Troubles. But if Donaldson goes ahead with his threat to pull out of the power-sharing executive, then it will be exceedingly hard, if not impossible, to put the institutions up again in the foreseeable future. All of this is complicated by the Unionist fear of Sinn Féin winning the elections next year and taking the first minister position. That will lead to prolonged political crisis, reduced support for the devolved institutions and probably increased support for a united Ireland.For the sake of the peace process and the British economy, let’s hope Frost is really just bluffing yet again.
184  The writer is a Harvard senior fellow and author of ‘Extra Time: Ten Lessons for Living Longer Better’OMG, I forgot to have children!” says the ubiquitous cartoon, in which a pretty blonde with lots of lipstick smites her forehead.Now the new head of an all-women Cambridge college is offering seminars on fertility to students she fears are taught to focus more on their looks and careers than their biology. Dorothy Byrne, who was a successful TV executive before becoming head of Murray-Edwards college, is wonderfully honest about having put her career first and only woken up to her biological clock just in time to have her daughter at the age of 45.Every few years, some part of the establishment rises up to accuse women of ignorantly frittering away their fertility. But having interviewed women on three different continents about why they’re not having children, I think the problem is rather more complex. Some women do, sadly, leave it too late. But others have actively decided not to start a family, are worried about cost or have not met the right partner. Most young women I meet are very keen indeed to discuss whether to have a baby, and when.Yet the death of birth is one of the biggest stories of our age. In 1950, the average woman on the planet had five children; today she has just below 2.5. The birth rate in England and Wales has just hit a record low, with no sign of the rumoured baby boom from Covid-19 lockdowns.Catholic Italy now has among the lowest birth rates in Europe. Speaking to women there, I have found a combination of fear about the cost of starting a family and fury — largely with men who are neither bringing home the bacon nor stepping up to fatherhood.These women don’t need lectures about their fertility. When the Italian health minister tried just that, in 2016, she was met with outraged counter demonstrations. On National Fertility Day, women marched through the streets carrying placards reading “siamo in attesa” — a play on “we’re expecting”: affordable childcare and job protection.Other governments have faced similar problems when trying to cajole women into having kids. A hilarious Danish campaign urged women to “Do It For Denmark”, and to take romantic breaks because Danes have 46 per cent more sex on holiday (I have no idea where they get such precise statistics). But women have been largely unmoved — perhaps because they don’t like being treated like prize cattle. It is important to recognise that, contrary to the evolutionary impulse, quite a few women — and couples — are choosing not to have children. For many, being child-free is a liberation from societal expectations. Others feel, as one Singaporean couple put it to me, that kids “don’t pass the cost-benefit test”. Some wrestle with the question of whether it is right to bring children into what they feel is a very uncertain world. Four in ten young people surveyed in the UK, India, Brazil and seven other countries said they were hesitant to have children because of the climate crisis. Far from being too casual about the topic, most young people I meet put a great deal of thought into the pros and cons of parenthood. As a soppy mother of three, I feel they may be overthinking it. But a new hurdle is a dramatic shift in time of life stages. The human race is living longer, and taking longer to settle down, than ever before. The average age at which children leave home in the UK is now 25, an age which should arguably mark the new end of adolescence. But if people are settling down later and carrying student debt into their 30s, the window to start a family is narrowing: because we are stuck with female fertility fading from around 35.The calculation is different for men. It’s perfectly rational for a man to put off having children while he climbs the career ladder, especially given that many people seem to hit peak earning age in their forties. It’s not ideal to be bug-eyed from lack of sleep just when the big promotions loom, especially if you’re up against colleagues who are not having to change nappies at night.I meet many women in their thirties who are panicked about missing the boat, but dare not spook any date by mentioning kids over dinner. One friend was strung along by an eligible chap until her late thirties, who then fled when she gave him an ultimatum. Like many others, she is now grimly googling sperm banks. Although we can’t yet alter the biological clock, there is one way to change the equation. Some women are now freezing their eggs, either because they have not found Mr Right or because they want to have the best chance of conceiving later in life on their own terms, with or without a partner.Baroness Deech, former chair of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, argued in 2019 that women should be able to store frozen eggs for much longer than the currently permitted 10 years — which technological advances have now made possible. While this raises its own ethical questions about later parenthood, it could enable women to store their eggs in their twenties, when they are at their most fertile.It might make a difference to tell men that their fertility declines too. Research suggests that babies born to fathers over 45 have greater risks of being born prematurely, and of suffering from congenital diseases later in life.

185  Olaf Scholz has moved closer to succeeding Angela Merkel as German chancellor after his Social Democrats agreed with the Greens and liberal Free Democrats on moving towards formal negotiations to create a three-party coalition.At a joint press conference in Berlin on Friday, Scholz hailed the results of eight days of exploratory talks on a tie-up that has no precedent in Germany’s postwar history. “A new start is possible with the three parties that have come together here,” he said.The announcement indicates that Germany is heading for an SPD-led coalition with Scholz as chancellor and that Merkel’s CDU/CSU will be confined to opposition for the first time in 16 years.The SPD, Greens and FDP all saw their share of the vote increase in last month’s election, while the CDU/CSU slumped to 24.1 per cent — the worst result in its history.The three parties released a 12-page paper on Friday that sketched out what they had agreed during the talks. This will form the basis of formal coalition negotiations.The document must still be approved by a Green party conference scheduled for this weekend and by the governing executive of the FDP, though both are expected to give the go-ahead for formal talks.Scholz said the three parties had agreed to implement the “biggest industrial modernisation project Germany has undertaken in more than 100 years”, with huge investments in climate protection and an overhaul of the country’s creaky bureaucracy.“There has not been a comparable chance in a long time to modernise our society, economy and state . . . and we can’t let this chance pass us by,” said Christian Lindner, FDP leader.The three parties also wanted to “significantly increase” private and public investments over the coming years, but without touching the “debt brake” — Germany’s constitutional restriction on new borrowing.The Greens had called for a loosening of the rule to allow €500bn in investments over the next decade, much of it financed through increased public debt. But the FDP has always insisted the debt brake must stand.The paper contains important SPD election promises, such as a commitment to raising Germany’s minimum wage to €12 per hour. It also rules out any cuts in the state pension or an increase in Germany’s pensionable age, and says the next government should aim to build 400,000 new flats a year, 100,000 of them in the social housing sector.It also satisfies Green demands, saying Germany’s next government must “drastically accelerate” the buildout of renewable energy and exit all coal-fired power by 2030 — eight years earlier than currently planned. All new commercial buildings will be obliged to have solar panels installed and 2 per cent of Germany’s total territory will be set aside for wind turbines.But the Greens were unable to overcome liberal resistance to one of their big demands — a speed limit on German motorways. The FDP also blocked any attempt to raise the income tax rate for high earners and to introduce a wealth tax — a demand of both the SPD and Greens.The FDP also got its way with a mention in the paper of one of its key demands — “super” tax write-offs for investments in climate protection and digitisation.The paper says the three parties will strive to create a “digital state” that works “proactively for its citizens”. Administrative procedures will be accelerated, bureaucracy reduced and big investments in fast internet mobilised. The parties also said they would seek to reform Germany’s citizenship laws to enable immigrants to obtain residency status more quickly.
186  One of Turkey’s top business tycoons has spoken out against the country’s “exhausting” inflation and spiralling exchange rate, in a rare public intervention that will be seen as a thinly-veiled criticism of president Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s economic policy.Omer Koc, chair of Koc Holding, one of the country’s oldest and most important companies, called for an economic overhaul as he said it was “extremely saddening” to see the impact of annual inflation — which rose to almost 20 per cent last month — on ordinary Turkish citizens.“There is no lasting alternative but to bring down the exchange rate, [high] costs and their outcome: inflation,” he said at an event in Istanbul, according to a transcript of his comments published by the company on Friday.Koc made no mention in his remarks of Erdogan or his Justice and Development party (AKP), which has ruled Turkey for the past 20 years. But his comments will be seen as an unusual and thinly-veiled criticism of the Turkish leader, whose increasingly unpredictable and unorthodox approach to running the country’s $765bn economy has scared away foreign investment and caused rising public discontent at home.Koc called for reforms to help attract sorely needed foreign investment, adding: “It is obvious that, for the sake of peace in our country and for sustainable economic growth, it is necessary to act in accordance with reason and with science.”He said the country needed to return to the “fundamental reform agenda” of the first decade of the 2000s, a time when the AKP was newly in power and was following an IMF programme after a dramatic financial crisis. It is a period seen by many in the Turkish business world as a golden era.As Erdogan has consolidated his own powers and increasingly meddled in nominally independent economic institutions, the country has suffered a succession of crises. Analysts have said that his pursuit of high growth at all costs has come with the side effect of double-digit inflation and a sliding currency.Ten years ago, it cost 1.86 lira to buy a dollar. On Friday, the currency hit a new record low, reaching 9.24 against the greenback as investors fretted over a decision by Erdogan to fire three members of the central bank’s monetary policy committee.The Turkish president’s interference in monetary policy has combined with broader concerns about strained relations with the west and the erosion of the rule of law to scare away vital international capital.Foreign direct investment stood at just $5.7bn last year, according to central bank data — down from a peak of more than $19bn in 2007.Turkish business figures rarely criticise Erdogan or his policies — fearful of losing lucrative public contracts or being targeted by politically motivated investigations.Koc Holding itself, seen by the Islamist-rooted AKP as the embodiment of the old secular elite that they have long railed against, has had a tense relationship with the ruling party during its two decades in power.In 2013, Erdogan accused the company of sheltering violent protesters in its Divan Hotel in Istanbul during the Gezi Park demonstrations that rocked the government. A criminal investigation was opened against the group after its patriarch published a thinly-veiled critique of Erdogan later that same year.Koc’s brands include Tupras, which runs Turkey’s largest oil refinery, the white goods producer Arcelik (which trades as Beko in Europe), the bank Yapi Kredi and a joint venture with the auto giants Ford and Fiat. Its revenues were equivalent to more than 6 per cent of national gross domestic product in 2020, according to its annual report, and 7 per cent of the country’s exports.There was no immediate reaction from Erdogan or his ruling party to Koc’s remarks.Additional reporting by Funja Guler in Ankara
187  Protesters took to the streets of Italy on Friday to express their anger at the introduction of mandatory workplace Covid-19 health passes, one of the strictest measures to fight the disease imposed by a European country.The new rules require all workers to show a “green pass” that proves they have either been fully vaccinated, or have tested negative for coronavirus within the previous 48 hours.On Friday, the day the regulations came into force, demonstrators blocked access to the port areas of Genoa, Ancona and Trieste and held street protests in Rome and Milan. A small sit-in was also held outside the Sigonella Italian air force base in Sicily organised by the Siam air force trade union.“Having to pay to go to work, under the threat of blackmail for your salary, cannot be a tool to contain the pandemic,” the union said in a statement on its Facebook page about the protests.The government believes the tougher measures will prompt an estimated 3.8m unvaccinated Italian workers to get a jab. But the move has been met with fierce resistance from a small but vocal number of protesters who claim the rules infringe their rights.Speaking before the measure was introduced on Friday, Joachim Oberrauch, a 51-year-old high school teacher from Bolzano, said he had been suspended from his job because he had not been inoculated and was angered by the new rules.“I didn’t get the vaccine because I don’t trust all this chaos and miscommunication that has been going on from the start of the pandemic until now,” he said. “I don’t trust ‘big pharma’, and as of today the news about vaccines has been quite contradictory and confusing, so I decided to postpone it or wait for another vaccine to become available that I am not afraid of.”More than 80 per cent of all Italians over the age of 12 have received a Covid-19 vaccine, with Mario Draghi’s government after a slow start having turned the country into one of the vaccine leaders of Europe. Any public or private sector worker who breaks the rules risks being fined €1,500, while employers face fines if they fail to enforce the new measures.In the build-up to the new rules coming in, there have been violent demonstrations in Rome and elsewhere. Last week supporters of the fringe neo-fascist party Forza Nuova attempted to force their way into the prime minister’s official residence, as well as ransacking the offices of one of Italy’s largest trade unions, resulting in 12 arrests. Some workers are likely to face difficulties not because they have refused to be vaccinated but because they received a jab that has not been approved in the EU.Giulia Sorrentino, 34, recently returned to Italy after five years in Russia, where she worked as a university lecturer. She got two shots of Sputnik V in Moscow before coming back. Because the Russian vaccine is not recognised by the European Medicines Agency, she says she is “dismayed” by the government’s move.“When I came back the green pass limitations were much softer, it was summer, there was a lot of outside living, and I could more or less do everything I wanted,” she said. “I was also quite optimistic about the approval of Sputnik in Europe. But now, with the tightening of the restrictions, I can’t do anything at all.”
188  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.It’s not often that EU prime ministers trade barbs on Twitter, but yesterday Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte openly criticised Slovenia’s Janez Jansa (whose country still chairs the rotating EU presidency until the end of December) for making disparaging comments about EU lawmakers who visited Ljubljana and expressed concerns about the rule of law and freedom of the press.Jansa, who’s expressed controversial views on social media before (he congratulated Donald Trump for his US re-election last year, before the official results were called), retorted by implying that freedom of the press is more at risk in the Netherlands than in Slovenia after a journalist was shot in Amsterdam. Jansa also criticised the European Parliament for conducting “political intrigues and senseless accusations of Slovenia”.The row has the potential to escalate at next week’s European Council, prompting its chief, Charles Michel, to call Rutte and Jansa last night. Michel tweeted afterwards that “mutual respect” towards MEPs and among fellow EU leaders “is the only way forward”. A task that may prove harder to enforce than tweet about.Twitter spats aside, our main story today looks at next week’s first step towards a possible overhaul of the Stability and Growth Pact in the post-pandemic era.With UK Brexit minister Lord David Frost in town today, we also look at the negotiation quagmire the EU desperately wants to extract itself from, only to be sucked into once again.And in artificial intelligence news, we’re exploring why the potential use of AI by the bloc’s law enforcement agency has attracted fresh criticism.The EU will formally kick off next week the latest instalment of its long-running debate over how to reform its budgetary rules, as it publishes a consultation paper paving the way towards potential reforms of the Stability and Growth Pact, writes Sam Fleming in Brussels.Among the key goals underlying the upcoming discussions is ensuring the EU does not repeat the mistakes of the financial crisis, when premature budget cuts curbed Europe’s rebound compared with other big economies including the US.In addition, some policymakers are anxious to find ways of better incentivising public investment in priority areas including green spending and the digital economy — while finding a way to rebuild public finances following Covid-19-induced public debt blowouts.The discussions will again expose the deep gulfs between member states over how strict the EU’s budget rules should be, and how aggressively debt mountains should be pared back. But while those divisions remain as real as ever, it is also worth reflecting on how far the debate has come since the last economic crash.The IMF’s latest economic outlook lays out the picture clearly. As Vitor Gaspar, head of fiscal policy at the IMF, said this week, “fiscal policy proved its power” during the current crisis.Big economies with access to cheap funding were able to roll out massive spending and public support programmes. Their public spending power also boosted mass vaccination drives that enabled rapid reopenings in major economies. As a consequence the IMF predicts 5.2 per cent economic growth among advanced economies this year, following a 4.5 per cent contraction in 2020).Looking ahead, blockbuster stimulus packages unveiled by the US and the EU are set to play a surprisingly important role in the global growth outlook, the IMF’s latest Fiscal Monitor shows. It weighs up the impact of the American Families Plan and American Jobs Plan in the US, and the European Commission’s Next Generation EU recovery plan.While the €800bn EU plan has legislative backing, the fate of large sections of the US package will depend on political machinations on Capitol Hill. But the two programmes, if fully enacted, would deliver a $4.6tn real-terms boost to global GDP by 2026, according to the IMF. Positive economic spillovers to other countries represent more than 16 per cent of that extra output.Countries with deeper commercial ties to the US and EU will experience the most significant benefits, the IMF says. For example, the fund says the cumulative increase in real GDP in Canada and the UK would be about 5.2 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively.The flipside of this is a much more depressing message — namely the deep split between the fortunes of advanced economies and developing markets.Output for the advanced economy group is tipped to regain its pre-pandemic trend path in 2022 and exceed it by 0.9 per cent in 2024, according to the IMF’s World Economic Outlook. By contrast, output for the emerging markets group (excluding China) will stay 5.5 per cent below the pre-pandemic forecast in 2024.Public policy is again a key reason for the divergence. Advanced nations have been able to build more generous fiscal support packages on the back of low borrowing costs. In addition, vaccine rollouts in deep-pocketed rich economies have been far more expansive than in emerging and developing countries — where access remains extremely limited.The EU’s energy pricing system is at the heart of complaints from some member countries. It operates on a common “pay as you clear” model where wholesale electricity costs reflect the price of the last unit of energy bought via auctions held in member states — generally gas, even in pro-nuclear countries such as France. (More here)Yet another round of Brexit talks begins today in Brussels when Lord David Frost, UK Brexit minister, sits down for lunch with Maros Sefcovic, the commission vice-president handling UK relations, writes Andy Bounds in Brussels.The commission and member states believed, to paraphrase UK PM Boris Johnson, that “Brexit was done” with the deal sealed last year. But the UK wants to rehash the settlement over the thorny question of trade between Great Britain, which left the single market, and Northern Ireland, which stayed in.Sefcovic admits the Northern Ireland protocol, which created an Irish Sea border to prevent one on the island of Ireland itself, has caused disruption. He is also aware that the loyalist community is sensitive to threats to ties with the UK. Riots occurred earlier this year.Hence his proposals on Wednesday to cut checks substantially. But Sefcovic’s — and the EU’s — patience could run out by the end of the year, his deadline for a deal. The UK government welcomed his proposals but added last night that “there is still a substantial gap between our two positions”.The Slovak commissioner is too diplomatic to moan, telling the FT in an interview that talks are in the “home stretch”. “We are tilting the focus of the discussion back to a constructive path,” he said.But some countries are less diplomatic. “The EU member states’ patience is not infinite. It will reach a point where they will just have had enough,” was a typical comment from one official.Others have already tired of the Brits. Crises with Poland, Hungary, energy supplies and migration are just a few of the topics filling inboxes. Asked where Brexit was on the priority list, one diplomat replied “10 or 11”.Some believe that even after a deal on the protocol the British will demand to reopen other agreements. “For us, you finish negotiations and move on to other things, for them it’s always the beginning of new negotiations,” said one EU official.The potential use of artificial intelligence by Europol, the EU’s law enforcement agency, has come under criticism by privacy advocates and human rights defenders, writes Javier Espinoza in Brussels.Europol has for a long time asked to be able to use this technology, which it says will help catch terrorists and other criminals.This week, the European parliament’s committee on civil liberties, justice and home affairs voted in favour of Europol being able to process massive amounts of data using artificial intelligence. MEPs are likely to confirm its new powers in a plenary vote scheduled for next week.The move has prompted activists to raise concerns that the agency may misuse the technology and escape scrutiny, pointing to Europol’s patchy record when it comes to handling data.Last October, the European Data Protection Supervisor warned it was highly likely Europol “continually processes personal data on individuals for whom it is not allowed to do so”.Europol spokesman Jan Op Gen Oorth said any future deployment of AI will make sifting through data collected by member states much easier, but that it will only be done in consultation with the bloc’s data protection authorities “to ensure appropriate levels of data protection as a fundamental right of EU citizens”.“Europol is respecting the democratic process and is looking forward to its outcome,” the spokesman added.The use of AI by police is highly contested. In the US, for instance, there have been multiple reported incidents of wrongful arrests because of incorrect facial recognition matches, in many cases involving people of colour.The UK police has faced legal challenges for alleged human rights violations. Activists in the country worry about a legal vacuum because the laws relating to the use of technologies such as artificial intelligence have not been updated for nearly a decade.In the European parliament, dissenting voices are also raising concerns, even as pro-law enforcement MEPs are likely to carry the day.“The vote next week will legitimise Europol’s current activities which are not always legal when it comes to respecting data protection and privacy,” said Saskia Bricmont, a Belgian Green MEP who vehemently opposes the plans.She said the agency’s patchy record and glitches in the technology were a bad mix. “This is problematic because there is a lack of efficiency in the AI tools and they are not 100 per cent giving us the truth,” Bricmont said.Activists worry the processing of this information may lead to wrongly accusing innocent individuals. “The fundamental risk is the impact that this may have on fairness of proceedings and the integrity of the justice system,” said Laure Baudrihaye-Gerard, European legal director at Fair Trials, an advocacy group in Brussels.“There’s a huge gap with potential for mistakes,” she added.
189  Some 340 of the 376 lawyers who took part in the survey, anonymously, said there were some firms they would never join, regardless of the pay on offer. In the past 12 months, just over a third of the respondents had actively considered leaving the legal profession or changing their specialism, according to RSGi, which carried out the survey for the Financial Times Innovative Lawyers (Europe) report. “Throwing money at the problem won’t make the problem go away,” said one lawyer.Another respondent said that, as soon as a client requires a response from lawyers, caring goes out the window: “No firm feels able to say ‘no’ because another firm will say ‘yes’.” Lawyers at top tier firms have been in high demand in the past 12 months and many have seen their hours increase. “I would strongly consider moving to a firm which retains full remote working opportunities post-pandemic,” said one. 90 per cent said that, if they were applying for a job at a law firm now, there are firms they would refuse to work for, regardless of remuneration, because they believe the working culture would impact their wellbeing.35 per cent have actively considered leaving to work in a different profession or sector in the past 12 months.30 per cent would accept a reduction in pay in exchange for reduced working hours if this was offered by their organisation.32 per cent would prefer to have their working hours more strictly limited/regulated by their organisation.38 per cent do not think the hours they are expected to work are reasonable.37 per cent said volunteering and pro bono opportunities offered by their firm improve their wellbeing, while 26 per cent said it does not improve their wellbeing; the remaining 37 per cent said it was either not offered or not applicable.52 per cent were aware their organisation has a published wellbeing policy.Source: RSGi
190  Leading EU member states are pressing Brussels to draw up tough retaliatory measures should the UK carry out its threat to suspend trading arrangements for Northern Ireland enshrined in the Brexit deal.Representatives of five member states on Monday met European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic, the EU Brexit negotiator, to demand he come up with contingency plans for a possible trade war, diplomats have told the Financial Times.France, Germany and the Netherlands, a traditional UK ally, were the most vocal, supported by Italy and Spain, the diplomats added.Among the options being discussed in EU capitals are curbing UK access to the bloc’s energy supplies, imposing tariffs on British exports, or in extreme circumstances terminating the trade agreement between the two sides.UK Brexit minister Lord David Frost on Tuesday warned that London could seek to suspend much of the Northern Ireland protocol, the part of the withdrawal agreement that sets out the region’s trading arrangements since Britain left the EU.The protocol mandates customs and regulatory checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland that took effect in January, and these arrangements have become a bitter source of dispute between the two sides.By invoking Article 16 of the protocol, the UK could disregard many of its requirements, but the EU would be expected to retaliate in such circumstances.One diplomat said EU capitals wanted the commission to draw up a “legally sound, proportionate and robust response”.Under the Brexit deal, the UK agreed to allow Northern Ireland to remain in the EU single market for goods to avert a hard border on the island of Ireland.Sefcovic on Wednesday proposed changes to the protocol, including scrapping many of the checks on foods going from Great Britain to the region, in an effort to resolve the dispute with the UK.But EU member states fear the UK, after demanding a fundamental rewrite of the protocol, will reject the bloc’s proposals and instead trigger Article 16.“There’s a significant chance that Frost will say ‘We want the moon’,” said another diplomat, adding that the UK Brexit minister might try to get rid of the Northern Ireland protocol altogether.“Frost knows he’s playing with fire. But when you play with fire, you get burnt. The EU has a broad palette of options for hitting back at the UK: for example, energy supplies.”The UK relies on undersea cables and pipelines connecting it with the EU for up to 10 per cent of its electricity supplies and 12 per cent of its gas. France has already threatened to shut off its 2 gigawatt electricity cable to the UK in a separate dispute over post-Brexit fishing rights.Frost travels to Brussels on Friday for talks with Sefcovic, with both sides far apart on the crucial issue of whether the European Court of Justice should continue to play a role in overseeing the Northern Ireland protocol.UK health secretary Sajid Javid said “there should not be a role for the ECJ in any part of the UK”. Frost, however, has left himself some leeway, saying the issue was not a “red line”.Neither side has shown any appetite for adopting a possible compromise legal solution similar to the one used in bilateral treaties signed by the EU with neighbours such as Ukraine.Under that model, proceedings first go to an arbitration panel, while the ECJ would continue to issue binding opinions on matters of EU law.“What stands in the way of progress is the politics,” said Anton Spisak, a former UK adviser on Brexit. “Substantive solutions require changes to the text of the protocol, which the EU says it cannot do, while the UK says it won’t agree to anything less.”If the UK triggered Article 16, there would be a month of talks between the two sides after which the EU could retaliate with “proportionate” countermeasures, pending a ruling by an independent arbitrator.EU measures could include tariffs on UK exports such as cars. Simply increasing EU checks already allowed on British goods moving across the English Channel could lead to huge congestion.The EU could ultimately terminate its trade and co-operation agreement, which guarantees tariff-free trade with the UK, with a year’s notice.“The EU would take a close look at possible countermeasures along the whole EU-UK co-operation landscape, including the TCA,” said another diplomat.Sefcovic told the Financial Times in an interview on Wednesday that he preferred a “constructive path” with the UK.“This week is not about Article 16, to be honest, it is about the proposals. And I trust Lord Frost and the UK government will see the huge merit in what we are putting on the table,” he added.Sefcovic said he was open to different solutions when he meets Frost on Friday but added: “This process cannot go on forever.”He warned that British intransigence was blocking collaboration with the EU in fields such as defence and foreign policy.Sefcovic said the EU saw the withdrawal agreement and the trade and co-operation accord as a “baseline” from which to build a wider relationship.“The question is why enter into any new deals with the UK, if two such important agreements . . . are not respected?” he added. “That is to be honest quite a fundamental issue. I thought with such a country like the UK we would never have this discussion. Once you sign a deal you respect it.”
191  Germany’s top economic research institutes have cut their growth forecasts for Europe’s largest economy this year to 2.4 from 3.7 per cent, blaming supply bottlenecks in manufacturing and the lingering impact of the pandemic on services.The lower forecasts — published twice a year on behalf of the government — reflect a worsening short-term outlook for the German economy, as supply chain problems have continued for longer than many economists expected.Oliver Holtemöller, head of macroeconomics at the Halle Institute for Economic Research, said the economy had rebounded strongly earlier this year — but not as much as expected “and that was because of supply bottlenecks in the manufacturing sector”. “Production has actually been falling there since the start of the year and the effects of the pandemic . . . as well as the supply bottlenecks will slow down the recovery over the winter months,” he told a Berlin press conference.German industrial production fell 4.1 per cent in August, taking it 9 per cent below pre-pandemic levels. Several of Germany’s big carmakers have had to idle production due to shortages of materials, particularly semiconductors.However, the five research institutes raised their forecasts for next year to 4.8 from 3.9 per cent, after which they predicted growth would slow to 1.9 per cent in 2023.The outlook is in line with most economists’ models but more pessimistic than one published this week by the IMF, which lowered its prediction for German growth this year to 3.1 from 3.6 per cent and raised its forecast for next year to 4.6 per cent.“We assume that the supply bottlenecks will only be resolved gradually, in the course of next year,” said Holtemöller. “The main driver of the recovery next year will be private consumption. This will pick up significantly.”He said confidence in next year’s rebound was bolstered by the strength of Germany’s labour market, after the country added 240,000 jobs in the three months to September. “We see that companies are hiring a lot,” he added.The five institutes predicted Germany would add a further 450,000 jobs next year and a similar amount in 2023, pushing its unemployment rate close to pre-pandemic levels.But they predicted growth in unit labour costs would drop from 3.4 per cent last year to 0.8 per cent this year and zero in 2023 — dismissing fears that rising inflation could trigger a surge in wages.Holtemöller said German inflation would return to around 2 per cent from 2023. “We are not seeing any signals at the moment . . . that we could get a significantly above-average inflation rate over the long run.”That is despite higher inflation forecasts both for this year, which were raised to 3 per cent from 2.4 per cent, and for next year, to 2.5 from 1.7 per cent — reflecting expectations that higher energy prices and production costs will pressure prices.Oliver Rakau, chief German economist at Oxford Economics, said the expectation that inflation will fade in Europe’s largest economy, even though it has one of the eurozone’s lowest unemployment rates, strengthened the European Central Bank’s case that the recent surge in inflation above its 2 per cent target is only “transitory”. Germany’s political parties are still negotiating to form a ruling coalition after last month’s election. But the institutes predicted the country would soon return to fiscal discipline, with its budget deficit falling from 4.9 per cent of gross domestic product this year to 2.1 per cent next year and 0.9 per cent in 2023.
192  Strange things are happening in France. Ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy has been given a jail sentence (to be served at home), after his second conviction in six months. Other prominent Frenchmen have been charged with rape or incest. Jurors of the country’s main literary prize have been barred from awarding it to their lovers. The Ecole Nationale d’Administration, the school that recruits the self-reproducing French political elite, is being renamed and supposedly reformed.The French — possibly the most pessimistic nation — might refuse to believe it, but it turns out their elite can be cleansed after all. And there are lessons here for other countries.Every elite eventually becomes self-serving, and the French elite I encountered after moving to Paris 20 years ago was shameless. Its members studied together, then clustered in a few arrondissements around the Seine, decamping in summer to each other’s second homes. In a high-tax country, caste-mates rewarded each other more through power and perks than money. If problems arose, you could generally call a friendly judge. An era was summed up in the 2016 photo of François Fillon — Sarkozy’s prime minister — chilling with his family on the lawn of his château.But the French elite has learnt to listen out for the whoosh of the guillotine and, in 2017, several forces combined to force a cleanse. There was the threat that the far-right leader Marine Le Pen would become president. Emmanuel Macron won instead, but he had no temperamental loyalty to old friends. He brought in a younger elite generation containing unprecedented numbers of women and infected by foreign norms of transparency. Months later, the exposure of American predator Harvey Weinstein unleashed the global #MeToo movement.A Macroniste law on “the moralisation of politics” stopped MPs from hiring relatives or spending without providing invoices. Fillon was convicted for employing his wife in a fictitious job. Inevitably, some on the right claim that he and Sarkozy are victims of judicial persecution. Perhaps their sentences have simply exacerbated French mistrust of elites. Nonetheless, these are signs of reform: justice is no longer just for little people.Parliamentary life has changed too. Gone are six-hour champagne-fuelled lunches with 22-year-old “research assistants”. One Parisian restaurateur grumbles that politicians today “don’t have any money”. In late 2017, lifts at parliament were hung with signs stating the legal definition of harassment, associated jail terms and fines, and adding numbers for victims to call. It’s having an effect.French #MeToo accelerated last winter, sparked by two memoirs, by Camille Kouchner and Vanessa Springora, containing allegations about incest and paedophilia. Kouchner’s stepfather, Olivier Duhamel, president of elite dining club Le Siècle — in effect, chairman of the French establishment — was banished from public life, accused of having abused her brother. The case brought down several other elite members, including controversialist philosopher Alain Finkielkraut, sacked by TV channel LCI after he pondered about the alleged abuse of a 14-year-old: “Was there consent? . . . Was there some form of reciprocity?” A different slice of the elite, the Catholic church, faces similar difficulties after a report estimated priests had sexually abused 216,000 of today’s French adults since 1950.The scandal around France’s biggest literary prize may seem small beer by comparison, but it’s culturally just as telling. One author longlisted for this year’s Prix Goncourt happened to be the boyfriend of a juror; that juror also wrote a devastating review of a competing novel. A decade ago, nobody would have cared. Indeed, the Goncourt’s secretary-general, Philippe Claudel, initially said, bizarrely, that “there is no ethical problem, as there would have been in the case of a spouse, descendant or progenitor”. Other defenders noted that the couple didn’t live together.But times are changing. Last week the Goncourt banned jury members from consecrating lovers and family. Most unusually too, the newly unveiled shortlist featured no books from the country’s best-connected publisher, Gallimard. All this follows last year’s reform of France’s biggest cinematic prizes, the Césars: the board resigned after 400 artists criticised an “elitist and closed” academy that had nominated a film by the convicted paedophile director Roman Polanski for 12 awards.France hasn’t suddenly become a Nordic-style model of transparent egalitarianism. But it is reforming, and it’s not alone. When elite institutions are attacked from below, they find reason to clean up.Italy has slashed its number of parliamentarians and is reforming its courts so that wealthy defendants can’t string out cases until they lapse. In Britain, Oxbridge is admitting more state-school pupils. Voters have stopped tolerating self-dealing leaders, as witnessed by this week’s resignation of Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz and the defeat of Czech prime minister Andrej Babis. Part of fighting corruption is that we should be willing to acknowledge when it declines.Follow Simon on Twitter @KuperSimon and email him at simon.kuper@ft.comFollow @FTMag on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first
193  The Turkish lira hit a record low overnight after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ordered a new round of dismissals at the country’s central bank.In a late-night decree published hours after he met Sahap Kavcioglu, the bank’s governor, Erdogan removed two deputy governors.One of them, Ugur Namik Kucuk, was the only member of the bank’s seven-member monetary policy committee to oppose a rate cut that shocked international investors last month, according to two people familiar with the matter.“He was the one who voted against the interest rate cut decision so it’s a pity for him and for the country,” said one Istanbul-based banker.Kucuk was also opposed to the contentious policy of selling off the bank’s foreign currency reserves in a doomed bid to prop up the lira, the banker added. The policy began in early 2019 and continued until the end of last year.The second sacked deputy governor, Semih Tumen, had been rumoured to be in line to succeed Kavcioglu.Erdogan, who has ruled Turkey for almost two decades, has gained unprecedented control over the nominally independent central bank in recent years after taking steps to consolidate his own powers.The president, an opponent of high interest rates, has clashed with a succession of governors as he has sought to prioritise high growth at all costs — including soaring inflation. He has sacked the central bank chief three times since mid-2019, as well as dismissing a number of other officials.Abdullah Yavas, a longstanding member of the monetary policy committee who had faced criticism in Turkish media for living in the US, was also dismissed by Erdogan on Wednesday night.In overnight trading the lira, already under pressure owing to a strong US dollar and investor concerns about Turkey’s economic and foreign policy, fell 1 per cent to TL9.19 to the dollar. The currency has suffered a bruising few years, losing 59 per cent of its value against the dollar since the start of 2018.In early European trading on Thursday, the lira stood at TL9.14 against the dollar.The lira came under pressure last week after Reuters reported that Erdogan had lost faith in Kavcioglu, who was appointed as head of the central bank in March, even though he slashed the bank’s benchmark rate last month to 18 per cent at a time when annual inflation was running at 19 per cent.The president’s communications chief rebuffed that claim and the Wednesday meeting between Erdogan and Kavcioglu, which was announced by the president’s office, was interpreted by investors as a show of support for the governor.Kucuk was a well-known figure in the international financial community. A former chief economist at the private Garanti bank, he often took the lead in answering questions during the central bank’s regular video conferences with foreign investors. Market participants were struck by his absence from a meeting that took place last week.Taha Cakmak, a former official at the state-owned Ziraat Bank and the Turkish banking regulator, was appointed as a new deputy governor. Yusuf Tuna, an academic at Istanbul Commerce University, was appointed to the monetary policy committee.Hakan Kara, who served as chief economist at the central bank until he was sacked in 2019, said there was “no trace of institutional memory” left on the monetary policy committee after the firings. But he added that it was “no longer needed anyway” because decisions on interest rates were no longer being taken by the bank itself.Piotr Matys, a senior FX analyst at In Touch Capital Markets, said the reshuffle “strengthens the position of governor Kavcioglu”. He predicted that further rate cuts would come, fuelling further lira losses and stoking inflation.“If the lira was significantly overvalued, cutting interest rates would be a justified strategy,” he said. “However, this is not the case. At a time when global commodity prices are high and may rise further, Turkey needs a stable or even a stronger currency.”Many foreign investors have already pulled their money out of Turkey in response to what they see as unconventional and unpredictable policymaking. Foreign investors held just $6bn in government bonds at the end of the second quarter of 2021, according to central bank data, compared with $61.5bn at the same time in 2013.That means the impact of the falling currency will be felt mostly domestically in the form of higher energy costs in a country that imports almost all of its oil and gas. That in turn risks stoking inflation, which has become a political headache for President Erdogan given deep public discontent over the rising cost of food and other basic goods.
194  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.A grim reality is shaping up in Romania where the energy crisis is piling on soaring Covid-19 infections and deaths, all while politicians are quarrelling and seeking to form a new government. We’ll have a look at the chances surprise-nominee Dacian Ciolos has in cobbling together a majority and become a prime minister again.Over in the European parliament, some lawmakers are engaging in lucrative side-hustles — which are allowed but questionable given the lack of information on who is paying them for the extra work. We’ll give you a rundown of the top earners, courtesy of Transparency International which dug up the numbers.In Norway, a new centre-left government is being unveiled today which looks set to continue exploiting the country’s oil reserves, including in the Arctic, just as the centre-right government has done over the past eight years.Last night, the EU proposed to sweep away most checks on goods crossing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland in an attempt to ensure smoother trade within the UK, but the protracted post-Brexit dispute with London is unlikely to end here.A triple crisis is brewing in Romania as a potential new prime minister is trying to gain a foothold on a notoriously shifting political landscape at a time when energy prices are spiking and the coronavirus is infecting a record number of people, writes Marton Dunai in Budapest.In a somewhat surprising move, Romania’s president Klaus Iohannis on Monday called on centrist-liberal leader of the USR party, Dacian Ciolos (up until recently leader of the Renew group in the European parliament) to form a government.The move was unexpected because USR was the smaller coalition partner that had left the government in the first place. Earlier this month, USR backed a no-confidence vote that toppled Prime Minister Florin Citu, who is also the president of the National Liberal party (PNL).Citu continues as interim PM while Ciolos is now seeking a parliamentary majority for his new government.A former EU commissioner for agriculture and head of a technocrat government in Romania in 2015-17, Ciolos has worked on his liberal credentials as head of Renew group in the European parliament (dominated by Emmanuel Macron’s party).But the 52-year-old has struggled to make a lasting impression in the complex haggling over posts, policies and prominence that group are tasked with.Ciolos, who held a first round of talks yesterday with potential coalition partners, is likely to run into difficulties in cobbling together a majority as the ruling PNL is still holding a grudge against the USR for quitting the previous coalition.If he makes it as premier, Ciolos will have an immediate crisis to handle — Covid infections and death rates in Romania have surged to their highest level since the onset of the pandemic and the vaccination rate hovers just above 30 per cent, one of the lowest in Europe.Ambulance cars line up at the entrances of hospitals, which struggle to admit new arrivals and Romanians worry that scenes seen in Italy in early 2020, with people treated in crowded hospital corridors, could soon be a reality for them. Hungary’s government yesterday said it would take excess Covid patients, to free up some capacity in Romania’s overcrowded hospitals.The health crisis was predictable as many Romanians rejected vaccinations and anti-vaxxers are given ample air time on TV and social media — even as the Citu government pronounced the pandemic as being over in the summer.“It is a vicious circle,” Romanian political analyst Ion Ionita said. “We do not have a government in power, so we do not have new measures to cope with Covid, and of course to cope with the energy price crisis.”“It could be a prolonged political crisis,” he said. If it came down to early elections, Ionita pointed out that they were likely to take place at a time when the energy and the Covid crises overlap with a potentially disastrous result for the ruling centre-right parties.“Winter is coming,” Ionita said.All of this puts into a stark context the country’s longer-term problems — continued concerns about corruption and pending administrative and judicial reforms required as “milestones” for the EU recovery money to be delivered.The shortage of heavy goods vehicle drivers is widespread across Europe, reaching 80,000 in Germany and 400,000 across the whole EU, according to industry associations. They warn the situation is likely to worsen owing to an ageing workforce — the average age of drivers is over 50 — and difficulties recruiting young people. (More here)The finances of MEPs is under the spotlight, after new research from Transparency International sheds light on the side-hustles of Brussels parliamentarians, writes Mehreen Khan.TI’s figures reveal more than a quarter of the chamber’s 705 MEPs have declared earnings outside their salaries, with an estimated 39 reporting €100,000-plus a year (MEPs earn just over €105,000 a year).The centre-right European People’s party pull in the biggest total income of all political groups, with Polish MEP Radoslaw Sikorski topping the list with at least €588,048 a year. Second is Italy’s Renew Europe MEP Sandro Gozi with at least €360,072 in additional income, according to TI which compiled the figures based on public declarations.Supplementary income is not prohibited in the European parliament and MEPs have to declare their earnings on a monthly basis. But as reporting is done in a range of earnings rather than specifics, total figures could be much higher say TI.The figures will supercharge a debate about possible conflicts of interest and lobbying of MEPs at a time when the parliament will be making key legislative decisions on climate change policies and digital regulation. TI note that about 15 per cent of MEPs’ declarations did not specify what they were being paid for, providing “vague or generic job descriptions”.Daniel Freund, a German Green MEP, said the EP needed robust, independent oversight rather than the current system of self-regulation over second incomes. “The study shows: we finally need an independent control body.”Norway made it into the news last night when a lone attacker used a bow and arrow to kill people, but today attention turns to the country’s new minority centre-left government taking charge, writes Richard Milne in Oslo.The new government’s platform announced yesterday focused on issues such as introducing VAT on the most expensive electric cars, changes in local government, and the maximum price for a spot in kindergarten.The names of the ministers will be presented today but it is clear Labour leader Jonas Gahr Store will be prime minister, Centre leader Trygve Slagsvold Vedum will be finance minister, and former culture minister Anniken Huitfeldt will take over the foreign ministry.On the biggest issues abroad, there is little change from eight years of centre-right rule in Oslo. Even though the Centre party are generally Eurosceptic, the government commits itself to the European Economic Area. It also pledges to develop, not unwind, the petroleum sector — the largest in western Europe — much as the outgoing centre-right prime minister, Erna Solberg, had pledged. And it wants to make Norway’s $1.4tn oil fund world leading in sustainable and green investments, even with the pro-oil Vedum in charge of the finance ministry.Still, it is as much what the policy document — which will guide the next potential four years of government — doesn’t talk about that is instructive.As Europe Express wrote yesterday, the EU wants a ban on drilling in the Arctic. Norway is arguably the most aggressive of all the Arctic states in oil and gas exploration and there is no word on it in the policy platform, even as many petroleum groups — including state-backed Equinor — appear to turn their back on the Barents Sea area.“Too grey, and too little red and green,” was the verdict of the leader of the Socialist Left party, which Store had wanted in his government, but which decided to stay in opposition. Expect an increasing international focus on what this oil-rich country should be doing on climate in the coming years.
195  Turkey has a fighter jet problem. The decades-old Nato member was barred by the US from taking delivery of its order of more than 100 next-generation F35s that were meant to form the backbone of its air force — a punishment for Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s decision to buy a Russian-made air defence system from Vladimir Putin.Ankara one day hopes to fill the gap in its air force by building its own, Turkish-made fighter. But, with that aircraft far from ready, for now it is reliant on an ageing fleet of F16s.That explains the recent request submitted by Ankara to Washington for 40 newer F16s, made by Lockheed Martin, as well as modernisation kits to upgrade close to 80 of its existing jets.Turkey, which has been subject to US sanctions on its defence industry since in December 2020 because of the Russian S-400 defence system contract, argues the deal would be win-win. It would help Turkey update its air force at a time when Greece, its neighbour and long-standing rival, is buying French Rafale jets and American F35s. While the S-400 is seen by the US as a threat to the security of its fifth generation F35, the same problem may not arise with the older F16.Not only would a deal be lucrative for the US defence industry, but it would also help mend strained relations with the US and western allies, who have no interest in Erdogan getting closer to Putin.“There’s an opportunity here,” says Alper Coskun, a former Turkish diplomat now based in Washington at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “This would guarantee that the Turkish defence industry, or at least a significant element of it, would continue to be embedded in the transatlantic relationship. It’s a way out of the dilemma that we’re facing that would have a ripple effect in a lot of other areas.” But it is unclear whether the US will oblige. Congress, which can block the sale, is hostile to Erdogan for a long list of reasons, including human rights abuses and military operations against US-backed Kurdish forces in Syria.Even if Joe Biden’s administration is more inclined to advocate on Erdogan’s behalf — as Ankara believes — the Turkish leader’s determination to buy Russian equipment by purchasing a second S-400 air defence system will not help. “In the future, nobody will be able to interfere in terms of what kind of defence systems we acquire, from which country, at what level,” he told the broadcaster CBS News days before submitting the F16 request.The S-400 issue is the “main impediment” to getting the fighter jet deal through Congress, says Aaron Stein, director of the Middle East programme at the Philadelphia-based Foreign Policy Research Institute. “Not from a threat basis, but from a pissed-off basis.” An angry Congress will probably want concessions from Erdogan on the Russian hardware that is already in Turkey and a commitment not to buy the second system. But the Turkish president, who accuses the US of failing to offer him an American alternative, is unlikely to cede ground.The situation creates a bind for the Biden administration. Pressing for a green light to the F16 sale without any conditions would be seen by Turkey’s critics as unwarranted appeasement. But if the sale is rejected, Ankara will have found a ready-made excuse for turning to Russia.Deeper Turkish defence co-operation with Moscow would not serve Ankara’s interests. Not only would it be likely to trigger further US sanctions, it would also be damaging for the expanding domestic defence industry Erdogan himself has championed.Yet the worry is that he may feel he has no other option. During a 2019 trip to a Russian airshow where he ate ice cream with Putin and eyed up Russian defence kit, Erdogan asked his Russian counterpart, half jokingly, about buying one of his Su-57 fighters. Some western officials are now anxious that the quip could become a reality.“If the Americans don’t approve this deal then what will Turkey do? They will buy Russian or Chinese,” says a European diplomat who is eager to see the F16s sale approved. “They have to fill this gap.”
196  The soaring cost of gas has pushed up energy bills across Europe — and put the EU’s electricity market under the spotlight.The way prices are set has come under fire not just from member states — with Spain and France leading calls for changes to protect consumers from surging costs — but from Russia, where President Vladimir Putin blames rising gas prices partly on the EU’s decision to phase out long-term contracts in favour of market-based prices.The European Commission, however, has resisted pressure for major regulatory changes to the 30-year-old EU energy market. Brussels has published a “toolbox” of options to deal with the price surge, such as direct income support and tax breaks but is staying away from promising a radical overhaul of pricing rules.Kadri Simson, EU energy commissioner, has defended the system for paving the way for market liberalisation and encouraging investment in green technologies.The average European household electricity bill is broken down into costs for taxes and VAT (about 35 per cent), network operator costs (30 per cent), and the unit cost of energy (about 35 per cent), according to figures from the EU’s Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER).At the heart of complaints from some countries is the EU’s energy pricing system. It operates on a common “pay as you clear” model where wholesale electricity costs reflect the price of the last unit of energy bought via auctions held in member states.Generally gas is the fuel that is needed to make sure enough energy is supplied to meet demand.So even in countries such as France — where cheaper nuclear power provides about 70 per cent of electricity — gas is still driving the wholesale electric price. And as the gas price has soared, so has the price of electricity.The EU’s energy market has helped to bring down prices across Europe since the late 1990s by accelerating a shift away from long-term contracts for fossil fuels such as oil to less carbon-intensive natural gas and renewables bought on spot markets.Because prices are based on shifting supply and demand dynamics, Europe has even experienced negative prices — most notably during the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 — when supply massively outweighed falling demand. Between 2019 and 2020, Europe’s households experienced a 20 per cent fall in the cost of gas, according to figures from Eurostat.Jan Cornillie, research associate at the European University Institute, said the EU’s energy market had “delivered very low prices for years” but a confluence of recent factors — largely outside the control of policymakers — mean that “this is among the first times it is not working in our favour”.“The lesson is not to do away with the design altogether but to add insurance mechanisms in times of high prices,” said Cornillie.Brussels is also fiercely protective of a model that it says is crucial to meeting its ambitious climate goals and speeding up the transition to renewable energy.Marginal pricing means all suppliers in the market, including cheaper wind or solar installations, get the price paid for the most expensive offer accepted, providing a boon for capital intensive technologies such as renewable energy. “The market is not dominated by the big players and is open for smaller renewable installations,” Simson told the Financial Times.Finance ministers from France, Spain, Romania, Greece and the Czech Republic have called for sweeping changes to “better establish a link between the price paid by the consumers, and the average production cost of electricity in national production mixes”.The commission has promised to assess how this possible “delinking” could be achieved.But appetite for sweeping changes is low. Changing the marginal pricing rules would also require time-consuming EU legislation. Many member states including Germany, the Netherlands and the Nordics are likely to resist major legal changes in the face of a price surge that experts say is expected to fade by early 2022.“To the extent that [the price surge] is a temporary phenomenon, then the response should be just as transitory,” Christian Zinglersen, director of ACER, told the FT.One solution that Brussels is working on is to find ways to boost the EU’s capacity to procure and store natural gas so it would be available to smooth out swings in prices at times of high demand. “Volatility is likely here to stay and we need to work on accepting this,” said Zinglersen.Only about a dozen member states have their own strategic gas reserves.By contrast, the EU already has strict rules on emergency oil stocks: each member state must keep crude oil worth 61 days of consumption and continually report stock levels to Brussels.But moves towards establishing joint EU gas purchasing and storage are likely to be beset by technical difficulties and high costs. Natural gas is stored in underground reservoirs and the market is dominated by commercial players, including Russia’s Gazprom.“Only a few member states may be able to offer storage sites at sufficient scale, again raising the tricky question on how costs are divided between them,” noted Christian Egenhofer and Irina Kustova at the Centre for European Policy Studies.Energy commissioner Simson on Wednesday said Brussels would propose a “voluntary” system for joint storage and procurement, encouraging countries who want to participate, but not creating obligatory rules.Follow on Twitter: @mehreenkhn
197  Almost three months after the UK demanded far-reaching reform of the Brexit deal’s trading arrangements for Northern Ireland, the European Commission on Wednesday proposed more limited changes.In July UK Brexit minister Lord David Frost requested a fundamental rewrite of the deal, to eliminate most checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.The commission responded with four papers on Wednesday that address some of Frost’s demands, but leave several others unanswered. The Financial Times summarises the key issues below.The Northern Ireland protocol in the UK-EU withdrawal agreement sought to safeguard peace in the region by averting the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland.But with the protocol placing Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods, the bloc insisted on customs and regulatory checks on products going to the region from Great Britain. The protocol thereby created a trade border in the Irish Sea.Business complained that these arrangements involved unacceptable levels of bureaucracy, and they were one of several factors blamed for violence in Northern Ireland in April.In July, the UK government accepted the need for full EU checks on goods going from Great Britain into Ireland and the bloc’s single market excluding Northern Ireland.But Britain said there was “no need for certificates and checks for individual items” that were part of a traceable supply chain and destined only for consumption in Northern Ireland.The EU has stopped short of meeting these demands, and instead proposed measures to reduce physical inspections of goods at the border. EU officials said the proposals could end as much as 80 per cent of current checks.This means a lorry load of supermarket goods with hundreds of products going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland could need just a single certificate which states that all the items meet EU standards and legal requirements.However, businesses will still need to have “detailed documentation” for each product available for electronic inspection by border authorities, with details including proof that the items are UK-made and not imported from another country outside the EU.Northern Ireland will be exempt from an EU prohibition on the import of chilled meats, such as sausages from Great Britain, provided those products remain aligned with the bloc’s standards.The EU has also offered to cut customs paperwork, and a broader range of companies will be able to take advantage of a scheme that exempts them from the bloc’s tariffs and some form-filling if they can show their goods are not “at risk” of reaching Ireland.EU officials said these measures would create an “express lane” that facilitated faster movement of goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, while ensuring the products comply with EU rules.The quid pro quo is that the UK builds full border control posts for inspections of goods, and provides more comprehensive product data and market surveillance information to allow the EU to see that items are compliant with its rules.UK officials acknowledged the EU proposals went further than expected, but they fall short of Frost’s benchmark that for businesses in Great Britain, trading with Belfast should be as easy as commerce with Birmingham.Britain proposed a “full dual regulatory regime” for Northern Ireland that would allow goods compliant with EU and UK standards to circulate freely in the marketplace side by side.The EU has ignored this request. EU officials said that under the Northern Ireland protocol the region is inside the bloc’s single market for goods and therefore must comply with its standards.But the EU has agreed that all medicines registered in the UK will be able to circulate freely in Northern Ireland, which is heavily reliant on suppliers in Great Britain, after concerns companies would pull products rather than bear the costs of the bloc’s regulations. This move will require amending EU law.The commission has declined to address another emotive issue: pets. While guide dogs will be exempt, Britons taking their pets from, say, Liverpool to Belfast will need a pet passport and vaccination certificates as they do when travelling into the EU, although such checks are currently not being enforced.The UK wants an end to the European Court of Justice’s role in oversight of the Northern Ireland protocol, saying it is intolerable to have part of its territory under the jurisdiction of a foreign court.Instead Britain proposes an arbitration system of the kind it negotiated in the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which does not have the ECJ as the final arbiter of disputes.The commission has refused to engage, saying that since the protocol leaves Northern Ireland following EU rules for goods it must, axiomatically, accept the writ of the ECJ.The EU has, however, suggested setting up a mechanism to facilitate deeper consultation with Northern Ireland’s political and business representatives, perhaps with an eye on 2024, when the region’s devolved assembly will vote on whether to retain the protocol.But the EU will only agree on such a mechanism in full consultation with the British government.The EU has also ignored London’s demand for a rewrite of Article 10 of the protocol, which requires any UK government subsidy decision that potentially affects goods trade in Northern Ireland to comply with the bloc’s rules on state aid.Brexiters argue that Article 10 gives the commission an unacceptable ability to interfere in UK decisions that only indirectly touch Northern Ireland.The UK and EU will now engage in intensive talks in order to see if a compromise on Northern Ireland’s trading arrangements can be agreed.While both sides said they were not setting red lines, the gulf on some issues, including the role of the ECJ, remains vast.Failure to reach an accommodation could lead the UK to carry out its threat to unilaterally suspend parts of the Northern Ireland protocol under Article 16.This could ultimately trigger a trade war, in which the EU imposes tariffs on UK industries including carmaking and fishing.
198  Vladimir Putin has vehemently denied Russia is limiting gas supplies to Europe to drive up prices but offered no indication that there would be swift action to relieve tension in volatile energy markets.The Russian president told a conference in Moscow on Wednesday that accusations of state-owned Gazprom using energy as a “weapon” to speed up approval of the recently built Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany were “politically motivated blather”.Putin said Russia was meeting all requests for gas supplies from Europe, adding that Gazprom had already exceeded its contractual obligations to customers in the bloc. But he stressed that further supplies depended on requests from the EU — who, he implied, would have to buy gas on Russia’s terms.“We’re increasing [supply] as much as our partners ask. There hasn’t been a single refusal. Not one,” Putin said.Analysts and traders say, however, that there have been no signs of additional gas supplies since Putin’s hints last week that Russia could increase exports to help calm prices, which have soared to more than five times the level of a year ago.Putin reiterated comments made frequently by Kremlin officials that European customers would need to sign long-term contracts — which are often for two decades or more — to secure additional gas supplies from Russia, rather than via the spot market as favoured by the EU.He said he would be happy to discuss “additional actions” with the EU without providing specifics.“If anyone was expecting there to be some dramatic announcement about them auctioning additional volumes of gas for Europe in the short term, they’ll have been disappointed,” said Laurent Ruseckas at IHS Markit, a consultancy.“That’s what the market was listening for and it wasn’t forthcoming, beyond the comments we’ve heard before . . . but what Putin did reiterate is that once NS2 is operating that would be positive for supply.”Putin helped temper surging gas price rises last week by saying Russia was prepared to intervene to stabilise a “speculative craze” on volatile energy markets.Putin argued that Gazprom had already reached capacity for sending exports under current routes, saying the approval of Nord Stream 2, which bypasses Ukraine to supply gas to Germany, would help “significantly relieve tensions on the energy market” if it were approved by German regulators.Kadri Simson, EU energy commissioner, said the commission was “looking at all issues around manipulation and anti-competitive activity including concerns around Gazprom”.“Our initial assessment is Gazprom is fulfilling its contracts while providing no additional supply,” said Simson.The International Energy Agency, which is primarily funded by OECD members, has said it believes Russia could increase exports to Europe by 15 per cent and has called on Moscow to demonstrate that it is a “reliable supplier”.Russia’s deputy energy minister Evgeny Grabchak told reporters on Wednesday that Gazprom would continue filling domestic storage facilities until November 1, a sign that Russia was in no rush to divert supplies to Europe.European gas prices have eased slightly since Putin’s comments last week, but are still well above previous years. The benchmark contract for November delivery was trading above €90 per megawatt hour on Tuesday, more than 5.5 times the level of a year ago.Putin also said Russia was targeting achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, underlining the Kremlin’s growing appreciation of the threat from climate change. Russia’s Arctic region is warming three times faster than the global average.But Putin also said that natural gas, as well as hydrogen and ammonia, would play a greater role in the energy mix, implying that Russia would continue to exploit its huge natural resource base.
199  The UK government has a severe case of buyer’s remorse. Almost from the day it signed the Northern Ireland protocol that governs post-Brexit trade arrangements with the region, it has longed to renegotiate it. Downing Street’s determination to resolve real problems with the operation of an accord that is vital to preserve peace in the north of Ireland is legitimate. Yet binding international pacts cannot be ripped up or rewritten on one party’s whim. The solution must be to make the existing deal work, through constructive engagement by both sides.Boris Johnson resurrected the idea of leaving Northern Ireland in the single market for goods as a last-ditch way to deliver a hard Brexit, while avoiding creating a hard border with the Irish Republic. By necessitating a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, this was always going to be tricky to make work.Complicating any solution is the fact that Britain is now waging two battles. One is over whether the protocol is being implemented too heavy-handedly — gumming up goods flows from Britain and diluting unionists’ sense of British identity. The other is over the constitutional settlement with the EU that gave the European Court of Justice oversight of the protocol.On the first front, the EU has made steps towards compromise, tilting towards the risk-based approach the UK favours, rather than its usual rules-based stance. Proposals from Maros Sefcovic, European Commission vice-president, could reduce customs and regulatory checks on the Irish Sea border by more than half. These will, though, require businesses in Britain to have detailed documentation available for electronic inspection. As a quid pro quo, the UK must provide more data and market surveillance so the EU can see goods are complying with its rules.The UK, meanwhile, has hardened its line on the ECJ. Brexit minister Lord David Frost pre-empted Sefcovic’s proposals with a hawkish speech warning the EU would be making a “historic misjudgement” if it failed to rewrite the agreement. His amended text replaces the EU court with international arbitration. This reflects more the ideological preoccupations of Frost and fellow hard Brexiters with “sovereignty” than realities in Northern Ireland. The unionist community is more concerned with making the deal function than with who is the ultimate arbiter.The Johnson government may have convinced itself that, as with the EU exit deal in 2019, only its hardball tactics have persuaded Brussels to bend, and pushing harder will make it bend further. London may believe it can go as far as triggering the partial suspension of the protocol — as Frost has threatened — opening the way to legal and trade sanctions if no resolution is found. Surely, after all, the EU would not want to retaliate in a way that could destabilise Northern Ireland.Yet proceeding further towards confrontation would be a mistake. ECJ oversight over the 450m-strong single market is an EU article of faith. The more it believes Britain simply wants to blow up the protocol, the less willing Brussels will be to pursue useful talks. Wider EU relations could be poisoned. And in any trade dispute, the EU’s size will give it far greater leverage.Most importantly, perhaps, one reason the UK chose a hard Brexit was to allow it to reach trade accords with others. Partners will shrink from making deals with a country they feel cannot be trusted to respect its commitments. Britain has made its point. The EU has taken steps towards it. “Landing zones” for agreement exist, even on who resolves disputes over the protocol. Now the two sides must get back to the table and thrash out a solution.
200  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
201  The EU on Wednesday proposed to sweep away most checks on goods crossing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland in an attempt to ensure smoother trade within the UK and end a protracted post-Brexit dispute with London.But European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic warned the “far-reaching” offer to cut up to 80 per cent of checks on animal and plant-based products and halve the customs paperwork was the final chance to solve the problem, and required binding commitments from the UK.“There will be no other package. This is it,” Sefcovic told the Financial Times. He said the commission’s proposals went “pretty far” to meeting UK concerns but he was willing to negotiate within the framework he had set out.Some British officials said they were initially “taken aback” by the apparent scale of the EU offer and the “notable movement” made by Brussels to cut checks on goods, but they warned that the devil would be in the detail.Big stumbling blocks remain. Lord David Frost, UK Brexit minister, insisted that any agreement must remove the European Court of Justice from its role in policing the Brexit deal in Northern Ireland, but did not call it a “red line”.Frost said: “We’ve got a track record of reaching successful outcomes in negotiations despite predictions that we would not.”Sefcovic said he hoped the two sides were in the “home stretch” for an agreement. He has invited Frost to Brussels on Friday for lunch to begin intensive talks and aims to clinch an accord by the end of the year.UK prime minister Boris Johnson will now face pressure from business leaders in Northern Ireland to reach a compromise. Most business groups broadly welcomed the EU move and said the ECJ was rarely raised by members.The commission’s proposals come in response to UK demands for a radical rewrite of the Northern Ireland protocol, the part of the UK-EU withdrawal agreement designed to avoid the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland. The protocol placed Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods.Sefcovic produced four papers addressing areas of concern to businesses and Northern Ireland’s unionist politicians: sanitary and phytosanitary controls, customs, medicines, and democratic participation.Under the commission’s proposals, lorries coming from Great Britain and supplying retailers in Northern Ireland could head through “express lanes” at ports. A lorry with 100 different food products would only need one certificate, instead of 100 as now.Businesses in Northern Ireland importing products of animal origin such as eggs and cheese from Great Britain would be freed from some form-filling and an EU ban on chilled meats, such as sausages, would end.The EU will also legislate to allow medicines from Great Britain to enter Northern Ireland.However, Brussels remains wary that the region could provide a back door into the EU single market for produce that would normally pay tariffs or be banned.So it is demanding that London tightens controls over the origin of food and labels such goods as UK only. EU officials would be able to audit and inspect importers and shops in Northern Ireland.Sefcovic dismissed Frost’s demand that a joint arbitration panel should replace the ECJ as the arbiter of disputes, saying that without the court Northern Ireland could not stay in the EU single market.Some UK government insiders believe that despite Brussels’ offer, Johnson will ultimately deliver on his threat to activate article 16 of the protocol to suspend some of its provisions, possibly triggering a trade war with the EU.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of trade body Manufacturing NI, welcomed the commission’s proposals and described the ECJ issue as “a Brexit purity issue for the UK”. He said his members wanted frictionless access to the EU single market.But Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, the largest group in Northern Ireland’s devolved government, said: “These proposals clearly fall a long way short of being the basis of a sustainable solution and are presented within the framework of a protocol that has failed.”Additional reporting by Jude Webber in Dublin
202  Slovak prosecutors said on Wednesday that the governor of the country’s central bank, Peter Kazimir, had been charged with a “corruption-related crime”.The general prosecutor’s office said that the charge against Kazimir, who is also a member of the European Central Bank’s governing council, had been brought on October 8, but declined to provide any further information, citing the “early stage of the criminal case”.The statement from prosecutors follows Slovak media reports that Kazimir, who served as finance minister before taking over the reins of the National Bank of Slovakia in 2019, had been charged in a case relating to an alleged bribe for a former senior tax official.The website aktuality.sk wrote that Kazimir was alleged to have played the role of a “courier” in bringing a bribe of about €50,000 to the former official.Kazimir said on Tuesday evening after the report was published that he did “not feel guilty of committing any criminal acts”.“The information provided isn’t true and the reasoning in the given statement lacks corroborating evidence,” he said in a statement issued via the National Bank of Slovakia.“I have no information and I am not aware of any violation of the law. I have never had any interest in influencing any proceedings.”Kazimir’s lawyer said that Kazimir had been accused of bribery and would “fight, challenge the accusation and file a complaint in the matter of days”.The Slovak central bank declined to comment beyond releasing Kazimir’s comments. The ECB also declined to comment.The charge against Kazimir comes amid a broader series of investigations into alleged corruption in Slovakia’s business and political elite that were set in train after the murder of young investigative journalist Jan Kuciak and his fiancée Martina Kusnirova in 2018.Police linked the killings to Kuciak’s work investigating corruption, and the case sent shockwaves through the central European nation, leading to the resignation of then prime minister Robert Fico, in 2018, and ultimately to the ousting of his Smer party in parliamentary elections last year.Slovakia’s president Zuzana Caputova said on Wednesday that she respected the presumption of innocence in relation to Kazimir. But she added that if she were in his position, she would consider resigning in order to protection the central bank, according to the newspaper Dennik N.Kazimir reiterated on Wednesday that he had “not committed any crime” and would “continue to perform my duties as governor”.“I will do everything to clear my name and defend the institution I represent,” he said.
203  Rui Soares is an investment professional for FAM Frankfurt Asset Management, an independent investment firm.Several news outlets, including the Financial Times, have drawn attention to the threats of strike action coming from German workers. The press’s knee-jerk reaction to these threats has been to link them to the recent rise in inflation, which has seen prices climb 4.1 per cent over the past 12 months.And at first glance, the workers’ actions may indeed look like a direct reaction to price pressures. But a closer look reveals a more chronic problem: decades during which Germany’s workers have failed to (fully) reap the gains of euro membership.German businesses have benefited greatly from the euro’s creation more than those in other countries. Having a currency that is fairly valued for the eurozone as a whole doesn’t mean that the currency is fairly valued for each member country. For Germany, euro area membership has produced 20 years of undervalued currency — as a string of current account surpluses testify.But the evidence of the single currency’s benefits for German society as a whole is less substantial.Before euro membership, there was of course the Deutschmark. Contrary to conventional wisdom, appreciations of the German currency didn’t lead to significant drops in exports. During such periods, exports just grew at much lower rates or remained stable. The reason being that German companies mostly produced high-value-added products with a reasonably low price elasticity of demand (a 10 per cent price increase didn’t, and still doesn’t, lead to a complete collapse of demand for BMWs).These appreciations did, however, produce a strong rise in imports. Which suggests the German consumer was able to take advantage of appreciation to buy more goods and services from the rest of the world. And that in turn means that appreciation weighed on corporate profits, not wages.The Deutschmark’s international prowess was, therefore, a massive income redistribution mechanism. Appreciation took from the wealthiest in German society (business owners, top management, shareholders in general) and gave it to the middle class (employees). Any increase in Germany’s international competitiveness that occurred at the expense of workers was short-lived, as the current account surplus that resulted would in turn lead to a further currency appreciation that would redistribute income towards workers.But the pre-Eurosystem system had a mechanism to balance the interest of workers and capital that the current system lacks.Here’s a quick way to quantify this statement. The net profits of the DAX 30 companies have increased on average by 8.1 per cent a year since 2004 (I use 2004 as starting point to avoid the distortions that the bursting of the internet bubble in the early years of euro adoption would cause to the calculations). This compares with just 1.5 per cent for France’s CAC 40, 0.2 per cent for the Euro Stoxx 50 and declining net profits of 2.4 per cent per annum for the Italian FTSE MIB and 1.9 per cent for Spain’s IBEX 35. All brilliant news for shareholders of German companies and their top management. However, nominal wages for workers over the same period increased by less than 3 per cent a year.No matter what government coalition ends up running the country over the coming four years, a new era is about to begin. And an important topic will, alongside climate change, dominate the German political agenda for years to come: social inequality. The increasingly heated debate about how to stop the social divide in the German real estate market – well-off landlords benefiting from rising real estate prices versus middle class tenants being squeezed by higher rents – is a clear indicator of where things are heading.According to the latest surveys by polling firm Civey, a majority among the German economic elite prefers a coalition dominated by left-wing parties. Forty-five per cent support an “Ampel” coalition, compared with the 30 per cent that are in favour of a “Jamaica” coalition that would keep the centre-right CDU as the country’s leading party. That suggests the social inequality debate may have reached German corporate boards, and top managers are aware of the need to deal with the topic. At this stage, the only open question is how to strike a better balance while remaining in the euro area. One way or another, the average German will likely see their real income over the coming years rise more strongly than in the past two decades.Yet this is not to say that German workers’ wage demands will trigger a wage and price spiral that will lead to ever-higher inflation across the currency bloc.France’s unemployment rate is 8 per cent, Italy’s 9.3 per cent and Spain’s 14 per cent. The three countries together account for half of the eurozone’s economic output. Combine the substantial slack in the eurozone’s labour market with the free movement of people, capital, goods and services, and one would imagine that German companies will struggle to pass on those higher labour costs to consumers elsewhere.Better wages for German workers will also have the effect of raising imports, narrowing the current account surplus and boosting economies across the region in the process.What the Deutschmark did automatically, German workers must now do themselves. Doing so will be to the benefit of the entire region.
204  Industrial output in the eurozone fell back below pre-pandemic levels in August as supply chain bottlenecks restricted production of many products, such as German cars, raising concerns that the bloc’s economic rebound may run out of steam.Several companies in Germany’s large carmaking industry have been forced to idle production and put thousands of workers back on furlough due to shortages of materials, particularly semiconductors.This led to a 1.6 per cent drop in manufacturing production in August from the previous month across the 19 countries that share the euro, Eurostat announced on Wednesday. The fall was in line with economists’ expectations.One of the steepest declines was in Germany, where manufacturing output dropped 4.1 per cent. However, in France, industrial output rose 1 per cent, while Spanish industrial output was up 0.1 per cent.Maddalena Martini, economist at Oxford Economics, said: “The automotive sector is bearing the brunt of the global semiconductor shortage, with car manufacturers often sitting on a large stock of semi-finished vehicles waiting for components.” But she added that the “latest data suggest that the supply of microchips is finally turning a corner and we expect it to gradually ease over the coming quarters”.Eurostat said capital goods production was down 3.9 per cent in August, durable consumer goods output fell 3.4 per cent, intermediate goods declined 1.5 per cent and non-durable consumer goods fell 0.8 per cent. The only growth was in a slight rise in energy output.The overall eurozone economy is still expected to grow at about 2.5 per cent in the third quarter, compared with the previous quarter, boosted by a continued rebound in household spending. But some economists worry that this could be hit by the recent surge in European gas and electricity prices.Fabio Balboni, senior economist at HSBC, estimated that the rise in regulated energy prices and oil prices would knock 0.6 per cent off eurozone household income, and reduce gross domestic product growth by 0.2 percentage points.“It still does not seem enough to derail the recovery, accounting for the likely pick-up in wages and accumulated excess savings,” said Balboni. “Still, it could certainly take quite a lot of steam out of it, particularly considering the impact on poorer households, confidence and firms.”The gloomier economic outlook was underlined by a sharper than expected drop in German investor confidence in the latest Zew survey of analysts, published this week.Zew said the outlook for the German economy had “deteriorated noticeably” in October after its gauge of investor expectations fell for the fifth month in a row and its measure of confidence in the present situation dropped for the first time in seven months.
205  Russia and Vietnam are up for promotion in the investors’ world of league tables. The duo are on FTSE Russell’s watchlist, a potential springboard for passive funds to pour in if Russian and Vietnamese stocks move up a notch.Russia has been on the watchlist for a year. The index compiler is reviewing it for elevation from secondary emerging market to advanced emerging market. FTSE Russell began splitting the category into two tranches a couple of decades ago. That is one step below the 25-strong camp of developed markets and would place Russia alongside Brazil, Greece and Turkey among others.Vietnam is still on the starting blocks as a frontier market. If successful in reforming post-trade settlement issues, it would be catapulted to secondary EM status and on to the radar of international fund managers.Huge amounts of money ride on classifications. When MSCI, another big index provider, completed the 20 per cent inclusion of renminbi-denominated China A shares into its EMs index in 2019, it attracted tens of billions of dollars. But a boost to Russia would be less material. It is already in the FTSE’s EMs fund, tracked by about $140bn of funds.Index providers are unimpressed by sheer size or economic might. Tiny Israel and Poland, home to a $200bn stock exchange, are in the first league. Instead, the focus is on ease of international investment — ruling out countries with capital controls that impede foreign exchange transactions, say, or lengthy settlement times.As a secondary EM, Russia sits alongside the likes of China, India and Saudi Arabia. Russia and Vietnam are not the only countries awaiting the outcome of FTSE Russell’s March review. Mongolia, now completely out in the cold, has improved settlement terms enough to warrant review for inclusion as a frontier market — a group followed by a small but growing band of investors. It would not take much to move the needle: the Mongolian exchange’s top 20 stocks are worth a combined $1.7bn, almost a third of which is Apu, a drinks business. Time to buy cashmere.
206  Our recent interview with Paul Polman, the former Unilever chief executive, drew many responses from readers, but one in particular caught our attention.“If we continue to only amplify the voices of those who have been in charge for the last 70 years, we will miss out on lots of other talent and insights,” she observed. This idea rang true to us, so Simon Mundy and I asked if she would elaborate on a follow-up call.Media outlets need to challenge “the intellectual lock-in” that comes when they only quote those with similar backgrounds, and “change the notion of what expertise looks like”, she told us. When it comes to steering finance to emerging markets, an area in which Marcelle specialises, she says those in proximity to the biggest pools of capital are too often deemed to be the experts, rather than those in proximity to where that capital is deployed. (Marcelle herself has tapped capital in the Caribbean, connecting a credit union in Trinidad and Tobago with a private equity fund in Hamburg.)Given the scale of the challenges those working in environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing and climate finance claim to want to address, it seems incumbent on us all to seek out fresh thinking. Moral Money is committed to doing so, and to making our readers part of that process.So which expert ESG voices do you believe need to be amplified? Please send your thoughts to moralmoneyreply@ft.com. As ever, we look forward to hearing from you. (Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson)You know that policymakers and regulators have really dropped the ball when big business coalitions start pleading publicly to be regulated more strictly.That is one interpretation of the gathering wave of “calls to action”, ahead of the COP26 climate summit, from corporate associations urging governments to impose more stringent climate rules on the business sector.Two of these calls came on Monday alone. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (Gfanz), a Mark Carney-led coalition of nearly 300 international financial companies, laid down a number of demands for governments, including the alignment of regulatory frameworks with net zero emissions targets and serious movement on carbon pricing. While Gfanz members promised to use their clout to help green the global economy, they warned that this was “no substitute for action by government and certain responsibilities cannot be shifted to finance”.Another call came from the UK, where a group of businesses with £4.5tn ($6.1tn) in assets, including telecom operator BT and retail company Tesco, asked the British government to force big companies to disclose net zero transition plans.I discussed these interventions with Fiona Reynolds, who has a good perspective on some of the main issues at stake here after nearly nine years as chief executive of the UN’s Principles for Responsible Investment initiative. It might seem unusual for big companies to plead to be hit with tighter rules, she said. But with so many of them already publicly committed to net zero targets, a clear regulatory framework could actually lessen the cost and workload involved in meeting them. As it stands, she noted, they faced a rising demand for transparency and disclosure from investors, while grappling with a smorgasbord of voluntary reporting options.I also checked in with Paul Simpson, chief executive of CDP, the global environmental disclosure system. Paul told me there had been a substantial 35 per cent year-on-year increase in companies disclosing under the CDP framework, who now number more than 13,000, including the majority of big corporations in the US and Europe. To many of those companies, he said, climate disclosures already feel mandatory, so heavy is the pressure from investors. But as we move towards legal requirements for environmental reporting, he warned, regulators must be careful not to “lower the bar” by requiring disclosures less rigorous than those already seen in the market.Even as it issues its calls to action, big business is of course under scrutiny itself, over the true extent of its green ambitions. As our colleagues Owen Walker and Stephen Morris reported, Gfanz negotiators have struggled to convince members from the banking sector to end financing for the oil and gas sector this year — as required under the International Energy Agency’s pathway for limiting global warming to 1.5°C. Still, the banks’ fiercest critics would concede that they have a point when it comes to the dire need for an increase in action from governments. And with many global politicians still arguing that the economic costs of serious climate action are too steep to bear, these public interventions from big business are helping to highlight the flimsiness of such claims. (Simon Mundy)Despite a slowdown in green bond issuance in recent months, the sustainable debt market saw reasons to cheer this week. The EU yesterday priced its inaugural green bond — a €12bn offering due in 15 years that attracted more than €135bn of orders.For green bonds, “demand clearly remains strong,” said Peter Goves, a research analyst with MFS Investment Management. The EU deal “is just the beginning of the large wave of EU green bond supply that will come to market in the years ahead”. But there is trouble in the green bond market, and yesterday’s deal might be a bit of an aberration. Refinitiv this week published data on green bonds that reinforce the drop in issuance we highlighted in last week’s chart from the Institute of International Finance. In the three months to the end of September 30, sustainable finance bond issuance dropped 12 per cent to $229.9bn compared with the second quarter, Refinitiv said. Sustainable loans also dropped in the third quarter.One of the reasons why issuance is falling is that the “greenium” — the favourable pricing companies enjoy from green debt — is eroding. Our colleague Tommy Stubbington reported about this greenium decline. Spreads on green corporate bonds versus a business’s conventional debt have narrowed to less than 1 basis point, down from 9 basis points in 2020.Companies ranging from Austria’s Erste Group to Canadian convenience store group Alimentation Couche-Tard have touted to shareholders the greenium financial savings they have achieved with green bonds. For future issuers, however, these savings look like they will be harder and harder for companies to obtain. (Patrick Temple-West)The exploding interest in ESG is clearly apparent in wealthy nations such as the US and UK — but interest and opportunities in the sector look very different in other parts of the world.Last week I was in Colombia where I met investors and sustainability experts to understand how the country, and the region at large, is tackling the ESG revolution.“We are not going to make the same headlines as other markets,” María Ruiz Sierra, chief of sustainable investing at Latin American asset manager Sura Investment Management, told Moral Money. “But investors are pushing the conversation.”As recently as last year, investors “didn’t have any ESG opportunities” to invest in within Latin America, said Gema Sacristán, chief investment officer at IDB Invest, part of the Inter-American Development Bank Group.“Investors would go to ETFs, indexes, and funds outside of Latin America. Now, the local asset managers are creating their own products,” Sacristán said.The question of whether emerging markets are benefiting from the ESG movement, has sparked debate. Ricardo Hausmann, former chief economist at the Inter-American Development Bank, recently called for an “alternative framework” for developing countries.For example, the US and European markets’ approach to sustainability would be “impossible” in Colombia, South American investors told Moral Money. The nation is the region’s largest coal producer and third-largest oil exporter. “Divesting would do more harm,” one Colombian investor said. “And, we have a fiduciary duty.”South American investors might not leave fossil fuel stocks behind any time soon, but there’s hope yet. After all, Bancolombia was ranked as one of the world’s most sustainable banks by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index in 2020. (Kristen Talman)Electric car sales are zooming ahead in China. Neither its slowing economy nor chip shortages have left a dent. A battery shortage, however, would be a different story. Please check out this report from our Lex colleagues.The UN’s COP26 conference convenes in early November. As we look ahead to this highly-anticipated event in Glasgow, here are some of the things we will be keeping an eye on.
207  The EU will on Wednesday unveil a package of measures intended to reduce bureaucracy associated with the controversial post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland.The proposals from the European Commission come in response to UK demands for a radical rewriting of the so-called Northern Ireland protocol, which was agreed to avoid a return of a hard border on the island of Ireland.EU officials briefed on the document said the measures could reduce the amount of customs and regulatory checks on the new Irish Sea border by up to half. The measures will be published in full later on Wednesday.The commission has said it hopes the proposals, which one official described as “far-reaching”, will defuse the stand-off over the post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland, which has dogged UK-EU relations since it came into force in January.However, the UK government has warned that the protocol is “not sustainable” because the level of border checks is impeding trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and creating distortions in the UK’s internal market. Under the terms of the protocol, all goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland must comply with EU customs rules.As well as reduced friction at the border, the UK has demanded the removal of the oversight of the EU’s top court from the deal — a request that is not expected to be addressed in Wednesday’s paper.Lord David Frost, the UK’s Brexit minister, warned on Tuesday that the EU would be making a “historic misjudgement” if it did not engage on addressing the question of the role of the European Court of Justice in governing post-Brexit trade in Northern Ireland.The UK, which agreed to the role of the ECJ when it signed the protocol in January 2020, now says that it is an unacceptable impingement on UK sovereignty.The EU has instead argued that the focus should be on reducing the frictions experienced by businesses in order to make the protocol function better and allow Northern Ireland companies to benefit from privileged access to the EU single market.Mairead McGuinness, Ireland’s EU commissioner in charge of financial services, said ahead of the release of the new proposals that they would provide answers to “the real practical problems” faced by businesses.EU officials said data would be central to reducing checks, with companies able to show their products are not destined for the Republic of Ireland having much-reduced paperwork.Northern Ireland trade groups, which were closely consulted by the European Commission and provided a list of issues they wanted addressed, gave an early welcome to reports of what the EU is expected to unveil.Aodhán Connolly, convener of the Northern Ireland Business Brexit Working Group, said they appeared to match many of their requests. “A lot of what is coming out this evening is indeed very close to what the NI Business Brexit Working Group has been asking for,” he said on Twitter.Oliver Dowden, the Conservative party chair, said the early accounts of the commission’s proposals were “welcome”, but added that it was important there was “fundamental change” to the protocol. “We will look at them and engage properly with them,” he told Sky News.Dowden also repeated Downing Street’s insistence that Frost’s demand that the ECJ be expunged from the Northern Ireland protocol was “not a deal breaker”.Nonetheless, Downing Street has said it remains a “central” British demand, raising questions about whether negotiations can reach a successful conclusion given that the EU side is adamant it will not renegotiate the fundamental legal tenets of the protocol.Lord Gavin Barwell, ex-chief of staff to former prime minister Theresa May, denounced Frost’s demand for a total rewrite of the Northern Ireland protocol. “The absolute state of David Frost trashing the deal he negotiated + hailed as a triumph,” he said on Twitter.Dominic Cummings, former chief adviser of Boris Johnson, said the prime minister “never had a scoobydoo what the deal he signed meant”.
208  Hungary’s nationalist government has given its full backing to Poland over a confrontation with Brussels over the rule of law, saying Warsaw is the victim of a “political witch-hunt” and that the EU has “no business” interfering in how member states exercise control over their judiciary.Judit Varga, Hungarian justice minister, said legal disagreements, such as over Poland’s procedures for disciplining judges, were “completely normal and self evident in a democracy”.“The witch-hunt is political, even though the EU founding treaties clearly indicate Poland made the right decision,” she told the Financial Times in an interview. “The EU has no business around the Disciplinary Courts.”Varga made her remarks as the Polish government published the text of an explosive constitutional tribunal ruling last week that elements of EU law — specifically those relating to judicial independence — were not compatible with the Polish constitution.The Polish tribunal’s defiance of EU law is the culmination of a five-year campaign by the Polish government to exert political control over the judiciary. The European Court of Justice has ruled against Warsaw in a number of cases, including the creation of a disciplinary regime for judges, saying they curtailed judicial independence and were incompatible with EU law.The decision has triggered talk that Poland could one day exit the EU, though Poland’s conservative government has denied any such aim.The disagreement between Brussels and Warsaw has also called into question Poland’s receipt of tens of billions of euros in EU funds as the European Commission ponders how to respond.Varga rejected the idea that the dispute over judicial procedures would lead to a “Polexit” but said the EU was undermining its own treaties by requiring conformity in areas where it had no jurisdiction.Hungary’s ruling conservative Fidesz party and Poland’s Law and Justice (PiS) government have been staunch allies, helping each other to thwart EU disciplinary procedures that require unanimity among member states.The Polish judgment followed a German constitutional court ruling on bond buying by the European Central Bank last year. That case may have been somewhat different, but a member state still challenged the ECJ’s authority and “prevailed”, Varga said.The commission and court both said the German court had no right to over-rule the European court.Varga said the next such conflict could be over migration. Hungary has a case pending about detention and removal of migrants at the border, a practice that the EU said was illegal and prompted it to launch an infringement procedure. Hungary has taken that issue to its own constitutional court, which is deliberating, Varga said.The Hungarian court may well come out against the EU decision, as did Poland’s top court, and Hungary is prepared to defend it the way Poland has defended its own, Varga added.“We are not talking about animal welfare, but what to call our families, or what we think about fundamental things like immigration and culture,” the minister said. “These remain national prerogatives.”She even quoted from the EU Treaty: “The Union shall respect the equality of Member States before the Treaties as well as their national identities, inherent in their fundamental structures, political and constitutional.”Varga added that Hungary and Poland want to stop Brussels accumulating powers but not reverse EU integration.“What they say to Polexit is up to the Poles. But for Huxit, excuse me, we insist on the status quo, on the Treaties. Liberals may dislike that because they prefer to integrate immigrants, but that does not make it a legal category.”
209  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.The ongoing energy crisis does not deter the EU from dreaming big: it wants to see a ban on Arctic drilling for fossil fuels and on purchasing oil and gas from the northernmost region of the globe. In an interview with Europe Express, environment commissioner Virginijus Sinkevicius lays out the Arctic strategy he will unveil later today. Separately, the European Commission will present a toolbox of measures on how to deal with the energy crisis.On the Brexit front, commissioner Maros Sefcovic is set to publish a set of proposals on how to alleviate trade difficulties between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. We’ll give you a rundown of what they are set to contain.Meanwhile, in news likely to raise eyebrows among EU states, the FT has revealed that EU top diplomat Josep Borrell decided to send observers to elections in Venezuela next month, overriding his own staff’s warnings that the mission risked both legitimising autocratic president Nicolás Maduro’s regime and tarnishing Brussels’ reputation.And a quick update on our story from the end of August: the commission yesterday published plans for paying Afghanistan’s neighbouring countries hundreds of millions of euros to stem any potential refugee flows.The EU wants to ban any new oil, gas and coal production in the Arctic Circle and plans to make it illegal for member states to purchase any hydrocarbons produced from such projects, in a major push to get serious on tackling climate change in the high north, writes Henry Foy in Brussels.The ambitious target that will headline the bloc’s new Arctic strategy to be unveiled today in Brussels comes as Europe finds itself in the midst of an energy crisis that many have blamed on a shortage of gas from Russia — a country with extensive Arctic hydrocarbon projects, some of which supply EU states.The EU’s strategy, drawn up by the commission and the European External Action Service, seeks to marry environmental concerns and geopolitical tensions over the Arctic, which formally includes eight countries but has become a global issue as temperatures rise.Finland, Sweden and Denmark — through Greenland — are Arctic EU members, but the bloc will need to convince the US, Canada, Iceland, Norway and Russia to join Brussels’ demand for a “legal obligation” to prevent new Arctic oil, gas and coal projects.The US and Canada already ban offshore oil and gas drilling in the Arctic, but Russia has been clear that it sees the warming north as an opportunity to expand its hydrocarbon exploration. The EU is indirectly involved: French energy company Total owns 16 per cent of Novatek, a Russian company that has one major gas project in the Arctic and is constructing a second.“It will require diplomatic efforts and we are not naive about that,” Virginijus Sinkevicius, EU commissioner for environment, told Europe Express. “But we need to lead by example . . . Our call starts a very important debate.”The Arctic is warming three times faster than the rest of the planet and forest fires in Russia’s Arctic region are now an annual occurrence. But while some countries have warned about the threat of retreating ice, others see opportunities in it.Russia has aggressively promoted the so-called Northern Sea Route — an Arctic shipping route from Europe to China shorter than via Suez and around India, and invested in a number of new military bases on their islands in the Arctic.And cognisant that member state territory accounts for a small chunk of the total region, the EU’s strategy will aim to blend ambitious demands with offers of bloc competencies to the other stakeholders.The EU will offer its sizeable research capabilities and, of course, deep pockets to promote “scientific diplomacy”, skirting around the complicated issue of, for example, partnering up with Russia in the snow and ice while sanctioning them for their actions on the sunny beaches of Crimea.“It requires finding an agreement with countries where we don’t always have the easiest of relations,” admits Sinkevičius. “Ultimately climate change is going to affect all of us.”“The Arctic is home to hundreds of thousands of Europeans,” he added.The EU has joined national governments and other supranational institutions in issuing green bonds. The inaugural sale of its 15-year debt attracted more than €135bn of orders, and marked the largest green bond deal, narrowly eclipsing the UK’s £10bn debut last month. The proceeds will be passed on to member states to be spent on areas such as energy efficiency, transport and nature protection. (More here)Brexit is back and the sequel is proving as dramatic and bad-tempered as the original, writes Andy Bounds in Brussels. In a speech yesterday, UK Brexit minister Lord Frost called for a complete rewrite of the deal he signed two years ago over the contentious issue of Northern Ireland.His salvo to an audience in Lisbon — chosen as it is the capital of what London dubs “Britain’s oldest ally” — appeared to sink proposals from the commission’s own Brexit supremo, vice-president Maros Sefcovic, to be published today.Sefcovic will propose a number of measures to ease the situation with widespread support from member states.According to diplomats who have seen them they should cut paperwork in half and include:But that is about as far as the EU is willing to go. Frost’s demand to abolish the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice is a no-go, as it would force Northern Ireland out of the single market. And member states are prepared to dig in as they respond to Frost’s attacks.Sefcovic concedes that trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland is not as smooth as he would like. There have been protests from unionists over checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea that caused empty shelves at the beginning of the year. A looming ban on chilled meats entering Northern Ireland from GB also outraged unionist politicians.The protocol kept Northern Ireland in the single market, and therefore subject to its rules, while the rest of the UK left. That was to avoid having checks on the island of Ireland, which could have exacerbated tensions.The Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement of 1998 demilitarised the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic and largely ended violence between the Nationalist and unionist communities in the north.But Frost said the protocol had inflamed those tensions again, and “shredded” the balance between the two communities by effectively blocking many goods coming from the British mainland.“The way this is happening is disrupting ordinary lives, damaging large and small businesses, and causing serious turbulence (. . .) within Northern Ireland.”Frost has repeatedly threatened to trigger Article 16 of the protocol, which would suspend parts of it. That would start a period of talks before the EU would take retaliatory measures, such as imposing tariffs on UK goods.“London shouldn’t make a mistake and underestimate the EU’s resolve and strength,” said one EU diplomat.Join the Women At The Top Europe Summit on October 20-21, including an in-person reception at the FT headquarters in London.

210  During France’s battle against Covid-19, fast-growing tech start-up Doctolib was thrust into the spotlight when the government enlisted its platform to help run the national vaccination campaign.The seven-year-old company was already familiar to many in France who use its slick blue-and-white smartphone app to book visits with about 300,000 doctors, dentists, and therapists. Valued at more than €1bn in its last fundraising, Doctolib makes money from selling its software services to medical practitioners starting from €129 a month, and is free to use for patients.Doctolib soon turned into an invaluable tool in a national crisis — more than three-quarters of the appointments for jabs were eventually booked through the site, helping France achieve one of the highest immunisation levels in Europe. Its video consultation software also enabled millions of virtual doctors’ appointments during lockdowns.The company has big ambitions to become a world leader in e-health from Europe — think Salesforce for the doctor’s office, plus a booking system for patients like OpenTable for restaurants. With Doctolib now present in France, Germany and Italy it is increasing revenue by about 50 per cent a year from about €200m now, and plans to hire 1,000 people in the next year.Doctolib’s rise was a surprising success in a country where the state is omnipresent in the healthcare system and where the private sector is often regarded with suspicion. But it also reflects a bigger story of France finally getting its act together on modernising the technology infrastructure that underpins its national health service and public health system.There is a lot to do. In France, it is still common for nurses in hospitals to rely largely on paper records, and under-investment in tech in the health sector is chronic in many countries, according to a 2015 OECD study.“There is a lot of innovation in pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and historically very little on the software services and tech side,” Doctolib’s co-founder and chief executive Stanislas Niox-Chateau says. “We need to update legacy systems for the cloud and mobile era.”Since 2019, a small team toiling in obscurity in the French health ministry is trying to help. It has laid out a smart strategy for what the state needs to do to facilitate the use of technology to improve patient care and boost efficiency, while also respecting core values such as equal access to care and the privacy of health data.Laura Létourneau, a savvy, entrepreneurial civil servant who co-leads the project, says that after years of burning money on expensive IT projects such as an electronic patient record system that few doctors used, France has switched its approach to instead thinking of the “state as a platform”. “It’s a bit like a city,” she explains. “We set the rules and build the infrastructure like the roads and bridges, and then we rely on others to construct the houses and buildings.” Létourneau has long studied how to drag France’s sprawling public sector into the 21st century, and co-wrote a provocatively titled book called Let’s Uberise The State Before Someone Does It For Us. In health, this has meant that France is working to create the invisible, unglamorous stuff that allows companies such as Doctolib and many others to then develop tech-enabled services for doctors and patients.These include a unique patient identifier, an authentication tool that checks doctors’ credentials, a digital patient record, software to facilitate electronic prescriptions and lots of standardisation work to connect disparate databases. Its work is being turbocharged by €2bn from France’s Covid recovery plan to be deployed until the end of 2023.Next year, a long-awaited new portal for patients will launch, which will help them co-ordinate their care across doctors and feature approved apps and services, much like Apple’s app store.For once, the French government is doing all this in close collaboration with the private sector. For example, during the first lockdown, Létourneau’s team created a system in only three weeks that linked up the country’s myriad diagnostic labs to a national database so that Covid test results could be tracked in real time. With all usual rules suspended because of the crisis, they worked directly with three software companies.Such collaboration is at least one positive thing to come out of the pandemic.leila.abboud@ft.com
211  Three political earthquakes in three days in central Europe have underscored how upholding the rule of law has become a defining issue for the EU — and how allowing it to unravel poses an existential threat to the union.On Thursday, Poland’s constitutional tribunal dropped a bombshell on the EU’s legal order with a judgment that said elements of EU law relating to judicial independence are incompatible with the Polish constitution.On Saturday, voters in the Czech Republic backed the centre-right opposition against their prime minister Andrej Babis in a general election. Since he became premier in 2017 Babis has been dogged by allegations of fraud and conflicts of interest relating to the payment of EU subsidies to his business empire.On the same day, Austrians were stunned when their chancellor Sebastian Kurz, once celebrated as the wunderkind of European conservatism, stepped down after being named as a suspect in a corruption probe into alleged government payments for favourable media coverage.Kurz denies any wrongdoing, has not been charged with any offence and will probably try to return to the chancellery if and when he clears his name. But the fact that he was forced to resign is testament to the functioning rule of law in his country. It is hard to imagine the same due process in today’s Poland.Babis has brushed aside the corruption allegations against him but persistent investigators backed by the country’s chief prosecutor and EU auditors have kept the case alive. The billionaire businessman is almost certainly heading into opposition because he is deemed too toxic for the other parties in parliament to team up with.The political pressures on judges and prosecutors are much greater in Poland than Austria or the Czech Republic. But, said Daniel Hegedüs of the German Marshall Fund in Berlin, these three events underline the point: “Without the rule of law, you can have neither democracy nor a framework for fighting against corruption.”Poland’s constitutional tribunal ruling amounts to a rejection of the even application of EU laws across its 27 countries. If Polish judges actually enforce it, which is moot, EU rules would gradually cease to apply. Poland would, in effect, incrementally exit the bloc while formally staying inside.Political abuse of power in Europe is neither new nor confined to former communist states. But it was largely a national problem. Even when Hungary’s Viktor Orban returned to power a decade ago and began to dismantle democratic checks and balances and silence independent media it was easy for the EU to gloss over, says Heather Grabbe of the Open Society Foundations in Brussels.But the rot has spread to Poland, while Bulgaria and to a lesser extent Romania have struggled with corruption and cronyism. Together they account for a much bigger share of EU spending. Politicians and taxpayers in the bloc’s richer countries are no longer willing to turn a blind eye, said Grabbe, especially when pro-government oligarchs who have benefited from EU largesse use the media to bash the EU.“It is this nexus now between corruption, EU money and anti-EU propaganda that makes this matter a much more serious issue than before and harder to deal with,” Grabbe said.The European Commission, which in the past has tended to deal with rule of law breaches with kid gloves, is now under intense pressure from some governments and the European Parliament to get tough and withhold EU funding.On Poland, commission president Ursula von der Leyen faces a difficult dilemma: stand firm and protect principles of judicial independence or compromise to avoid an escalating and debilitating confrontation that could snarl up EU decision-making. Warsaw’s publication of the tribunal ruling on Tuesday, making it official, narrows the scope for a deal. A reckoning over the rule of law may be hard to avoid.
212  Chief executives of European utilities including Enel, Orsted, Vattenfall and EDP have written to EU governments urging them to avoid drastic market interventions such as Spain’s windfall tax, as countries resort to emergency measures to curb the energy crisis.In a letter due to be sent this week to EU member states and the European Commission, seen by the Financial Times, more than 15 chief executives warn member states against taking “short-sighted political measures” that risk undermining market confidence and derailing the green transition.The commission on Wednesday will publish a “toolbox” of measures for high energy prices, recommending temporary steps such as cutting taxes, providing income support to the poorest households and increasing renewable energy capacity.The industry letter comes as Spain’s big electricity companies — notably Iberdrola, the multinational utility, and Endesa, the subsidiary of Italy’s Enel — are making their first payments under the country’s temporary windfall levy, which rises in tandem with the price of gas.Spain’s leftwing government initially estimated that based on prices last month, the measure would raise €2.6bn during its six months in force, taking funds from utilities that benefit from the impact of gas on the electricity price but which do not have corresponding gas costs of their own.But the continued increase in gas prices means the levy may now cost the companies involved more than €5.5bn, which the groups argue shows that it was disproportionate and ill-conceived.About 20 EU governments have announced emergency spending plans to protect consumers from surging costs but no other member state has yet implemented a profits tax on utilities.Kristian Ruby, secretary-general of Eurelectric, who organised the letter, said Brussels should make clear that the Spanish tax contravenes EU law.“We ultimately will be looking for a signal to the commission at some point, to take a clear stance on what the Spanish government has implemented,” said Ruby. “If all member states [take measures] like Spain, there is no doubt that it will slow down or even derail the energy transition.”Brussels’ toolbox will not explicitly repudiate Spain’s windfall levy, according to a draft seen by the FT. Instead, the paper will focus only on short-term policy measures that can be taken to protect households from surging electricity costs driven by record prices for natural gas.Madrid says the proceeds will be used alongside temporary tax cuts to bring electricity prices down and insists the measure is fully compliant with EU law.“The government’s measures take into account the change in prices,” said a Spanish official. “The situation is being followed closely and there will be no hesitation in acting again if it is necessary.”Ignacio Galán, chair and chief executive of Iberdrola, is set on Wednesday to meet Teresa Ribera, Spain’s deputy prime minister for the environment.The companies argue the windfall profits that the levy targets are illusory, since most energy for this year and next has already been sold via longer-term contracts rather than at the spot prices that have hit a series of all-time highs.“More than 80 per cent of all the electricity in Spain that is hit by [the windfall tax] has already been sold and is already tied up in bilateral contracts. So you’re putting companies in a situation where they are forced to pay a bigger tax than the actual revenue they’re getting. They’re basically being forced to resell their energy,” said Ruby.He added that he expected the companies to “pursue all options” to challenge the legality of the measure. However, the utilities’ legal recourse against the royal decree that implemented the levy may be limited.
213  Steffen Bork sees the 25 or so trucks sitting idle at his family-owned haulage company in central Germany as clear evidence that a lack of drivers across Europe is reaching an “extremely dangerous” point.“For months now, our business has been characterised by an acute shortage,” said Bork, the third generation of his family to manage the company. “Some of our existing customers have overflowing order books. Due to the driver bottleneck, enormous pressure has built up.”Bork’s worries are the latest sign that Europe’s rebound from the coronavirus pandemic is creating widespread supply-side frictions as companies struggle to find enough workers or materials to meet rising demand — slowing the economic recovery.Increased economic activity after coronavirus restrictions were eased across Europe earlier this year had produced a “very high workload for drivers and dispatchers, which in turn leads to dissatisfaction and resignations”, he said. About 10 per cent of his company’s 290 trucks were without drivers, he said, adding: “There is high customer dissatisfaction with our failure to meet deadlines.”The shortage of heavy goods vehicle drivers is widespread across Europe, reaching 80,000 in Germany and 400,000 across the whole EU, according to industry associations. They warn the situation is likely to worsen owing to an ageing workforce — the average age of drivers is over 50 — and difficulties recruiting young people.So far, however, there are no signs the impact in the EU is as severe as in the UK, where the army has been deployed to deliver fuel to petrol stations, ports are overflowing with containers awaiting delivery and some supermarket shelves are empty.The country’s crisis has been partly attributed to Brexit. The number of truck drivers there dropped year on year by 29,000, or 9.5 per cent, in the 12 months to March, according to the Office for National Statistics. More than half of the drop was owing to a 36 per cent decline in the number of EU citizens working as drivers in the UK, the ONS said.“In Germany and all over the EU we have the same problem as in the UK, but in the UK it was made worse by Brexit,” said Dirk Engelhardt, chair of Germany’s Federal Association of Goods Transport, Logistics and Disposal.Engelhardt blames EU driver shortages on low wages, the job’s bad image among young people and the poor treatment of workers. “When drivers deliver to big industrial companies, they are not even allowed to use the toilets,” he said. “They are treated like animals. This must stop.”Horst Kottmeyer, owner of a haulage company with 300 trucks in north-west Germany, has tried to recruit from Poland, the Czech Republic and the Baltic nations. “But in the meantime, the driver shortage has also arrived in these countries,” he said.Kottmeyer worries the situation could be aggravated once carmakers and other industrial groups recover from pandemic-related shortages of materials such as semiconductors that have held back production.In August, a 17.5 per cent month-on-month fall in German production of motor vehicles and trailers left overall industrial output in Europe’s largest economy 9 per cent below pre-pandemic levels.Others are concerned that when tougher EU labour laws on commercial road transport, known as the Mobility Package, come into force next year the crisis could deepen. The regulation will make truck drivers eligible for the minimum wage of every member state they drive in for most jobs outside their home nation, to take a minimum number of breaks and to return to their home base every eight weeks.But Isabelle Maitre at France’s national federation of road transport, believes the new rules will improve the image of the sector and boost recruitment. “We are trying to attract more young women to join the industry,” she said.Labour shortages are also affecting other industries as the eurozone economy rebounds and unemployment falls back towards pre-pandemic levels.The proportion of EU companies saying staff shortages were the main brake on activity reached record highs in the industrial and construction sectors in September, according to the European Commission’s monthly survey.As in the US and UK, many European restaurants and bars have had difficulties hiring staff since they reopened after coronavirus lockdowns. More than a third of German builders said they lacked workers in a recent survey by the Ifo Institute in Munich.However, the eurozone’s unemployment rate was 7.5 per cent in August, well above levels in the US or UK. Economists say the region’s labour shortages are likely to ease as people who left the workforce during the pandemic look for jobs, furlough schemes expire and remaining Covid-19 travel restrictions are lifted.Enzo Weber, head of research at the Institute for Employment Research in Nuremberg, said its index of German labour shortages remained below pre-pandemic levels, despite rising sharply since the spring. “We have had a severe redirection of migration since Brexit,” he said. “New migrants don’t go to the UK any more, they go to Germany, France or other countries and these jobs like builders and lorry drivers are typically done by migrants.”And while the UK’s driver shortage has led to ships being diverted from the UK’s main port at Felixstowe because it is rammed full of containers, the three big EU ports of Rotterdam, Antwerp and Hamburg say they are confident of being able to handle their exceptionally high volumes of cargo.For German truck drivers, the UK’s problems have been positive in at least one sense — raising awareness of how badly things can go wrong if labour shortages are not addressed. “The current situation in the UK really helps us,” said Engelhardt. “The government is afraid to have the same things happen here.”
214  “Best” is a favourite word of the chairman and chief executive of the LVMH group. It punctuates his every sentence. It is also the standard by which he compares the 75 brands in the LVMH stable, including the fashion houses Dior, Givenchy and Louis Vuitton and the drinks brands Moët & Chandon, Hennessy and Château d’Yquem (the last dates back to 1593). It also includes the suitcase maker Rimowa, acquired in 2016, the fine-jewellery brand Bulgari and the watchmaker TAG Heuer. He expects each to be the best. The Cheval Blanc brand began life in Courchevel in 2006 as a boutique, seasonal 34-room ski resort. It now consists of five properties, including this new Paris outpost in the deco section of the landmark building on the Seine. The project has been 15 years in the making and marks a city debut for the hotel group better known for exotic faraway locales. It’s an interesting development for LVMH, which also acquired Belmond in 2019 for $3.2bn. Is this Arnault’s bid to conquer the hospitality market? Or simply to become the best hotelier in the world?“The goal is not to do a big chain with Cheval Blanc,” says the 72-year-old over breakfast. A slight, 6ft presence with a looming statesmanlike authority, Arnault arrived at the hotel for our appointed meeting at exactly 8.30am. “We don’t need to be a group with 50 hotels. We want to concentrate on being the best – to have the best location, the best team, the best interior design, the best architecture. And this takes time. We are not in any rush.”La Samaritaine was founded by Ernest Cognacq as a small apparel shop in 1870, and expanded over the next few decades to become the sprawling temple to art nouveau and art deco – as well as commerce – it is recognised as today. After safety issues were discovered in the building, and decades of financial losses, the store was closed in 2005: five years later LVMH took full control. It was only while redeveloping the original department store that Arnault was inspired to build a hotel on the Seine side of the building when he realised that its greatest asset was its uninterrupted views. The completed Cheval Blanc opened in early September following months of Covid-19 delays. It has 72 suites, four restaurants and a spa, with suites costing from €1,150, but today Arnault is unveiling the hotel’s most exclusive residence: a 1,000sq m apartment incorporating seven bedrooms, a vast living area, marbled bathrooms and a private gym. Called The Apartment, it will cost tens of thousands per night. The world is different. But I think the economy is going to boom”The Apartment has secure and independent street access, a team of dedicated staff ready to tend to every ministration, and – the kicker – a substantial private pool. The hotel already has a guest pool in its basement, surrounded by a dazzling video map conceived by the artist Oyoram. By contrast, the apartment’s aquatic facility is more modest, but it does boast a picture window through which bathers can admire the Sacré-Coeur. The apartment, like the hotel and a vast number of other LVMH-owned buildings, was designed by the architect Peter Marino and it contains an inventory of museum-quality artworks. A James Siena painting, Ssonsunurrhth, hangs in the library, alongside a sculpture, Bull, by William Byl. The living suite is furnished with a Steinway grand piano – Arnault is himself an accomplished player, and his second wife, Hélène Mercier, is a concert pianist (she sometimes plays with her sons Alexandre, an executive vice president at Tiffany and Chopin enthusiast, and Frédéric, CEO of TAG Heuer and the fourth of Arnault’s five children). In the apartment dining room, an abstract painting, T1989-L42 by Hans Hartung, hangs over a row of citrine-yellow chairs. A gilded guardrail of flowers unfurls along a stairwell: commissioned in addition to a loveseat and two sculptures, Arnault explains proudly, it represents some of the final work undertaken, in 2018, by the artist Claude Lalanne. The deco details such as the window casements, which were all listed, have preserved the building’s historic integrity, while the prestigious furnishings lend everything a just-so, very contemporary air. “We asked Peter Marino to design the inside as though it were a private home,” says Arnault of the light-filled decor. “And you can see that in the rhythm of the rooms. You may have, also, access to the top terrace, where you can do cocktails and other things. I think it is the best experience in town.” Arnault stands suddenly. “We should go on the terrace for one minute.” He leads me to a spacious terrace revealing a 360-degree panorama that shimmers under a blue sky hung with perfect cumulus clouds. Here is Paris delivered in a cinematic landscape where the Bastille, the Seine, the Louvre and Montmartre are laid out in one great gulp of Stendhal-inducing wow.It also illustrates quite deftly the sweep of Arnault’s power. To the left is the Louis Vuitton headquarters, the house which contributes the majority share of the group’s revenues, reported to be €44.7bn in 2020. Earlier this year, Arnault’s personal fortune was estimated to be $194bn, a number that has since grown bigger to earn him the sometime title of richest human in the world. To the right is the Louvre, the world’s most visited museum, which has been hosting LV fashion shows amid its priceless relics since Nicolas Ghesquière first staged a womenswear collection in the Cour Marly in September 2017. And across the river stand the charred remains of Notre-Dame. In the aftermath of the fire that devastated the cathedral in 2019, Arnault pledged a €200m donation towards its restoration (doubling that pledged by his arch rival, Kering CEO François-Henri Pinault). Just beside Notre-Dame, on the Tribunal de Commerce, a giant advertising hoarding promotes the LVMH-owned Celine. Aside from being a stunning building, the Samaritaine has become a symbol. It’s a marvel: the art nouveau façades, cast-iron signs and glass-filled atrium that first characterised the department store have been painstakingly restored. It’s a social enterprise: the development also contains 96 low-cost housing units, a nursery and office space that have been built alongside the hotel and store. It’s a place of civic pride: since the reopening, the Samaritaine has seen an average of 35,000 visitors daily walking through its doors. And it’s a morale boost for the city, which, following the Bataclan and Charlie Hebdo massacres, the tumult of the gilets jaunes demonstrations, the Notre Dame catastrophe and 18 months of pandemic, is finally emerging from a long period of disquiet. “It’s a symbol of the reopening of Paris,” says Arnault. “It’s a symbol of a return to normal life.”The same observation is made by Olivier Lefebvre, chief executive of the Cheval Blanc group, and as jolly and avuncular as Arnault is cool and lean. “We have had a very nice surprise with the occupancy and in the bookings for the restaurants,” he says as he briskly marches through the Le Tout-Paris restaurant, with its graphic 1980s carpet and Roger Capron coffee tables, along the handcarved, burned, brushed and varnished wall of wine vault inside the Plénitude restaurant and through the warren of beauty treatment rooms, where the scent of Cheval Blanc, a bespoke fragrance made by Dior Parfums, gently mists the air. “The local clientele has been very present as guests, even among those staying at the hotel,” adds Lefebvre. “Overall the market is doing quite well again – Paris has experienced a good return.” When the project was first conceived, it was probably anticipated that a lot more foreign tourists would be here. I wonder to what extent the pandemic has derailed the plan? “The Americans are coming back gradually, but not the Chinese, not a lot of countries,” says Arnault of the challenges faced by the hospitality industry. “But, you know, tourism is important but you should not overestimate it. When Covid arrived and we saw, for the luxury activities, that the Chinese were not going to travel, we thought it might be difficult. But, in fact, the Chinese started buying in their own country, and we compensated for what we lost on the tourism of people buying in Paris, or for the loss in airport sales.” If the absence of Asian tourists in Europe is a situation, it’s not something that is causing Arnault undue stress. “I don’t think there will be one tourist coming to Paris that will not want to see Samaritaine, both the department store or the hotel,” he says of his expectations for the future. “For 15 years, this plaza was completely empty. Now, you see, it’s full of life.” Arnault insists on thinking long term about his investments. And shoring up different assets around the world. “We don’t have the constraints of the stock market value every quarter. And it is the same thing for my brands. I always say to people working in the company, you should not look at the profitability. Profitability is a consequence of work done well, and a consequence of desirability of the product. And so too for this project. We were not looking at immediate profitability. We were looking at taking advantage of the beauty of this historic architecture and the fantastic location just in the middle of Paris. Because, you know, a project like this could not have been done by anybody. It took us 15 years of investment, with no profit at that time.”It’s arguable that Covid-19 has done much to rehabilitate Arnault’s reputation. Early on in the pandemic, the group was quick to pivot its resources to help make hand sanitiser where there was a shortfall. He was also instrumental in securing a supply chain through which France could secure more PPE. That the company remains in France, employs some 170,000 people (a number increasing by 10,000 every year, according to Arnault), and manufactures mostly French-made products is something that the country might regard with patriotic pride. “I think people know that the group is good for the country,” says Arnault, who last night had dinner with Sergio Mattarella, the president of Italy, and President Macron. “Good for durability and good for the people. They know the group as a whole is good for France.”Does he think, as predicted by some financial analysts, we’re about to enter the Roaring Twenties? It would be fitting after all, considering the Samaritaine was the archetypal Twenties building the first time they roared around. “I think there will be a high level of optimism when all this is finished and things return to normal,” replies Arnault. “And there is an appetite for high-quality goods, yes. In perfume, for instance, what is striking is the success of the very special perfume made by Christian Dior. It’s more expensive. It’s more unique. You can personalise your perfume, and the success of it is incredible. And what is interesting, because I was reviewing it only yesterday, is that the clientele is maybe 10 years younger than the clientele for the very famous brands like J’adore or Miss Dior.” He is cautiously optimistic about the future. “I think the world is different,” he continues. “But I think the economy is going to boom.”In his own life, however, it’s business as usual. Arnault is already focused on a new Cheval Blanc in Beverly Hills, there are meetings with other foreign presidents to schedule, and he longs to travel so that he can check in on his many hundreds of retail points around the world. Being static doesn’t really suit him; he is frustrated by Zoom meetings and he likes to address people face-to-face. It seems ironic that beyond his customary blue Dior suits and shirts with monogrammed initials, one of the chief architects of modern luxury appears to thrive most in the un-luxuriously relentless business of hard work. His description of the Cheval Blanc brand as a “couture house” leads me to wonder which specific personalisations he might request of his own hotel. His answer is almost disappointingly normal. For all the wealth of services at his disposal, the thing Arnault values most significantly when he travels is some peace and quiet. “And then in the room,” he adds, “I care about the light. Sometimes in the hotel, you switch off the light and you see something blinking. Or a TV or something.

215  The EU will be making a “historic misjudgement” if it fails to agree to rewrite the Brexit deal that covers trading arrangements for Northern Ireland, the UK warned on Tuesday.In an uncompromising speech, UK Brexit minister Lord David Frost warned that “fractious” relations between the two sides would not find a new equilibrium unless the EU agrees to British demands to fundamentally rewrite the so-called Northern Ireland protocol in the withdrawal agreement.He was speaking ahead of the publication on Wednesday of a new package of measures by the European Commission to try to ease the bureaucratic impact of the protocol.The protocol, which sought to avoid the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland, has bedevilled relations between London and Brussels since it came into force in January.“For the EU now to say that the protocol . . . can never be improved upon, when it is so self-evidently causing such significant problems, would be a historic misjudgement,” said Frost in a speech in Lisbon.Business has complained about how the protocol requires customs and regulatory checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, and the arrangements were one of several factors blamed for fuelling violence on Belfast’s streets in April.Northern Ireland’s pro-UK unionist politicians object to how their region, by being placed in the EU’s single market for goods, is treated differently to Great Britain.Frost accused the EU of sometimes looking like it wanted post-Brexit Britain to fail, as he made clear the UK wants root and branch reform of the Northern Ireland protocol, including an end to the role of the European Court of Justice in oversight of the withdrawal agreement.Citing the rejection of the Brexit deal by Northern Ireland’s unionist parties, Frost also repeated his threat that the UK would unilaterally suspend parts of the protocol using procedures set out in article 16 if the EU did not bend further.“It is our responsibility to safeguard peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland, and that may include using article 16 if necessary,” he said.The EU has said it will not renegotiate the fundamental tenets of the Northern Ireland protocol, but the bloc is prepared to find ways to reduce the volume of checks on goods.EU diplomats believe the commission’s package of measures, outlined to them on Tuesday, go about as far as the bloc’s law allows.To try to assuage unionist concerns, the commission is expected to propose that many foods from Great Britain will be allowed to enter Northern Ireland with significantly reduced checks, including chilled meats such as sausages, so long as they are labelled as for sale in the “UK only”.Mairead McGuinness, Ireland’s EU commissioner who is in charge of financial services, said the measures would give answers to “the real practical problems on the ground for business”.She urged the UK to listen to Northern Ireland’s business community and focus on the potential benefits the protocol could bring, including privileged access to the EU single market compared to companies in Great Britain.“I hear the business community just shutting their ears to this political drama and they are saying . . . let us reap the rewards of access to the EU market while maintaining access to the United Kingdom. And I mean why not?” she said.Simon Coveney, Ireland’s foreign minister, said the commission’s proposals were “practical” and came after “months of hard work, careful listening”.EU diplomats warned Frost’s rhetoric could backfire, and that any move which imperilled Ireland’s place in the EU single market would be met with a united response by the bloc’s 27 member states. “The Irish have got solidarity and we would like the same if we were in that position one day,” said one.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, the largest group in Northern Ireland’s devolved government, said the protocol needed to be “replaced” because it was undermining the region’s position in the UK.“This is not a time for tinkering around the edges with temporary fixes,” he added in a statement. “We need a long-term solution.”Additional reporting by Jude Webber in Dublin and Peter Wise in Lisbon
216  The EU’s top diplomat ignored the advice of his own staff in deciding to send observers to elections in Venezuela next month, over-ruling warnings that the mission will legitimise president Nicolás Maduro’s regime and tarnish the reputation of the bloc’s election observation missions.Josep Borrell, head of the European External Action Service, the EU’s security and diplomatic arm, said last month he would send observers to Venezuela’s regional and municipal polls in November, for the first time in 15 years.That decision came despite an internal report seen by the Financial Times, in which a team of EEAS officials sent to the country in July to assess the feasibility of deploying election monitors warned that such a move “may be contrary to the political line of the EU”.“The deployment of an EU (mission) is likely to have an adverse impact on the reputation and credibility of EU (observers) and indirectly legitimise Venezuela’s electoral process,” the report reads.Citing numerous human rights violations and restrictions on freedoms, it concluded that “the minimum conditions for election observation are not met at this time”. It did however add that “the Venezuelan authorities have hinted that this could change through political negotiation”.Maduro has been internationally condemned for widespread human rights abuses and political repression since taking over as Venezuela’s president in 2013.Borrell, a former Spanish foreign minister who has long called for the EU to take more interest in the Venezuelan crisis, said when unveiling the EU observer mission that he believed it could constitute an “important contribution” and “a path towards credible, inclusive and transparent elections” in Venezuela.After the report was written, Venezuela’s main opposition bloc reluctantly agreed to participate in the November 21 elections, although without any expectation that they would be free or fair.Maduro controls most media, has taken over political parties, jailed opponents and appointed allies to the electoral council. His government hopes that an internationally recognised election might help secure relief from economic sanctions.Last month, a UN fact-finding panel presented the latest evidence of rights abuses, concluding that the Venezuelan justice system had played a significant role in state repression by allowing evidence obtained through torture to be admitted in court.“Is Borrell ready to legitimise a dictatorship?” said Carlos Vecchio, the Venezuelan opposition’s envoy to Washington. “This report reflects what we have always said, namely that there are no conditions for an electoral process in Venezuela. You don’t need to wait until November 21 to see what is happening: today, the political parties are controlled by Maduro, the disqualifications [of opposition politicians] continue.”EEAS spokesman Peter Stano said in response to questions from the FT that “the deployment of an EOM in no way represents a legitimation of an election . . . This political decision is fully consistent with the EU position on Venezuela”.Borrell’s decision was taken after Maduro’s electoral council promised to allow election observers to work “according to [the EU’s] methodology” and had the backing of opposition groups, Stano said, adding that the mission could be recalled if that agreement was broken.Venezuelan opposition figures have complained of pressure from European diplomats to take part in the elections and to return to Norwegian-brokered negotiations with Maduro’s government, even though these have failed three times before.The EU and the US are searching for ways to resolve Venezuela’s political crisis after previous attempts to topple Maduro through ever-tighter economic sanctions and by recognising Vecchio’s opposition colleague Juan Guaidó as “interim president” failed.Maduro has clung to power with support from Russia, China, Cuba and Iran. The US has accused his government of raking in billions of dollars from drug trafficking and gold smuggling.
217  A company developing a silver and zinc deposit in Bosnia-Herzegovina has launched the biggest share sale this year by a London-listed mining company.Adriatic Metals is seeking to raise $102m to complete development of the Vares underground mine, which is located 50km north of the country’s capital Sarajevo.It has placed $52m worth of shares with private equity group Orion Mine Finance, which is also investing $120m in senior debt and $22.5m for a stream of future royalty payments.At the same time, the company’s bankers will seek to place $80m worth of shares owned by Sandfire Resources, an Australian-listed copper producer that built a 16 per cent stake in Adriatic. Paul Cronin, Adriatic’s chief executive, also intends to sell 3m shares if demand is strong enough.Unlike many countries in Europe, where it is becoming increasingly difficult to build a new mine, Bosnian policymakers are looking to attract foreign direct investment by offering a low corporate tax rate of 10 per cent.On average it takes 16 years to permit and bring a new mine into production. If all goes to plan Adriatic should reach that milestone in four years.“Europe needs new mining operations. Policymakers can see the pressure on supply chains,” said Cronin told the Financial Times. “But you don’t have to do it in a mega project way. I think our project demonstrates that.”Adriatic’s prosed $244.5m financing package will support the biggest foreign direct investment into Bosnia since it was declared an independent state in the early 1990s.“We welcome Adriatic Metals’ commitment to rebuilding Bosnia’s mining industry with the impending financing of the Vares silver project, which will be the largest single investment in the country’s metal mining history to date,” said Bosnia’s Prime Minister Fadil Novalić.Cronin, a former banker, founded Adriatic in 2017 after he purchased exploration licences around the former mining town of Vares and started drilling. He had immediate success, discovering what is now called the Rupice deposit.“When I went to Bosnia to evaluate these projects, I sat down at the Geological Institute and went through archived boxes that no one had even looked at before. We digitised it there and then and put it into our own software model,” he saidThe high-grade core of the Rupice deposit will enable the company to recoup its investment in less than a year once the underground mine starts production in 2023.While the price of silver has slipped 14 per cent this year, zinc, used to rustproof steel, has gained 15 per cent to a three-high above $32,000 a tonne on the back of strong manufacturing demand in China and the rest of the world.Cronin is planning to use the cash generated by the mine to fund further exploration in the area, progress projects in Serbia and to fund acquisitions, primarily in Europe.“We would like some battery metals. Certainly nickel but also cobalt. We will also look at precious metals. Silver has a part to play in decarbonisation, particularly as it is required in solar panels,” said Cronin.Cronin said the company, which is also listed in Sydney and has a market value of $500m, will seek a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange, a move that would make it eligible for inclusion in prestigious FTSE indices.Canaccord Genuity, RBC and Stifel Nicolaus are bookrunners for the share sale.
218  The EU attracted strong demand from investors for its inaugural green bond on Tuesday, as Brussels kicked off its efforts to become the world’s biggest issuer of sustainable debt.The €12bn sale of 15-year debt attracted more than €135bn of orders, and marked the largest green bond deal, narrowly eclipsing the UK’s £10bn debut last month. The sale comes as Europe continues to battle an energy crunch, serving to illustrate a growing need for diverse and renewable sources of power.Tuesday’s issue is the first of an expected €250bn of the European Commission green bonds, making up about a third of the bloc’s €800bn Covid-19 recovery fund. The proceeds will be passed on to member states to be spent on areas such as energy efficiency, transport and nature protection.The EU’s debut green bond “will help strengthen the role of the EU and euro in the sustainable finance market”, said Johannes Hahn, EU budget commissioner. “This will serve as an inspiration to other issuers.”Brussels has joined a host of member states, including Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Poland, in issuing green debt. Demand for green securities has been intense owing to the fund management industry’s focus on environmental, social and governance factors, or ESG.“This first issue will boost the growth of the [green bond] market while further improving its liquidity,” said Johann Plé, a senior portfolio manager at Axa Investment Managers, adding that overall green bond issuance was on course to hit €400bn, doubling 2020’s total.The EU joined other recent issuers in attracting a price premium — known as a “greenium” — for its green bond, meaning it achieved a slightly lower funding cost at Tuesday’s sale. The yield of 0.45 per cent represented a borrowing cost of about 0.025 of a percentage point under what would be expected for an equivalent conventional bond, Hahn said.Still, the rapid growth of the green bond market, not least owing to the bloc’s ambitious issuance plans, is likely to alleviate the relative scarcity of green sovereign debt. “As the amount of green bonds grows, the ‘greenium’ could come under pressure,” said ABN Amro rates strategist Floortje Merten. “It’s something we have seen happen in the corporate bond world.”Brussels’ green bonds will be based largely on the EU’s sustainable finance rules known as the taxonomy, although this has yet to be finalised as governments are split over whether to include gas and nuclear as green activity.As part of its recovery fund, the commission will screen national spending plans in an attempt to ensure the cash is used to fund genuine environmental projects, while aiming to stamp out so-called greenwashing. Member states must spend at least 36 per cent of their national recovery envelopes on green spending.
219  Austria’s government has survived a parliamentary no-confidence vote just days after the resignation of Sebastian Kurz as chancellor amid a probe by state prosecutors into political corruption.The Green party, the junior coalition partner of Kurz’s moderate conservative People’s party, voted to support the new chancellor Alexander Schallenberg.Kurz, the 35-year-old who was once feted as the future of European conservatism, was not present at Tuesday’s vote. He is to remain leader of the People’s party and is due to take over as head of its parliamentary faction this week — leading many to dub him the new “shadow chancellor”. He will continue to sit in the cabinet.Austria had been in a state of political crisis since last Wednesday, when police raids across Vienna at ministries revealed an investigation by prosecutors into bribery and perjury in government.Kurz, who resigned as chancellor on Saturday, is a key suspect in the probe. Prosecutors allege he was entangled in a conspiracy to direct taxpayer money towards media organisations in exchange for positive coverage. He has denied any wrongdoing.In an intense five-hour sitting of parliament on Tuesday, opposition deputies lined up to lambast the “Kurz system”. One MP fainted at the rostrum.Addressing parliament, Schallenberg, who was sworn into office on Monday, appealed for unity and an end to politicking. “If I have a message to give today, it is that our hand is outstretched towards our coalition partner to overcome the rifts,” he said.He made clear that Kurz still had his support. “Of course, I will proceed in close consultation with [the] former chancellor,” he said.Vice-chancellor and Green party leader Werner Kogler praised Kurz. “I want to state that I appreciate [his] move and that he deserves respect,” he told MPs, to jeers from the opposition.The Greens had indicated last week that if Kurz did not resign, they would contemplate forming a politically disparate coalition with three other opposition parties to shut the People’s party out of power.Analysts said that to have done so would have been a risky and potentially unpopular strategy and would have significantly diluted the Green’s role in any future government.“The government reshuffle is a farce,” said Pamela Rendi-Wagner, leader of the opposition Social Democrat party. “One person continues to pull all the strings. That person is Kurz.”Herbert Kickl, leader of the rightwing populist Freedom party who Kurz forced out as interior minister in 2019 after a scandal that ended the first Kurz government, said that since the raids “Austria knows one thing for certain: that abuse of power, serious systematic corruption, manipulation of the population, perfidy and hypocrisy are what hold the [People’s party] together at its core”.
220  French president Emmanuel Macron has outlined a five-year, €30bn investment plan to boost the country’s high-tech industries and reduce dependence on imported raw materials and electronic components such as microchips.Six months before a presidential election in which he is expected to seek a second term, Macron said the “France 2030” plan would direct government money to 10 targets, including the development of small “modular” nuclear reactors and of a “low-carbon” aircraft, green hydrogen production, the modernisation and decarbonisation of industry and the financing of start-ups.“We need to reinvest in a strategy of growth,” Macron told a selected audience of 200 ministers, company bosses, politicians, scientists and students at the Elysée Palace. “If we don’t reindustrialise the country, we cannot again become a nation of innovation and research.” Although France in recent years has accelerated the launch of new digital and tech businesses, the Covid-19 pandemic and the logistical delays that have bedevilled the global economic recovery have brutally exposed French and EU dependence on imports, especially for health products and microchips for the motor industry.The idea of the plan, Macron said, was to strengthen the country’s autonomy “so that France and Europe can retake control of their destiny”. Senior officials said the plan would require €4bn of capital from the state, and about €30bn in budgetary spending, starting with €3bn-€4bn in the next fiscal year from January 1. It comes on top of an €100bn post-pandemic recovery plan that is being partly financed by the EU.Some opposition politicians immediately dismissed the move as electioneering ahead of next April’s presidential vote. “A few months before the end of his term, the outgoing president is committing taxpayers’ money to gild his election platform with promises to be taken on by his successor,” Marine Le Pen, far right leader of the Rassemblement National party said on Twitter. “It’s a matter of ‘Whatever it costs, I want to be re-elected’.”Details of the plan and how the money will be allocated and monitored have yet to be fleshed out, but Cédric O, minister for the digital economy, said the “real revolution” of France 2030 was that it represented a “massive bet” on start-ups or “emerging actors”. He said: “We want to have Elon Musks in France.” Macron used the example of Musk and his SpaceX rocket launch venture to explain how innovation globally was moving faster than expected and how successes were often a combination of private sector inventiveness and significant state funding or procurement. “This plan must start quickly . . . commando-style,” he said.Ludovic Subran, chief economist of insurer Allianz, noted that it was unclear how Macron had arrived at his €30bn total. “I love how everyone is trying to put together the #France2030 investment plan from pieces of the jigsaw,” Subran said. “You can bet that the French finance ministry is doing the same right now. That’s what’s funny :)”.Asked about the vagueness of the plan, Philippe Martin, who chairs the independent Economic Analysis Board advising the government, said he understood critics’ misgivings but argued it would be undesirable to have a detailed investment programme “decided from above and all sewn up in advance without any tenders for the projects”.Among the sums announced by Macron were €8bn for energy, including funding for two big hydrogen production plants and €1bn for “small modular reactors” for the nuclear industry; almost €6bn to double electronics production in France and reduce dependence on imported chips; €4bn for new forms of transport, with a target to produce 2m electric or hybrid vehicles in France annually by 2030; and €2bn for modernising farming.He also announced plans to invest in health and medical innovations, with the aim of developing “at least 20 biomedicines against cancer, emerging diseases and chronic illnesses” by 2030, as well as in industrial training and the exploration of space and the deep oceans.Of his €600m allocation for France’s creative and cultural industries, including the building of film studios, Macron said: “It is a fight that is both civilisational and a value creator.”
221  The writer is Fritz Stern chair at the Brookings InstitutionWhat direction will Berlin’s foreign and security policy take in a post-Merkel era? Allies, neighbours and competitors are all no doubt anxious for phone calls from Germany’s next government. Chancellor Angela Merkel, who remains in place as the leader of a caretaker government, has been doing farewell tours since the summer. One can almost hear her drumming her fingers on her desk.It looks as if some patience may be required. The Social Democrats, winners of last month’s Bundestag election, began “exploratory” talks this week with the Greens and liberal Free Democrats. A decision on whether to open coalition negotiations may come by Friday.They have little choice. There has been no SPD chancellor since 2005. That was also the last time the Greens were in government. The FDP has been out of power for all but four years since 1998. Merkel’s Christian Democrats — the only coalition alternative — appear to be taking themselves out of the running. Their leadership is busy forming a circular firing squad amid angry calls from the ranks for a reckoning.The most urgent, divisive issues on the negotiators’ agenda are domestic, though almost every one has external policy dimensions. They involve modernising Germany’s creaky physical, administrative, educational and digital infrastructure, and achieving a just and green transition. Each would require public investments funded by tax increases or public debt — which the SPD and Greens are ready to contemplate, but the FDP firmly opposes.Gone are the budget surpluses of a few years ago. Instead, Germany’s first three-way coalition since the 1950s would face rising consumer prices, shortages of affordable housing, global supply disruptions and a looming European energy crisis. The pandemic persists; its long-term economic and social effects have yet to play out. And while the hard-right Alternative for Germany lost seats nationwide, it gained ground in two of Germany’s most structurally disadvantaged eastern states.As in other western nations, these domestic tensions are likely to act as constraints on the foreign and security policy of the country’s next government. The problem is that neither Germany nor its allies can afford that. From January, it will be Germany’s turn to chair the G7 club of leading industrial democracies as it grapples with a frayed international order. President Emmanuel Macron of France will seek re-election in April in a contest likely to feature two tenacious hard-right candidates. His defeat would leave Berlin bereft of its most important partner in Europe.Elsewhere, more trouble is afoot. Poland’s government is openly challenging the rule of law in the EU. The UK is confronting Brussels over the Northern Ireland protocol, while foreign secretary Liz Truss just laid out a diplomatic strategy that omitted all mention of the EU.The US is conducting global force and nuclear posture reviews that could have a major impact on defence and deterrence in the western alliance. But the Biden administration is under siege from the far right as well. Should it lose one or both of its legislative majorities in next year’s midterms, its foreign policy could become even more disjointed.None of this turmoil escapes the authoritarians in Moscow and Beijing. The Kremlin taunts Europeans with their dependence on Russian energy. China doubles down on intimidating Taiwan. It all sends shudders through the global economy, on whose stability the “export champion” Germany depends like few other nations.Can a “traffic light” coalition of SPD, Greens and FDP rise to these challenges? There are some grounds for hope. Olaf Scholz, finance minister and presumptive chancellor, was the driving force behind the €750bn European economic recovery programme in spring, as well as the recent international agreement on a minimum corporate tax rate. Key voices in all three parties favour a tougher, values-based response to China.But do the negotiators understand that Germany must be the central provider of land-based deterrence in Europe — and will have to invest in its armed forces accordingly? Do they realise how great Europe’s stake is in the Biden administration not losing its domestic struggles — and that they can help by taking on greater responsibility for European security? Their campaign platforms offered little reassurance that they do. One thing, meanwhile, is certain: the world will not wait for Germany’s next government.
222  Two things to start:Welcome back to another Energy Source.While Europe frets over natural gas and electricity prices, the oil rally is gathering some menacing steam. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, settled at $80.52 a barrel yesterday, its highest price in seven years. Brent settled at $83.65/barrel. A price surge that started as a recovery from last year’s pandemic-induced depths is now ringing alarm bells in the world’s capitals.Last week, before this latest lurch higher, the US energy secretary told me that a release from strategic stocks was one of the tools under consideration to ease the pain. The crude price is even higher now, and average American petrol prices have risen to $3.27 a gallon — 50 per cent above the average a year ago. So what next?Roger Diwan, a veteran oil-market analyst at IHS Markit, told the FT:The silence last week from Opec+, which is sticking with its planned supply increases despite US pressure to quickly supply more oil, is spooking the market.Meanwhile, I was in Colorado last week to look at a new solar facility outside Pueblo, a hardscrabble city on the High Plains that needs the jobs the new facility has secured.Colorado is endlessly fascinating to energy watchers. It is a state with huge fossil fuel reserves and a dependence on coal power and oil and gas production. But it also has ambitious decarbonisation goals and some of the best wind and solar resources in North America. It is truly an American test-case for an energy transition. Readers in Colorado, please write to me at derek.brower@ft.com with your tips on what we should be covering in the state.In today’s newsletter, our first note is on Chevron, which announced a new net-zero emissions target yesterday. Climate campaigners thought it missed the mark.Our second is on US liquefied natural gas. A global supply crunch has left consumers and politicians crying out for more fuel — and American exporters are now hoping to benefit. Climate activists don’t like that, either.Data Drill looks at coal prices. Spoiler: it’s boom time for the dirtiest fossil fuel.Thanks for reading.Chevron yesterday outlined “aspirations” to make its oil and gas exploration and production operations net-zero emissions by 2050, but made it clear that it is not giving up on growth in its oil and gas business.That latter part has drawn the ire of activist shareholders who are heaping pressure on the company to go much further in slashing so-called scope 3 emissions, pollution from the fuel it sells and produces.Chevron said it would trim its scope 3 carbon intensity, not the overall emissions, of its business by 5 per cent by 2028 compared to 2016 levels.In yesterday’s climate report outlining the new targets, the company said adopting the intensity metric gave it the “flexibility to grow its upstream and downstream businesses provided it remains an increasingly carbon-efficient operator”.Bruce Niemeyer, Chevron’s vice-president for sustainability, further defended the intensity metric to the FT as a crucial signal for the market during the transition.In May, green shareholder group Follow This won a significant proxy vote that saw 61 per cent of Chevron’s investors, including leading institutional investors, defy the company’s management and back a resolution calling on the company to set and reduce its scope 3 emissions.The group welcomed Chevron setting a target on scope 3 emissions for the first time, but called the target itself “tokenism” and said it failed to bring the company in line with the Paris agreement’s climate goals, a key demand of big shareholders such as BlackRock. Chevron argues it is in line with the Paris agreement’s goals.“The world needs to reduce absolute emissions by around 40 per cent by 2030 to have any chance to achieve the Paris accord. Until Chevron’s targets reflect this fact, their strategy falls short of Paris alignment. Five per cent is disappointing tokenism, not a serious attempt to confront the climate crisis,” Follow This said.Chevron, like its oil supermajor rivals, has been under intense scrutiny to show shareholders how it plans to profitably navigate the global shift to cleaner fuels.Engine No 1, the activist hedge fund that won a shareholder battle with ExxonMobil, has been in talks with Chevron’s management team. The fund won its fight at ExxonMobil in part by warning that the company’s fossil fuel reliant business plan left it at “existential risk” if the low-carbon transition quickened.Chevron will hope it has done enough to fend off a similar campaign. (Justin Jacobs)Record-high gas prices in Europe have left governments scrambling for supplies and developers eyeing a new boom for US liquefied natural gas. A new report by environmental watchdog Global Witness predicts the US will become the top LNG exporter by 2023, with exports set to more than double over the next decade. US gas exports reached new highs at the start of this year. The world leader in natural gas production, the US currently ranks third behind Australia and Qatar in LNG exports. Governments and consumers might want more gas, but climate campaigners want to remind the world that it is a fossil fuel with a growing carbon footprint.“Unless the current US administration urgently changes course, its lasting legacy will be to push the world irrevocably towards climate catastrophe,” Global Witness wrote in its report. Other climate groups, like the Sierra Club and the Sunrise Movement, argue the surge in US LNG production runs contrary to Biden’s decarbonisation plans. Natural gas emits about half as much carbon dioxide as coal in combustion, but the supply chain can leak huge amounts of methane, an even more potent greenhouse gas with a warming potential 80 times greater than carbon dioxide. Natural gas proponents argue that LNG can serve as a global bridge fuel, especially for poorer countries with a pressing need for electricity now.Natural gas can also provide a stable source of power generation when renewables falter — an argument industry executives have made for years. A strategic benefit of US LNG exports was also that the “freedom molecules”, as US officials referred to them, would lessen Europe’s dependence on Russian gas — although record-high US exports have hardly helped in the latest supply crisis, with spot cargoes heading to Asia, not Europe.Robert Stoner, deputy director for science and technology at MIT’s Energy Institute, argues that without widely available, low-cost carbon-capture technology, the switch to natural gas is a “time-limited opportunity.” The latest IPCC report revealed that countries must significantly reduce methane emissions to meet Paris climate targets.“If we’re going to continue to use LNG and natural gas . . . at a big scale, we’re going to have to do a better job about reducing methane emissions in a very deliberate way,” Stoner said. (Amanda Chu)The global natural gas supply crisis is sending coal prices to record highs. Two benchmarks, Newcastle and Rotterdam, surpassed $250 per tonne last week, which is more than 250 per cent above last year’s price levels, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. In China, coal power generation reached an all-time high yesterday when flooding shut down dozens of mines. The country had been struggling with an energy crunch before the flooding, with power shortages leading economists to reduce its expected economic growth. Soaring coal prices are also threatening India’s economic recovery from the pandemic, say analysts.Analysts at Bank of America expect Newcastle prices to remain above $200/tonne as the northern hemisphere’s winter kicks in. “Extreme volatility could continue across the energy complex . . . as below-normal temperatures could exacerbate the supply situation and send prices even higher,” wrote Bank of America in their weekly global energy report.

223  Brussels is racing to delay the introduction of new rules on trades that fail to settle, leaving banks and asset managers uncertain whether they need to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on compliance with standards likely to be rewritten.EU country representatives will meet this week to discuss a route through the Brussels legislative process to halt the arrival of the contentious rules, which market participants have warned would harm the region’s capital markets, and hit investors around the world.The rules, which are due to come in to effect in February 2022, would force the banks and asset managers using EU securities depositories into a mandatory “buy-in” process if a trade fails, potentially squeezing market liquidity, raising costs and leaving them less able to hedge their risks. The rules cover all securities, including stocks and bonds.At the moment, failed trades are usually resolved informally between buyer and seller. Under the new rules, to close a failed trade, a counterparty such as a securities depository will be required to buy the asset at the prevailing market price. The institution responsible for the failure will have to pay any difference between the buy-in price and the original deal.The rules are designed to ensure investors receive the goods they paid for, particularly in a volatile market. But regulators have accepted warnings from banks and asset managers that the rules are likely to hit the EU’s bond and exchange traded funds markets and make them less attractive to international investors. Market volatility, such as the pandemic-related episode of March 2020, could further exacerbate problems with the standards, according to a paper circulated by Italian diplomats and seen by the Financial Times.Blocking the introduction of the new rules is tricky, however. One plan is to add a clause postponing the introduction into unrelated upcoming legislation on digital ledger technology, the paper said. The matter will be discussed at a meeting on Wednesday as the clock ticks down on the new rules coming in to force.Market participants have also been concerned at the wide-ranging scope of the rules, as they cover any trading party around the world that uses an EU central securities depository. That includes Belgium’s Euroclear and Clearstream of Luxembourg, which collectively hold around €50tn of assets in custody for global investors.In June, the European Commission said it would revisit the rules to “avoid potential undesired consequences” but did not give a timeframe for action, setting up a potential collision with their formal introduction on February 1.The Italian paper proposed to delay the deadline for mandatory buy-ins but allow other parts of the legislation, such as penalties for trade failures, to come into effect. The buy-in clause could then be addressed in a separate review, it suggested.Pete Tomlinson, director of post trade at Afme, a lobby group, said it was encouraging that authorities recognised the problems with the buy-in regime and hoped it would be postponed.“We are already past the point at which the industry would ideally have liked this to be clarified. We are at the stage now where every day counts,” he said.“Putting aside the question of whether the current rules should be implemented, it’s not clear that the current rules can be implemented. There are a number of questions where the industry is waiting for the authorities to provide interpretative guidance,” he added.Esma, the EU’s market regulator, last month urged the European Commission to delay the February introduction and provide more clarification on its plans by the end of October at the latest. The EU has already delayed the introduction of the rules because of the coronavirus pandemic. The UK has said it will not implement the buy-in clause.
224  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.The energy crisis is not letting up and the old EU dispute over the role of nuclear power is back with a vengeance. We’re looking at how the troops are rallying behind nuclear-friendly France and nuclear-exit promoter Germany and what this dug-up hatchet bodes for EU’s climate ambitions.With an EU-Ukraine summit taking place in Kyiv today, we’re also exploring how that part of the bloc’s neighbourhood is acting in the gas crisis and what concrete results are expected from this high-level gathering.While you were sleeping, the IMF’s executive board decided to keep faith in Kristalina Georgieva as the institution’s managing director after marathon meetings in recent days to discuss allegations she pressured World Bank staff to manipulate data for China’s benefit.And in Brexit news, the UK has doubled down on its demand for a complete overhaul of the deal that governs trading arrangements for Northern Ireland, including removing oversight by the EU’s top court. This comes as the European Commission tomorrow is set to put forward proposals on how to reduce customs and regulatory checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.The EU’s divisions over the merits of nuclear power risk being reignited by the bloc’s energy crisis, writes Mehreen Khan in Brussels.There are few issues that provoke such a fevered debate between member states than the future of nuclear energy on the continent. That’s partly because France and Germany have long been pitted against each other — with Paris the loudest cheerleader for nuclear technology and Berlin firmly opposed, having decided to phase out all nuclear power by next year.Divisions are once again on show as Brussels is under pressure to respond to surging electricity prices by taking a stance on nuclear technology.France, the Czech Republic and Finland are demanding the commission designate nuclear power as a “green” technology under its much anticipated classification rules on sustainable finance, known as the taxonomy.Brussels delayed a decision on how to treat nuclear and gas earlier this year, fearing that the taxonomy would be junked by member states. A secondary set of rules was due to be published in the coming weeks to deal specifically with natural gas — a low-carbon fossil fuel — and nuclear power, which emits no CO2 but produces toxic waste.Commission officials yesterday spent hours grappling over whether to include a reference to the taxonomy in tomorrow’s publication of a so-called toolbox that will lay out what measures governments can take to alleviate the energy crisis.Officials in the talks said it was a mere taste of the fraught battle to come on the taxonomy.At stake for pro-nuclear countries is private investment and cost of financing for their power plants. They fear that without the highest green label in the taxonomy, capital will desert a technology that is so prized in countries such as France.The same logic applies for pro-gas countries in southern and eastern Europe who do not want the taxonomy to penalise a fuel that is crucial in reducing their emissions as they switch from dirtier coal or lignite.But green designation for both would leave the EU open to accusations that it was “greenwashing” rules that were designed precisely to stamp out the practice by guiding investors on what counts as genuinely sustainable economic activity. The UK and US have said they will each come up with their own taxonomies, moves that risk gazumping the EU's efforts to become a global standard setter for investors.“It is very delicate balance to strike. Countries care about their right to choose their energy mix and markets and investors are watching us to come up with credible rules,” said an EU official.Such are the political sensitivities that the commission is likely to further delay taking a stance, hoping perhaps that an easing of the energy crisis after the winter will simmer down tensions over nuclear power.Political support for a global agreement on methane emissions at the UN climate summit is building slowly, as another 25 countries joined the US and EU-led pledge to cut pollution from the potent greenhouse gas. Major emitters including China, India and Brazil are yet to sign up, however. (More here)A deal to open up Ukraine to more low-cost airlines and tourism opportunities will headline the results of the latest EU-Ukraine summit taking place today, which will otherwise be heavy on solidarity rhetoric but light on tangible ways to resolve the crisis in the country’s east, writes Henry Foy in Brussels.Now in its 23rd iteration, the Kyiv-Brussels conflab is now a well-established name in the EU’s diplomatic fixture list. But what is still not well-established is exactly how the bloc can extract Ukraine from its seven-year conflict with Russia, nor how united the EU really is over how to be tougher with Moscow as a means to that — much to Kyiv’s irritation.The EU in July rolled over its Russia sanctions pegged to the 2014 invasion of Crimea and yesterday extended them to eight more individuals who it said were “responsible for enforcing Russian law” in the occupied Black Sea peninsula. But Ukrainian officials will use today’s summit to push for more active steps, such as a potential EU military training mission in the country.In addition to the aviation agreements, talks will also touch on deepening trade relations and economic integration, particularly in terms of energy and telecommunications. Kyiv, still smarting from the US’s decision to drop its objections to Nord Stream 2, wants compensation of some sort for the pipeline’s now seemingly inevitable start of operations.And talking of gas: That the summit is taking place at a moment when the EU feels acutely menaced by Moscow and its pipeline politics will permit Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky a sense of I-told-you-so as he hosts Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen. But while he wants his guests to insist that any extra Russian gas flows through Ukraine’s pipes, all three know that European buyers will snap it up whatever the route.
225  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
226  President Emmanuel Macron has said France will invest €1bn in nuclear power by the end of this decade as Europe’s energy crisis spurs renewed interest in the contentious source of power.“The number one objective is to have innovative small-scale nuclear reactors in France by 2030 along with better waste management,” he said while announcing a “France 2030” investment plan on Tuesday.France is a bastion of nuclear power in Europe, with more than 70 per cent of its electricity derived from nuclear plants. However, after the disastrous 2011 explosion at a plant in Fukushima, Japan, and big cost overruns at a new plant in Flamanville, north-west France, national pride around France’s nuclear capability eroded.Early in his presidency Macron announced the intention to shut 14 reactors and cut nuclear’s contribution to France’s energy mix from 75 to 50 per cent by 2035.But the mood has now changed. Macron said on Tuesday he would begin investing in new nuclear projects “very quickly”.“We will continue to need this technology,” he said.Approval of nuclear plants is also a way for Macron to show his pro-nuclear credentials when a number of his most likely challengers in next year’s presidential election are pushing for more investment.“Nuclear is coming [back] to the fulcrum of the energy debate in France and much faster than I ever thought it would,” said Denis Florin, a partner at Lavoisier Conseil, an energy-focused management consultancy.Advocates say nuclear power’s availability and predictability has proved its worth at a time of soaring gas prices — while renewable energy remains volatile and difficult to store. Those advantages, which have protected French industrial companies and consumers from the most severe price hikes seen in other parts of Europe, have begun to outweigh lingering safety concerns.About 25 per cent of France’s electricity is sold at a regulated price of €42 per megawatt hour (MWh). The rest is subject to wider market prices and, specifically, a European pricing mechanism that means countries pay for the last unit of energy consumed — normally gas — which has led to some frustration among French consumers.Bruno Le Maire, France’s finance minister, has advocated a complete overhaul of Europe’s electricity pricing mechanism, which he argues unfairly prevents French citizens from fully benefiting from the country’s nuclear capability.France also wants nuclear energy to be labelled as “green” in the evolving EU green finance taxonomy that determines which economic activities can benefit from a “sustainable finance” label. France and eastern European capitals want to show investors that nuclear energy is part of the EU’s journey towards carbon neutrality, while Germany and others have resisted, pointing principally to the environmental impact of nuclear waste.Many on the left of French politics remain wedded to the idea of reducing France’s nuclear power supply, seeing it as a substitute for ambitious investment in renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, at a crucial juncture in EU governments’ ambitions to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.But proponents of nuclear power argue that in recent weeks France has boasted much lower carbon emissions than Germany, which has been rapidly phasing out its nuclear fleet since 2011 and has invested heavily in renewable energy but has also become more reliant on coal.Nicolas Goldberg, a senior energy analyst at Columbus Consulting, said Macron had now “firmly taken the path of seducing the right more than the left” with his nuclear policy, at a time when many rightwing presidential rivals promise that they would enhance France’s nuclear capability.Centre-right candidate Valérie Pécresse said this month that she would halt the planned shutdown of 12 nuclear reactors and give the state-controlled energy company EDF the green light to produce six new nuclear power stations.Eric Zemmour, who is rising quickly in polls after captivating the French public with his anti-immigration rhetoric, has also called for more nuclear investment and lambasted Macron’s investment in wind energy. “I do not want our country to lose its energy sovereignty under the pretext of an absurd energy transition copied from Germany,” he wrote in the magazine Le Point this month.Such calls also reflect shifts in public opinion.While a recent opinion poll by Odoxa found that the French public is still on the whole more favourable to wind power than nuclear, at 63 per cent compared with 51 per cent, French citizens’ support for nuclear has increased 17 percentage points over the past two years, while positive perceptions of wind power have decreased by the same amount.According to the same survey, nuclear power is judged to be less expensive than wind and less damaging to the landscape, as well as being a field in which France is “more advanced than its neighbours”.Macron’s proposed new “mini-reactors” — which would be less complex to produce and run than conventional reactors — would also help to maintain France’s industrial competitiveness given that prototypes are already being developed in China, Russia, the US and Japan.Several analysts believe Macron will go deeper into nuclear technology through the construction of at least six conventional European pressurised reactors (EPRs), to be built by 2044 — a project the government has considered for years. Documents obtained by the French press in 2019 suggested those would cost France’s heavily indebted EDF roughly €47bn.This month, RTE, the French grid operator, is due to publish six scenarios for France’s future energy mix by 2050, ranging from 100 per cent renewable energy to several new nuclear plants.“I am confident that Macron will announce six or eight new EPR power plants at the end of this month — he’s just waiting for this report,” said Goldberg.For those who have spent years advocating greater investment in renewable energy sources, and who thought they had the president’s ear, the mounting momentum towards nuclear has come as a disappointment.“Every euro invested in nuclear is a euro not invested in other energies,” said Matthieu Orphelin, an MP who used to represent Macron’s party but has now switched to France’s Greens. “A permanent, headlong rush into nuclear power will not save us.”
227  Octave Klaba, the founder of OVHcloud, arrived at a court in Paris earlier this year to bid for a promising tech start-up that had gone bankrupt, only to bump into a rival bidder: Xavier Niel, France’s most famous tech billionaire.“He is a shark who can spot a good business opportunity, and so am I,” Klaba said, remembering how he outbid Niel, the founder of the tech incubator Station F and a serial investor in start-ups, for Shadow, a cloud gaming service.Unlike Niel, the 46-year-old Poland-born entrepreneur has kept a relatively low profile until now. But this week, the cloud computing company OVHcloud he founded in the industrial city of Roubaix in northern France will start trading on the Paris stock exchange.The group aims to raise €350m by selling new shares at the IPO at a valuation of between €3.5bn to €3.75bn, and Klaba and his family still own 78 per cent of the shares.Even after they sell a slice at the IPO, their roughly 70 per cent stake will be worth €2.5bn if the shares price at the bottom of the range, making them some of the richest tech entrepreneurs in Europe.“I know it’s hard to believe that a company from Roubaix that was bootstrapped with no venture funding can compete with American tech giants,” said Klaba. “The IPO will help us convince the doubters that this is really happening and that they should get on board.”Founded in 1999 as a company that hosted websites, OVHcloud now employs 2,200 people and provides computing, storage and networking services to clients mostly in Europe and the US. A big fire at a data centre in Strasbourg earlier this year dented its growth and incurred extra costs, but it still aims for annual sales of €663m and roughly €230m in operating profit.Octave is chair, his father Henryk and his brother Miroslaw, both engineers, work as the head of networking and R&D, respectively and are board members.The IPO will be a key moment for France’s tech ecosystem, which is steadily creating more billion-dollar start-ups, but which has seen few public listings in Paris. Before digital music company Believe went public earlier this year, no France-based tech company had listed publicly at a valuation of more than a billion dollars since the online advertising group Criteo listed on Nasdaq in 2013.Meanwhile, some French founders have moved to the US to expand their companies, leading to blockbuster IPOs such as DataDog in 2019 and Snowflake in 2020.Klaba, who is married with three daughters, does not appear to care much about the outward trappings of wealth. His office attire consists of T-shirts with OVH logos and sneakers. “I was born in communist Poland where we had nothing so you learn to make do with very little,” he said.Instead, he spends his money on expanding the company, playing guitar, and more recently investing in other start-ups and setting up a new wind-turbine manufacturing company. A serious battle with cancer about 10 years ago made him realise his priorities and that OVHcloud needed to be structured and strengthened so it would outlive him.Klaba’s grandfather was a miner in the north of France after the first world war, but returned home to Poland in 1949. But through his grandfather’s French citizenship, the family was able to relocate to France when Klaba and his brother were teenagers.“We told [our parents] we wanted to go,” said Klaba. “Ever since then I saw it as my role to make sure that the family did not end up poor in France. To take care of everyone.” Klaba did not speak much French when the family arrived in Roubaix, but developed an interest in the internet, and in the servers underpinning networks, at engineering school in Lille.That hobby would lead him to create OVH (the name stands for “on vous héberge”, French for “we host you”) which stored and operated web pages for its clients. As the company grew, the whole family joined the business. Klaba’s father helped invent OVH’s in-house server technology that became key to their low-cost model since it used water to cool its processors instead of more expensive air conditioning. His mother handled finance and administration.The family took no outside investment until 2016 when it sold a 20 per cent stake to private equity funds KKR and Tower Brook for €250m.“What I am trying to prove with OVH is that there is another model that is more European that puts entrepreneurs and families at the centre of the ecosystem,” said Klaba, referring to how he had eschewed venture capital and expanded more slowly than a US start-up. “In ours, the entrepreneurs keep control instead of being at the mercy of investors or financial pressures.”Klaba got a helping hand early on from none other than Niel, who rented the young entrepreneur some space in a building he owned in Paris for his growing banks of servers. Klaba was so dedicated that he used to sleep next to his equipment some nights, Niel recalled.“Given his unusual life story, what he has done is impressive,” said Niel. “He came from nowhere to build a great company that will be a European leader in cloud computing.”Today, OVHcloud is trying to crack the market for so-called public cloud computing services, which is growing at roughly 25 per cent a year and is dominated by US players including Google, Amazon and Microsoft.So far it has lacked the scale and financial clout to compete directly with them in this segment — it estimates that it has 1 per cent market share in Europe, compared with 66 per cent for the US groups.But its position is stronger in “private cloud services” where equipment such as servers are used exclusively by one business or organisation as opposed to shared, as in public clouds. OVH estimates that this market represents sales of €8bn to €13bn a year globally, and is growing at 15 to 20 per cent a year. In Europe, it estimates that it holds about 10 to 15 per cent market share, on a par with its main competitor IBM Cloud.OVHcloud also still earns one-quarter of its revenues from web hosting, where it has a leading position in Europe.Many in political circles in Paris and Brussels are rooting for OVHcloud to succeed because they worry that European sovereignty and economic competitiveness could be at risk if companies and governments are forced to rely solely on US cloud providers.Klaba has ably used such concerns to advocate for OVH as a safer alternative because its servers outside the US are not subject to search warrants from US law enforcement and intelligence agencies, although some experts and lawyers question that claim.“OVHcloud is the only European company that has a chance of resisting the dominance of the US tech giants,” said Cedric O, France’s junior minister for digital affairs. “It is a very important actor in European tech, and it’s telling that Octave has built it on his own without any help.”
228  “Until a year and a half ago, we would have been in the presence of the tallest edifice in Africa — until the construction of the Grand Mosque Algiers [265m],” notes Mustapha Sellam, site director at Masen, the publicly funded company that runs the complex, during a visit.But the primary motivation for the country’s push towards renewables, which began in 2009, was not so much to build record-breaking structures, as to reduce the kingdom’s reliance on oil and gas imports. Its oil-rich neighbour, Algeria, cut diplomatic relations on August 24, citing “hostile actions”. While the north African rivals have very few economic links, this rift could result in the severing of a gas pipeline that delivers natural gas to Spain and Portugal via 500km of Moroccan land, and gives Morocco 7 per cent of the gas as a transit fee. The contract is set to expire on October 31.This latest diplomatic spat marks a deterioration of already frosty relations between the two countries: tensions over the Western Sahara were reignited in December when former US president Donald Trump recognised Morocco’s claim over the contested territory. Algeria, meanwhile, backs and hosts Polisario, the movement demanding independence for the territory.The economic interests in Morocco and the European interests in the stability of Morocco trump everything elseWashington’s move was a triumph for Morocco and part of a quid pro quo deal that required the normalisation of its diplomatic relations with Israel. This has also raised hopes — especially on the Moroccan side — for a possible economic exchange with Israel, says Riccardo Fabiani, project director of north Africa at International Crisis Group.Following the US decision, however, which is in violation of international law, Morocco expected others to follow suit. This “led to a sense of emboldenment” and what Irene Fernández-Molina, lecturer in international relations at the University of Exeter, describes as “miscalculations” from Morocco.While 23 mostly African countries have opened consulates in the Western Sahara since 2019, according to the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, European countries — in particular Spain and Germany — have not shown a readiness to follow suit.In the wake of Trump’s move, the Spanish foreign minister Arancha González Laya reaffirmed Spain’s position in support of a UN-brokered solution involving both sides. Then relations worsened further when Spain allowed Polisario leader Brahim Ghali into the country for medical treatment.Similarly, Germany took a critical stance on the US’s move and called a UN Security Council meeting to discuss the matter. In March, Morocco cut contact with the German embassy in Rabat and recalled its own ambassador from Berlin in May over “antagonistic activism” on the Western Sahara issue.For now, all German partnerships are on pause, including €300m pledged by Masen for a green hydrogen project. Another of Masen’s stations is located in the Western Sahara region of Laayoune.Pandemic exposes vulnerabilities in Moroccan economyMorocco’s carmaking prowess a result of shrewd state planningCritics flag opposition weakness in Morocco’s new parliamentMorocco tourism struggles despite vaccine progressMoroccan lenders shore up small businesses but risks loomCasablanca financial hub’s fortunes tied to national economic strategyClean energy dividend evades Moroccan citizensAnalysts suggest all sides are trying to mend relations. “Overall, the economic interests in Morocco and the European interests in the stability of Morocco trump everything else,” says Fabiani.European countries were recently given a reminder of their reliance on Morocco to ensure stability and control migration when a record 6,000 migrants — including 1,500 minors — were able to cross its border into Spain’s Ceuta enclave on a single day in May.Relations with European countries are still positive, though. Moroccan and European representatives opted for a measured response to a EU court decision in September that ruled against the legality of trade and fishing activity in the Western Sahara under EU-Morocco agreements. That decision disputes the validity of the EU’s previous legal workaround in which it claimed to have the “consent” of the Sahrawi population.“We remain fully mobilised to continue full co-operation between the EU and Morocco,” said Josep Borrell, EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, in a joint statement with Nasser Bourita, Morocco’s minister of foreign affairs.There is a two-month period for lodging an appeal against the ruling. “They [Morocco and the EU] are avoiding a high-level diplomatic crisis like the one declared by Morocco in 2016,” says Fernández-Molina. “But it is a precarious situation and there needs to be a change in the [EU’s] approach since they can’t use the same creative solution as last time.”
229  The price of US crude oil hit a fresh seven-year high on Monday on fears that fuel demand was recovering faster from last year’s economic slowdown than producers could bring supply to the market.West Texas Intermediate, the US crude benchmark, hit a high of more than $82 a barrel, its highest level since 2014, before pulling back to $80.46, up 1.4 per cent for the day.Oil prices have climbed more than 16 per cent since the start of September, encouraged by a global economic rebound and a shortage of natural gas that has increased demand for other energy sources.The rally hit a brief speed bump last week when Jennifer Granholm, US energy secretary, told the Financial Times that the Biden administration was considering tapping into the nation’s strategic stockpiles to help ease surging fuel prices.American consumers are paying more for fuel at the pump than they have since 2014, a political liability for an administration that has seen its popularity drop.However, price rises resumed after the Department of Energy added on Thursday that there was no plan to release government-held supply “at this time”, reviving worries of tight supplies that have continued into this week.“The market is gripped by fears — fear of stronger demand, fear of a rally contagion from gas and power, fear of missing out on the rally, and the fear to rule them all: supply anxiety,” said Roger Diwan, an oil analyst at consultancy IHS Markit.The price moves contributed to a mixed day for US and European stock markets.The boost to energy stocks was initially enough to lift the entire S&P 500, overriding concerns about the affect of inflation and supply shortages on the wider market ahead of third-quarter earnings season. However, the blue-chip index fell back into the red as the oil price gave up some of its earlier gains, and closed down 0.7 per cent.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.6 per cent.The energy- and mining-heavy FTSE 100 index enjoyed the biggest boost among big markets in Europe, rising 0.7 per cent, while the broader region-wide Stoxx 600 inched up 0.1 per cent.Rising energy prices have exacerbated concerns that recent high inflation rates will not be transitory, increasing the likelihood of interest rate rises and leading to an increase of the yields demanded by investors in government bonds, which rise when prices fall.Yields on Germany’s benchmark 10-year Bund and Britain’s 10-year gilt each rose 0.03 percentage points on Monday, to negative 0.12 per cent and 1.19 per cent respectively. The gilt yield briefly hit 1.2 per cent for the first time since May 2019.“The bond market is very focused on the UK as they look likely to raise [interest] rates quite rapidly,” said Anne Beaudu, global fixed income portfolio manager at Amundi.US Treasury bond markets were closed for the Columbus Day holiday.Economists polled by Reuters expect data published on Wednesday to show US consumer prices rose 5.3 per cent in September from the same time last year, marking the fourth consecutive month that headline inflation in the world’s largest economy has topped 5 per cent.Prolonged inflation has piled pressure on the Federal Reserve, which has already signalled it is ready to wind down its $120bn a month of pandemic-response bond purchases, to raise US borrowing costs from record lows.“This creates an environment that is ripe for monetary policy mistakes,” said Gregory Peters, head of multi-sector and strategy at bond investor PGIM.“The costs of petrol and heating and all the things plaguing global supply chains are exogenous factors that central banks have nothing to do with.”Financial markets, Peters added, had priced in economic stagflation that could be caused by rate increases quashing growth as central banks potentially “turned dogmatic”.In energy marks on Monday, European gas contracts for November delivery stood at €83.75 per megawatt hour, about double the level they traded at in mid-August. Brent crude, the main international benchmark, topped $83 a barrel on Monday.
230  The UK has doubled down on its demand for root and branch reform of the Brexit deal that governs trading arrangements for Northern Ireland, including removing oversight by the EU’s top court.Despite both the European Commission and the Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney saying that removing the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice was impossible, Downing Street on Monday insisted the demand was “central” to its bid to renegotiate the deal.The two sides are now on a collision course over the Northern Ireland protocol in the withdrawal agreement, which has poisoned relations between the UK and the EU since it came into force last January.Lord David Frost, the UK’s Brexit minister, is due to use a speech in Lisbon on Tuesday to warn that unless the EU agrees to rewrite the protocol it will further destabilise Northern Ireland and wider trade relations between the two sides.The speech will lay down a marker to Brussels ahead of the publication on Wednesday of a European Commission paper setting out proposals to reduce customs and regulatory checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland that were mandated by the protocol.The British government has said repeatedly that, in hindsight, the arrangements which Boris Johnson agreed with the EU in 2019 to avoid the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland are unsustainable. This is because they created an internal trade border in the UK, in the Irish Sea, under the supervision of a foreign court, it has added.“It’s simply not sustainable for the EU to make laws that apply in Northern Ireland without democratic scrutiny,” said Downing Street, adding that removing ECJ oversight of Northern Ireland’s trading arrangements was “core to what we think needs to be addressed”.However, the commission has ruled out removing ECJ jurisdiction, arguing that it is fundamental to the withdrawal agreement, which places Northern Ireland within the EU single market for goods.“The EU single market is an ecosystem of standardised rules that ensures trade between member states, it ensures a level playing field,” said a commission spokesman on Monday. “There are reasons behind [the ECJ role].”The 27 EU member states, which will be briefed on the commission proposals to ease customs and regulatory checks on Tuesday, generally back Brussels’ stance.Downing Street’s position, and the commission’s response, fuelled expectations that the two sides would not reach a compromise. One UK government insider said: “The view among many in Downing Street is that the [Northern Ireland] protocol has to go entirely, tweaks won’t do it. Everyone is quite hardline about it.”Tensions have been rising sharply between the UK and the EU over the protocol in recent weeks.EU diplomats have warned that if the UK unilaterally suspends elements of the protocol, the bloc could take retaliatory measures, including ultimately imposing punitive tariffs on British products such as cars and fish.Coveney said the EU’s patience was running thin and questioned whether Frost, by demanding the impossible, was serious about brokering a compromise over the practical implementation of the protocol.“At some point in time the EU will say ‘Enough, we cannot compromise any more’ . . . I think we’re very close to that point now,” Coveney told RTE radio.But British officials have countered that removing ECJ oversight of the protocol could open the door to innovative solutions that take account of Northern Ireland’s unique political situation.The UK has warned the Brexit deal has caused sufficient negative economic, social and political impacts in the region to justify unilaterally suspending parts of the protocol, using procedures set out in Article 16.Northern Ireland’s unionist political parties have called on Johnson to trigger Article 16 and suspend the protocol, and have also boycotted ministerial meetings with their Irish counterparts in protest at it.The Democratic Unionist party, the largest political group in the region’s devolved government, repeated the call on Tuesday after the High Court in Belfast ruled that the ministerial boycott was illegal.“The High Court judgment is further proof that the conditions to trigger Article 16 have been met,” said a DUP spokesman.Additional reporting by Sebastian Payne in London
231  Moldova is requesting emergency gas supplies from EU countries after Russian state-controlled exporter Gazprom slashed its shipments to the country amid a wider European gas crunch.The former Soviet state of 2.6m people is seeking a deal to supply more gas via Romania to alleviate shortages and surging prices after a supply contract ran out last month, according to two people involved in the talks. Officials are unwilling to agree to new terms with Gazprom at a significantly higher price.Supply to Moldova, wedged between Romania and Ukraine, has fallen by around one-third while prices have shot up from $550 per thousand cubic meters last month to $790 this month — nearly five times the average that the country paid last year.The prices are “not justified and not realistic for Moldova,” deputy prime minister Andrei Spinu said on Monday.Spinu said Moldova was negotiating with Gazprom over a new contract but was also exploring “alternative ways to supply gas” from Russia, Romania, Ukraine and other EU countries.Moldova, caught in a tussle for influence between Moscow and the west, elected Maia Sandu, a staunchly pro-EU president, last year. Her party won a landslide victory in July’s parliamentary elections.“The amounts of gas involved are very small for a company of Gazprom’s size, but they are significant for Moldova,” said Aura Sabadus at market information service, ICIS.“The most plausible explanation for their action is that Moldova has a pro-EU president and government and Russia is happy to use this situation to pressure the country.”The shortage comes as Europe wrestles with skyrocketing gas prices blamed on strong demand globally and an unwillingness by Gazprom to provide additional supplies to the European market beyond those secured through long-term contracts.Moldovan government officials are in talks with EU counterparts seeking to arrange emergency gas shipments from neighbouring Romania, but Bucharest is also struggling to cover its own needs amid broader fears over low storage levels across Europe.Moldova has long been susceptible to over-reliance on Moscow, its former imperial and Soviet capital. It relies entirely on a pipeline from Russia through Ukraine for its gas needs, although a gas connector with Romania will start to operate this year after construction finished last week.Moscow has also regularly imposed trade embargoes on Moldovan exports, such as wine, while Russian troops are the de facto security guarantors for Transnistria, an unrecognised breakaway state on the country’s eastern border with Ukraine.The International Energy Agency has said it believes Russia could send 15 per cent more gas to Europe to help cool prices.But Russia’s ambassador to the EU told the FT that Europe’s best way to avoid gas supply shocks was to mend relations with Moscow, while denying that Gazprom had played any role in the current crisis.The Kremlin has blamed the European Commission for forcing Gazprom into shifting sales from long-term contracts on to freely traded market sales, where prices can fluctuate.ICIS’s Sabadus said Ukraine had offered Gazprom capacity to ship the gas into Moldova, using capacity that had previously been earmarked for shipments to Hungary. Those flows were recently diverted to another pipeline.“The Moldovans quite rightly say there’s daily capacity, there’s plenty of flexibility if Gazprom wants to supply them the full amount,” Sabadus said.Gazprom did not respond to a request for comment.Additional reporting by Marton Dunai in Budapest
232  Russia is often represented as a bear. The surge in natural gas prices suggests a bull might be a better emblem. Gas is a key Russian export and the EU has been running short of it. Soaring prices reflect low European inventory and high Asian demand. This gives Russia political leverage it is keen to exploit.The EU has only itself to blame. The bloc has increased its gas dependency on Russia over the past decade despite US warnings against doing so. At the same time, limited US export capacity for liquefied natural gas means it cannot plug the supply gap.The EU depends on Russia for 41 per cent of its imported gas. The UK has little direct reliance but is as sensitive to price squeezes as any nation. Both have ignored the role natural gas should play as a transitional fuel for decarbonisation, advocated by pundits including Lex. One result in the UK has been a rundown in gas storage by two-thirds in the past decade, down towards four-five days of winter demand.Normally, US LNG would cushion against price shocks. Last year, US gas accounted for 12 per cent of UK imports. This year, US LNG terminals are already running at 95 per cent of capacity, says Rystad Energy, thanks to brisk Asian demand. That is despite US natural gas prices close to $6 per 1,000 cubic feet, perhaps a fifth of the UK level.Russia, for all its talk, is constrained by the need to fill domestic storage before serving foreign customers. State-owned gas producer Gazprom is at near full effective capacity, says Ron Smith at brokers BCS, producing at 1.4bn cubic metres daily.Next week Russia will announce its November gas shipments. Then we will see how badly it yearns to sell more gas to Europe, as Citi points out.That could take some heat out of UK near-term prices. These have hit £2.96 a therm, equivalent to $232 a barrel of oil. The UK sources nearly half of its gas from the very mature UK Continental Shelf, according to government data.The gas price spike is dealing apt punishment to EU and UK politicians for their short-sightedness. They can atone by writing energy transition plans featuring natural gas as a transitional and reserve fuel, supplied by the US eagle as well as the Russian bear. That should make the latter pull in those bullish horns it has grown.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Please tell us what you think of Russia and the gas crisis in the comments section below.
233  The co-leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has announced he is standing down, after losing a long-running power struggle with hardliners in the party.In a letter to AfD members on Monday, Jörg Meuthen, 60, who is also a member of the European Parliament, said he would not be running again for party leader at internal elections in December.Meuthen, a former economics professor, has been co-leader of the AfD since the summer of 2015 and represented its more moderate face.But he was increasingly at odds with other senior figures in the AfD, such as Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla, leaders of the party’s parliamentary group, who are backed by influential hardliners, particularly in eastern Germany.In his letter to party members, Meuthen described an “incredibly demanding time” as leader that had been marked by “some hardships and disappointments”. He vowed, however, “neither to fall silent nor to stop my political work”, without specifying what that might be.Tensions and divisions have riven the AfD for years. Meuthen led a long-running campaign against “The Wing”, a hard-right movement within the party that was formed in 2015, and he was behind a successful attempt to expel one of The Wing’s most prominent members, Andreas Kalbitz, from the AfD in 2020.The Wing, which was classified by Germany’s domestic intelligence agency as a rightwing extremist organisation in 2020 and formally placed under observation, was dissolved by the AfD executive board that same year. But another of its founders, Björn Höcke, head of the AfD in the central state of Thuringia, remains an influential force.The AfD began as a Eurosceptic party but used anxiety over the 2015 influx of hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers, mostly from war-torn Syria, to ride a populist wave into parliament. It became the Bundestag’s largest opposition party.But its fortunes waned amid shifting public concerns during the coronavirus pandemic and its very public divisions. Its regional branches in Thuringia, Saxony, and several other states are under local surveillance by the domestic intelligence agency.The party attempted to latch on to protest movements against the coronavirus lockdown as well as vaccine sceptic groups. It failed to leverage that alignment into better results in last month’s national elections, where its share of the vote fell to 10.3 per cent from 12.5 per cent in 2017.The election outcome led to a very public split between Meuthen on the one hand and Weidel and Chrupalla on the other. At a press conference after the vote, Meuthen pointed to the nationwide results as proof of the need for a more moderate course, using the moment to skewer his more rightwing rivals and argue the party had “significant acceptance problems” with mainstream voters.Weidel and Chrupalla said they were satisfied by the results, arguing they were being misrepresented in the media. Weidel argued the media “juiced the Greens to the top”. The Greens came in third with 14.8 per cent, after the centre-left Social Democrats in first and Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats in second.Yet one aspect of last month’s elections suggest the party could continue to drift further to the right.The best AfD results were in Thuringia, where it garnered more votes than any other party for the first time — 24 per cent. The AfD also came out top in Saxony, with 24.3 per cent.Hardline party figures see the electoral results as proof that Meuthen’s approach failed. They argued that they adopted the more moderate style he called for in the campaign, using softer speaking voices in stump speeches and less aggressive campaign posters under the slogan “Germany. But normal.”Meuthen is not the first AfD leader to step aside over similar disputes. In 2017, the then party leader Frauke Petry stepped down immediately after the Bundestag election, also over concerns that it was not distancing itself enough from hardline nationalists.
234  Hello from Brussels. Last week there was a “what happened next?” moment in a story we wrote about last year. We noted the long reach of a World Trade Organization ruling in constraining the takeover of an English football club, Newcastle United, by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. The problem was a WTO ruling won by Qatar against Saudi Arabia on intellectual property grounds because it blocked legitimate broadcasts from the Qatari TV channel beIN in the kingdom while allowing a pirated version. By breaking the law, this might have caused the Saudis to fail the Premier League’s Owners’ and Directors’ Test for football club ownership. In the event, while the WTO case technically remains open, Saudi Arabia has allowed beIN to broadcast.Whatever guff the Premier League says about receiving assurances that the Saudi government won’t control the club, it was that settlement that opened the way for the takeover. So, at least Saudi Arabia’s adherence to WTO rules on IP is up to scratch. This leaves only the question of whether it’s OK to have a jewel of civic pride and emblem of national culture in effect owned by a dictatorship, which has beheaded people for sorcery, whose agents murdered and dismembered an inconvenient journalist and created a humanitarian disaster by bombing desperately poor countries into the ground, to which the answer is apparently yes.Today’s main piece is on the deal on global minimum corporate taxes agreed at the OECD last week, its impact on trade disputes and the virtue of expedient fudge.Charted waters looks at the state of global growth and the trade-related reasons for the latest slowdown.So we have an agreement on corporate tax. More knowledgeable people than us reckon this is a bit of a fudge. Determined lobbying from Ireland ensured that the 15 per cent agreed minimum rate could not rise higher, and developing countries say they will still miss out on revenues. But, still, it’s good news for trade. For one, at the margin, as we argued before, it might have a medium-term collateral benefit in encouraging more efficient trade by removing distorting incentives for locating manufacturing in low-tax jurisdictions. A more immediate gain is defusing the row over digital services taxes (DSTs), which are now on hold for at least two years while the US administration tries to get the deal through the US Congress.Avoiding a DST-based trade dispute is, let’s be clear, a Very Good Thing. The Trump administration’s sudden threat of Section 301 tariffs against the EU was a Bob Lighthizer special, blindsiding other US government departments. (Lighthizer, incidentally, continues to spout ripe nonsense about how great tariffs are even after his retirement as Trump’s USTR — hats off to him for real determination and stamina in the cause of persistently being wrong.)The DST dispute also had the potential to escalate to something pretty nasty. It was largely in response to the Section 301 threat that the EU’s in-house legal-weaponry design studio came up with the idea of the “anti-coercion instrument”, which would allow Brussels to retaliate immediately against a trade restriction it considered an illegitimate attempt to infringe its policy sovereignty. Even if the tax deal itself isn’t all that, managing to keep a lid on another trade row definitely counts as a win.We’ve had a few of these patching-up operations in recent years and we’ve probably got another one coming. The latest was this June when, during a visit to Brussels by President Joe Biden, his team suddenly proposed a surprise solution to the 17-year Airbus-Boeing subsidy dispute. The essence: let’s just assert everything has been resolved and agree to stop clobbering each other with WTO-authorised countermeasures. Recognising a higher cause than worrying about each other’s aircraft subsidies, namely worrying about China’s, the EU agreed. Does anyone think the EU will really get rid of launch aid for Airbus? No. But at least the Scotch whisky industry won’t be collateral damage from aircraft disputes any more, at least not for a while.Going back a few years, an even more epic fudge was the 2018 deal the then European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker sold to Donald Trump to forestall threatened US tariffs on European cars. Trump, apparently utterly bamboozled, agreed not to impose levies in return for meaningless promises from the EU to buy more US soyabeans and liquefied natural gas, together with the promise of a broader bilateral deal to cut industrial tariffs. Said deal, which would have violated the EU’s own policies and WTO rules had it ever happened, never actually did. Cynical on Juncker’s part, yes, but it worked.There’s a similar exercise in what we might euphemistically call transatlantic pragmatism under way right now. Brussels and Washington are trying to fix the Trump-legacy Section 232 national security tariffs on steel and aluminium ahead of an early December deadline for the EU to double its retaliatory levies. Will the Section 232s just be lifted entirely as the EU wants? No. Will they remain in place unchanged? Most likely also no. There will be a fuzzy deal involving some kind of quota-ish arrangement with an indeterminate degree of formality, a bit of a monitoring system, a bit of this and a bit of that: hey, look over there! It will allow in a judicious amount of European exports to the US but nothing dramatic, steering a course between alienating US labour unions, inflaming European steelmakers and inviting WTO litigation from aggrieved third countries.We at Trade Secrets have traditionally been all sniffily purist about deals like this and say things must be done comprehensively and by the book, adherence to the rule of law is tremendously important, intellectual coherence and multilateral principles are vital, that kind of thing. But quite often we think a day in which the world’s big trading powers aren’t actually shouting abuse at each other is a good day. Do the deal. Take the trade truce and run. It’s probably the best we’re going to get.The global growth revival that’s occurred since the middle of 2020 has slowed, according to the Brookings-FT Tracking Index.Reasons for the slowdown include supply shortages and weaknesses in the economies of the world’s biggest exporter, China, and importer, the US. Claire JonesThe FT has a must-read interview with the Kremlin’s ambassador to the EU in which Vladimir Chizov has called on Europe to mend ties with Moscow in order to avoid future gas shortages.Divisions over the fate of IMF head Kristalina Georgieva following accusations of bias towards China will dominate this week’s annual IMF-World Bank meetings.The UK and EU are edging closer to a trade war as the UK continues to pretend not to understand a deal it signed and said was a great success.

235  Good morning — or as the Russian ambassador to the EU would put it, do svidanya.EU governments may be looking for joint purchasing and other solutions to the ongoing energy crisis, but in an interview with the FT, Kremlin’s envoy Vladimir Chizov suggests another fix: stop treating Russia as an adversary (just a friendly piece of advice, nothing more).We will unpack what the European Commission is likely to put forward later this week and why the energy proposals won’t go as far as some southern member states would like.Also taking place this week: the annual meeting of the IMF, expected to be dominated by divisions between the US and Europe over whether Kristalina Georgieva should stay on as managing director.In Brexit news, the drumbeat of a possible trade war over the Northern Ireland protocol is getting louder, with things coming to a head as soon as this week.Following a surprise result in its parliamentary elections over the weekend, the Czech Republic now joins the ranks of Germany and the Netherlands in complex government coalition talks. We’ll look at prime minister Andrej Babis’s miscalculations and what this result means for the central European country.And as a deadline for the Trump-era tariffs on European steel and aluminium producers approaches, we’re exploring the views of the industry on both sides of the Atlantic on how they see the way forward.Brussels will step up its response to Europe’s energy crisis this week after facing a chorus of calls from governments to help protect consumers from rising electricity prices, writes Mehreen Khan in Brussels.On Wednesday, the European Commission will publish a long-awaited “toolbox” of measures that national governments can take to protect consumers from record natural gas prices. They will include proposing measures like cutting VAT and levies on electricity bills, providing targeted financial support in the form of cheques to the poorest households, and offering long-term regulated tariffs for the most vulnerable.The response is unlikely to satisfy demands from countries in the south and east who think the EU needs to revamp its internal energy market to sever the link between the cost of gas and electricity.But such radical measures do not have overwhelming support among northern countries or commission officials. EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson told the FT last week that the bloc’s energy pricing rules were not responsible for the crisis.One area where Brussels is ready to come up with creative solutions is joint procurement and storage for natural gas.The commission will begin to explore ways to set up a platform for buying gas and a strategic reserve for common storage to be tapped in times of peak demand. The idea will be raised at an EU summit in Brussels in two weeks and is likely to generate interest and opposition.Greece, Spain and France are among countries asking Brussels to step in to regulate the stocks of natural gas. But previous attempts to build such reserves have been beset by technical difficulties and there are big questions over the time and expense involved in setting up shared storage capacity.The commission’s analysis suggests that the electricity crisis should abate by the early months of 2022. The question of whether a temporary price surge should prompt sweeping changes to the EU’s energy pricing system has yet to be resolved.As if the gas supply crunch weren’t enough bad news, electricity production from wind turbines has fallen by as much as 15 per cent on average in some places this year, according to data compiled by Vortex, an independent weather modelling group. The cause of the trend is uncertain, but one possible explanation is a decrease in average surface wind speed owing to climate change. (More here)In the run-up to last weekend’s Czech parliamentary election, most polls suggested that the Ano party of billionaire prime minister Andrej Babis was on course to claim first place, writes James Shotter in Prague.Instead it was the three-party rightwing Together coalition that emerged victorious, in a result that puts its leader Petr Fiala, a bespectacled political scientist, in pole position to be the country’s next prime minister.Babis’s ally, president Milos Zeman, could yet — health permitting — give Babis the first shot at forming a new government. But between them, Together and a centrist coalition consisting of the Pirate party and the Mayors and Independents now control 108 of the 200 seats in the Czech parliament, meaning that Babis’s chances of success are very limited.However, building a five-party coalition is likely to be a time-consuming process, and it could prove unstable.Part of the reason for Together’s success was a campaign that gathered pace as the election campaign wore on. But analysts say that the party also benefited from miscalculations from Babis.The prime minister identified the Pirates as his main enemy, and spent much of the campaign firing outlandish salvos in their direction. At one point he claimed that they wanted to force Czechs with big houses to share them with migrants. At another, he claimed they were promoting “ideologically correct ice cream”.Yet although the Pirates did end up with a poor result, rather than going to Babis, their voters went to Together, said Jiri Pehe, a political analyst who runs New York University’s academic centre in Prague. “If you look at opinion polls in the long run, you can see that Together and PirStan were forecast to win about 42 per cent between them,” he said. “And if you look at their results, they got what polls were predicting six months ago, but rather than Pirates in the lead, it was Together.”Babis’s other miscalculation, said Pehe, was not doing enough to ensure that the two parties that had propped up his government for the last four years — the Social Democrats and the Communists — made it into parliament again. Both failed to do so, leaving Babis bereft of possible partners.“Instead of cultivating them, he basically sucked all life out of them and took all of their voters,” said Pehe. “That’s why he still got 27 per cent. But those two parties suffered as a result.”As the deadline for a deal to end US tariffs on EU steel and aluminium draws closer, the industry has come up with its own solution: gang up together against China, writes Andy Bounds in Brussels.China accounts for 45 per cent of world steel production and was the only big producer to increase output during 2020, when the pandemic shut down large parts of the global economy.“In light of the worsening global excess capacity, for the steel sector in general — not only in the US and the EU — it is important to start considering some sort of stabilisation mechanism”, Eurofer, the European industry group, told Europe Express. The group is pushing for the Commission to introduce a monitoring system on Chinese imports to limit volumes. And it wants the US to follow suit.Industry groups representing aluminium producers on both sides of the Atlantic are already on board.Gerd Götz, director-general of European Aluminium, said in a statement backed by the Aluminum Association, its US counterpart, that joining forces globally to “effectively tackle China’s unfair trade practices” is the only way forward.The US tariffs on European steel “are a clear example of how China’s market distortions impact all regions of the world”, Götz said.The problem for Brussels is that there are business voices shouting just as loudly on the other side, for smoother trade with China, a provider of cheap components and free-spending consumers.Meanwhile, officials in Brussels and Washington are haggling over how to roll back the US tariffs imposed by former president Donald Trump in 2018.The EU agreed its own retaliatory tariffs against other US goods but suspended their application until December 1, in a sign of goodwill towards US president Joe Biden. EU officials say a deal needs to happen a month before the deadline to ensure the retaliatory tariffs are not imposed.Both the European and US aluminium trade groups have made a joint call for a gradual reduction over three years to a complete phaseout of those tariffs.Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU executive vice-president in charge of trade policy, has hinted he is willing to accept a US proposal for a monitoring system to replace tariffs.The EU would agree to restricting exports to the US at a certain level. Both sides could claim a victory: tariffs would end but the US is effectively imposing quotas instead without being rude enough to say so publicly. Washington has done similar deals with Brazil and Mexico.The big question is what the import level would be. Eurofer, which represents the steel industry, wants to get as close to the pre-tariffs level as possible. (Since 2018, annual US finished steel imports from the EU have decreased by more than 6m tonnes to about 14m).Over at the commission, Dombrovskis is keen to end the spat and could settle for less than the industry wants. However any deal will still need to appease steelmaking countries such as Germany, France and Italy . . and later this week
236  If you live in continental Europe or the UK the natural gas that heats your home this October is costing at least five times more than it did a year ago. The reasons are varied: among them are earthquakes in the Netherlands, China’s attempt to clean up its air and Russian president Vladimir Putin’s power politics.But the impact is clear. The record prices being paid by suppliers in Europe and shortfalls in gas supply across the continent have stoked fears of an energy crisis should the weather be even marginally colder than normal. Households are already facing steeper bills while some energy intensive industries have started to slow production, denting the optimism around the post-pandemic economic recovery.And while some in the gas industry believe the price surge is a temporary phenomenon, caused by economic dislocations owing to coronavirus, many others say it highlights a structural weakness in a continent that has become too reliant on imported gas.“Europe principally has two options for additional gas supplies as it is so heavily reliant on imports: Russia or cargoes of liquefied natural gas,” says Tom Marzec-Manser at ICIS, a consultancy. “Neither of those sources have worked as Europe might hope during this crisis.”The transition to cleaner energy such as wind and solar has had the effect of pushing up demand for gas — often viewed by the industry as a medium-term “bridging fuel” between the eras of hydrocarbons and renewables. But the long-term target of creating net zero economies in the UK and Europe has also sapped investors’ willingness to put money into developing supplies of a fossil fuel they believe could be largely obsolete in 30 years. Meanwhile, Europe’s domestic gas supplies, run low by decades of rapid development, have declined by 30 per cent in the past decade.Europe’s attempts to be a global leader on climate change have arguably fed into the wider changes in the market. They have pushed the fast-growing economies of Asia to move away from coal, only to find that countries such as China and India are now rivals for the same supplies of LNG that Europe has come to rely on from countries such as the US and Qatar.The gas industry used to operate almost entirely on point-to-point pipelines that kept regional competition to a minimum. The rapid growth of the LNG industry means seaborne cargoes have now created something more akin to a global market similar to oil.“Every year China connects up to 15m homes in its coastal cities to the gas grid — that’s like adding a Netherlands and a Belgium worth of demand every year,” says Henning Gloystein at Eurasia Group, a consultancy. “So when it gets cold in China the gas price goes up in the UK and Germany.”European governments argue that “volatile” gas prices reinforce the need to accelerate towards renewable energy. But there are concerns that the problems could trigger a backlash against renewables if consumers start to believe the price of the energy transition is too high.“Some people are trying to portray this as the first crisis of the energy transition,” says Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency, which advises governments and is largely funded by OECD nations. “They would be wrong, but if this is the dominant voice coming from this situation it may become a barrier to the policies we need to enact to make the energy transition work.”The world’s oil consumption remains relatively stable throughout the year with only small fluctuations between the seasons. Gas demand, however, is far stronger each winter owing to its role in domestic heating.While there is a baseload of gas demand all year from electricity generation and industry, such as fertiliser and steel producers, the winter peaks can be far higher across the northern hemisphere. About 40 per cent of total gas consumption in the UK goes directly to heating homes, largely condensed into a period of five-six months.The industry manages these cycles in various ways. The chief one is storage — pumping gas underground during the low-demand summer months that can then be called on when the weather turns cold. The other is access to swing supplies that can rise or reduce as needed. One of the big problems the UK and Europe faces, however, is that the main sources of these supplies are not working as they once did, creating the conditions for more volatile gas prices.Europe’s largest gasfield, Groningen, in the Netherlands, was designed to be a significant swing supplier, with production boosted or suppressed to help balance supply with demand, allowing other gasfields to produce freely all year round. But Groningen has become a liability for the Dutch government. As its huge supplies slowly depleted, small earthquakes were triggered in the surrounding area, causing damage to homes and businesses.As political pressure mounted, the decision was taken to begin shutting it down, with the field now pumping three quarters less than in 2018. “It takes away one source of flexibility,” says Laurent Ruseckas, Emea executive director of gas and renewables at IHS Markit.The UK faces similar issues. It has much lower storage capacity than most countries in Europe — a legacy of being energy independent in the heyday of North Sea supplies — a position that has been worsened by the shutdown of the Rough storage facility, off the east coast of England, three years ago. That decision cut the UK’s storage capacity from 15 days of winter demand to at most five.The good news for Europe is that it has more LNG import capacity than any other region. The UK imported almost 20 per cent of its gas in 2019 through LNG shipments, alongside pipeline flows from Norway and the EU to offset declines in domestic production. The bad news, however, is that, Asian gas demand has grown so rapidly — expanding by 50 per cent over the past decade, led by a tripling in consumption in China — that LNG cargoes have become much harder to secure in 2021. What was supposed to be a reliable source of flexible supplies suddenly appears a lot less so.For instance, the UK government no longer names Qatar, one of the two largest LNG exporters, as a main supplier. The majority of Qatar’s cargoes sail east, where buyers have been paying a premium to attract shipments.“LNG will remain tight,” says James Huckstepp, Emea gas analyst at S&P Global Platts. “So it will come down to industry cutting demand to balance the market if it’s a cold winter.”Arguably the most important factor in all of this is Russia. Continental Europe gets more than a third of its total gas supplies from Gazprom, Russia’s state-backed monopoly pipeline supplier. It is a relationship that has developed over decades, but has more recently been poisoned by the fallout from Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.The EU is often characterised by critics as vulnerable to its reliance on Russian gas supplies. But the relationship is more complex. The EU initially pushed for a Russian shift away from long-term contracts linked to oil prices, a move that indirectly created a pricing system more reflective of gas market dynamics.However, Gazprom’s reliability has been called into question this year. A long 2020-21 winter meant storage facilities in both Russia and continental Europe have been drained to low levels. And Gazprom has done little to help Europe refill, declining to ship additional supplies via Ukraine beyond what had been secured under long-term contracts.Ukraine and other countries in eastern Europe have accused Russia of trying to “weaponise” gas supplies, partly to pressure Berlin to accelerate the approval of the politically controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will bypass Ukraine to deliver supplies direct to Germany through the Baltic Sea.In September, Putin derided “smart Alecs” in the European Commission for pushing for market-based pricing, suggesting they were at fault for the surge in prices now threatening European economies. “The Russian view is the EU asked for this world,” says one senior western trading executive. “Now they’re welcome to enjoy it.”The gas industry is fiercely divided over whether Russia is playing games with supplies. In one camp analysts argue that Moscow has had to prioritise filling its own storage facilities and that domestic consumption has risen in recent years, leaving it with less gas to export.Others suspect that while there are elements of truth in Russia facing challenges in boosting supplies to Europe, there has also been a degree of opportunism on Gazprom’s part — both to raise the gas price and to further Moscow’s political ambitions. They believe these stretch from sealing approval for NS2 to reminding Europe not to neglect fossil fuel producers in its rush to decarbonise. The IEA said last week it believed Russia could send roughly 15 per cent more gas to Europe this year.“Either Russia is playing games because of NS2 or they don’t have enough gas,” says Eurasia Group’s Gloystein. “[Either way] you can’t rely on them.”It means Europe’s three main sources of swing supplies have become a lot more precarious all at the same time.Marzec-Manser at ICIS says that while LNG supplies should increase in the coming years as more projects come on stream, consumers need to brace for a period of higher energy costs. “At least until the summer of 2023 we should assume wholesale prices are not going to fall back to the levels of the pre-Covid years,” he adds.Europe may face even more long-term competition for gas supplies. Russia started supplying China with gas through the Power of Siberia pipeline two years ago, but it is fed by fields that have never been used to supply Europe. Gazprom is now studying construction of Power of Siberia 2, a pipeline that would connect the fields in western Siberia — which do supply Europe — to China by 2030.Ruseckas at IHS Markit says this would give Russia the option of “where to send the gas on a month-to-month basis”, potentially creating more uncertainty around supplies to Europe.“Put yourself in Russia’s shoes,” adds Ruseckas, “I think they valued this role of being Europe’s main supplier and thought they should be respected. But if Europe is to decarbonise, ‘why should we keep being Mr Nice Guy?’”Despite the short-term boost to cash flows and share prices, the wider gas industry has not uniformly welcomed record prices. “This is not ‘good for gas’ that prices are so high,” says Paddy Blewer at the International Gas Union, an industry body.The industry concern is that although it still hopes to act as a bridge fuel during the energy transition, recent price rises have left it besieged on all sides. Gas executives point to the US, where the shale industry has sharply reduced coal consumption, leading to a steep drop in emissions, and record carbon prices in the UK and Europe, which have the potential to do the same.The gas industry has been criticised for being disingenuous. While it produces about half the CO2 of coal when burnt, methane emissions — an even more potent greenhouse gas — are released during extraction and transportation and have come under growing scrutiny. French power company Engie backed out of a US LNG deal this year, reportedly under pressure from the French government over methane concerns.“Energy needs to be affordable, reliable and clean and the gas industry is struggling on all three fronts right now,” Gloystein says.The hope is that if the industry tackles methane emissions, as many companies have pledged to, it can still play a role. But the International Gas Union wants governments to think harder about policies — from drilling restrictions in the US to licensing delays in the UK — they believe have damaged the industry’s ability to keep the world well supplied.“Governments have attacked the supply side while executing policies that actually boost demand for gas, like higher carbon prices,” Blewer says. “We want to cut emissions but electrification hasn’t moved fast enough to say we don’t need hydrocarbons any more, so the role gas can play should be recognised.“But gas developments take many years and billions of dollars so require investors to feel confident they will get repaid,” adds Blewer.For now, policymakers are largely left hoping that Russia follows through on hints that it could increase gas supplies this winter, or that the weather will be mild.In the longer term, cutting demand and finding alternatives is critical. Some analysts have drawn comparisons with the 1970s Arab oil embargoes. They spiked prices but triggered an energy efficiency drive and the development of resources in regions like the North Sea and Alaska, ushering in almost two decades of relatively cheap oil.Whether renewable developments will have the same capacity to stabilise global energy prices if gas supplies stay tight remains untested.Birol has urged governments to stay the course and to use this moment to solidify plans to decarbonise quickly, even if they need to find ways to cushion voters from the full extent of the gas price rise this year.“I cannot predict how long or how harsh this winter will be,” the IEA chief says. “But I do know that after winter, spring will come and clean energy transitions will continue.”
237  The writer, Morgan Stanley Investment Management’s chief global strategist, is author of ‘The Ten Rules of Successful Nations’Much has been written about how Angela Merkel is about to become the joint longest-serving German leader since Bismarck, but even that underplays her achievement. Come the new year she will have served a little over 16 consecutive years, longer than any leader of a major, advanced democracy since the 19th century, but for one, Tage Erlander of Sweden.Merkel has defied the normal evolution of power, which is that leaders grow stale with years in office and leave on a low. Those who endure tend to grow arrogant or complacent over time, and get caught in scandal or are overtaken by events. Most lose momentum and support, usually well before their first decade is up.Going back to 1900 in the 20 largest advanced democracies (by gross domestic product), only 31 leaders lasted 10 years or more, and the giants among them succumbed to stale leader syndrome with regularity. When Charles de Gaulle left the presidency in 1969, surveys showed most voters thought him too old, self-centred and authoritarian. François Mitterrand served longer than any French leader since Napoleon III but stepped down in 1995 “reviled by some, tolerated by others, loved by a few”. Jacques Chirac admitted at the end that he had lost touch with young voters and was pushed out by a protégé in his own party.Franklin D Roosevelt died in office months before allied victory in Europe, widely adored as a war hero but loathed by critics as a dangerous socialist. Fears that his unprecedented four terms had raised the threat of an imperial presidency led quickly to term limits on his successors. Even so, of the 14 US presidents since FDR, 11 saw their approval ratings fall over the course of their administrations.Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair both secured multiple terms in Britain but left office with abysmal approval ratings, under 25 per cent. Thatcher over-reached, pushing a regressive poll tax that gave Tory rivals an excuse to force her out.Germany was, before Merkel, an even clearer illustration of how leaders exhaust their welcome. Konrad Adenauer, who presided over the postwar “economic miracle”, was nudged out after 14 years by rivals emboldened by his government’s abuse of power in the “Spiegel affair”. Helmut Kohl, who oversaw German reunification, grew increasingly imperious, sought an unprecedented fifth term, and lost badly. In the end, wrote Ralph Waldo Emerson, every hero becomes a bore.This tendency is more pronounced in developing nations, where checks on power are weaker. Suharto and Mahathir Mohamad were feted, respectively, as the fathers of development in Indonesia and Malaysia; both held power for decades but left amid gathering protests and charges of cronyism. China’s Deng Xiaoping, arguably the most important economic reformer of the 20th century, lost key titles after about 10 years in power following the Tiananmen Square protests.Leaders who retired with reputations intact — like Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore or Erlander, who served 23 years as Sweden’s prime minister after the second world war — were exceptions who prove the rule.The past is often better remembered than it was lived. Many rulers gain in popularity only after they are dead, when their nations are looking for new or at least reimagined heroes. Merkel, still Germany’s most popular politician, breaks the mould at a difficult time.Politics is increasingly polarised. The pandemic is undermining support for leaders in many major democracies; Merkel is one of only two with an approval rating over 50 per cent. The other, Mario Draghi of Italy, is just eight months into office. Had Merkel run for a fifth term, she likely would have won, succeeding where Kohl failed.Her own party has not turned on her. Rather than vilify Merkel, the main opposition leader ran and won as her true heir, pragmatic and steady. No scandal trails her name. Merkel’s most controversial move, opening German doors to refugees in 2015, was also her boldest reform. She will leave Germany far richer, relative to its closest rivals in Britain and France, than she found it.The consistent knock against Merkel is that she was a bore from the start, a timid reformer who left a long to-do list, from energy supply to digital competitiveness. But sins of policy omission should not overshadow the human tendencies she rose above: pride, greed, sloth. Power corrupts and time erodes but neither had much effect on Merkel. Go back more than a century and it’s rare to find any major leader who ruled so long but went out on such a high.
238  A frank intervention in the European parliament last month captured the frustrations that are blunting the EU’s attempts to curb the powers of Big Tech.Last year, the EU unveiled a radical blueprint for tech regulation that would put onerous responsibilities on the likes of Google, Facebook and Amazon to clean up their platforms and ensure fair competition.But since then, the package of measures has become bogged down in the European parliament, and now risks being watered down and heavily delayed.There are even fears in Brussels that the new rules will not be in place before Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition and digital policy chief, leaves her post in three years.“It sounded like we had agreed but that is not the case . . . at all. We are a long way from having a common position on this,” Evelyne Gebhardt, a German MEP, said in exasperation during last month’s debate.The slow progress also gives Big Tech more time to fully capture key sectors of the economy. “If we wait too long some markets will not be able to be repaired any more. This is about protecting consumers and small companies in Europe. We need to get this done as soon as possible,” said one person directly involved in the parliamentary debate.The two proposed bills are the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which is designed to force the so-called gatekeepers, such as Google, to ensure a level playing field on their vast online platforms, and the Digital Services Act (DSA), which clarifies the responsibilities of Big Tech for keeping illegal content off their services.But the package has split MEPs along a number of fronts.The biggest fight is over which companies should be captured by the regulation. Andreas Schwab, the lead MEP representing the powerful EPP Group in the parliament, has been pushing for the legislation to focus only on the largest platforms. But his rivals want the legislation to be wider in scope and target a number of digital services.“If the threshold is too low, it would also capture a number of traditional companies. But this law is not for the general economy but it is specifically to target digital gatekeepers that are shutting down markets,” Schwab told the Financial Times.Under his proposals, only companies with a market value in excess of €80bn would fall under the new laws. Schwab also wants to target solely the core digital services of each company, for example, targeting only Google’s search and advertising business.But the Socialists & Democrats (S&D), the second-largest political group in the European parliament, want to include other types of digital services, such as video streaming, music streaming, mobile payments and cloud services.“If we only go after five companies this won’t fix the problem,” said the Dutch MEP Paul Tang, who said companies worth more than €50bn should be regulated, a threshold that would also capture the Netherlands-based Booking.com, Germany’s SAP and Airbnb.“I fear new gatekeepers will rise instantly once you have dealt with Google and the rest. We need the legislation to be future proof,” Tang said. “We have waited more than 20 years to reform the rules of the internet and so we will need to make it strong enough for the upcoming 20 years.”He also said his party believed the legislation should go after those platforms that offer more than one service because “otherwise Big Tech will know how to bypass the laws with their army of expensive lawyers and this will be a missed opportunity”.Schwab, who has been quite vocal against Google’s business model, said too broad a focus would water down the EU’s ability to tackle the biggest problems. “We risk having a law that wants to cover everything and achieves nothing. If this happens, it will be a great win for Google and other big tech companies,” he said.The impasse will not be easily solved. “Everyone has a hard position and nobody is willing to move and compromise,” said a person involved in the debate.Some remain hopeful that a solution will emerge before EU states, the European Commission and the parliament gather for talks early next year, and before France, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU in 2022, heads into presidential elections in April. A meeting last week between all political parties aimed to bridge some of the gaps.Separately, MEPs are also fighting over the obligations large platforms should be submitted to. In line with the commission’s proposals, Schwab wants users to give consent over whether their data can be combined across services, for example between Google’s Gmail and YouTube. The socialists want this practice banned.The S&D is also pushing for the new rules to force Big Tech to prove that acquisitions of small businesses are not harming the market or block them from buying smaller rivals, a measure that Schwab considers too extreme. It also wants a ban on the controversial practice of targeting users with ads, but Schwab opposes this.Meanwhile, EU states are also vying to influence the outcome of the process. France wants individual states to have more power to fine big tech companies if they do not clean up their platforms. Ireland and Luxembourg, where several big tech companies are based, prefer the status quo.Under the current rules, only countries where large tech groups are headquartered have the power to impose onerous fines and force platforms to remove illegal content.“This is the main fight on the DSA that risks derailing it,” said one person with knowledge of the negotiations.
239  Brussels is preparing a sweeping overhaul of the regime that allows foreign banks to use lightly regulated branches to operate across the EU, in a move that could push up costs for the industry.The European Commission is working on proposals to empower financial regulators to force banks to turn some of their European branches into subsidiaries, if the branches’ activities are deemed sufficiently large and risky, according to people familiar with the plans.The rules aim to crack down on thinly supervised non-EU banks that are expanding rapidly in Europe — a trend accelerated by Brexit as financial institutions from Asia, the US and other markets broaden their activities in the single market.The European Central Bank, which has been supervising Europe’s biggest banks since 2014, has grown increasingly concerned that the branches system allows some foreign banks to continue escaping ECB oversight by doing much of their business in the bloc via lightly supervised branches.However, the proposals could cost the industry billions of euros since capital and liquidity requirements for branches are largely far lower than those imposed on subsidiaries, which typically have to meet the same rules as standalone banks.European officials believe the changes would bring EU rules on foreign banks closer to those already in place in the US and the UK. However, bankers and their lobbyists warn the proposed rules could prompt them to back away from some activities and could also trigger retaliation in other countries which allow large European banks to use branches to carry out their operations.In a speech last month, Edouard Fernandez-Bollo, a board member at the ECB’s supervisory arm, said it was “particularly important” to take this opportunity “to increase harmonisation in this area”. European branches of non-EU banks had assets of €510bn at the end of 2020, up €120bn on a year earlier.Details of new proposals, being overseen by financial services commissioner Mairead McGuinness, are still being debated within the commission. They are part of the EU’s next package of banking legislation which mostly centres on giving legal basis to the Basel III global banking capital standards. The Commission is due to publish the draft legislation on October 27 after which it will be finalised by the European Parliament and Council.The rules are expected to apply to EU branches with at least €30bn of assets, although the threshold is still being debated in the commission and could change. Financial supervisors would have to regularly review the situation of the non-EU banks’ branches and decide whether turning them into subsidiaries would make sense.The proposals also provide for increased co-operation between banking supervisors for smaller less complex branches, closer oversight, and minimum harmonisation of the capital and liquidity requirements for branches directly owned by non-EU banks.An executive at one large US bank said he was “concerned about being caught by a proposal that was to address bad apples, and becoming collateral damage”. An executive at another said that even if it was unlikely that his bank’s branches would be turned into subsidiaries, it could still change the way the bank operated because it would have to be prepared for the possibility.The lobby group Association of Financial Markets in Europe said “It would not be appropriate to require subsidiarisation without a full understanding of the reasons for doing so and whether it was likely to result in adverse effects for customers and financial stability more widely”.The commission said the proposals “will meet our international commitments to implement the Basel III standards, but adjustments to those will be made to reflect the specificities of the EU economy and banking sector.”Commissioner McGuinness said last month that the overall package will address remaining flaws in the framework for bank regulation without leading to a “significant increase” in overall capital requirements.
240  While modern travel dictates a little less formality and a lot less luggage, I share my father’s (and his travel companion’s) view that one must always look smart. Travel light and always travel unrumpled — it just makes you feel better. A healthy mind in a well-pressed outfit. Hotel laundries are an essential tool for the traveller wanting to follow this maxim — they are as important structurally as the perfect wheelie bag or the right adapter plug. And, rather like a hotel restaurant, a hotel’s laundry service can be either a grim necessity or a reason in itself to stay there. There is a bewildering variety in these laundry services. At its most extreme, the laundry can be a place for saying goodbye to one’s clothes. Once, at a hotel in Maputo, I found myself having to share my socks and underpants with a colleague, an incident of enforced and excessive office bonding. In some parts of the tropics, I have found my precisely cut Turnbull & Asser collars refashioned into something better suited to Fun in Acapulco than to the solemn meeting I had come to attend. Then there are those hotels whose laundries imbue one’s clothes with a “nose”, no doubt due to the proximity to the hotel’s kitchens, or even subject one to passive smoking — laundry as a health hazard. And inevitably, every visit to the laundry seems to engender a minor ecological disaster: three yards of slippery plastic wrapping for every one of Sea Island cotton.A good hotel laundry needs to understand one’s clothes, listen to instructions (amount of starch, sharpness of crease, etc), and be reliable and punctual. Luckily, most good hotels manage this.Every now and then, however, one comes across a laundry service that is so good as to lift one’s mood, make one love life despite one’s jet lag. Two hotels stand out for their laundry services: the Palace Hotel in Tokyo and Le Bristol in Paris. Each elevates the act of cleaning clothes into one of sartorial ablution. It is hard to describe just what happens to one’s shirts at the Tokyo Palace Hotel. No matter how old and tired they may be when one arrives, a few hours later they are returned as if they had just spent three weeks on Lake Constance. It’s all in the starch, I think — pure corn starch, generously applied but also incredibly light, giving the cloth volume, hold and smoothness but never stiffness. The collars and the cuffs also seem to undergo a rebirth, rekindling the three-way love affair between shirt, tie and cufflinks. At the Palace, laundry is returned wrapped in lightly, yet precisely, folded Japanese paper loosely fastened with a ribbon. (The paper also lends itself perfectly to packing.) I must admit to, once, having saved a Palace-laundered shirt for a special occasion at home. The Tokyo Palace laundry is also a very Japanese phenomenon. When I asked the hotel about its laundry service, I was told that, “to have a request for laundry means that we are trusted to jump into the guest’s very personal and private space (and some Japanese guests hesitate to use the laundry service), so we take full care to respond to the trust that the guest has given us”.In Europe, Le Bristol in Paris does laundry best. Always immaculate, with buttons replaced and repairs effected; the sense of personal and thoughtful attention which pervades every aspect of the hotel tangible in its laundry service as well. Entrusting one’s clothes to Le Bristol’s immaculate (and perfectly starched) housekeeping staff is a profoundly reassuring experience: here is my beloved garment, I know you will treat it as if were your own. Le Bristol achieves this level of service by having its very own in-house laundry beneath the hotel (sometimes glimpsed from the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré) run with the precision of a grand kitchen. As Aurélie Martin, the hotel’s head of rooms, explained, the laundry employs no less than nine people: six teinturiers to take care of the different items received and three “runners” who work on the preparation and delivery of the cleaned garments. Here too, the beautifully finished laundry reappears shrouded not in plastic but in tissue paper.New York hotel laundry, in my experience, is never memorable. Perhaps that is because, when I stay at The Carlyle or The Sherry-Netherland, I am charmed by the residential feel of the Upper East Side and so cannot resist the temptation of the multitude of independent (and also reasonably priced) laundries. I almost feel like a local when settling into the twilight luxury of Bemelmans Bar wearing a shirt fresh from the nearby family laundry.The pleasure of hotel laundry need not be reserved for travel, however, as I recently found out when visiting my very dependable local dry cleaners, Mayfair Cobblers and Laundry Service in White Horse Street, just off Piccadilly, in London. There, to my delight, I saw all manner of clothing from local clubs and hotels — gold-braided uniforms, striped trousers, shirts and dresses — tidily hanging and awaiting collection. For a moment I was able to dream of being on the road again.Illustrations by Agathe Bray-BourretHave we left anywhere out?

241  Matteo Dell’Acqua never thought Italy’s rebound from Covid would be this good.The 31-year-old boss of a family business says his investment in digitalisation and more environmentally friendly products made during the pandemic is paying off and has contributed to a 20 per cent annual increase in orders.“It’s going very well,” said Dell’Acqua, whose company in Lombardy —Italy’s initial Covid epicentre — makes plastic pipes and tubing. The company is “sailing through” the post-pandemic phase, he says, thanks to “a positive atmosphere generated by the sudden and unexpected recovery”.Italy, the first European country affected by the pandemic, is now changing gear in its recovery after a widespread vaccination programme, robust investment and expanding exports.“Italy’s economic outlook is far better than we expected in the spring,” said Mario Draghi, Italy’s prime minister, last month. He expects the country to grow 6 per cent this year, in line with the OECD and international private forecasters, and much stronger than the 4.5 per cent expected in April.Italy’s economic growth had the biggest upgrade of any other G7 country over the past five months, according to Consensus Economics, which averages leading economists’ forecasts.It is a marked change for a country that has suffered years of economic stagnation, dragging living standards below the EU average. Economists hope it could be a springboard for longer-lasting changes, with an ambitious programme of EU-funded reforms and public spending getting under way.“For the first time in many decades, Italy is in such a favourable position,” Laurence Boone, chief economist at the OECD, told the Financial Times. She pointed to Italy starting to tackle well-known brakes on growth such as a sclerotic civil justice system and public administration and its ineffective competition laws. “Italy today is in the position of resetting its economy.”Draghi, the former president of the European Central Bank, has put much of the improved outlook this year down to his government’s vaccination campaign. Italy’s proportion of fully vaccinated people is the second-largest among G7 countries, after it made a Covid “green pass” mandatory for almost all workers and access to most public venues.Draghi said this had allowed the reopening of businesses without a spike in hospitalisation, boosting consumer confidence and spending. Household consumption rose by a strong 5.5 per cent in the second quarter.Nicola Nobile, economist at Oxford Economics, expects Italy’s economy to have expanded by about 2.5 per cent in the third quarter, following an above expectation 2.7 per cent rebound in the previous quarter.Other factors are also at play in the recovery, said Emma Marcegaglia, chair of the B20 international business summit, a G20 business forum.Investment is “booming”, said Marcegaglia, thanks to government-supported incentives for energy efficiency improvements and purchases of machinery and equipment, as well as more investor confidence in Draghi’s government after years of political instability.Many businesses have also stepped up digital investments to adapt to the pandemic — helping Italy, which lagged behind EU peers on readiness for ecommerce, to make up ground. Italy’s investment was 5 per cent above pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter, stronger than a marginal contraction in Germany and a 4.5 per cent drop in the UK.Exports are also supporting the post-pandemic rebound, with Italy less affected than some countries by supply chain disruption thanks to lower reliance on semiconductor imports, according to some analysts. In the first seven months of the year, the value of Italy’s goods exports was up 4 per cent compared with the same period in 2019, better than stagnation for Germany and a contraction for France.Manufacturers have proved agile in adapting to changing national and international restrictions, said Marcegaglia.The green and digital transition could continue at a much faster pace if Italy gets the €205bn from the EUs “Next Generation” recovery plan that has been promised if key reforms and targets are achieved.This is by far the biggest commitment by the EU to a member state and would be Italy’s largest support package since the Marshall plan after the second world war. Italy has already received an instalment of €25bn.The OECD expects Italy’s economic output to return to pre-pandemic levels by early 2022, quicker than in previous estimates and much faster than the recovery in earlier recessions — although later than in most advanced economies. Before the pandemic, output had not recovered to levels of more than a decade earlier.Italy’s government is certainly bullish. It expects strong growth to continue until at least 2024, reducing the country’s high public debt of more than 150 per cent of gross domestic product and the above EU average unemployment rate of over 9 per cent.Nobile argues that “ambitious reform agendas typically face enormous political hurdles in Italy” and that official growth forecasts could be “too optimistic”. Political stability is also a threat to the reforms and spending plan.“Good as all this modernisation may sound, Italy’s fractured political system has often meant that reforms started by one government get reversed or abandoned by the next one,” said Nick Andrews, economist at the investment research company Gavekal Research.Meanwhile, there are shorter term concerns. Italy is already worried by Europe’s soaring energy prices and is to spend €4bn to subsidise bills. A protracted crisis could lower the pace of the recovery. Weakening demand following prolonged supply chain disruption and slowing Chinese economic growth create extra headwinds for the country and the global economy.But Italy’s business and consumer optimism remain at a near-decade high. “Of course, we have to be cautious and continue to monitor critical factors such as the cost of raw materials and transport,” Dell’Acqua said, “but at the moment we have the wind in our sails”.
242  The Kremlin’s ambassador to the EU has called on Europe to mend ties with Moscow in order to avoid future gas shortages, but insisted that Russia had nothing to do with the recent jump in prices.Vladimir Chizhov, Russia’s permanent representative to the EU, said he expected Gazprom, the state-controlled exporter that supplies 35 per cent of European gas needs, to respond swiftly to instructions from president Vladimir Putin to adjust output.Action, which would help curb skyrocketing wholesale prices, was likely to come “sooner rather than later,” he said. Putin “gave some advice to Gazprom, to be more flexible. And something makes me think that Gazprom will listen,” Chizhov told the Financial Times.While rejecting assertions from European lawmakers that Russia had played a role in Europe’s gas crunch, Chizhov said Europe’s choice to treat Moscow as a geopolitical “adversary” had not helped.“The crux of the matter is only a matter of phraseology,” he said. “Change adversary to partner and things get resolved easier . . . when the EU finds enough political will to do this, they will know where to find us.” Natural gas prices in Europe have been surging, raising fears of a winter fuel crisis and putting the economic recovery in jeopardy.At one point last week spot gas prices reached nearly 10 times their level from the beginning of the year, before abruptly dropping after Putin hinted that Gazprom might increase supplies.Chizhov insisted Moscow had no interest in gas price surges. “This does not promote stability,” he said. “People will start looking around, turning back from gas to coal, which some are already doing.”Record high prices and low reserves have spooked EU governments fearful of a winter shortage and led to demands from some member states for Brussels to consider emergency remedies or new reforms. But energy commissioner Kadri Simson told the FT last week that the roots of the crisis were “not created here in Europe”.Cold winters in Europe and Asia drained gas in storage while the economic rebound from the pandemic has pushed up demand and lower wind speeds in Europe this summer have reduced renewable energy generation.Russian officials have said that regulatory approval to permit gas flows through the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany would help solve the crisis. Some analysts have suggested Moscow is exacerbating the price squeeze to force such an outcome. The US and many eastern EU states oppose the pipeline, which they say was designed to circumvent gas transit through Ukraine.Chizhov said the EU’s own energy policies had worsened the bloc’s woes as well as a reluctance among European energy companies to pay more to replenish their reserves. “All the problems that are arising have been created artificially. Primarily for political reasons,” he said.However, Klaus-Dieter Maubach, chief executive of German gas company Uniper, a Gazprom client, suggested last week that supplies were the issue. Uniper “would be happy if Gazprom . . . delivered more volumes to cool down the situation and lower the gas price,” he said at a conference in Russia.Chizhov also said the crisis had been aggravated by EU regulations that force Gazprom to supply a proportion of gas to Europe on the freely-traded spot market terms, rather than through long-term contracts, which Brussels has argued are uncompetitive.“Long-term contracts . . . provided security of supply and stability of volumes and prices. Then came this idea, emanating from Brussels, that the system should be changed,” he said. “We know that market rules may be helpful in some situations but quite unhelpful in others. Things can change. And they did change.”Gazprom is fulfilling its obligations to European customers on long-term supply contracts, but has been reluctant to make additional volumes available on the spot market, instead supplying domestic Russian storage facilities. Chizhov said that was because European energy companies were delaying extra purchases in the hope that prices will fall.“If prices are freely floated on the market, of course any energy company in this part of Europe will think what the best moment is to order additional volumes,” he said. “The serious buyers know perfectly well what is going on . . . they have their own calculations.”But Chizhov said he believed the commission, whose flagship renewable energy reform initiative aims for the bloc to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, was “underestimating the future role of gas” as a European energy source.“Until mankind finds a way to store energy in a sizeable manner, all those propellers and solar panels will not become a decisive factor,” he said.This article has been amended since first publication to correct the spelling of Vladimir Chizhov.
243  Tens of thousands of Poles rallied to show their support for EU membership on Sunday evening, days after a ruling by the country’s constitutional court that inflamed tensions between Warsaw and Brussels.Donald Tusk, leader of the main opposition Civic Platform party, called the protests in response to the ruling, which said that parts of EU law were incompatible with the Polish constitution and sparked questions over whether the country could one day leave the bloc in a so-called “Polexit”.In the capital Warsaw, thousands of people gathered in the square in front of the Royal Palace in the city’s old town, waving EU and Polish flags, holding placards with slogans such as: “I was born in [communist Poland]. I prefer to die in the EU,” and chanting: “We are staying.”“I came here because I don’t want Poland to be outside the EU. I remember what communism looked like and I don’t want Poland to go back to that again,” said Miroslaw from Warsaw, holding a Polish flag. “Being here is what being a patriot means to me.”Demonstrations also took place in many other Polish cities, including Poznan, Krakow, Katowice, Gdansk and Lublin. In Warsaw, nationalists held a smaller counterdemonstration and attempted to drown out pro-EU speakers in front of the Royal Palace.The ruling by the constitutional tribunal last Thursday brought to a head years of tensions between Warsaw and Brussels, which have been building since the conservative-nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS) embarked on a series of reforms that give politicians sweeping powers over judges.The EU’s top court has ordered Poland to reverse several aspects of the overhaul, including an attempt to purge the Supreme Court, and a new disciplinary regime that allows judges to be punished for the content of their rulings.However, PiS insists that the EU has no right to intervene in its judicial reforms, which it argues are a purely domestic matter and necessary to overhaul a lumbering and inefficient system.Earlier this year Mateusz Morawiecki, the prime minister, asked the constitutional tribunal, which has been filled with government loyalists, to rule on whether provisions of EU law being used in the dispute conflicted with the Polish constitution.The tribunal’s ruling that there was a conflict has sent shockwaves through the EU and sparked questions in both Poland and other EU capitals over whether the central European nation, once seen as the big success of the bloc’s 2004 eastern expansion, could one day leave.PiS politicians dismiss the idea that they want to leave the EU as nonsense designed to undermine the party in the eyes of the more than 80 per cent of Poles who want to remain within the bloc.“There will be no Polexit. That is a propaganda invention which has been used against us many times,” PiS’s leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, said last month. “We want to be in the EU. But at the same time, we want to remain a sovereign state.”However, critics say that even if the party does not set out to leave the EU, it could end up setting in train a dynamic that eventually leads to a Polish withdrawal, much as David Cameron’s attempts to renegotiate the UK’s relationship with the EU when he was British prime minister culminated in Brexit.“We need to show the government that there is a limit to them destroying the country,” said Maria Kaminska, a 42-year-old who joined the protest in Warsaw. “I am more and more ashamed of this country. I feel European, I believe in western values. I feel part of the European community and I want to stay there.”
244  Thursday’s ruling by a top Polish court that elements of EU law are incompatible with Poland’s constitution poses a bigger challenge to the EU’s unity than Brexit. The Polish constitutional tribunal judgment is a direct attack on the EU’s legal order, which is the cement holding the EU together. The UK withdrew from the EU; Poland is asserting its constitutional independence while staying inside. It is corroding the union’s integrity from within.The tribunal’s ruling is the culmination of a five-year campaign by Poland’s nationalist conservative government to exert political control over the country’s judiciary. It reduced the retirement age for supreme court justices, to remove those it regarded as disloyal. It created a disciplinary regime to ensure judges reached the decisions it wanted and stopped invoking EU law to challenge the Polish authorities. It previously broke the law to stack the constitutional tribunal that produced Thursday’s bombshell judgment with government loyalists.The government’s campaign is first and foremost an attack on Poland’s institutions and constitution. It was only when the European Commission took legal action against Poland’s failure to comply with the fundamental value of judicial independence that Warsaw turned against the EU.True, Poland’s tribunal is not the only one to question the supremacy of EU law. Germany’s constitutional court last year ruled that the European Court of Justice had acted beyond its powers when it endorsed bond-buying by the European Central Bank. The German court, too, overstepped the mark.But the German ruling was fundamentally different. It was a proper legal case considered by an independent court; the Polish one was a politically-inspired intervention by Mateusz Morawiecki, Poland’s prime minister. The German court also has a long history of challenging ECJ judgments for not protecting fundamental rights enshrined in the German basic law; in the Polish case, it is the government that is abusing the rights of Poles to fair judicial redress. The German court in effect said the ECJ had not done its job properly; the Polish tribunal rejects the notion of supremacy more widely.The tribunal’s ruling is a travesty — as some of its dissenting members argued. Its argument that EU law would force Polish courts to break the Polish constitution is absurd. The EU is trying to get Warsaw to respect its own constitution and ensure judicial independence. The government may yet pull back by not officially publishing the ruling; otherwise it will have to be superseded, set aside or simply ignored, as some Polish judges have already vowed.The EU regrettably has no viable mechanism for expelling a member in serious breach of its rules. The Commission will almost certainly take legal action, threatening large fines if Poland refuses to comply. It must also use its financial leverage to try to pull Warsaw back into line. It is now inconceivable that Brussels would approve Poland’s application for €36bn in pandemic recovery funds. It also has grounds to freeze other payments. Poland is due to receive €121bn in EU development aid by 2027. Taxpayers elsewhere are asking why they should support a country that no longer recognises club rules.Unfortunately, Poles will pay the price for government fanaticism. That could backfire politically against Law and Justice and its allies who seem increasingly out of line with a public that remains strongly pro-European. The government insists it is not seeking Poland’s exit from the EU. A constitutional secession engineered through a partisan court tells a different story.
245  The UK and the EU edged closer to a trade war on Sunday after Brussels rejected London’s demands for a comprehensive rewrite of the Brexit deal’s contentious Northern Ireland protocol.The European Commission reiterated that it would not agree to remove oversight of the protocol by the European Court of Justice, a UK demand that Lord David Frost, the UK Brexit minister, will repeat in a speech on Tuesday.The protocol avoids the need for a land border on the divided island of Ireland — its removal was a key part of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that ended three-decades of sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland — with checks made instead on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.The imposition of controls by the EU on inter-UK goods trade has enraged unionist politicians in Northern Ireland, who said it undermined the region’s position in the UK.Raising the temperature further, Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney took to Twitter to accuse the UK of setting out a new “red line” just days before the EU was set to offer “serious” concessions.“Are we surprised? Real Q: does UKG actually want an agreed way forward or a further breakdown in relations?”Frost responded that the UK’s demand to remove the oversight of the ECJ was “not new”, adding: “We set out our concerns three months ago in our 21 July Command Paper. The problem is that too few people seem to have listened,” he tweeted. His allies said it was “a key ask”, but one added: “We don’t use the expression ‘red line’.”The commission declined to comment on Frost’s demands directly but pointed to a speech on October 7 by Maros Sefcovic, its Brexit chief, in which he ruled out renegotiating the protocol. An official added that the ECJ’s role was a “red line” for Brussels.Sefcovic said in his speech that ECJ oversight came up just once in his meetings last month in Northern Ireland. “I find it hard to see how Northern Ireland would keep access to the single market without oversight from the ECJ,” he told a webinar.On Wednesday, Sefcovic will publish proposals to drop many checks on goods deemed unlikely to leak from Northern Ireland into the EU single market via the Republic of Ireland.But around half the customs and health checks would remain, a situation considered intolerable by the UK government and the Democratic Unionist party, which is part of Northern Ireland’s administration.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, its leader, welcomed the EU’s willingness to negotiate but said it did not go far enough. “We are clear there should be no internal barriers to trade within the United Kingdom and we want to see the removal of barriers to trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and that is our bottom line. For us, the Irish Sea border must go,” he told the FT.He has threatened to pull his ministers out of the Northern Ireland power-sharing executive, another key element of the Good Friday accord, as early as this month unless the protocol is scrapped.Frost wants the protocol to be governed like the later Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the two sides, where disputes are managed collectively and ultimately through international arbitration.However, legal experts believe Frost would run into problems in the domestic courts if he tried to use Article 16 — the override mechanism in the protocol — because the EU refused to end the role of the ECJ.George Peretz, QC at Monckton Chambers, noted that the protocol specifies that Article 16 could only be used where there are “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist, or to diversion of trade”.If it triggered Article 16 over the ECJ, the UK would “face likely defeat in the domestic courts”, he said on Twitter.That could mean the Johnson administration faces either the possibility of a battle in the courts or the need to introduce new legislation, which would potentially run into opposition from the House of Lords.It would also face retaliation from the EU’s 27 member states, who have accused the UK of trying to renege on a deal it signed two years ago.“If the UK chooses a path of confrontation and triggers Article 16, the consequences will be far reaching and felt throughout the UK,” an EU diplomat warned. “It is very disturbing that the UK still does not do enough to implement the agreement and pretends not to have known the consequences of an agreement it wanted, negotiated, signed and ratified in the first place. Friends and allies don’t treat each other like that.”Letter in response to this article:Northern Ireland protocol breaches Good Friday deal / From Ben Habib, London SW1, UK
246  Czech president Milos Zeman was rushed to hospital on Sunday, as his poor health threatened to complicate the process of forming a new government a day after the ruling coalition narrowly lost parliamentary elections.Zeman’s doctor, Miroslav Zavoral, said in a statement that the 77-year-old, who suffers from diabetes and has trouble walking, was in intensive care.Zavoral said the president was suffering from complications related to a known condition, but he did not provide further details. Zeman had previously been hospitalised for a few days last month for what his office said was dehydration and exhaustion.Zeman was admitted to the Central Military Hospital in Prague shortly after meeting Prime Minister Andrej Babis, whose centrist Ano party unexpectedly lost Saturday’s parliamentary poll to the rightwing Together coalition.Under the Czech constitution, the president has the right to designate which party gets the first chance to form a new government after an election. If the president is unable to do this, the decision is taken by the Speaker of the lower house of parliament.Zeman said before the election that he would give the first shot at forming a government to the biggest single party, rather than the coalition with the most seats.If Zeman were to stick to that decision, it would mean that Babis would have a chance to try and cling on to power. His Ano party won 27 per cent of the vote, narrowly behind the three-party Together coalition, which garnered 28 per cent.The Together bloc and the centrist PirStan, a second coalition uniting the Pirate party and Mayors and Independents, which came third in Saturday’s poll, have both ruled out co-operating with Babis, citing allegations of conflict of interest relating to the business empire the prime minister built before entering politics.Babis has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.Between them, Together and PirStan won 108 of the 200 seats in parliament, meaning that even if Babis is given the first chance to form a government, he will struggle to succeed unless MPs from Together or PirStan break ranks to join him.“The situation is pretty clear: there is a majority of 108 deputies and the response of the head of state should be to appoint [Together leader] Petr Fiala as prime minister. No other alternative presents itself,” Martin Kupka, an MP from the Together coalition, told CNN Prima TV on Sunday.“The president should abide by constitutional custom and take the necessary steps.”Vit Rakusan, leader of the Mayors and Independents, said on Saturday evening that the two coalitions would work together and that Fiala should be designated the new prime minister. “We will not disappoint. We will stick to what we promised,” he wrote on Twitter.Babis made no statement after leaving his meeting with Zeman on Sunday.He later wrote a brief message to his supporters on Facebook in which he pointed out that despite not winning the election, Ano would be the largest single party in the new parliament.“At first glance, it looks like the project of the five-party coalition to force Babis out of politics has worked. But the coming months with show whether that is the case,” he said.
247  The Czech opposition won a majority of seats in Saturday’s parliamentary elections, giving them a chance to oust billionaire prime minister Andrej Babis.With 99.9 per cent of votes counted, the rightwing Together coalition and the centrist PirStan coalition of the Pirate Party and the Mayors and Independents were on course to win 108 of the parliament’s 200 seats. Babis’s Ano was on course for 72 seats, and the far right SPD was on course for 20.“It was a close election, but this is a huge triumph for the opposition, and in particular Together,” said Milan Nic, senior fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations. “Tonight they got more votes than they were hoping even a few days ago.”Petr Fiala, leader of Together, and Ivan Bartos, leader of the Pirates, both said on Saturday that their groups had a chance to form a government. But how quickly they are able to do so depends on the president, Milos Zeman.Zeman, a close ally of Babis, said before the election that he would give the first chance to form a government to the biggest single party, even if a coalition won more votes.If Zeman sticks to this approach, Babis’s Ano would have a chance to try to remain in power, even though the Together coalition unexpectedly won the most votes, with 27.8 per cent of the vote, putting it narrowly ahead of Ano on 27.1 per cent. But since both Together and PirStan have ruled out working with Babis, his chance of success is slim.“There is a clear majority that would like to govern together,” said Vladimira Dvorakova, a political scientist at the University of Economics in Prague. But the process of forming a government “could be prolonged.”To complicate matters further, the 77-year-old Zeman, who has been ailing for some time, was rushed to hospital after meeting Babis on Sunday. Zeman’s doctor was due to make a statement later on Sunday afternoon.Babis, a combustible billionaire who built up an empire stretching from food to fertilisers before founding Ano in 2011, came into politics pledging to use his experience to run the country like a business and pledging to fight corruption. In office, he has cut income tax and boosted state pensions, earning him the support of many older voters.“My grandparents were in a really bad financial situation and now they are fine, so I can really see a difference,” said David, from Prague, who voted for Ano. “So I am pretty happy with what Babis actually did. Other political parties didn’t do anything in 25 years.”However, for much of his time in power, Babis has been dogged by separate allegations of fraud and conflict of interest. He suffered a further setback this week, when the Pandora Papers leak revealed that he had used offshore companies to buy property in France before entering politics.Babis has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and dismissed the claims as attempts by his political opponents to undermine him.Babis has also come under fire for allowing the state’s debt to rise sharply, albeit from a low level, and for his handling of the pandemic. More than 30,000 Czechs have died, and at one point earlier this year, the country had the highest cumulative death toll in the world in per capita terms.“I am angry with the way Babis has run the country and . . . I believe that this is maybe almost the last chance to get rid of him,” said Martina, an IT worker from Usti nad Labem who voted for Together.“[The handling of the pandemic] was a tragedy on all sides. Babis had four health ministers. The communication was bad. And now the campaign the for vaccination — it’s a tragedy.”The other factor that counted against Babis was the failure of the two parties that have supported his government for the past four years, the Social Democrats and the Communists, to make it into parliament.“There are a lot of votes that finished just below the threshold,” said Nic. “This is one of those elections that were decided at the margins.”
248  For years I have been telling a story about car washes. Why is it that in some countries you are more likely to drive your car through the roller brushes of a giant machine, while in others a group of (often immigrant) men will descend on your car with washcloths?My answer is that when wages are high, employers economise on labour, investing in machinery, digitisation or other steps to get more out of every hour worked. In turn, that allows them to pay those higher wages. In economies where labour is cheap, businesses find it profitable to forgo capital investment and employ enough low-productivity workers to do what machines could otherwise have done.The car wash analogy explains Scandinavia’s combination of high productivity and relative egalitarianism. Rather than a paradox, the high productivity is because wages are high.Since the British Conservative party conference last week, fans of my car-wash parable have asked me what I think of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s new economic message. His government is telling business to stop complaining about worker shortages — such as that of HGV drivers — because ending low-wage immigration will shift the country to a high-wage high-productivity economy. Unusually, Johnson’s deeds are (for now) as good as his words; he has largely resisted calls for substantial emergency visa schemes.So, is the government doing what I have been recommending all along? I am not convinced.Lip service to a high-wage, high-productivity economy is not a true strategy for getting there. A real plan would signal that wage levels will be permanently higher and that businesses must adapt or die. If Conservatives are serious about this, they should steal a march on Labour by committing to an early target of a £15 minimum wage. (That would also monumentally troll the Labour left, which last month picked and lost a fight with party leader Sir Keir Starmer over just this.)The government would also show it understands the most likely way high wages drive productivity. That is not because every business finds previously unexploited sources of productivity, but because those that don’t (typically smaller, less professionalised ones) lose out to those that do (larger, more efficient groups). If this government is steeling itself for a wave of small business bankruptcies, it is not telling us.Nor is there ambition to spend much more on education or sustain aggregate demand so more productive businesses have the long-term confidence to expand. These have been essential to make the strategy of productivity from high wages work in Scandinavia. In sum, it is not at all clear the British government really desires to take the economy down the path to the promised land.There is a strain of Conservative party thinking that does. Forcing productivity increases by raising minimum wages was the secret Scandinavian ingredient of George Osborne’s 2015 Budget. But this is not the 2015 Tory party. For the current lot, the “strategy” smacks of political opportunism, though I would love to be proved wrong.Even if the government really did want to force higher wages on business, the end of EU free movement of labour, and Brexit generally, would be the worst ways to achieve this. Any potential pay-induced productivity gains can be cancelled out by other frictions that leaving the EU creates — such as more red tape for cross-border trade. Global Britain must run just to stand still.Brexit-induced labour shortages may also not even lead to higher wages. The economic evidence is unambiguous that immigration for work exerted at most only a small downward pressure on wages. So ending it should not be expected to push them up.Britain’s low-wage economy is arguably entirely homegrown, a result of domestic policies such as poor labour law enforcement and a big informal economy. After all, some countries avoided a low-wage economy even with free movement. Norway welcomed many more Europeans after eastern Europe joined the EU in 2004 than the UK, and has extended collectively bargained wage floors to exposed sectors, effectively creating sectoral legal minimum pay — including for HGV drivers.In contrast, UK employers’ ability to pay little caused low-productivity sectors to expand — with immigrant labour. With those workers gone, the consequence may be not generalised high wages and high productivity, but that more dispensable sectors — fruit and vegetable exports, hospitality and tourism — simply shrink to give up labour to more essential ones, such as trucking. What happens to car washes is anyone’s guess.martin.sandbu@ft.comLetter in response to this article: A mistaken understanding of how an economy works / From David Sainsbury, London SW1, UK
249  Angela Merkel will go down in history as one of Germany’s most successful chancellors. But for conservatives, her party’s defeat in last month’s national election has become an indelible part of her record.Merkel failed at one of the most basic jobs for a senior politician: keeping her party in power. The September 26 election was supposed to return her Christian Democratic Union to office, this time under Armin Laschet. Instead, Laschet and the party performed disastrously. Many are now faulting Merkel, the CDU’s long-serving figurehead, for neglecting to groom an electable successor and for alienating its core conservative voters.“The CDU is at a low point in its history, and of course people will ask to what extent Merkel, among other reasons, contributed to this,” said Christoph Ploss, a CDU MP and head of the party’s Hamburg branch. “She was, after all, our party’s leader for 18 years.”Others are more damning. “She really neglected the party for years,” said one conservative backbencher. “Look at the state she’s left it in. That’s part of her legacy.”Merkel’s CDU, together with its Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union, took just 24.1 per cent of the vote — nearly 9 percentage points down on 2017. It was a disaster for an alliance that has run Germany for 52 of the past 72 years and sees itself as the natural party of government.The election was won narrowly by the Social Democrats and their candidate, finance minister Olaf Scholz. The SPD has begun talks with the Greens and liberal Free Democrats on forming Germany’s first three-party coalition government since the 1950s.On the day those negotiations began, Laschet, the CDU/CSU candidate for chancellor, yielded to pressure from within his party and signalled he was prepared to step down. If he does, the CDU will face its third leadership election in less than three years.Many blame the CDU/CSU’s poor electoral showing on Laschet, whose approval ratings always lagged far behind those of Scholz, and say the parties should have run instead with the popular Markus Söder, leader of the CSU. “The cardinal error was to have chosen a candidate who didn’t connect with large parts of the electorate, and to do so against the will of the party’s rank-and-file,” said Ploss.It was a decision that Merkel, who has tended to stay out of internal party politics since standing down as leader in 2018, had no hand in.But some senior Christian Democrats have said that Merkel is at least partly responsible for the CDU’s predicament.First, she stepped down as party leader in 2018 but decided to remain as chancellor. It meant that both of her successors as party leader — first Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, then Laschet — struggled to emerge from her shadow.Kramp-Karrenbauer, who was widely seen as Merkel’s favoured heir, lasted little more than a year as leader. Resigning in February 2020, she said she had concluded the two jobs of chancellor and party leader “belong in one hand”. The remark was seen at the time as a criticism of Merkel’s refusal to make way for her in the chancellery.Wolfgang Schäuble, Merkel’s finance minister for eight years and now Bundestag president, echoed that point last month, saying in an interview with Tagesspiegel newspaper that he was “firmly convinced that the two functions [of party leader and chancellor] must be carried out by the same person”.Laschet found himself trying to run in the shadow of “a successful, veteran chancellor”, suggested Schäuble. “He can’t say, ‘we’re going to do everything differently’, but also can’t say ‘we’ll continue as normal’. After 16 years of Angela Merkel as chancellor, that is now a problem for my party.”Merkel’s decision to quit as CDU chair also unleashed a power struggle in the party between its liberal and conservative factions, with both Kramp-Karrenbauer and Laschet — seen as moderates aligned with the chancellor — facing constant sniping from the more rightwing camp. It is a conflict that remains unresolved.Some in the CDU also accuse Merkel of eroding the party’s identity. The Christian Democrats came to dominate the centre of German politics: her governments pursued a modernising agenda, bringing in a minimum wage, abolishing compulsory military service, closing down Germany’s nuclear power stations and introducing gay marriage.In the process, she opened the CDU up to swaths of middle-of-the-road voters. But she alienated conservatives in the party. The anger intensified after her decision to let in hundreds of thousands of Syrian war refugees in 2015, a move that enraged hardliners and led to mass defections of traditionalist voters to the far-right Alternative for Germany.“For years we just enacted social-democratic policies,” said the CDU backbencher. “We lost our profile.”Some even began to wonder whether Merkel had more sympathy with the Greens than with her own party. There was anger when she received the climate activists Greta Thunberg and Luisa Neubauer, head of Fridays for Future, the school strike campaign in Germany, in the chancellery last year.“It’s fair to ask whether Merkel even wanted to be succeeded by someone from the CDU,” said Andreas Rödder, a historian at Mainz university. “Especially after the Greta incident, you can understand why people would have serious doubts about that.”Conservative MPs say that after 16 years of Merkel’s centrist policies, voters did not know what the CDU stood for.“Polls show that we lost on issues that should be our core competence — things like foreign and economic policy,” said Ploss. “The clear takeaway from this election is that the CDU needs to broaden its appeal.”Some are drawing personal conclusions. Kramp-Karrenbauer and economy minister Peter Altmaier announced on Saturday they would not be taking up their Bundestag seats, in order to make way for younger colleagues.“After such a defeat the CDU . . . must renew itself,” Altmaier said. “That was clear to me on election night. And that everyone must start with themselves.”
250  The EU must still make significant changes to the contentious Northern Ireland protocol if the arrangement is to survive, the UK’s Brexit minister will warn this week, pouring cold water on efforts by Brussels to offer concessions.Lord David Frost is due to make the remarks as the EU prepares to offer to scrap many border controls between Northern Ireland and the British mainland in an attempt to de-escalate tension over trade with a part of the UK that effectively remains part of the European single market.EU concessions set out in a commission paper, expected to be approved next week, include allowing the free circulation of many food products across the Irish Sea, reducing the prospect of what some have dubbed a “sausage war”, a situation where chilled meats from Great Britain would be banned from entering Northern Ireland.EU officials say the total number of customs checks could be cut in half.However, the offer falls far short of British requirements that trade with Belfast should be as easy as trade with Birmingham, as well as demands to remove the oversight of the European Court of Justice from the deal.In a speech on Lisbon on Tuesday, Lord Frost is expected to warn: “The EU now needs to show ambition and willingness to tackle the fundamental issues at the heart of the protocol head on. The commission have been too quick to dismiss governance as a side issue. The reality is the opposite.“The role of the European Court of Justice in Northern Ireland and the consequent inability of the UK government to implement the very sensitive arrangements in the protocol in a reasonable way has created a deep imbalance in the way the protocol operates.“Without new arrangements in this area, the protocol will never have the support it needs to survive.”In 2020, Frost agreed to the protocol, which left some EU rules in place in Northern Ireland in order to prevent a hard border with Ireland. Failing to keep an open border risked inflaming community tensions between Protestants and Catholics in the north that had been greatly improved since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.UK officials have threatened to suspend the protocol entirely by invoking Article 16 of the post-Brexit Trade and Cooperation Agreement, unless almost all checks are scrapped.“Tinkering around the edges just won’t work”, an official said. “If the EU can’t show ambition and agree significant changes to the Protocol, we will have to use Article 16 to make sure arrangements are in place that do safeguard the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and the peace process.”The UK warned in July that the threshold for using Article 16 had already been reached, but it was delaying its use in order to find solutions. The EU has for the same reason deferred legal action that it took earlier this year over the UK’s breaching of the terms of the protocol.Once triggered, Article 16 would require a set of talks and, if no deal were reached, potential legal and trade sanctions.Maros Sefcovic, the European Commission vice-president, ruled out removing the ECJ as the ultimate arbiter of the Northern Ireland protocol in a speech last week.
251  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
252  France’s antitrust chief has expressed her “surprise” and “disappointment” at President Emmanuel Macron’s decision not to renew her mandate in the middle of a review of a far-reaching broadcasting merger and several competition cases against US tech giants.Isabelle de Silva, who won plaudits after imposing two penalties against Google for a combined €720m, said she found out last week that she would not be nominated by the French president for a second five-year term, and will therefore leave on October 13. The Elysée has not commented on the decision.“Until a few days ago I was quite confident that I would be renewed although you never have absolute certainty,” she told the Financial Times. “So it came as a bit of a surprise.”“I would have liked to continue, but obviously I respect the decision and hope a new person will continue the work I have started. It is a personal disappointment for me and my team to have to come to terms with.”The decision comes six months before presidential elections, in which Macron is seeking a second term, and at a time when the regulator is reviewing several large national mergers. One of them is the tie-up between TF1, France’s largest broadcaster, and smaller group M6. Tf1 is owned by construction billionaire Martin Bouygues and its 8pm news programme is the most watched with about 6m viewers on average.The new group would control about 70 per cent of the French TV advertising market but the government has signalled it regarded the merger positively.Other large combinations under review include the merger of water and energy utilities Veolia and Suez, as well as that of book publishers Editis, owned by Vincent Bolloré’s Vivendi, and Hachette, controlled by Lagardère.De Silva said that the agency would continue to review the TF1 -M6 case with its in-depth and “serious methodology”, which meant that “there is no possibility that changing the president (of the competition authority) will change the outcome.”She added: “I felt that it was not necessarily a good thing to change to the captain in the midst of such an important and difficult case.”De Silva, a Franco-American lawyer who spent her entire career in the French civil service, was appointed in 2015 by then president François Hollande. She became a prominent advocate for stricter oversight of tech companies and carried out antitrust investigations against Google, Apple and Facebook. In addition to fining Google, she managed to extract a pledge from the search giant to make changes to its advertising business.The competition authority is still working on probes into Apple and Facebook, and De Silva had also worked closely with the European Commission’s antitrust watchdog.More recently she had been building ties with the Biden administration’s new antitrust chief Lina Khan, who is also pushing for more technology regulation. She has been a powerful voice in the discussion of new draft legislation in Brussels set to curb the power of large technology companies.Such international co-operation “must be preserved and built on” if regulators were to effectively oversee big tech companies. “To tackle those digital platforms we need to really come together and work as a team,” she said.The spelling of Lina Khan’s name has been corrected in this article.
253  Brussels is offering to scrap many border controls between Northern Ireland and the British mainland in an attempt to de-escalate tensions with the UK after London threatened to suspend the NI protocol.The concessions include allowing the free circulation of many food products across the Irish Sea, reducing the prospect of a “sausage war”, where British chilled meats would be banned from entering Northern Ireland, which in effect remains part of the bloc’s single market.Until now the European Commission had said it could only drop checks if the UK signs an agreement to align its food rules with the EU’s, which would prohibit it from developing its own food regulations and could restrict trade with non-EU countries.But a commission paper, expected to be approved next week, will suggest that certain British goods such as sausages and bacon could enter the province. They would also cover other food easily identifiable as British, such as Stilton cheese, ending the need for the complicated veterinary forms required for many products. The products would have to be labelled as UK only and not cross the border to Ireland.However, the offer appears to fall far short of British demands that trade with Belfast should be as easy as trade with Birmingham. Food such as a ham sandwich or packet of crisps could still require extensive paperwork, deterring businesses from sending them to Northern Ireland.Lord David Frost, Brexit secretary, has threatened to suspend the Northern Ireland protocol by invoking Article 16 of the post-Brexit Trade and Cooperation Agreement, unless almost all checks are scrapped.The UK government said on Friday: “As we have said before, chilled meats is just one issue out of many that need to be resolved if the protocol is to be put on a sustainable footing . . . Significant changes must be made to the protocol in order to protect the Belfast [Good Friday] Agreement and the peace process.”The commission has already agreed to permit the free circulation of medicines from Great Britain, amending a law that prohibits third countries from licensing medicines used in the single market for the first time. Had Northern Ireland’s NHS had to purchase supplies independently, its costs would have sharply increased.EU officials say the total number of customs checks could be cut in half. The UK has started building a software system that EU customs officers could access in real time.“We have been searching hard for ideas. We want to create the space for a solution,” said one EU official. “We are taking a risk. We need the UK to co-operate with us, for example on access to databases. Any solution will need to protect the single market. The most important thing is peace and stability in Northern Ireland.”Maros Sefcovic, the European Commission vice-president who drew up the package, has worked hard to square other commissioners who fear it could set a precedent for the British to push for further concessions.The 27 member states could yet demand tougher measures.In 2020, Frost agreed to the protocol, which left some EU rules in place in Northern Ireland in order to prevent erecting a border with Ireland, which would have inflamed community tensions between Protestants and Catholics in the north that had been largely tamed since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.Sefcovic warned in a speech this week that he would not meet Frost’s demand to remove the European Court of Justice as the ultimate arbiter of the agreement.
254  “What is really serious,” said Sebastian Kurz as he threw his scandal-plagued far-right coalition partners out of office in 2019, “is the idea of abuse of power, the idea of [misusing] taxpayers’ money, and of course, the [manipulation of] the media landscape in our country.” Barely two years later, the Austrian chancellor is the central suspect in an alleged conspiracy involving the same political malpractice.On Wednesday, police raided ministries across Vienna and the headquarters of Kurz’s conservative People’s Party, triggering a political crisis that has engulfed the Austrian government and now threatens it with collapse.Prosecutors are investigating whether Kurz and a group of allies used fake invoices to illicitly channel €1.2m of taxpayers’ money from the finance ministry to pay for favourable media coverage. Glowing headlines helped propel Kurz, from foreign minister to party leader to the chancellorship itself.No charges have been made in the investigation.But the scope of the suspicions and the evidence that has been made public threaten to bring Kurz’s second term in office to an even more abrupt and controversial halt than his first.Two years ago it was Kurz himself who pulled the plug, after his vice-chancellor, Heinz-Christian Strache, of the Freedom Party, was filmed soliciting Russian influence in the Austrian media. Now, it is Austria’s Greens — Kurz’s new junior coalition partners — who may end his chancellorship. Without them, the government does not command a majority in parliament.Kurz was once seen as a wunderkind of European politics, whose combination of youth, gloss and opportunism offered a model for other moribund conservative parties across the continent. But his image has now been tarnished.“I’ve got no idea what the legal outcome is going to be, but in terms of his image, of his whole politics, this is really bad news,” said Thomas Hofer, an Austrian political consultant. “You can sense the nervousness. It is beginning to look like a theme.” Kurz’s ascent in Austrian politics had been remarkable for its velocity.He became a state secretary in 2011, having made a name for himself as a prominent voice in the party’s youth movement. Within two years, at the age of 27, he was Austria’s youngest ever foreign minister and already talked of as a future leader of the People’s Party. In May 2017, he took over the chairmanship. That December, after an election in which support for the People’s Party surged as a result of his hardline anti-immigration platform, he was appointed chancellor for the first time.The investigation announced by Austria’s central state prosecutor for economic crimes and corruption (WKStA) this week, offers an alternative history.Its 104-page warrant, published by Austrian newspapers, contains dozens of text messages and communications between Kurz and key party allies in 2016 and 2017. They include a series of exchanges between Kurz and Thomas Schmid, the general secretary in the finance ministry. Schmid’s phone was seized in November 2019 as part of a separate corruption investigation.Schmid, a close confidant of Kurz, was a central figure in what was dubbed “Project Ballhausplatz” by Kurz’s circle — a reference to the seat of the chancellorship, and the effort to get Kurz into it.The WKStA says it believes Schmid used his position in the finance ministry to divert federal funds to place adverts in the Österreich stable of newspapers and online publications controlled by the media entrepreneurs Helmuth and Wolfgang Fellner. In exchange, they allegedly published opinion polls, commissioned and “dressed up” by Schmid, that reflected Kurz in a positive light and helped steer his career.“I have never really gone as far as we have,” Schmid wrote in 2018 in a text message to Johannes Frischmann, who is now Kurz’s press spokesperson: “Ingenious investment. And [Wolfgang] Fellner is a capitalist . . . Whoever pays [gets to] create. I love that.” The use of taxpayers money, estimated at €1.2m, was disguised with fake invoices for consultancy work for the ministry, the WKStA believes.Using public funds was necessary for Kurz’s campaign because as foreign minister he had no access to party finance and very little influence within the party to smooth his way to the top, the prosecutor’s warrant alleges. “Schmid regularly reported to Kurz on all developments and progress,” it adds.“Thank you for Österreich today,” Kurz wrote to Schmid in January 2017. “Always at your service :-)),” Schmid replied.The WKStA said it was investigating 26 opinion polls apparently linked to Schmid and published on Österreich platforms, which covered matters ranging from the unpopularity of former People’s Party boss Reinhold Mitterlehner (before Kurz took over from him) to the popularity of a Kurz coalition with the far right.Schmid and the Fellners have denied wrongdoing. Österreich said in a statement that the WKStA’s allegations were based on “serious misunderstandings”. It said it had been paid far less for adverts by the ministry of finance than claimed in the WKStA warrant and disputed any deal existed with Schmid or others.“At no time was there an agreement . . . to pay for surveys through advertisements. In fact, all advertising payments made by the ministry of finance are disclosed by the Transparency Act,” the group added.For Kurz, and the rest of the People’s Party leadership, the allegations are an outrage that the chancellor has pledged to fight “with all my might”.The WKStA, he believes, is pursuing a nakedly political agenda to try to unseat him. The messages that have been used in its warrant, he told state TV channel ORF, had been cherry-picked and presented without context.On Friday, in an apparent response, the WKStA released 500 pages of evidence, including dozens more text messages. Politicians, journalists and spin-doctors from across the political spectrum have been poring through them for further revelations.Austria’s parliament is due to convene on Tuesday, when a possible motion of no confidence could be taken to unseat the government.Kurz’s supporters have, in the meantime, rallied to him. He is still, by far, the most popular choice for the chancellorship among Austrians. And the People’s Party remains the leader in the polls by a wide margin. When Kurz’s first government ended in calamity, the snap election that followed returned him to power with an even larger share of the vote.
255  For years after Poland joined the EU in 2004, the country was the biggest success story of the bloc’s eastern expansion — seemingly set to be a permanent and reliable bulwark of European integration.But Thursday’s ruling by Polish judges — that parts of EU law are incompatible with the country’s constitution — has sparked fears that a “Polexit”, to follow the UK’s Brexit from the EU, could one day cease to be an idea from political fiction.Luxembourg’s foreign minister Jean Asselborn warned on Friday that the ruling was “playing with fire”. France’s Europe minister Clément Beaune said it flew in the face of the rules Poland had accepted by joining the bloc, and raised the risk of a “de facto exit”.“When you sign a contract with someone and say ‘My rule, which I define when I want and how I want, is worth more than what I have signed with you’, there is no more contract,” Beaune said in an interview with BFM TV.Opinion surveys suggest that more than 80 per cent of Poles want their country to remain in the EU. Poland’s conservative-nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS) insists that the idea that it could take the country out of the union is nonsense.“The entry of Poland and the countries of central Europe to the EU was one of the most important events of the last decades. Both for us and for the EU itself. We all won from this,” Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki wrote on Facebook on Thursday. “That is why I say clearly: the place of Poland is and will be in the European family of nations.”Yet critics fear that even if PiS does not want to undo Poland’s EU membership, its constant clashes with Brussels could set in train a dynamic that eventually leads that way, much as David Cameron’s attempts to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the EU paved the way for Brexit.“Cameron came to the EU . . . with a gun to his head threatening that if he wasn’t granted what he wanted he would shoot himself,” said an official from one EU state. “This is similar: the Poles are threatening to shoot themselves in the foot, if not the head.”For the EU, which has to balance the need to protect its legal order against the risk of inflaming tensions with Warsaw, deciding how to respond to Thursday’s verdict is a perilously difficult decision.The European Commission, the EU executive, has faced increased questioning of the primacy of EU law — and the right of the European Court of Justice to have the final word — in a number of member states. But the Polish ruling is more serious given that it explicitly rejects key parts of EU law as incompatible with the country’s constitution in a challenge brought by the country’s own prime minister.It also follows five years of clashes between Warsaw and Brussels over changes by PiS — including an attempt to purge the supreme court and the introduction of a system allowing judges to be punished for the content of their rulings — which have sparked deep concerns in Brussels that the independence of Poland’s judiciary is being dismantled.Previous disciplinary proceedings against Poland under the so-called Article 7 process have foundered due to opposition from Warsaw’s key ally Hungary.Ursula von der Leyen, the commission’s president, has additional means of leverage if she wishes to use them.The commission is likely to consider as a minimum bringing infringement proceedings over the judgment — although only after it has been published and comes into effect.The commission is also weighing up a €36bn Polish bid for recovery funding, which Warsaw submitted in May. While Brussels has been seeking to insert “rule of law” conditions into the plan, Thu Nguyen, a policy fellow at the Jacques Delors Centre, said the commission should now reject the Polish plan outright.The commission is also under pressure to examine powers that would allow it to hold back Poland’s regional development funds under certain circumstances. It has also been considering whether to bring a case against Poland under a new mechanism that allows money to be withheld from member states where there is a clear risk of waste and fraud.While such a case would not be founded on the tribunal ruling itself, it could politically strengthen the hand of those arguing in favour of deploying the mechanism.The risk is that withholding billions of euros of EU funding would only embolden anti-Brussels politicians in Poland, worsening the stand-off. But Nguyen said the risks of inaction were worse still.“This is quite unprecedented — a country so fundamentally rejecting EU law primacy,” she said. “Letting these things slide and doing nothing would risk giving the impression that member states can do what they want. This would mean that we may as well give up on the EU project.”
256  The 2021 Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to journalists Maria Ressa of the Philippines and Dmitry Muratov of Russia for their “courageous fight” to safeguard freedom of expression.The Norwegian Nobel Committee said on Friday that the prize recognised the pair as “representatives of all journalists . . . in a world in which democracy and freedom of the press face increasingly adverse conditions”.Ressa is co-founder and chief executive of Rappler, a Philippine news website. Launched in 2012, it has been the target of multiple ongoing criminal prosecutions by authorities in the south-east Asian nation.The former CNN journalist led reporting on Rodrigo Duterte’s populist presidency, including coverage of his anti-narcotics campaign, which the International Criminal Court is investigating for suspected crimes against humanity.Ressa and other Rappler executives have been charged with multiple crimes, including tax evasion, fraud and “cyber libel” in what freedom of expression advocates describe as targeted harassment. She has emerged as a global symbol of the free press under siege from illiberal politicians.“It’s like waking up to climb Mount Everest,” Ressa told the Financial Times in 2019. “It looks really hard and painful, maybe you won’t make it up, but if you don’t try, you’ll never make it up.”Ressa, who holds Filipino and US nationality, has also been a vocal critic of social media groups such as Facebook, accusing the platforms of enabling “information warfare” in the Philippines.She has shown herself “a fairness defender”, the Nobel committee chair Berit Reiss-Andersen said on Friday, notably for her reporting on Duterte’s “controversial and murderous anti-drug campaign”.The committee chair hailed the co-winner Muratov, who for “decades defended freedom of speech in Russia under increasingly challenging conditions”.Muratov co-founded the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta in 1993, which persisted with its investigative reporting even as President Vladimir Putin began to tighten the noose on the press after he came to power six years later.Six of its reporters have been killed since 2000, most prominently among them Anna Politkovskaya, known for her searing criticism of Russia’s wars in Chechnya and Ramzan Kadyrov, the strongman picked by the Kremlin to run the province.More recently, Novaya Gazeta has published hard-hitting coverage of Russia’s proxy conflict in Ukraine as well as social and environmental issues.“I didn’t deserve this. Novaya Gazeta did. Those who died defending people’s right to freedom of speech did. Since they’re not with us, they must have decided I needed to tell everyone,” Muratov told news agency Tass. He said he would donate some of the proceeds of his prize money to a Putin-founded charity for children with rare diseases.The Kremlin congratulated Muratov on Friday. “He works consistently and he’s dedicated to his ideals. He’s talented and brave. And, of course, this is high recognition. We congratulate him,” Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.The newspaper is the only remaining major independent media outlet not named a “foreign agent” under a highly restrictive new law that has forced some news outlets to shut down and prompted several journalists to leave the country.The two journalists will share the SKr10m ($1.1m) award given by the Norwegian body.
257  The Turkish lira edged up from a new record low on Friday after one of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s top aides dismissed claims the leader was about to fire his central bank governor for the fourth time in less than three years.The currency dropped about 1 per cent to TL8.97 against the US dollar as Reuters reported that Erdogan had lost confidence in Sahap Kavcioglu, even after the governor bowed to pressure to slash the bank’s benchmark interest rate last month. The news agency, citing three sources, said that Erdogan — a notorious opponent of high interest — was frustrated that a rate cut was delayed until September and had not been implemented sooner.But the lira retraced some of its decline, strengthening by 0.6 per cent, as Fahrettin Altun, Erdogan’s director of communications, described the reported allegations as “fake news” and “lies” on Twitter.Erdogan, who has ruled Turkey for almost two decades, is grappling with growing public discontent at his management of the country’s economy.The annual rate of inflation reached almost 20 per cent in September, five times the bank’s official target, with food prices accelerating even more quickly.But the Turkish president believes, contrary to general economic convention, that high interest causes high inflation rather than curbing it. He has wrangled over monetary policy with a long line of central bank governors.Speaking on Thursday, Erdogan reiterated his commitment to lower interest rates. “We will bring down inflation and interest just as we have done before,” he said. “But this cannot happen in a single day.”Kavcioglu, a former ruling party MP, was appointed in March this year. His predecessor, the former finance minister Naci Agbal, was sacked after just four months in the job after he tried to bring inflation under control with a succession of rate rises.The current governor stunned international investors by slashing the bank’s benchmark interest rate by 1 percentage point last month, bringing it to 18 per cent. The move triggered a fresh run on the lira, which has suffered a severe depreciation over the past decade. One dollar purchased TL1.77 in late October 2011.Yet some analysts and market participants have speculated in recent weeks that Kavcioglu could be replaced by Semih Tumen, a former central bank official who returned to the institution in May as a deputy governor.A senior Turkish banker played down the prospect that Tumen, who has a PhD in economics from the University of Chicago, would take over. “If [a change of governor] happens, [the replacement] will be somebody who is much more obedient and stupid.”
258  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express. It has been an eventful 24 hours.Poland’s top court yesterday went where no other court had gone before in ruling that parts of EU law are not compatible with the Polish constitution. Sure, some will point out Germany’s constitutional court last year also challenged the supremacy of EU law (and so did Romania’s this summer).But no court has said that two articles of the EU treaty (including the first one) are incompatible with a nation’s constitution. We’ll explore the likely consequences for Poland and what this precedent means for the EU as a whole.In Germany, the chancellor candidate of Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats, Armin Laschet, has signalled he’s willing to step down — another sign that the next government will probably be run by the country’s current finance minister, Olaf Scholz.The fate of Kristalina Georgieva, the embattled managing director of the IMF, could be decided as soon as today as its board meets in Washington. France has given its backing, but it is unclear how many will support her.In global taxation news, a final deal is expected to emerge today at a meeting of the OECD in Paris — after Ireland yesterday gave its blessing to the accord.And with home affairs ministers meeting in Luxembourg today, we got our hands on a letter signed by 12 EU governments asking for the commission to sponsor border walls — until recently a taboo topic for Brussels.Yesterday’s tribunal ruling in Poland is a verdict Brussels had long feared, write Sam Fleming and Henry Foy in Brussels. For half a decade Warsaw’s conservative-nationalist government has been in a pitched battle with the European Commission, as it takes greater power over its judiciary and calls into question the writ of EU law.Legal experts viewed the decision by Poland’s constitutional tribunal, which has been repeatedly delayed in what appeared to be a high-stakes game of chicken with Brussels, to be the most serious of a number of challenges to the EU’s legal order.The supremacy of EU law has also been called into question in member states including France and Germany, but Warsaw’s determination that parts of EU law are not compatible with the Polish constitution constitutes a more fundamental threat — in a case brought by the country’s prime minister himself.In June Didier Reynders, the justice commissioner, told the Financial Times that he feared these proliferating challenges could have a “spillover effect” to other member states that destroys the EU itself.The Polish tribunal’s decision immediately prompted predictions that Warsaw is embarking on a long path towards EU exit. A more urgent question for the EU is how it responds to a country that is challenging the basic tenets of the union’s legal order.This puts the spotlight very firmly on Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president. She has at her disposal legal weaponry aimed at defending the rule of law, including the potential for infringement actions on top of existing Article 7 proceedings against Poland that have failed to alter the country’s behaviour.At the same time the commission is considering Poland’s €36bn bid for EU recovery cash that has been hanging in limbo since May 3. Brussels plans to impose conditions in the plan regarding reforms of the disciplinary regime and compliance with the European court on the matter, but Warsaw’s tribunal has just given Brussels another reason to hold back approval.Among the further questions facing Brussels is when and whether to use a brand new rule of law conditionality mechanism that allows it to withhold funds when rule of law breaches put the EU budget at risk. That new tool was hard-won by member states last year that stared down Warsaw which had threatened to torpedo the EU’s entire seven-year budget in an attempt to block it.As such, many in the bloc may think it would be odd if the commission chose not to use it.Thrust into a scheduled, unrelated press conference shortly after the verdict was announced yesterday evening, Reynders said “all instruments” were indeed under discussion.“In the context of the rule of law, we have instruments at our disposal to ensure that these constitutional principles are respected,” he said. “We have some possibilities to move on this . . . and it will be the case in the next days or weeks.”“We will react, of course, in a short period of time,” he added. “We are guardians of the treaties . . . and we will do what is necessary.”Other EU member states will be watching very closely to see whether Brussels lives up to its tough rhetoric.What do you think about Poland’s future membership of the EU? Click here to take the poll.Today’s OECD meetings in Paris promise to be a landmark moment in the long journey towards a global agreement aiming to extract more tax out of big international companies, writes Sam Fleming.Whereas nine countries out of 140 in total rejected the proposed common position on a new tax framework in July, those close to the discussions expect fewer holdouts today. Among those falling in line are Ireland, whose finance minister Paschal Donohoe yesterday confirmed Dublin’s agreement to the new minimum tax rate in an interview with the Financial Times.In addition, Estonia, which had serious concerns about the compatibility of the deal with its corporate tax rulebook, announced last night that it would be going along with the rules having satisfied itself that they would not hurt its business model.The position of Hungary, the other key holdout among EU member states, is less clear as Budapest continued this week to seek concessions in return for shifting on its 9 per cent corporate tax rate.The deal would impose a minimum 15 per cent global tax rate to end what was seen as harmful competition between countries. The deal also seeks to force the largest multinationals to pay more tax where they operate rather than where they are located.If countries agree the updated text to the agreement today, it will move to be finalised by G20 finance ministers next week. However, that is by no means the end of the story. Among the key questions in the coming months is that of implementation into national law — including critically in the US and the EU.The Biden administration faces an uphill struggle obtaining approval for the new laws on Capitol Hill. In addition, the EU is planning to impose elements of the new framework via a directive, to be enacted relatively rapidly. Given it concerns tax, this legislation will need unanimous consent of member states. Obtaining that agreement will not be straightforward.Today’s meeting in Paris promises to be a key milestone in global tax reform — but it is by no means the end of the battle.In an interview with the FT, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon said she hoped the Covid-19 pandemic would have receded sufficiently by early spring next year for “concrete decisions” on the timing of a rerun of the 2014 referendum. Opinion polls suggest support for independence has fallen, but also that substantial majorities of younger Scots back independence. (More here)Border walls are back in fashion. Four years after Brussels condemned then US president Donald Trump’s effort to build a wall along the country’s border with Mexico, 12 member states have written to the European Commission calling for the EU to fund a barrier along the bloc’s external borders, writes Henry Foy.The group of countries — including the Baltic states, Poland, Denmark, Austria and Greece — write that a “physical barrier appears to be an effective border protection measure that serves the interest of whole EU, not just member states of first arrival”.“This legitimate measure should be additionally and adequately funded from the EU budget as a matter of priority,” they write in the letter, sent to commission vice-president Margaritis Schinas and home affairs commissioner Ylva Johansson and seen by Europe Express.The demand comes in response to a migration crisis on the EU’s eastern border over the past four months caused by what Brussels says is a co-ordinated campaign by Belarus to transport migrants from Middle Eastern countries via Minsk to the frontiers of Lithuania, Latvia and Poland.That campaign, which the commission has described as a “hybrid attack” on the EU, means the bloc’s external border “must be protected with maximum level of security”, the 12 countries write in the letter. While the commission has pledged additional resources to help the countries affected, its current rules do not permit the use of EU funding for building barriers or fences.Spokespeople for commissioners Schinas and Johansson did not respond to requests for comment last night. But the demand will undoubtedly be discussed today in a meeting of EU home affairs ministers in Luxembourg, with migration and border security top of the agenda.
259  Ireland has finally abandoned its cherished 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate and signed up to a minimum 15 per cent global rate that will cost the country about €2bn in lost revenues.Paschal Donohoe, finance minister, told the Financial Times big businesses could rest assured no more changes would follow the “very, very significant” shift from what had been a cornerstone of Irish policy for more than two decades.The new tax rate will affect 1,556 companies in Ireland employing 500,000 people, among them US tech giants such as Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook. Ireland now joins 140 countries in agreeing to the effective levy of 15 per cent on major multinationals ahead of a meeting of the OECD on Friday.The deal came after Dublin persuaded the OECD to ditch a commitment to a global rate of “at least 15 per cent”.For smaller, domestic companies with a turnover of less than €750m, Donohoe secured approval from other nations to keep the 12.5 per cent rate — a concession he admitted he had “many” times been unsure he could clinch.“I believe that change will be right for Ireland and I believe it is also right for Ireland to be playing a positive role in implementing what I believe will be an important agreement,” he said in an interview, adding the deal provided “certainty and stability”.Asked if the new rate would remain forever, he said: “I can’t see in my lifetime this kind of circumstances developing again . . . 15 will mean 15.”The meeting in Paris on Friday was expected to agree the framework deal but many details would not be hammered out until early next year, he said — not least how much tax companies will pay in the countries where they operate but are not necessarily located, the so-called Pillar One.EU members Estonia and Hungary are among lingering holdouts. The EU needs unanimous support from its 27 member states for the agreement.US President Joe Biden and Janet Yellen, Treasury secretary, are on board but face the challenge of getting the deal through the US Congress because Biden has only a tiny majority in the Senate.“We’re all depending on each other to be able to implement this collectively and comprehensively,” Donohoe said.But he added: “I have enough confidence now that this is going to happen globally for me to believe that it’s appropriate that Ireland go into it now.”High-tech companies have accounted for the bulk of Ireland’s €5bn to €7bn a year foreign direct investment over the past five years.Karen Frawley, president of the Irish Tax Institute, said Ireland “didn’t want to be in a position where its reputation was very damaged — not signing up would have made us seem to be almost like a tax haven”.Despite factoring the prospect of a 15 per cent rate into his budget sums since 2019, Donohoe admitted that “at many points I have thought that it is very possible that the entire process itself wouldn’t conclude or Ireland would not be able to get assurances for the changes we needed”.Dublin worked on the basis that both scenarios — a deal, or no deal — could translate into a loss of revenue. Nevertheless, “it has been evident to me that this moment would be coming”, Donohoe said.An Irish Times/Ipsos MRBI poll found 59 per cent of respondents opposed increasing the corporate tax rate but Mark Redmond, chief executive of the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, “warmly welcomed” the announcement.“The revised agreement ensures essential predictability, stability and certainty for multinational employers,” he said. US FDI in Ireland accounts for about a fifth of private sector jobs.The new global tax rate is expected to take effect from 2023 and the government estimates it will cost Ireland up to €2bn in coming years.Donohoe said the estimate of the loss was based on companies paying a smaller share of their overall taxes in Ireland, offset by a higher rate.In the absence of further detail at this stage “we believe there will be a net overall loss of €2bn in the medium term”, he later told a news conference.Donohoe added it was important to be inside the deal because otherwise other countries would have collected the difference between the 12.5 per cent and 15 per cent rates.Some also suggested the move could be positive, not negative, for Irish government coffers.“Under the proposals, these large corporates would have been paying this additional tax anyway, irrespective of whether Ireland signed up to the deal, as the tax would be collected by other countries. At 15 per cent, Ireland still remains a very attractive location for foreign direct investment,” said Tom Woods, head of tax at KPMG. “The changes should also yield additional gains to the exchequer,” he said in a statement.Feargal O’Rourke, managing partner at PwC, said the deal could in fact end up being positive for Ireland. The country stands to lose about €2.5bn under Pillar One. “If we increase our rate to 15 per cent on those big global companies affected by the OECD deal, we could gain about €2bn,” he said.
260  Poland’s constitutional tribunal has ruled that parts of EU law are not compatible with the Polish constitution, in a dramatic escalation of a battle between Warsaw and Brussels with tens of billions of euros in EU funding at stake.The ruling — in response to a case brought by prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki — caps a five-year legal feud between Poland and the EU, during which the country’s conservative-nationalist government has given politicians sweeping powers over the country’s judiciary.The fight has also sparked questions about Poland’s long-term future in the EU, with the government’s critics at home and abroad accusing it of setting the country on course for “Polexit”.“The Polish constitutional tribunal agreed completely with what the prime minister wanted,” said Marcin Matczak, a law professor at Warsaw university. “All the questions were answered: ‘Yes, prime minister’.”Brussels has responded to what EU officials have said are breaches of EU values by withholding approval of Warsaw’s application for €36bn in Covid-19 recovery funds.The European Commission is also under increasing pressure to deploy powers that would allow it to hold back Poland’s regional development funds worth up to €121bn over the next six years.Didier Reynders, the EU’s justice commissioner, said after the ruling that Brussels would act to protect the primacy of EU law over national law and the binding nature of the European Court of Justice’s rulings on national governments.“We are very firm on the different principles and we will use all the tools at our disposal to be sure that it is possible to protect them,” Reynders added.Asked whether the commission would trigger a mechanism that allowed it to withhold EU funding because of rule of law concerns, Reynders said: “We will use all the tools in the toolbox . . . we will see now how it is possible to put pressure.”Politicians from the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) say the judicial changes have overhauled an inefficient system and are a purely domestic matter.“Today’s constitutional court ruling is an appeal to the EU institutions to stop violating the treaties by trying, by usurpation and blackmail, to gain competences which they were not granted in the [EU] treaties,” Poland’s deputy justice minister, Sebastian Kaleta, wrote on Twitter.“The EU does not have the right to interfere in the Polish judiciary.”However, the commission and PiS’s domestic opponents regard the changes PiS has introduced as an assault on judicial independence. Brussels has repeatedly taken Poland to the EU’s top court to try to reverse various elements of the reforms.The constitutional court ruling “has put the country on the path to Polexit”, said Jeroen Lenaers, justice and home affairs spokesperson for the European People’s party, the largest bloc in the European parliament.“This is an attack on the EU as a whole,” Lenaers added. “Our money can’t finance the governments which mock and negate our jointly agreed rules. The consequences must be drawn, and the European Commission should immediately use all available tools in order not to sponsor the autocrats in Warsaw.”The stand-off has sparked increasingly angry rhetoric in Warsaw, with Zbigniew Ziobro, the hawkish justice minister who also leads PiS’s smaller coalition partner, United Poland, saying in August that the country should not remain in the EU “at any price”.However, PiS has insisted that it has no intention of taking Poland out of the EU. More than 80 per cent of Poles support EU membership.
261  Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orban has launched a new effort to wrest control of Budapest airport from its international investor owners.The government has submitted a second offer to buy the airport after the first was rejected as too low this summer, according to two people familiar with the matter. The offer price for the airport could not be determined.The airport, which was fully privatised in 2011, is majority owned by Canada’s Public Sector Pension Investment Board, which holds a 55 per cent stake through its German-based airport investor AviAlliance.GIC, the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund, owns 23 per cent, while a second Canadian pension fund manager, Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), owns the remaining 21 per cent stake.AviAlliance and CDPQ declined to comment, while Singapore’s GIC did not respond to a request for comment.The Hungarian government declined to comment, but in May announced it would make a co-ordinated effort to buy back a majority stake in the airport.The persistent interest from the government comes despite the consortium of foreign investors repeatedly declaring their desire to keep hold of the asset, which is thought to have big growth potential.The owners said in May they were “committed to the airport in the long run”, while in July AviAlliance said it “deeply hope[d] to be given the opportunity to remain invested in this airport” when it confirmed the first non-binding offer from the government.But the Orban government has made regaining control of key Hungarian infrastructure and other assets a priority and it raised the equivalent of €4.4bn in a series of foreign currency bond issues last month.A person familiar with government plans said part of the proceeds of the bond issue could finance the airport deal.“It is difficult to evaluate an airport without having proper capex plans and traffic forecasts, but for an initial ballpark figure I would expect the airport to be valued somewhere between €4bn to €5.5bn,” said aviation consultant Martin Fossati.Orban has already reshuffled ownership of the country’s infrastructure in other ways this year. His government has moved to place about 2,000km of motorways and public roads into a 35-year concession, including projects to expand the network by hundreds of kilometres.He has signalled that he is targeting domestic majority ownership in key sectors, including finance and retail, as well as gaining control over infrastructure assets.Orban has criticised the airport’s privatisation for years and his government has in the past threatened to wrest control of the airport from its current owners.The consortium of foreign owners first invested in the airport in 2007 when they took a roughly 75 per cent stake. They acquired the remaining 25 per cent from the Hungarian state in 2011.The eastern European aviation market is expected to grow rapidly as incomes rise and people travel more, including switching to air from road and rail.Only 3.9m passengers used the airport in 2020, but passenger numbers had grown rapidly in previous years, from 11.4m in 2016 to 16.2m in 2019.
262  This month Mike Hewitt, a former US naval rear admiral, is shuttling across the Atlantic to pitch a green venture to investors. Nothing unusual about that you might think: such projects are popular ahead of next month’s COP26 climate talks in Glasgow.However, this particular environmental project, known as IP3, has an unusual twist: it is focused on nuclear power. More specifically, Rolls-Royce, the British engineering group, is organising a consortium to install more than a dozen so-called “small modular reactors” (SMRs) across Britain.They hope to get £210m from the UK government to fund this, according to Hewitt. His group is also raising matching finance from private sources, including investors with “environmental, social and governance” (ESG) mandates. “The traditional ESG criterion has kept nuclear power out [of their funds],” he tells me. “But we think this is changing.”Is this right? It is not clear yet since the plan is not officially in place. However the fact that IP3 is even attempting to make nuclear reactors part of an ESG pitch is a striking sign of the climate times — and one which, in my view, should be welcomed.Until very recently, the word “nuclear” was toxic to most green activists and many politicians, both because of the pollution risks linked with spent nuclear fuel, and due to previous accidents at nuclear plants. Indeed, events such as the 1986 meltdown in Chernobyl, Ukraine or the 2011 tsunami at Japan’s Fukushima plant have left such a legacy of fear that countries such as Germany have been shutting their existing plants, along with US states such as New York and California.Meanwhile, a row has broken out inside the team that has been drafting the EU’s taxonomy for sustainable finance, which will help investors ensure projects are environmentally sound. The French government has lobbied for nuclear power to be included because it does not emit carbon (since France relies on nuclear for much of its electricity). But this has been blocked by Germany.Unsurprisingly, this makes ESG funds wary. Or as Bank of America observed in a recent research note: “We have received feedback multiple times from a variety of environmentally conscious investors that they cannot invest in certain utilities due to nuclear exposure.”However, there are now two factors which could (and should) change this conversation. First, nuclear technology is shifting. Whereas 20th century reactors were so big and expensive that they required a decades-long commitment to install, the new generation of SMRs are smaller, cheaper and far more flexible. This means that they can be located in more convenient places, and — crucially — treated as a temporary or transitional energy source.Evangelists for nuclear power, such as Bill Gates, claim that such technological breakthroughs have also made plants far safer than before, with less pollution risk, because they can be run on recycled fuel, although these claims remain controversial.The second factor changing the conversation is a growing sense of realism — or desperation — about carbon emissions ahead of COP26. In an ideal world, there is (or should be) no question that the best way to slash emissions is to use renewable sources, such as solar, wind and hydroelectric power.In the real world, however, renewables only account for a small slice of current energy sources and that is unlikely to change without dramatic innovations in battery storage and transmission systems. This miracle seems unlikely to occur any time soon.Thus the nasty choice confronting policymakers and environmental activists is this: should they swallow the risks of nuclear, at least temporarily, in order to cut carbon emissions? Or should they tolerate higher use of fossil fuels?If they want to keep global warming below 2 degrees, what the COP26 attendees face is not a beauty contest around the best energy choices, but an “ugly contest” to pick the least-bad energy mix.Personally, I favour the first option, using nuclear as a transitional option, even with the attendant risks, to cut the near inevitable rise in carbon emissions without it. As a report from the World Economic Forum notes, “the contribution nuclear power can make to the energy transition lies in its ability to follow and assume the system costs generated by the intermittency of renewables”. In other words, it fills in gaps that renewables still (sadly) create.Those governments that continue to shun nuclear plants are haunted by the dirty secret that this move is likely to increase emissions. To cite one example, officials in New York privately tell me that closing their nuclear plant at Indian Point, while politically popular, will probably increase reliance on fossil fuel, something no one will admit publicly.But don’t expect Western politicians to talk too frankly about this difficult choice, especially given that they face a “Nimby” — Not In My Back Yard — voter problem when it comes to nuclear plants. Hence the need to watch what those ESG funds are doing. If they start to accept that we live in a world of difficult energy trade-offs in the coming months, and fund nuclear, it may signal that the climate movement is also beginning to realise that we live in a world with fifty shifting shades of green.gillian.tett@ft.comThis article has been amended to correct the ‘small modular reactors’ (SMR) acronymLetter in response to this article:A school pupil questions the case for nuclear power / From Gordon Ng, Year 10 student, King George V School, Hong Kong
263  Armin Laschet has signalled he is prepared to step down as leader of Germany’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union after the party slumped to its worst election result.In a statement on Thursday evening Laschet said he would propose a party conference next week to elect a new leader. “We need an overhaul of our personnel structures and . . . we need to do it quickly,” he said.Laschet has come under mounting pressure to resign since the CDU’s disastrous showing in the September 26 election, which was narrowly won by Germany’s left-of-centre Social Democrats (SPD).The SPD garnered 25.7 per cent of the vote, ahead of the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, on 24.1 per cent.Laschet’s departure appeared almost inevitable after the SPD, Greens and liberal Free Democrats (FDP) began exploratory talks on Thursday on forming the country’s first three-party coalition government since the 1950s.If the discussions succeed, SPD finance minister Olaf Scholz will become Germany’s chancellor, succeeding Angela Merkel, who is quitting politics after 16 years leading Europe’s most powerful economy.Laschet made clear that he has not given up hope of a CDU/CSU-led “Jamaica” coalition — so-called because the colours of the participating parties — black for the CDU/CSU, green for the Greens and yellow for the liberals — match those of the Jamaican national flag.“Jamaica is a chance for a really fresh start in our country,” he said. “As far as we’re concerned, we are not slamming any door . . . [and] the CDU’s offer will stand until the very moment a government has been formed.”But he said he would be prepared to step aside and let someone else lead the CDU/CSU into a coalition with the Greens and FDP. “The great Jamaica project will not fail due to individuals,” he said.Despite the election result some in the CDU/CSU camp hoped they could still retain the chancellery by coaxing the Greens and liberals into a Jamaica alliance.But after initial talks with the CDU/CSU the FDP and Greens decided to go with the SPD.Over the past decades the CDU has been Germany’s most successful election-winning machine, governing for 52 of the past 72 years. But it has been badly weakened by factional strife and disagreements over its direction after Merkel.Laschet, prime minister of the industrial state of North Rhine-Westphalia, was elected as CDU leader in January. But he failed to stamp his authority on the party and improve his weak personal approval ratings.His authority was also sapped by a bitter public power struggle with Markus Söder, the Bavarian prime minister and leader of the CSU, over who should be the parties’ joint candidate for chancellor in September’s election.During the election campaign Laschet’s poll ratings sank further after he was caught laughing on camera during a visit to areas affected by flooding.Speaking on Thursday, Laschet said the CDU had to learn from its mistakes and said that since Merkel stood down from chairing the party in 2018 the Christian Democrats had “experienced a continuous debate about personnel”.“This time we should go down a different path, a path of consensus,” he said, adding that it was a “process that I will oversee”.
264  Having spent last week observing the Labour party still shying away from Brexit at its annual conference in Brighton, the Brexit Briefing went to Manchester for the Conservative equivalent, where for rather different reasons, Brexit was also strangely absent.Or more accurately, Brexit was everywhere and yet nowhere. It loomed over the conference in the form of disputes about labour shortages, petrol queues and the threat to suspend parts of the withdrawal agreement covering Northern Ireland, but was never cited as the cause.Any linkage between these issues and Boris Johnson’s decision to quit the EU single market for goods and services in as abrupt and complete a manner as possible, while leaving Northern Ireland behind in the regulatory orbit of the EU, was carefully avoided.With Brexit behind us, this was Year Zero for Global Britain. Liz Truss, the new foreign secretary, managed an entire speech on building a “network of liberty around the world” without mentioning Europe once. “She couldn’t even say the word,” hissed one EU diplomat.Listing partners in this global network of free trade and security co-operation, Truss included South Korea and the Gulf states; Narendra Modi’s India and the commonwealth, but no mention of the network of 27 countries that make up the UK’s geographical neighbourhood.The closest she came to Europe was a favourable mention for the Visegrad Four, the grouping of central and eastern EU states that includes Poland and Hungary, two places where democracy is ironically now in active decline.Lord David Frost, the Brexit minister, went further in his speech, describing the UK’s almost 50 years of membership of the European Union as a nightmare. Like it never happened. “The long bad dream of our EU membership is over,” he declared. “The British Renaissance has begun.”Perhaps none of this is surprising, but even allowing for the fact that party conferences are a gathering of the grassroots faithful, it was a reminder of just how instinctively defensive the government remains of its Brexit positions.EU diplomats did their best to observe the courtesies of their profession — although the EU ambassador João Vale de Almeida couldn’t resist noting how Tories from Churchill to Thatcher and Arthur Cockfield to Leon Brittan had helped to build the EU — but they will have cabled their capitals to say that while “Brexit is done”, the British boil has not been lanced.If there was a discernible strategy from the UK government to all this hostility, it was visible in Frost’s speech. He repeated his threat to suspend parts of the Northern Ireland protocol via Article 16 of the withdrawal agreement, but explicitly linked resolving the squabble over the region to normalising relations with Brussels.“We need significant change,” he said, before adding. “If we can agree something better, we can get back to where we wanted to be — an independent Britain with friendly relations with the EU based on free trade.” Frost worked the margins of the conference hard, setting out the demands of his July command paper and laying out a timetable for this autumn.His EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic will produce a package of suggested measures in mid- to late-October. There will be a period of intense negotiations that will probably run into early November, after which the UK will make a decision on whether to trigger Article 16. This is the clause that allows for the partial suspension of the protocol if either party judges the agreement is causing “economic, societal or environmental difficulties”.Frost himself is not optimistic, telling delegates that “from what I hear I worry that we will not get [an EU proposal] which enables the significant change we need” but is willing to hear Brussels out.The biggest of Frost’s demands is the removal of the European Court of Justice as enforcer of the protocol — in which the UK agreed that Northern Ireland would follow the EU’s rules and regulations for goods — replacing it with a “normal treaty framework”.This demand is so big that it is often dismissed as a red herring, or something the UK will look to barter away in negotiations in exchange for deeper flexibilities on the Irish Sea trade border, but Frost’s team warns that this misses the point.Indeed, the sovereignty question remains uppermost, just as it did in negotiating the subsidy regime and the level playing field elements of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) in 2020. The EU ultimately agreed to remove ECJ oversight then, so why not now?Well the simple answer is that Great Britain “opted out” of EU rules by agreeing a bare-bones free trade agreement, but Northern Ireland has been “opted in”, via the protocol that Frost himself negotiated, but now seeks to largely repudiate.The UK argument is that the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland means that ECJ oversight should be replaced by a form of binding international arbitration that would still enforce EU law and rules in NI, but avoid a border in the UK’s internal market at the whim of a foreign court.It would, to put it mildly, be a huge step for the EU to agree to such an arrangement. It would risk the ECJ no longer being the sole arbiter of EU law by setting up a system that could produce rival interpretations.But then, as Frost implied with mild menace in his speech, fixing the protocol to the UK’s satisfaction is the gateway to “friendly relations”.The autumn is likely to be stormy. Given the UK demands, the smart money (and there is some resignation to this in EU capitals) is that London will trigger Article 16, probably after the COP26 climate change conference, to avoid diplomatic repercussions.Just how stormy will depend on whether Frost uses the Article 16 structure in a narrow, targeted way to fix identifiable problems, or opts for a broader approach that uses Article 16 as cover to implement the “honesty box” approach to the Irish Sea border laid out in his July paper.At that point the EU will have to make some difficult choices. Without a fully functioning east-west border (which is there, remember to avoid a north-south trade border in Ireland) then either a border has to go up, or Ireland’s position in the single market is imperilled over time because of unchecked goods leaking in from Great Britain.Hitherto, Brussels has reacted to UK provocations over the protocol, such as the threat to break international law when tabling the UK internal market bill in 2020, by not overreacting.Frost perhaps bets that, based on past experience, Brussels and more importantly EU member states, won’t really risk a trade war with the UK over Northern Ireland, and that any sanction will be slow in coming and, in any case, have to be proportionate.Alternatively, as in 2020 when Johnson threatened a no-deal Brexit, this may all be bluff. If Johnson decides that he doesn’t have the stomach for the fight, then the current position will turn out to be a rerun of the 2020 “crazy man” strategy.In that scenario, the EU makes maximal concessions on the Irish Sea border, takes further steps to address the democratic deficit in the deal, and the UK accepts the “flexibilities” offered by Sefcovic, hailing them as another negotiating triumph.Either way, dig out your eyeshades. We’re back round the table for a game of high-stakes Brexit poker before Christmas.Welcome backFor all the ministerial bravado and the attempts to blame business for supply chain disruptions in Manchester, it is difficult to argue that Brexit is going well.Or that, at least, seems to be the opinion of the public, according to a rolling YouGov poll this month that found only 18 per cent of the public felt Brexit was “going well”, but more than half (53 per cent) felt it was “going badly” — that’s up 15 points from June.We are, thanks to Covid-19, still in the early days of Brexit effects being visible to the public and, as last week’s Briefing observed, a long way off from the opposition Labour party daring to use Brexit fallout as a political points-scoring opportunity.For now, say Tory strategists, Boris Johnson’s brand — typified in that ebullient Tory party conference speech — continues to defy the gravitational pull of petrol shortages, tax rises and energy crises.It remains to be seen whether a tough winter brings the greatest showman of British politics back down to earth, but those numbers suggest that the public is not oblivious to the frictional impacts of Brexit.Johnson’s trick will be to continue to make them believe that, in the long run, it is worth the cost — or at least soon will be.And, finally, three unmissable Brexit storiesUK chief political commentator Robert Shrimsley applauds the government’s critique of UK businesses’ “mainlining” of cheap labour but says the combined effect of the pandemic and Brexit has turned an anti-addiction programme into a brutal cold turkey.Anti-French stories adorned the front pages of UK tabloids this week as post-Brexit relations between London and Paris plumbed new depths. In this piece George Parker, political editor in London, and Victor Mallet, Paris bureau chief, step back and assess Anglo-French relations and find one area where co-operation is welcome on both sides of the Channel.Divorcing English expatriates are turning to London’s family courts to settle costly maintenance claims following a change in rules brought by Britain’s departure from the EU, according to lawyers.
265  Some European Central Bank policymakers have argued it is underestimating future inflation, warned about the risk of a “regime shift” in prices and pushed for a bigger cut in asset purchases than it ultimately decided at its meeting last month.These concerns by some of the ECB’s more conservative governing council members about “upside risks” to its inflation forecast were revealed in the minutes of its September meeting, published by the central bank on Thursday.The debate highlights how the recent rise in eurozone inflation to its highest level for more than a decade is creating tension between ECB rate-setters over how long the price surge is likely to last, and whether the central bank should adjust monetary policy as a result.The ECB last month forecast that inflation would fall from an annualised rate of 2.2 per cent this year to 1.7 per cent next year and 1.5 per cent in 2023. The minutes said most ECB council members agreed with its forecast for a “hump-shaped” pattern of inflation.But after the central bank consistently underestimated how soaring energy prices and supply bottlenecks would drive inflation above its 2 per cent target this year, some council members expressed doubts about the reliability of its forecasts.“They considered that the degree of persistence of the inflation shock and, especially, the outlook for inflation in 2023 were more uncertain, with the risk that inflation in 2023 might turn out to be higher than projected,” the minutes said. “The view was also expressed that the baseline projection for inflation in 2023 was too low.”Council members argued inflation would exceed the ECB forecasts “if a different path materialised for oil prices” and if supply chain bottlenecks lasted longer than expected or wage pressures started to materialise.The ECB’s recent commitment to take account of rising house prices would also “lead to a higher expected path for inflation”, they said. Eurozone house prices rose 6.8 per cent in the year to the second quarter, their biggest rise for 15 years, according to data published on Thursday.The policymakers said the ECB should pay closer attention to “direct and granular evidence, such as data collected from businesses, unions and households” to identify structural shifts caused by the pandemic that could cause possible “regime shifts” in the eurozone’s inflation outlook.Policies to tackle climate change and future increases in carbon prices were also “likely to lead to sustained upward price pressures for a number of years”, some council members said. Since the September meeting, European gas prices have shot up and the cost of carbon credits has risen to record levels above €60 a tonne.Carsten Brzeski, head of macro research at ING, said the minutes “signal a changed stance on inflation compared with a few months ago; a shift from a very benign assessment to one of more alertness and awareness that inflationary pressures might be less shortlived than initially thought”.In response to rising inflation and easier financial conditions, the ECB last month also announced a “moderate” slowdown in the pace of its €1.85tn emergency bond-buying programme launched in response to the pandemic.Some more hawkish policymakers argued in favour of “a more substantial reduction in the pace of purchases”, according to the minutes. But others resisted this, saying it “might drive euro area interest rates higher and thwart an incipient increase in inflation expectations”.
266  Donald Trump’s former chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, once described Hungary’s Viktor Orban as “the most significant guy on the scene right now”. Hungary’s self-professed champion of illiberal democracy nowadays looms even larger on America’s populist right.US conservatives used to admire Orban from a distance. Now they want to emulate him from close-up. The reasons for Orban’s ascent in the eyes of Republicans also offer a road map on how the party plans to return to power.It is not only about re-electing Trump in 2024 — although the ex-US president has made no secret of his Orban envy. After Germany’s Angela Merkel steps down, Orban will become Europe’s longest-serving leader — a cumulative 15 years so far. Budapest is the first, and often only, stop on the foreign itinerary of US conservative thinkers. In August, Fox News’ Tucker Carlson conducted an admiring interview with Hungary’s leader. Others, including the American Conservative’s Rod Dreher and the University of Notre Dame’s Patrick Deneen, have talked glowingly about Orban. The Conservative Political Action Committee, which holds the US right’s largest annual gathering, is planning a conference in Budapest in 2022, its first on European soil.What makes the leader of a small central European country so appealing to conservatives in the world’s richest democracy? Because Orban shows how the switch to illiberalism can be done. Success breeds imitation. The first time Orban was in power — in 1998 — he led a pro-small government free market party. He was defeated in 2002. In those days his Fidesz party had a lot in common with Reagan Republicans. When Orban returned to power in 2010, it was with a very different ideology. He was “Trump before Trump” as Bannon put it. The libertarian philosophy had been replaced by the politics of resentment. European identity made way for talk of defending Hungary’s Christian civilisation. The new Orban was an enemy of independent media, courts and universities. He also became Europe’s chief scapegoater of immigrants.Unlike Trump, who promised to build a wall on the US-Mexico border, but only partially delivered, Orban blanketed Hungary’s southern borders with barbed wire fencing. In 2015, the year after his party won the two-thirds majority he needed to overhaul Hungary’s constitution, Orban said: “We are experiencing the end of all the liberal babble. An era is coming to an end.” The jury is still out on whether he was right. Among US conservatives, however, the road map he has provided is too relevant to ignore.Orban’s example is two-fold. Peripheral Hungary is a surprisingly good model for the Republican heartlands of small town and rural America. Just as Orban harvested resentment of the networked metropolitans of Brussels, Berlin and Paris, so today’s Republicans rail against New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Red state America is subsidised by its more urban Democratic counterparts — the fiscal transfer from urban to non-urban America grows larger every year. Hungary, too, is dependent on huge subsidies from the EU. Both resent the cosmopolitan hands that feed them.Orban has tilted Hungary’s electoral system against opposition parties and shown how to win super-majorities without a majority of voters. In the country’s 2018 elections, Fidesz won 67 per cent of the seats with 49 per cent of the vote. Orban’s governance model is even more relevant. Having secured a stranglehold on power, he has parcelled out EU-funded largesse to allies on a grand scale. Almost half of Hungary’s public contracts have just one bidder. This would be hard to replicate in a federal democracy the size of the US. But there are many pages that can be taken from Orban’s book, including how to win a culture war with the urban elites.The US right’s love affair might well outlast Trump. Last month, Mike Pence, the former vice-president, and 2024 hopeful, visited Hungary and praised Orban’s pro-family policies. On the Christian right, Orban is seen as anti-LGBTQ, hostile to immigration and a defender of western civilisation. With US-Mexico border crossings rising, and a growing backlash against more diverse curricula in US schools, including “critical race theory”, Orban’s playbook is too pressing to ignore. The Hungarian leader’s strategy could prove as relevant to the Republicans’ future as Trump himself.
267  The head of the International Energy Agency said Russia has the capacity to send substantially more gas to Europe and alleviate the energy crisis gripping the continent, in an intervention likely to bolster claims that the country is withholding crucial supplies.Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, told the Financial Times that the agency’s own analysis suggested Russia could raise exports by roughly 15 per cent of peak winter supply to the continent.Speaking the day after President Vladimir Putin hinted at a boost to shipments, Birol urged Russia to prove it is a “reliable supplier” by helping alleviate a supply crunch that has rocked energy prices and threatened the global recovery from pandemic lockdowns.“If Russia does what it indicated yesterday and increases the volumes to Europe, this would have a calming effect on the market,” he said. “I don’t say they will do it but if they wish so, they have the capacity to do it.”The IEA, which is primarily funded by OECD countries to advise on energy policy and security, first said last month that it believed Russia could boost supplies to Europe but without specifying by how much.Gas prices have been climbing for months, and shot higher on Wednesday on the growing prospect of supply shortages over the winter. But a 40 per cent gain in UK prices quickly snapped back to a 9 per cent drop on the day after Putin hinted at larger supplies.Gazprom said Putin’s comments had a calming effect on Russian producers and European consumers alike. “We all let out a sigh of relief in agreement and said ‘Thank God!’” Elena Burmistrova, head of Gazprom’s export arm, told a conference in St Petersburg on Thursday.Burmistrova said the turmoil in gas markets threatened the stability of the regional economy and proved that the long-term contracts Gazprom was pushing were a safer option.“Buying gas at acceptable prices is good, of course, but it’s even better to know for sure in advance how much it’s going to cost a month, a quarter, or a year from now,” she said. “We can all see on markets how much that unpredictability can cost us.”Russia has repeatedly stressed it has fulfilled its long-term contracts but has also indicated more sales could be made available once the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany is approved. That has stoked suspicions from Ukraine and other eastern European countries that it is trying to use higher prices to ensure the project’s speedy approval.The line, which runs through the Baltic Sea, will bypass Ukraine, which turned away from Moscow to the west after a 2014 revolution and has fought a war against Russia-backed separatists in its east ever since.Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesman, said on Thursday there was “potential” to increase supplies to Europe, and hinted strongly that Nord Stream 2 was the best way to do it.Alternative supply routes “work brilliantly and are much more high-tech and ecological”, Peskov said, according to Interfax.Jennifer Granholm, the US energy secretary, said this week that the US was “carefully” watching Russia’s role in the European gas crunch, including assessing whether Gazprom was manipulating the market.The IEA’s Birol said Russian exports were not solely responsible for the tightness in supplies. The rapid economic rebound from the pandemic, prolonged maintenance at various projects and weather conditions have also played a role, he said. But he cautioned that soaring prices would damage the industry’s long-term future.“Very clearly the gas market is not getting good marks from consumers around the world,” Birol said. “It has been presented globally as a clean reliable source to complement the energy transition, but it may be casting a shadow on this image.”Birol said governments needed to insulate consumers from the surge in prices in the short term, but added that record prices should also accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels.
268  In his drive to turn Turkey into an indispensable power across the Middle East, north Africa and Central Asia, and to ensure his almost one-man rule is unassailable, Recep Tayyip Erdogan is finding he has less space for manoeuvre than he could wish.Not for the first time, in recent weeks he has been bumping uncomfortably up against the US, Turkey’s formal long-term ally within Nato, and its episodic ally of convenience, Russia.Erdogan had been buoyed by a string of apparent successes for his muscular foreign policy, defying not just Washington and Moscow but also member states of the EU, to which Turkey is still formally a candidate for membership.Using drones, militias and mercenaries as well as Turkish forces, he turned the tide of the civil war in Libya (with Russia and France on the other side); helped the Turkic state of Azerbaijan reconquer disputed territory from Armenia (in the Caucasus, which Russia considers its sphere of influence); and is putting down roots in northern Syria in enclaves from which it is pushing back US-allied Kurdish fighters.Where Ankara sees the rightful assertion of Turkish influence, its Nato allies worry about a neo-Ottoman push for regional hegemony. Their alarm — and Russia’s — has grown as a result of Turkey’s maritime claims to big stretches of the Black Sea, the Aegean and the east Mediterranean, under an expansive doctrine known as “blue homeland” (“mavi vatan”).Erdogan has shown he can temper his adventurism with pragmatism. He is mending fences with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, the three Arab states that blockaded his Gulf ally Qatar in 2017-20 — and who he believes were part of a conspiracy to topple him in the abortive mid-2016 coup in Turkey, alongside the US and some Europeans. He had also dialled down tensions in the east Mediterranean, the scene of a scramble for offshore gas riches as well as a clash of irredentists.But while Turkey and its age-old neighbour and adversary Greece were due to resume negotiations on Wednesday, its navy recently staged two maritime stand-offs with Greek Cypriot exploration vessels. On the eve of the Greek talks, Erdogan airily dismissed the “fabricated maps” of the European imperialists who parcelled out the Near East after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire a century ago.But while it is easy to rail against an EU that blows hot and cold, navigating between the US and Russia offers less wriggle room as Erdogan has been reminded recently.To the extent that Donald Trump, the former US president, had a coherent foreign policy, it usually served as a shield for Erdogan, along with fist bumps and admiration of his autocratic ways.Things with Joe Biden are different. Turkey and America have long been at loggerheads. This is mainly over the US alliance with Syrian Kurdish forces that still control most of north-east Syria and are linked to Turkish Kurd insurgents of the PKK, and Ankara’s purchase of the S-400 air defence system from Moscow, seen by alliance strategists as a cuckoo in the Nato nest.But now Erdogan is indignant that Biden did not make time to see him in New York at the UN General Assembly. “I cannot say things have got off to a good start with Biden,” he said, demanding a refund for being kicked out of Nato’s new F-35 jet fighter consortium and vowing not only to buy more S-400s but deepen defence ties with Russia in areas from aircraft to submarines.Erdogan’s declarations may have been designed to smooth his relationship with Vladimir Putin. Yet the meeting with the Russian president in the Black Sea resort of Sochi was unusually short, especially after an 18-month hiatus in what had been regular contacts. It ended without the usual press conference in which the two strongmen showcase their mutual admiration.The meeting was also preceded by acrimony. At the UN, Erdogan reiterated that Turkey would never recognise Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea. He has also agreed to supply Ukraine with Turkish Bayraktar TB2 drones — the decisive weapon in Libya and Azerbaijan’s war in the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. Russia also has carried out scores of air strikes in northern Syria — emphasising that Turkey’s presence in four areas there ultimately needs the blessing of Putin, who meanwhile cozied up to Greece and Egypt.Erdogan’s rhetorical barbs against the Americans play well to his fans at home but cannot mask the intrinsic intractability of his relations with the Russians. Nor can he simply ignore Turkey’s dependence on Europe for trade, investment and technology transfers. The country’s currency is again under siege and the president’s popularity is sinking.After lobotomising Turkish governance, it is tricky to go up against greater powers in the badlands surrounding Turkey. With a tamed media that hangs on his every outburst, and an inner circle shorn of all dissonant opinion, Erdogan has all the power he sought but no way of testing how to wield it.david.gardner@ft.com
269  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.Exploratory talks for a new coalition government led by Olaf Scholz are now officially under way in Germany and we wanted to examine the power dynamics among the potential junior partners — one of whom is likely to claim the finance ministry Scholz currently inhabits. Our profile today looks at both Robert Habeck from the third-placed Greens and Christian Lindner from the pro-business Free Democratic party that came in fourth.Over in Italy, tensions in the government coalition have reached a new peak, with the party of Matteo Salvini walking out of a meeting set to agree on a tax reform needed for the EU recovery fund.And in Brussels, a visit from Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, is designed to mollify recent transatlantic asperities after the Afghanistan withdrawal and the security pact with Australia and the UK that cut France out of a lucrative submarine deal.A picture is worth a thousand words, they say. So when the leaders of Germany’s Greens and pro-business Free Democrats met last week to hold their first round of preliminary talks, they posted a photo on each of their Instagram accounts. They used the same picture; the caption was identical. The picture speaks for itself, they told journalists who asked about its meaning.Cue a day of forensic German social media analysis. On the surface, it was a message of unity between two parties once seen more as foes than allies, writes Erika Solomon in Berlin.Now these two very different parties are the kingmakers of Germany — as long as they can co-operate. They will decide who will succeed Angela Merkel as chancellor: SPD candidate Scholz or Armin Laschet, candidate for the conservative CDU/CSU union.Even though the image was the same, subtle differences soon became apparent in the way the two frenemies — Green party co-leader Robert Habeck, and the head of the liberals, Christian Lindner — posted the picture.Habeck, who is 52 and sometimes dubbed “the philosopher” for having a PhD in philosophy and publishing several books, went for the full frame, without adding any filters — though critics mocked that as a touch of vanity, because it required adjusting Instagram’s automatic cropping.Lindner — who is 10 years younger, drives a Porsche and almost always wears a suit — left the automatic cropping, which cut out half of Habeck’s face. And he chose the type of flattering filter popular among his digital-forward young fans.The rivalry of the two men goes beyond their social media appearance: Habeck is a powerful orator of long speeches that amble along to a thoughtful conclusion. Lindner is the master of a perfectly timed retort.They could not be more different, but both of them want the same job: to become the country’s next finance minister. In Germany, the job is one of the most powerful government positions — not only does it hold the purse strings, it has veto powers over any government decision that could lead to additional expenditures.Both have their claims to the title.For nearly two years, Habeck has been studying up on financial policy, meeting bankers and finance ministers across Europe. He led the eco-party to a major overhaul of its vision on fiscal policy: he was instrumental, insiders say, to the Greens’ bold call for reforming Germany’s debt brake — anathema to nearly every other political party in the country, and especially to Lindner, a man of fiscal orthodoxy who calls such ideas his most important red lines.And yet, since a joint talk show appearance just days before the election, the two men who once barely disguised their disdain have been so courteous to one another it drew some mockery in the media: “Habeck and Lindner love each other,” one headline read. “Green and yellow [FDP] flirt” said another.It’s not hard to see why: They are too close to power to let personal animosities thwart their ambition, both for themselves and for the future of their parties.With the Greens and FDP having agreed yesterday to start three-way talks with the SPD, it looks more likely that Lindner, whose liberal party is furthest apart from the left-leaning SPD and Greens, will get the finance ministry.But Habeck is in for a win, too: The talk is now of him becoming vice-chancellor. He could also get the interior ministry — not the job he spent years preparing for, but nonetheless important. Through it, he could try to change the image of a party seen as soft on borders and security.There is still a long way to go before the picture is truly clear.This positive start is promising but some Greens point to the last coalition talks (in 2017), when their party and FDP were also poised to enter government together, only to have talks collapse at the last minute — a result the Greens blame on Lindner’s decision to withdraw.If Merkel has given the German language the verb merkeln, meaning to drag out a decision, some Green members have impishly devised a word inspired by the liberal politician: lindnern is to quit something at the last minute.Time will tell whether the selfie or the word turns out to be the better metaphor for these coalition talks.High polluters, low ambition: Only about a third of Europe’s largest companies have set a net zero target by 2050 (or sooner). Of these, just 9 per cent are on track to achieve those targets if they continue the pace of emissions reduction from the last decade, according to a study by Accenture.Tension within Italy’s government escalated earlier this week when the ministers of Matteo Salvini’s League party for the first time walked out on a cabinet meeting, writes Davide Ghiglione in Rome.League ministers on Tuesday refused to participate in the government meeting that approved the broad strokes of a controversial tax reform, which is one of the EU requirements for Italy’s next tranches of post-pandemic recovery loans and grants.The bill, which was initially promised by the end of July as part of Rome’s Recovery and Resilience plan, aims to simplify the system and reduce income tax.The decision to walk out of the cabinet meeting is the starkest sign so far of divisions within Italy’s government since former ECB president Mario Draghi was appointed prime minister last February.Draghi on Tuesday said the League’s move was “serious” and said “we are waiting for them to explain the implications”.Salvini told a press conference later in the day that the League “didn’t vote for the tax reform-enabling law because it didn’t contain what had been agreed”.But he also played down the significance of the move: “Our participation in the government will not be questioned.”The League said the bill would penalise taxpayers and was not adequately covered financially. The reform aims to update the taxable value of Italian real estate, which, according to the League, could result in higher housing levies.Draghi has said repeatedly that it will not weigh on public finances and that there is still ample scope for fine-tuning.“You might have the feeling that this is the last word on the tax system but luckily or unluckily the process isn’t so simple, it will take many years,” he said.Analysts see Salvini’s move as an attempt to regain ground in opinion polls, after his party’s lacklustre performance in local elections last week.Salvini’s “theatrical move”, said Gianluca Passarelli, professor of political science at Sapienza university in Rome, is “an attempt to make his mark at a time when he has to win back his supporters and is unable to position himself within the government”.Are the EU and US back to normal now, or still in the making up phase? Three weeks after Aukus and all that, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan is coming to Brussels today to reaffirm the message that it’s time to get back to business, writes Henry Foy in Brussels.Sullivan will hold meetings with Nato, EU commission and council officials, and “reaffirm the importance of the transatlantic alliance and consult on a range of shared interests”, the White House said.The smiles, handshakes and public statements will be pitched at conveying warm feelings about intense collaboration between the US and EU, and avoiding talk of submarine deals.But tougher words on bridging gaps in how to deal with China are likely to feature in the private discussions: Sullivan arrives in Brussels fresh from talks in Zurich with Yang Jiechi, Beijing’s top diplomat.The US and EU positions on China have moved closer in recent years but Washington is keen for even greater alignment. Indeed, Sullivan’s EU meetings will focus on “trade, technology, and global economic issues”, and come swiftly after the inaugural session of the US-EU Trade and Technology Council, where both sides agreed to “convergent” approaches to tech issues that could affect national security.After weeks of continual reassurance that the alliance with the Americans is rock-solid, EU officials should have got the message. Now they can expect a few reminders that transatlantic collaboration and mutual support cut both ways.
270  Brussels is powerless to prevent the gas price surge that is hitting consumers across Europe, the EU’s energy commissioner has said as she rebuffed demands from member states to act now to address the crisis.Kadri Simson told the Financial Times that Brussels had no powers to provide short-term fixes but would encourage governments to offer “targeted” national support, including cutting energy taxes.She also stepped away from promising sweeping regulatory changes to the bloc’s internal energy market, which some member states have blamed for exacerbating the crisis.“The reasons behind high global energy prices are not created here in Europe,” said Simson. “Several of our proposals will be addressing long-term solutions,” she added, referring to options including joint EU gas procurement and better storage facilities to act as a buffer against further supply shocks.Europe’s governments are at loggerheads over how to respond to an electricity price surge driven by record global demand for natural gas and limited storage capacity in the EU.France, Spain and eastern member states have demanded Brussels provide immediate palliatives to protect households and consumers from rising costs — on top of subsidies that some governments have already authorised.France and Spain also want Brussels to scrap a system of marginal pricing, where the cost of electricity is determined by the last, most expensive source of energy bought. Simson made clear the European Commission is unlikely to reform energy pricing rules.Simson said the internal energy market, set up in 1990s to help liberalise electricity supply, was not responsible for the price rises but “had opened up new possibilities for smaller producers” encouraging investment in green technologies.“The market is not dominated by the big players and is open for smaller renewable installations. We are monitoring what different member states are asking us to do. But there are not many voices who are asking us to change something that is not behind high prices,” she said.Brussels will also test EU support for reforms including joint procurement and common storage for natural gas.But Simson warned that previous attempts for Brussels to purchase gas on behalf of all member states had been bogged down in complications.“It has not become a reality because there are lots of practical obstacles. It is complex for the commission to have the permission to negotiate on behalf of member states who have different energy mixes and different rules on how they trade gas,” she said.The energy crisis has also put EU climate policies under scrutiny.Poland, Spain and the Czech Republic have complained about the EU’s carbon market, known as the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) which forces leading electricity producers to pay for carbon credits to cover the cost of pollution. The price of carbon credits has shot to records above €60 a tonne in the past month, prompting some countries to warn market speculators are driving up costs for consumers.Simson said the commission, which regulates the carbon market, had no such evidence. “We don’t have any concrete examples of market manipulation on the ETS. There are inbuilt safeguards designed to limit extreme rises,” she said.CO2 pricing is at the heart of EU debate about how to reach the bloc’s target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Poorer eastern and southern countries, as well as France, are vehemently opposed to extending the ETS to consumer facing sectors such as transport and heating. They argue it will have a regressive impact on the poorest households.The ETS extension is among a host of policies under the EU’s landmark Green Deal, a package of 13 policies designed to set the bloc on a path of radical decarbonisation. Germany, the Netherlands, and the Nordics are determined not to let the price rises derail broader climate measures and are wary of EU intervention in what they see as a short-term crisis.“The current price rises have many causes and we shouldn’t mix that up with [EU climate policies]”, said Svenja Schulze, Germany’s environment minister, during an EU meeting on Wednesday.@mehreenkhnLetter in response to this article:Here’s how Brussels sees off the yellow vest protests / From Barry Lynham and Mark Fell, Managing Directors, Knauf Energy Solutions, Brussels, Belgium
271  Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats won Germany’s election. Now comes the hard part.The SPD is set to start talks on Thursday with two smaller parties, the Greens and the liberals, on forming a coalition that has no precedent in Germany’s postwar history.Should the negotiations on a “traffic-light” alliance succeed it will mark a decisive break with the era of Angela Merkel, the country’s outgoing leader. Control of the chancellery could pass from Merkel’s centre-right CDU/CSU to the Social Democrats for the first time in 16 years.But the obstacles on the road to a traffic light deal are immense. The amber element — the Free Democrats (FDP) — are libertarian, business-friendly and pro-free market, with a commitment to cutting taxes and reducing state involvement in the economy. The left-leaning, more dirigiste SPD and Greens want to use the power of the state to modernise Germany and achieve carbon neutrality by 2045.“It is the FDP that now faces the biggest challenge — how to position itself . . . between two parliamentary groups — the SPD and Greens — that have shifted to the left,” said Julia Klöckner, deputy leader of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union.The partners themselves are more optimistic. “I don’t see any irreconcilable differences,” said Johannes Fechner, a senior SPD MP. “The rifts between the parties are not nearly as large as they’re made out to be.”If anyone can bridge the gaps between the potential coalition partners and ensure a good working atmosphere during the talks, it is Scholz, Fechner added. “He’s not the type who has to be the first to tweet something and pursue a quick headline,” he said. “He’s trustworthy and sober, and that’s what you need in talks like these.”It might also help that Scholz, finance minister since 2018, is one of Germany’s most gifted negotiators. He was, after all, a driving force behind the international deal reached in July when more than 130 countries agreed to the principle of a global 15 per cent minimum corporate tax rate.Robert Habeck, co-leader of the Greens, who successfully negotiated a coalition with the CDU and FDP in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein in 2017, has a similar reputation. “He’s a highly cautious, far-sighted politician and a huge asset for the Greens in this situation,” said Andreas Rödder, a historian at Mainz University.Another crucial actor will be Volker Wissing, the FDP’s general secretary, who was one of the architects of Germany’s first traffic light experiment — a regional tie-up between SPD, FDP and Greens in the south-western state of Rhineland-Palatinate, which has been in office since 2016.Wissing’s enthusiasm for the “traffic light” group is partly driven by antipathy towards the CDU, which has its roots in his experience of the last CDU-FDP government. The liberals were unable to implement any of their policies, haemorrhaged voters and ended up being booted out of parliament in 2013.That is why it is so important for them to get their way this time, experts say. “For the FDP, the 2009-13 coalition was the worst thing that happened in the party’s entire history,” said Uwe Jun, a political scientist at the University of Trier. “That’s why it’s understandable that it wants its policies to end up in some shape or form in the traffic-light coalition agreement.”But the negotiators will also have to deal with broad-church parties that each contain “widely divergent tendencies”, said Rödder. Finding consensus in the talks will be hard, but selling the deal to all the three parties’ various factions might prove harder still.That is particularly the case with the SPD. Olaf Scholz might be a centrist, but the Social Democrat leaders, Saskia Esken and Norbert Walter-Borjans, are leftists who enjoy broad support in the party, as does deputy leader Kevin Kühnert, a former leader of the party’s youth wing.“The differences on things like fiscal policy between [FDP leader] Christian Lindner and the SPD of Esken, Walter-Borjans and Kühnert are huge,” said Rödder.SPD MP Fechner said that was an exaggeration. People like Esken and Kühnert “know that one has to strike compromises”, he said. “They and Scholz have been working very well together.”The FDP and Greens have stressed that another option exists if traffic light fails. They both signalled on Wednesday that they were still open to the possibility of “Jamaica”, a black-green-yellow coalition with the CDU/CSU. Lindner said on Wednesday that the FDP had the “biggest overlap with the CDU/CSU when it comes to policy”.But some in the centre-right have already ruled out that option. “Traffic light is coming,” said Markus Söder, the prime minister of Bavaria, and leader of the CSU. “A completely new era is dawning for the CDU/CSU, and we really have to start preparing for it.”
272  Nato has expelled eight “undeclared intelligence officers” from the Russian delegation to the military alliance, and halved the total size of Moscow’s representation, in a move that will further deteriorate relations between western militaries and the Kremlin.The decision will reduce the maximum size of the Russian delegation to Nato headquarters in Brussels to just 10 diplomats, further eroding a communication channel designed to promote dialogue and confidence-building between Russia’s armed forces and the western alliance.“We have withdrawn the accreditation of eight members of the Russian mission to Nato, who were undeclared Russian intelligence officers,” a Nato official said in a statement. Two other accreditations, currently vacant, will be withdrawn. The decision will come into effect at the end of the month.“We have strengthened our deterrence and defence in response to Russia’s aggressive actions, while at the same time we remain open for a meaningful dialogue,” the official added.But Russia’s deputy foreign minister Alexander Grushko said the move implied recent Nato member states’ comments in favour of de-escalation of tension with Russia and re-establishing a bilateral dialogue were a bluff. “If anyone believed those statements were sincere, then today nobody does. Everyone understands their real goal,” he told Russian newspaper Kommersant.Relations between the Kremlin and western capitals are at a post-Cold War nadir following Moscow’s invasion and annexation of Crimea in 2014, allegations of Russian meddling in western elections, and the attempted assassination and subsequent jailing of opposition activist Alexei Navalny.Tensions with Nato have also risen this year because of a decision by Moscow to rapidly deploy a large military force on the border of Ukraine in April, and after large-scale war games and defence exercises conducted this summer in eastern Europe by Russian and Nato troops.Nato’s decision to remove the accreditations follows a spate of diplomatic expulsions involving Russia and western powers this spring, where more than 150 envoys from both sides were sent home in the space of a fortnight.Some of those diplomats were expelled by Moscow or foreign capitals as alleged spies, while others were kicked out in tit-for-tat responses.Nato first reduced the maximum size of the Russian delegation from 30 to 20 diplomats in response to the attempted assassination of double agent Sergei Skripal in the UK in 2018.Russia’s delegation to Nato was set up in 1998 and mirrors a Nato military liaison office in Moscow. The respective envoys were designed to facilitate information-sharing between Brussels and Moscow prior to 2014, when formal co-operation was suspended following the invasion of Crimea.Moscow says Nato is increasing its deployment of troops and weaponry close to the borders of Russia, in breach of an agreement between the two sides.Nato says Russia’s military activities “continue to make the Euro-Atlantic security environment less stable”, and accuses Moscow of regular violations of the airspace of member states, cyber attacks and disinformation campaigns.Both sides claim the other is developing weapons that are in breach of international treaties.
273  Gas markets swung sharply on Wednesday after Russia’s president Vladimir Putin said his country was prepared to stabilise the soaring global energy prices that are threatening to curb industrial activity and sharply raise inflation.UK and European natural gas prices shot higher early in the day to trade at close to 10 times their level from the beginning of the year. But prices abruptly reversed course hours later when Putin hinted that Russia’s state-backed monopoly pipeline exporter, Gazprom, may increase supplies to help Europe avoid a full-blown energy crisis.“Let’s think through possibly increasing supply in the market, only we need to do it carefully. Settle with Gazprom and talk it over,” Putin said. “This speculative craze doesn’t do us any good.”Gas traders say one of the drivers of the rally in prices is that Russia is limiting its European gas supplies to the levels in long-term contracts, and has let Gazprom’s storage facilities in the continent fall to very low levels.Putin said Gazprom was exceeding its contractual obligations for gas supplies through Ukraine this year.His remarks appeared aimed at staving off criticism from Europe that Russia is holding back supplies as it awaits approval for the controversial new Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which bypasses Ukraine to send gas to Germany. That project edged closer to going live on Wednesday after a judicial opinion in the EU.UK gas contracts for November delivery surged almost 40 per cent as trading opened to reach more than £4 per therm, having started the year below 50p. But after Putin’s intervention, they ended the day down 9 per cent, at £2.71.The gas industry was shaken by the swings in the price. Tom Marzec-Manser at ICIS, a consultancy, said it was “the most volatile and unpredictable day that many in the industry will ever witness”.Jennifer Granholm, the US secretary of energy, told the FT the US was “carefully” watching Russia’s role in the European gas crisis and trying to find ways to help, including assessing whether Gazprom was manipulating the market. “You don’t want to see energy made into a weapon,” she said.Ukraine and other eastern European countries have accused Russia of trying to “weaponise” gas supplies.Poland’s climate minister Adam Guibourgé-Czetwertyński called on the European Commission to investigate what he said were “clear signs of market manipulation” from Gazprom. Speaking at a meeting of EU ministers on Wednesday, the minister said: “We have to be assertive in the face of Russian coercion.”Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there was “absolutely no Russian role in what is happening on the gas market”. Angela Merkel appeared to lend support to Moscow, saying it was “not the case” that there were orders for gas that Russia had not supplied. “Russia can only deliver gas on the basis of contractual obligations,” Germany’s chancellor said. “That’s why we should ask the question: was enough gas ordered, or is the high price at the moment maybe the reason for not ordering so much?”Record natural gas prices are one symptom of a global battle to secure fuel supplies after demand rebounded rapidly from the depths of the pandemic. The price of coal, which is used to generate electricity and for heating, has also surpassed its all-time peak set in 2008.“An energy crisis is unfolding with winter in the northern hemisphere still to begin,” said Stephen Brennock of PVM, an energy brokerage in London.Domestic production of gas in Europe has fallen sharply, while demand in Asia has risen as countries increasingly seek alternatives to highly polluting coal, creating a bidding war for cargoes of liquefied natural gas.Rising energy prices are fuelling concerns about inflation, which has dented government bond prices, particularly in the UK.The UK is seen as more vulnerable to record gas prices than some countries in Europe because it has very limited storage capacity, leaving it reliant on a near just-in-time system of domestic production and imports from pipelines and seaborne cargoes.The vast majority of UK homes are heated with natural gas, and the country has shut more of its coal-fired power stations while adding renewables such as wind farms. On still days when wind power generation is lower, gas can make up more than 50 per cent of all electricity generation.Europe is also suffering from very high electricity prices as a result of the surge in energy costs. The EU said on Wednesday it would review the region’s power market and consider changes to regulation.French building materials company Saint-Gobain underscored the corporate impact on Wednesday when it said it was expecting energy and raw material cost inflation of about €1.5bn in 2021, up from its previous estimate of €1.1bn.Additional reporting by Mehreen Khan
274  Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz has been named by prosecutors as a suspect in an investigation into corruption, according to a copy of a warrant seen by the Financial Times after police raided ministries and political offices across Vienna on Wednesday.A warrant issued by the Central State Prosecutor for Economic Crime and Corruption (WKStA) cited Kurz as a suspect under suspicion of abetting bribery and perjury.Five other senior officials close to Kurz are also named in the warrant. None of the individuals named have been formally charged in the investigation.The probe centres on whether fake invoices were generated at the finance ministry in order to direct €1.2m of government funding to pro-Kurz media outlets between 2016 and 2017, during Kurz’s tenure as Austrian foreign minister. At the time Kurz was positioning himself to take over the leadership of the mainstream conservative Austrian People’s party.Analysts said the probe was likely to deepen the problems facing the coalition government between the People’s party and the Green party.In a statement on Wednesday evening, Kurz said: “Groundless accusations are now being constructed against my team and me about events that in part date back five years.”The allegations had been “systematically constructed” by prosecutors taking SMS messages and communications out of context, the chancellor said.Previous investigations by the WKStA against party colleagues had come to nothing, Kurz pointed out. “I am convinced that these accusations, too, will soon turn out to be false.”The WKStA declined to comment.The People’s party said the investigation was “politically motivated” and “staged for show”. Party deputy general secretary and MP Gaby Schwarz said: “[It is] always the same goal and system: to massively damage the People’s party and Sebastian Kurz.”This week, senior People’s party officials said the WKStA was run by “leftist cells” who were unabashedly pursuing a political agenda to compromise the chancellor.Kurz promised this year to reform Austria’s prosecutorial system and criticised the WKStA for its incompetence and poor record in winning cases in court.Police raids, ordered by the WKStA, took place on Wednesday at the federal chancellery, the headquarters of the People’s party and at the finance ministry, two sources familiar with the WKStA investigation told the FT.The People’s party and Greens have been in coalition since the beginning of 2020.“There has never been an investigation into a chancellor like this in Austria’s postwar history,” said Austrian political analyst Marcus How at VE Insight. “Of course, Kurz is still just a suspect and hasn’t been charged but the question will be whether, even with this as an open investigation, the Green party will [want] to uphold the government.”The chancellor’s previous government, a coalition with the rightwing populist Freedom party, collapsed in 2019 after a corruption scandal. Freedom party leader, and vice-chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache was filmed on the island of Ibiza soliciting Russian support for his party in exchange for promises of government favours.Kurz’s relationship with the Greens has already been under strain.A separate and ongoing investigation into Kurz, for allegedly perjuring himself in front of an official parliamentary investigation, has been a sticking point in coalition relations this year.The WKStA’s new investigation is far more serious, however, analysts said.The allegations in its 104-page warrant seem “concrete”, according to the prominent Austrian political consultant Thomas Hofer.“Using the ministry of finance and the communications department there to generate fake invoices . . . this is totally crazy if it’s true. It is really taking the problems facing Kurz to another level,” Hofer said.“I think that if there is something in this — and we’re basically talking about kickbacks here — then it’s something I think the Greens will hardly be able to swallow.”
275  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
276  European chemical and steel companies have warned that soaring gas prices threaten the region’s economic rebound in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.Gas is used to generate electricity and is directly used to make products such as fertiliser, paper and plastics. Although most large companies had long-term supply contracts in place, a sustained increase in prices would lead to higher manufacturing costs, executives at several groups said.“It no longer makes economic sense to produce at these levels,” said Petr Cingr, chief executive of SKW Stickstoffwerke Piesteritz, Germany’s biggest producer of ammonia, which has been forced to reduce output by 20 per cent to offset the rising prices.Ammonia is an important input for one of the most commonly used fertilisers. Cingr called on the government to intervene to avert a total halt to operations, with severe consequences for Germany’s agriculture industry.Last month CF Industries stopped operations at two plants in the UK. Austrian chemicals group Borealis and Norway’s Yara International have also reduced production of ammonia.Representatives of other industries, including chemicals, steel and cement producers, all warned that rising costs were undermining their members’ competitiveness.In Italy, Giovanni Arvedi, founder and president of steelmaker Arvedi group, said that problems for the country’s producers were compounded by the fact that they had “on average . . . already higher energy costs than their main European competitors”. He added: “The current situation makes it even more urgent to standardise prices to achieve a freer and a more competitive market.”Alessandro Banzato, president of Federacciai, the Italian steel producers’ lobby, said: “The recent hikes in gas and electricity costs could slow down, if not jeopardise, the positive trend of the Italian and European economy.”In France, Befesa, a company that specialises in the collection and recycling of steel dust and aluminium residue, has extended maintenance pauses in production through to the end of the year.Chief executive Denis Chevé complained that the company was being “hit twice” - by rising electricity prices and the higher cost of carbon dioxide emissions on the EU’s trading scheme. “We can pass on the cost, but only partially, because we’re in a global market,” he added.Other companies are more confident about their ability to pass on price rises. French construction company Saint-Gobain said on Wednesday that it anticipated energy and raw material costs would rise by about €1.5bn this year but it expected to pass on the majority of its higher costs to consumers by increasing prices by roughly 8 per cent in the third quarter.Some of the bloc’s largest manufacturers, including Germany’s largest industrial group Linde, stressed that, despite the surges on the spot markets, their operations were protected by long-term contracts and hedging policies.Belgian chemicals group Solvay said it had a “dynamic hedging policy” for its energy. Aurubis, a German copper producer, said that while the higher energy costs had had a “negative impact on otherwise excellent operating profit before taxes in the past quarter”, it had managed to offset the impact through hedging. It therefore did not expect “any production downtime due to energy price developments”.Although several European governments have recently acted to cap household energy costs, industrial groups have by and large had to manage the increases themselves.“Those price decreases are very useful for individuals but it’s not a solution for industry,” said Frank Roubanovitch, president of Cleee, an association of big energy consumers in France.In Spain, electricity producers are subject to a windfall levy that the Socialist-led government has imposed on companies it says have benefited from the rise in electricity prices and which do not have corresponding gas and carbon costs of their own.Iberdrola has already written to big clients warning that it may have to renegotiate existing contracts with them because of the “extraordinary [and] unpredictable” impact of the new levy.Reporting by: Sylvia Pfeifer in London, Anna Gross in Paris, Joe Miller in Frankfurt, Davide Ghiglione in Rome, Daniel Dombey in Madrid, Peggy Hollinger in London
277  Good evening from London,There was some late afternoon drama today as Russian president Vladimir Putin said his country was prepared to step in and stabilise soaring energy prices, which have rocked financial markets and fuelled fears that the global economic recovery could be knocked off course.UK gas contracts for November delivery surged nearly 40 per cent as trading opened this morning to hit £4 per therm, having begun 2021 below 50p. But Putin’s offer — aimed at fending off criticism from Europe that Russia was holding back supplies — saw markets dramatically change course, sending the price down to £2.87.Aside from the demand caused by economies emerging from the pandemic, traders have pointed to multiple reasons for the spike in prices, including the sharp fall in domestic production in Europe. The UK, which has very limited storage capacity, is especially vulnerable to higher energy costs.Investors meanwhile have been increasingly worried that the increases will feed through into broader price rises across the economy, with UK inflation expectations at their highest level since 2008. This has resulted in government bond prices falling as well as hurting equities because of the effect on company profits.In the EU, member states are urging Brussels to take action to halt the price rises, with some arguing that the Green Deal to make the bloc climate neutral by 2050 would only push up energy costs further and could lead to social unrest. One senior EU politician has warned that the Green Deal could become “the symbol of high energy prices and we will have instead of gilets jaunes, gilets [protesting over] energy poverty everywhere”.Putin also hit out at EU policy, blaming “poorly thought through decisions” by Brussels officials for creating “serious imbalances” in European energy markets.But the gas price rises in Europe are just one sign of a wider energy crunch that is playing out across the world, as consumer countries battle to secure fuel supplies. US oil prices this week hit their highest level in seven years after Opec+ decided to maintain current production levels, while the price of coal topped its previous all-time peak set in 2008.China and India, seen by the IMF as the two biggest drivers of global growth and both heavily reliant on coal, have been hit by severe power shortages. China has suffered a “triple whammy” of emissions restrictions on power generation, a shortage of coal and price caps on electricity that mean demand is unaffected as input costs go up. India, which relies heavily on coal for its thermal power plants, has just four days of stocks left.Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura, has highlighted the global implications of the power shortages in China. “Global markets will feel the pinch of a shortage of supply from textiles [and] toys to machine parts . . . [and this will] very likely result in a shortage of goods for Thanksgiving and Christmas”, he said.For up-to-the-minute coronavirus updates, visit our live blogBoris Johnson has outlined his plans to restructure the UK economy in his keynote speech at the Tory party conference. The prime minister denied the country faced a supply chain crisis, as his government pivoted from saying labour shortages had nothing to do with Brexit to saying they were a sign of Brexit success that signalled an end to cheap, foreign labour. Meanwhile, pig farmers have started to cull healthy animals as the government refuses to help with shortages at abattoirs.“Ouch, this one hurts” was the reaction of one analyst to this morning’s data showing a sharp fall in German industrial orders in August thanks to supply chain problems and surging inflation. Orders fell by 7.7 per cent, rather than the 2.1 per cent expected by economists. The German automotive sector was hit particularly hard — a problem echoed in the UK — as car sales fell to their lowest level in two decades.Aside from those industries badly hit by labour shortages, economists believe most British workers can only look forward to modest wage gains in the near future and that any increases could be totally wiped out by inflation, write economics correspondent Delphine Strauss and chief political correspondent Jim Pickard.The US Senate will vote on the debt ceiling at 2pm ET (7pm London), with Democrats needing 10 Republicans to vote with them to raise the country’s borrowing limits.

278  Poland’s central bank has unexpectedly raised interest rates for the first time in almost a decade, amid a surge in inflation in the central European nation.The 40 basis point increase - the first rise by the National Bank of Poland (NBP) since 2012 - lifted the country’s benchmark rate to 0.5 per cent and sent the zloty up more than 1 per cent against the euro.The move, which follows interest rate rises in other central European nations, including the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania, comes as year-on-year inflation in Poland hit 5.8 per cent in September — its highest rate for 20 years.Yet despite the mounting inflationary pressures, most economists had not expected the central bank, which has been one of the more dovish in central Europe, to act so soon. Of 29 economists polled by Bloomberg, not one had forecast the increase.“Consensus was that the first rate hike would be delivered in November,” said Piotr Bujak, chief economist at PKO BP, Poland’s biggest bank.The NBP said in a statement that the factors driving inflation in Poland were largely beyond the control of domestic monetary policy, such as global energy and agricultural prices, and disruptions in supply chains.However, it added that it had decided to take action because although some of these factors would fade next year, others, such as the pressure from agricultural and energy prices, would remain, and in conjunction with the post-pandemic economic rebound, this meant inflation could remain “elevated longer than hitherto expected”.The NBP said that it could also intervene in foreign exchange markets, but did not make clear whether further interest rate rises could follow.Bujak said that while Wednesday’s move was “enough to be noticed by the public, and will definitely affect inflation expectations”, further moves were likely to be needed to tame inflation.“It seems that [the NBP] may deliver an additional hike in November. The question is by how much: 10, 25, 50 basis points? And then may be it will be enough for some time: then . . . it is likely that they will want to adopt a wait-and-see approach,” he said.Liam Peach, an economist at Capital Economics, predicted a more sustained increase, but conceded that there was “a lot of uncertainty about where the dovish members on the [monetary policy council] currently stand”.“We’ve pencilled in the policy rate rising to 2 per cent next year but we’ll be looking closely at the comments from policymakers over the coming weeks to assess whether there is appetite for such aggressive tightening,” he wrote.
279  The EU on Wednesday committed nearly €30bn to the western Balkans to aid development and propel its countries towards membership — but stopped short of committing to a date for an enlargement.Expanding the EU to include the six countries remains a contentious issue across much of the 27-nation bloc. Slovenia, holder of the EU’s rotating presidency, last month urged the EU to admit the six countries by 2030. Some member states, including Germany, resisted the idea of deadlines.The EU said it would provide €9bn in grants and €20bn of investment over seven years, and reaffirmed a commitment to expand.“The western Balkans is part of the same Europe as the European Union,” European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen told a press briefing after a joint summit of the member states and the six countries — Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia.“We want the western Balkans in the EU,” von der Leyen said. “There cannot be any doubt.”The €30bn package can be used for investments in energy, digital networks, roads and other sectors. The EU is keen to preserve as much influence as possible in the region as rivals including China also step up investment.The six prospective member states are at various stages of development, some held back by formalities, while others face more serious hurdles.North Macedonia’s EU talks cannot start because of a veto by Bulgaria, a member state. That also halts talks with Albania, whose accession is handled together with North Macedonia’s.“We are sorry that only one of the 27 member states is blocking the process for North Macedonia,” North Macedonian prime minister Zoran Zaev said at the summit.Bulgaria holds general elections next month — its third this year after two inconclusive votes in April and July — and a new government will hopefully end the stalemate soon, Zaev said.Serbia should work out an agreement with Kosovo, its former province that broke away in 2008 and which Belgrade refuses to recognise, leaders said.Von der Leyen said last week’s agreement to de-escalate tensions between Belgrade and Pristina were an example of the EU’s pacifying effect.Serbian president Aleksandar Vucic acknowledged that the issue must be resolved before EU accession becomes a reality for his country.Slovenian prime minister and summit host Janez Jansa said the alternative was undesirable. “If that (enlargement) perspective is not ensured, certain tragic events from history could be repeated, and I don’t think anyone wants to repeat that,” he said, alluding to the violent conflicts engulfing the region after the break-up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.
280  When last month’s “Aukus” defence deal between Canberra, London and Washington sank France’s plans to sell submarines to Australia and enraged the French, UK prime minister Boris Johnson insisted it was nothing for Paris to worry about. “Our love of France is ineradicable,” he said.Even before Aukus, however, the Franco-British relationship was plumbing new depths, largely because of what the French see as the UK’s failure to implement key parts of the Brexit deal.“We remain neighbours, partners and very close allies and have a common interest in ensuring this bilateral relationship is strong and durable, and even becomes deeper in matters of defence and security,” Clément Beaune, France’s Europe minister, told the Financial Times.“But, as they say, it takes two to tango. And now I’m afraid that all the signals being sent by the UK are negative.”Beaune, a confidant of President Emmanuel Macron, went on to threaten “retaliatory measures” against the UK over what the French say is deliberate, politically motivated foot-dragging by the UK in the granting of fishing licences for small French boats in British waters as agreed in the Brexit accord.Although the European Commission and other EU members have been careful to avoid backing French calls for sanctions over what is at the moment mainly a bilateral dispute over fish, Beaune and other ministers have suggested they may cut off electricity supply from France to Jersey and even Britain. The industry estimates France provides about 2.5 per cent of Britain’s annual supply.“We’re looking at all options, French and European,” said Beaune. “Everything is possible. It could be energy, it could be other products and other trade measures. It could of course be fisheries products themselves.”Another fight over the post-Brexit settlement concerns the Northern Ireland protocol — a matter on which France’s worries are shared more widely by its EU partners — under which Johnson agreed to border controls in the Irish Sea so that the region could remain part of the bloc’s single market, through an open land border with EU member Ireland.Lord David Frost, the UK’s Brexit minister, has vowed that the UK will suspend parts of the agreement unless it receives generous concessions on Northern Ireland from the EU, an act that Beaune said would be “a big breach of trust as well as mistake for the stability of Ireland”. At the ruling Conservative party’s conference in Manchester this week, UK ministers admitted that relations with Paris were in the deep freeze and likely to remain so, if not deteriorate further, until after next year’s French presidential contest because politicians there were playing to a domestic audience. “Hopefully things will thaw out after the elections,” said one senior minister.There is no regret in London over the signing of the Aukus pact. “Does anyone think the French would have acted any differently if the shoe was on the other foot?” said a cabinet minister.But there is an acceptance that France could make life difficult on a number of issues. One minister said the only consolation was that “things can hardly be any worse than they are now”.The underlying problem from the French perspective, according to analysts, is that neither Johnson nor his government are trusted in Paris.“I think it’s quite serious,” said Lord Peter Ricketts, former UK ambassador to France. “It’s not just a short-term row. It’s a deep loss of respect and trust . . . At the beginning, Macron was intrigued by Johnson after his victory. But now they [the French] have simply concluded that he’s untrustworthy and not a serious person.” The repeated flare-ups of hostility between the two sides are exacerbated by issues that predate Brexit, including the continued flow of migrants crossing the Channel in small boats despite UK-funded French attempts to stop them.The management of Covid-19 has also been problematic, with the UK at one point imposing burdensome restrictions on travellers from France that were assumed to be politically motivated.But Brexit and its aftermath remain the main bones of contention, with the pro-Brexit British press portraying the actions of Macron and the French as mean-spirited punishment for Britain having left the EU.Tit-for-tat jibes have become the norm. Johnson mocked Macron in “franglais” over France’s anger about Aukus, suggesting he “prenez un grip” and “donnez-moi un break”. That prompted Beaune to respond by scoffing at Brexiters who “want to tell us how everything works better in the UK than the EU”. “I’m not saying everything in the EU is perfect, but if Brexit is really about leaving Europe, then move on to something else,” he said. “To re-use that expression ‘Give us a break’, we’re just trying to defend our interests and make sure an agreement is respected.” Beaune also noted archly that if the Northern Ireland protocol was really such a big problem then there would be more shortages in Northern Ireland than the rest of the UK, when in fact the opposite was true.The one area where both sides remain keen to continue working together is in military operations, even if enthusiasm for joint development of defence equipment has faded over the past decade. “There are no two sets of armed forces that are more capable of integration,” Johnson said when trying to soothe Macron over Aukus.France has the same view of western Europe’s two biggest militaries. “The French have always been very concerned about making sure that the UK remains a key player in European security,” said Georgina Wright, head of the Europe programme at the Institut Montaigne. “There’s a willingness to move on from Brexit. Whether it’s climate change, security or migrants, France is pretty willing to work with the UK . . . But the [UK’s] souring relationship with Europe does bleed into the bilateral relationship.” For Mujtaba Rahman, of the Eurasia Group consultancy, Franco-British co-operation on defence and security is overshadowed by the current bad-tempered politics.“Unfortunately, the relationship is likely to be volatile for quite some time, as Macron enters a difficult election cycle and the UK continues to scapegoat the EU for domestic political advantage,” he said.
281  Brussels has been urged by a string of EU countries to find ways quickly to ease the continent’s gas crisis as prices surged to record levels because of supply fears.A number of European leaders have criticised the European Commission for not responding quickly enough, warning that soaring prices could imperil the continent’s economic recovery and risk potential social unrest.The rise in European gas prices, which hit another all-time high on Wednesday, has stoked criticism of the EU’s flagship Green Deal, a package of upcoming policies designed to make the continent climate neutral by 2050. Critics of the policy say it will push up energy costs for citizens as fossil fuels are phased out.At least three leaders used a gathering of EU members in Slovenia to urge the commission to find measures to mitigate the impact of the price surge and prevent a repeat, officials involved in the talks told the Financial Times, adding that the number of restive member states was growing.“The commission has to act immediately,” one senior EU politician told the FT.“Otherwise the Green Deal will be the symbol of high energy prices and we will have instead of gilets jaunes, gilets [protesting over] energy poverty everywhere,” the politician said, remembering French protests against rising fuel prices in 2018.France, Spain, the Czech Republic, Greece and Romania called publicly for policies to co-ordinate national responses and “immediately react to dramatic price surges”.Other countries, including Germany and other northern states, have warned against rushing into changes to the EU’s energy market. They say the price surge is being driven largely by rising demand and one-off factors. They also do not want the crisis to derail the bloc’s ambitious climate policies which member states are negotiating.The commission will next week publish a “toolbox” of short-term measures that governments can take to respond to the gas price surge, including policies to protect households from higher electricity costs. Brussels will then put forward a more sweeping energy package at the end of the year, addressing issues such as gas storage.Mario Draghi, Italy’s prime minister, said after the Slovenia meeting that the commission was ready to discuss buying energy on behalf of all member states. “The commission will present a proposal to be discussed at the next European Council,” he said.Frans Timmermans, EU commissioner in charge of the Green Deal, said Brussels was working to find a “consensus at EU level on how we can protect our citizens against undue price hikes”.“The level of social unrest if we leave the climate crisis untackled will be insupportable. Our children will wage wars over water and food if we don’t tackle the climate crisis,” said Timmermans.National concerns were raised at a private dinner of leaders on Tuesday evening, and in public comments at the opening of formal summit talks on Wednesday morning.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban laid part of the blame for rising energy costs on the EU’s proposal to raise the cost of pollution by extending its emissions trading scheme, calling it “indirect taxation” on citizens.“Partly the reason why the prices are up is the fault of the commission,” he said. “We have to change some regulations, otherwise everybody will suffer.”EU estimates suggest about 12 to 15 per cent of the current electricity price surge can be attributed to the bloc’s carbon market, where power generators buy credits to cover the cost of pollution.Timmermans told EU ministers on Wednesday that the record carbon price had generated almost €11bn in additional revenues for governments in the first nine months of this year, compared with 2020. Almost all the proceeds go into the budgets of EU member states and can be used to shield consumers from price hikes.Commission president Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday said that while the gas price surge was “a serious issue” it was further proof of the EU’s support for renewable energy.Any common EU responses — such as boosting storage capacity and building up strategic gas reserves — are likely to address medium and long-term concerns rather than the immediate supply crunch.Additional reporting by Davide Ghiglione in Rome
282  Mali has summoned the French ambassador to Bamako as the row between the west African country at the centre of a jihadist insurgency in the Sahel and the ex-colonial power leading the fight against it deepened over its decision to consider hiring Russian private security business Wagner Group.The move came in response to comments by French president Emmanuel Macron, who last week said any deal with Wagner, first reported by Reuters, would “certainly” destroy the countries’ alliance and said Mali’s ruling military junta lacked “democratic legitimacy” after it took power in two successive coups in the past year.“The minister called on the French authorities to show restraint, avoiding value judgments,” the Malian foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. It added that foreign minister Abdoulaye Diop “strongly protested [against Macron’s] regrettable remarks, which are likely to harm the development of friendly relations.”Tensions have steadily risen since Macron in July announced plans to halve France’s 5,000-troop count in the Sahel, eight years after it first intervened to crush a jihadist insurgency that captured northern Mali. Despite the presence of French soldiers and a 13,000-strong UN peacekeeping force, the violence has spread to central Mali and into neighbouring Niger and Burkina Faso, killing thousands and displacing millions.Over that period, anti-French sentiment has grown among both civilians and politicians, with Macron going so far as to summon the leaders of Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad and Mauritania to a summit in France last year to publicly reiterate their desire for its troops to remain in the region.Relations have severely deteriorated since then.In a defiant speech at the UN general assembly last month, interim prime minister Choguel Maiga slammed France for its “abandonment” of Mali, and said it was seeking other help “to fill the gap which will certainly result from the withdrawal of Barkhane [French troops] in the north of the country”. Also in New York, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov acknowledged the contact between Mali and Russian security firms.French defence minister Florence Parly, who made a last-minute trip to the region in an effort to thwart a deal with Wagner, said the junta was “wiping [their] feet on the blood of French soldiers”. Macron repeatedly warned that France could pull its troops.Other international powers have warned that hiring Wagner could isolate the country and throw into question the billions of dollars in aid and military support and thousands of foreign troops helping the country.EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said a potential deal with Wagner was a “red line”, while Ivory Coast president Alassane Ouattara said it would be “suicide”. Germany and Estonia both threatened to withdraw troops stationed in Mali, while the US defence department on Tuesday warned that such a deal “would complicate the international response in support of the transition government”.But last Thursday, the junta took delivery of four Russian helicopters it bought from Moscow, along with donated weapons and ammunition. Speaking to reporters on the tarmac, interim defence minister Sadio Camara described Russia as a “friendly country, with which Mali has always maintained a very fruitful partnership”.Wagner is not a legal entity but a group of connected companies linked to Evgeny Prigozhin, the Russian businessman known as “Putin’s chef”. Its fighters have been accused of alleged war crimes and gross human rights violations in Libya and the Central African Republic, where they are widely viewed as controlling the national security apparatus.
283  Germany’s Greens and liberals are to launch talks with the Social Democrats on forming a coalition government, in a move that could end the centre-right’s 16-year hold on power in Europe’s largest economy.The talks increase the chances that Olaf Scholz, finance minister, will succeed Angela Merkel when she quits the political stage after four terms as chancellor.FDP leader Christian Lindner said he had already proposed to Scholz, the SPD’s candidate for chancellor, that the three parties start exploratory talks as early as Thursday.Scholz welcomed the move, saying polls showed that the “will of the people of this country” was for the SPD to form a coalition with the FDP and Greens. “It is now up to us to implement [that will],” he added. “Voters gave us a mandate to form a government together.”An SPD-Green-liberal coalition has been on the cards since last month’s national election, which was narrowly won by the Social Democrats while the CDU/CSU slumped to its worst-ever result.It would be the first three-party coalition in Germany’s post-war history and mark a break with the dominance of the Christian Democrats, who have governed Europe’s economic powerhouse for 52 of the past 72 years.Since the election the Greens and FDP have held talks with each other, and separately with the SPD and the CDU/CSU, to explore what kind of coalition to aim for.The FDP, a liberal, pro-free market party, favoured a tie-up with the CDU/CSU and Greens — an alliance known as “Jamaica” in Germany because the parties’ black, green and yellow colours match those of the Caribbean country’s flag.“We have most in common with the CDU/CSU when it comes to policy, and that was confirmed in our talks,” Lindner told reporters on Wednesday. “In policy terms, Jamaica is for us the viable option.”But he said a “public discussion” had broken out regarding the CDU/CSU’s “unity and will to govern” — a reference to the fierce internal attacks on CDU leader Armin Laschet since the party’s election defeat and the intensifying speculation that he could face a challenge to his leadership.Lindner also said the FDP would only join a “government of the centre, which strengthens the value of freedom and sets a real impulse for the renewal of our country”.Robert Habeck, co-leader of the Greens, said his party was not “wholly ruling out Jamaica” but said a “traffic-light” coalition of SPD (red), Greens and FDP (yellow) had the “greatest possible overlap in terms of policy”.Co-leader Annalena Baerbock said: “It makes sense, in view of the similarities we’ve been able to ascertain in our bilateral talks, to hold more in-depth talks with the FDP and SPD, and that’s what we’re proposing to the FDP.”Divisions emerged between Laschet’s CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, over what the FDP and Greens’ statements meant. Markus Söder, CSU leader and prime minister of Bavaria, said they amounted to a “de facto rejection of Jamaica”.“We have to accept reality,” he said in Munich. “We have to get used to the idea that there will probably be a government without the CDU/CSU.”Laschet interpreted the smaller parties’ move differently, saying the CDU/CSU remained open to further exploratory talks. “We stand ready as a negotiating partner, the CDU and CSU,” he said. The FDP had “made it clear that in many, many points there is agreement with the CDU/CSU”.
284  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.Leaders were asking themselves some searching questions about the EU’s role in the world and its military reliance on the US last night as the member states met for their first dinner discussion following the withdrawal from Afghanistan and the US-UK-Australia defence pact. Views continue to differ, however, on topics ranging from the EU’s role in stabilising gas prices to the importance of the transatlantic partnership and the relationship with China.One of the leaders who arrived late in Slovenia last night was President Klaus Iohannis of Romania, whose government just fell apart back home after losing a confidence vote. We’ll look at what options are on the table and why the opposition came to the vote with an unusual prop — a Superman dummy.Changing gears, the head of the EU’s Single Resolution Board in an interview with Europe Express warns about risk-taking by banks that are easily able to suck up deposits thanks to new fintech platforms that have developed between banks and customers.Europe’s ever-ascending gas prices hit fresh records as EU leaders gathered over dinner in Slovenia last night, throwing the bloc’s growing energy crisis into sharp relief, write Mehreen Khan and Sam Fleming.The focus of the discussions in Brdo was on defence policy and Europe’s place in the world.But closer to home, European governments have spent weeks hand-wringing about the rising cost of electricity, which has been caused by a host of factors mostly beyond their control.Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has been testing some potential palliatives, including setting up a common EU “strategic gas reserve” to be tapped in future emergencies.Creating common EU gas stocks would address one of the major gaps in the bloc’s internal energy market. About a dozen member states have national gas reserves but there is no common EU framework to ensure shared capacity across the bloc’s 27 member states.But bolstering storage capacity is a medium-term solution, rather than an answer to the immediate problem of soaring energy bills and rising demand for gas during the winter months.Jan Cornillie, a research associate at the European University Institute, said an EU strategic reserve was “not a quick fix but it can be a help. Europe’s capacity is under-developed.”Countries facing the biggest strains such as Spain, France, Greece, Romania and the Czech Republic want the commission to come up with common rules on storage and to explore joint EU gas procurement. But others which have largely escaped huge price increases are not convinced of the merits because of the costliness of said policies. “The question here is how much Europe can even do, if it isn’t more a matter for member states,” said Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte after the dinner.The commission will put forward a communication on the energy topic later this month, and the issue will be more thoroughly debated when the European Council convenes on October 21 in Brussels.While last night’s dinner in Brdo touched on energy matters, the idea behind the meeting was to focus on broader strategic questions over the EU’s place on the international stage — including its heavy reliance on US defence capabilities and Europe’s shifting relationship with China.Among the questions debated were the lessons from the US-led withdrawal from Afghanistan, as well as the defence pact between the US, Australia and the UK. French angst over the latter alliance was fully on display in Brdo, but officials stressed deeper concerns were also apparent, in particular calls for the EU to sharply bolster its defence spending and turn Europe into a more capable military partner to the US.The discussion revealed long-established differences between member states, as some northern and eastern leaders in particular placed their focus firmly on Nato and the transatlantic partnership rather than notions of independence and “strategic autonomy”.Nevertheless, the hope was for the debate to help inform preparations for an upcoming “strategic compass” for defence and security, the first draft of which is expected in November, and a planned defence summit in March. The EU is also working on a joint declaration with Nato.“Drawing the lessons of recent crises, we are committed to consolidating our strengths and strengthening our resilience by reducing our critical dependencies,” said Charles Michel, the European Council president, in conclusions from the dinner. “To become more effective and assertive on the international stage, the European Union needs to increase its capacity to act autonomously.”Electric vehicles still only make up about 1 per cent of the global fleet of passenger cars, but sales are taking off rapidly. Within four years, one-quarter of new cars bought in China and nearly 40 per cent of those purchased in Germany are expected to be electric. (More here)Elke König, chair of the EU’s Single Resolution Board, has warned supervisors to watch out for excessive risk-taking by banks that are hoovering up deposits via new fintech platforms, writes Sam Fleming.Deposit aggregators sit between banks and their customers, advising them of changing interest rates and helping them spread savings across multiple banks. In an interview, König said these fintech groups provided useful transparency across countries and acknowledged the “incredible benefit” to consumers of being able to pick rates from a range of banks.But she said banks could be encouraged to take on excess risk while enjoying a “free ride” on the EU’s multibillion-euro system for insuring deposits. “It’s an easy way to fund yourself, but if you turn it around it’s a free ride on the DGS [deposit guarantee system],” said König, who is responsible for winding down failing banks.The collapse this year of Greensill Capital raised questions about fintech companies that link depositors to banks. Part of the UK supply-chain finance group’s approach was to offer high interest rates on deposits, which it attracted via comparison websites.“It’s for the supervisors and deposit insurance system to be aware and to perhaps step in if they get the feeling a bank is accumulating deposits and increasing its risk profile dramatically,” said König.Greensill owned a German bank which has been declared insolvent. German fintech groups Raisin and Deposit Solutions, which struck a merger deal this summer aimed at creating a group linking banks with depositors, both listed accounts at Greensill Bank.Tamaz Georgadze, chief executive of Raisin DS, said deposit platforms not only improve customer choice but help banks diversify their funding mix. “Thus, the platforms improve banks’ stability and contribute towards creating a more resilient financial system.”König gave a broadly positive assessment of the health of the European banks, observing that Europe had not seen the huge surge in insolvencies and non-performing loans that regulators had feared from the Covid-19 crisis. That was in part because governments had offered companies and individuals hundreds of billions of euros of pandemic-related support.“The situation is, at least when you look at financial institutions, far better than we expected,” König said. “That avalanche has clearly not materialised and I’m not expecting it any more.”The SRB was formed in the wake of the eurozone financial crisis to wind down stricken banks while securing financial stability. But the agency is still working with an incomplete system of EU bank-crisis rules and a patchwork of different national arrangements.The worrying feature of the regulatory landscape, König said, was the lack of meaningful momentum on completion of the EU’s Banking Union project — meant to unite the way banks operate across the bloc — and other parts of banking regulation.“We are in a situation where the crisis seems to be fading away . . . and therefore it becomes incredibly difficult to move the files forward,” König said. “We are very lucky not to see a financial crisis at our hands. It takes away a bit [of] the urgency of finalising our Banking Union.”In early September, Romania’s Prime Minister Florin Citu posted a deepfake video on his Instagram account, depicting him as Superman — a nod to his intent to power through a brewing government crisis.That crisis has now brought his 10-month old government down in a no-confidence vote initiated by his main opposition rival Social Democrats (PSD), which fittingly placed a crashed Superman doll inside the parliament yesterday, writes FT’s south-east Europe correspondent Marton Dunai.The move was supported by Citu’s former coalition ally, the liberal USR party, that had left the government last month in a dispute over the sacking of their justice minister.Even as he will stay on as outgoing premier until a new government is formed, Citu’s political survival is unlikely, despite the support he enjoys from President Klaus Iohannis.Iohannis said yesterday he would not name a new PM until next week, as parties had to come to some sort of an agreement to end the political crisis and deal with several other emergencies — including a rapidly climbing fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic (Romania ranks second-to-last in the EU in terms of vaccinations).For their part, PSD said they wanted to end the crisis fast and hold snap elections.“We want to resolve the situation as soon as possible,” PSD vice-president Victor Negrescu told Europe Express. “We believe the current parliament does not allow the formation of a stable government, so we need a technocratic, expert government to ensure a transition towards snap election.”Citu’s former allies in the USR urged the president to act faster.“Why wait a week?” asked USR vice-chair Claudiu Nasui. “We will see what proposal for prime minister [Iohannis] makes. If it is Citu, we will not support [the government], if not, we are open to it.”Iohannis said politicians should end jockeying and start working as the country’s Covid crisis is exacerbated by the rise in energy prices and now topped by a government crisis. Adding hurt to injury, Romania’s central bank (not part of the euro) delivered a surprise rate increase yesterday, for the first time since 2018.
285  Divorcing English expatriates are turning to London’s family courts to settle costly maintenance claims following a change in rules brought by Britain’s departure from the EU, lawyers say.Estranged couples living and working in the Middle East or Asia have been able to bring cases more easily in England and Wales since regulations governing European maintenance fell away after January 1 2021 when the Brexit transition period ended.“We are already seeing more maintenance claims now the rules have changed,” said Alexandra Tribe, managing partner at law firm Expatriate Law.“It is good news for expatriates wanting to bring a claim in England but who are living in countries like Dubai where spousal maintenance can be limited to three months after divorce.” she added.Whether or not a case is heard before the English courts can make a substantial difference to the size of any financial divorce settlement.London has been dubbed “divorce capital of the world” because of the generosity of judges in splitting wealth equally between a divorcing couple, even if one spouse is the main earner.Before Brexit, a spouse temporarily living abroad who treated England as their permanent home, under the so-called “sole domicile” rule, could see their attempts to use domestic courts blocked or limited if one party objected, or the case fell outside certain exemptions.But these EU regulations no longer apply, making it easier for expatriates who claim sole domicile to bring an action in England.In cases where there is not enough money to make an upfront divorce settlement payment, British courts can opt to award annual maintenance payments, sometimes for life — as well as award a lump sum or a property transfer.In other countries like France, maintenance is often strictly time limited and only paid for three years.Rebecca Hick, solicitor at law firm Seddons, said: “It is still early days, but now the floodgates may have opened, we expect to see a rise in maintenance claims being brought in our courts from British citizens living abroad seeking to benefit from the more generous approach to maintenance in England and Wales generally.”Family lawyers say that Britain’s exit from the EU has caused greater uncertainty and they expect there to be more litigation if divorce proceedings are simultaneously filed in two different countries with no statutory legal instrument determining which set of proceedings will take priority.Before Brexit, parties were bound by the EU’s Brussels II regulations which meant that an English divorce decree or ruling was automatically recognised in another EU member state and vice versa.Now lawyers say there may be difficulties in enforcing judgments - including those related to maintenance - from one country’s courts in another if there are parallel court proceedings.“There is still a lot of uncertainty within family law post Brexit,” says Nathaniel Groarke, partner at law firm Irwin Mitchell.“Whereas once you could start the divorce in England, safe in the knowledge that if you got there first, the English courts would have jurisdiction. Now, if there is a challenge to jurisdiction, the courts would need to consider which is the most appropriate country to deal with the divorce.”“There is now the very real possibility of parallel proceedings taking place in two countries, with the potential for a race to divorce and even conflicting judgments.” adds Daniel Eames, partner at Michelmores and chair of the international committee of Resolution, which represents 6,500 family lawyers and other professionals.Lawyers say that some uncertainty could be resolved if Britain joined the 2007 Lugano Convention which determines which countries’ courts have jurisdiction over disputes. However, in July Brussels announced the UK would be blocked from joining the convention.
286  EU member states have reduced tensions with the UK over Gibraltar - one of the post-Brexit points of contention between Britain and the bloc - by dropping a Brussels proposal for Spanish authorities to police entry into the UK territory.Diplomats told the FT that at a meeting of EU ambassadors on Tuesday, member states agreed instead to propose that officials from Frontex, the pan-EU border force, are stationed at Gibraltar’s port and airport alongside local officials.The move puts the EU’s negotiating position for the bloc’s talks with London over the future of the territory in line with a British-Spanish deal reached on New Year’s Eve last year. The final agreement has to be codified in a UK-EU treaty.A goal of the talks is to facilitate movements to and from Spain by incorporating Gibraltar into the EU’s Schengen free movement area, which would in effect make the British overseas territory part of the bloc’s external border.But in July the European Commission sparked anger in the UK when it published draft guidelines for the negotiations that deviated from the agreement with Madrid by calling for Spanish border authorities, rather than Frontex, to help police Gibraltar’s ports. Dominic Raab, then foreign secretary, rejected the idea, saying it would “undermine the UK’s sovereignty over Gibraltar”.Both UK and Spanish diplomats expressed relief at the shift in the EU negotiating mandate. While the European Commission was concerned about a deal that could set precedents elsewhere — for example in Northern Ireland — both Madrid and London argued they wanted practical solutions to handling post-Brexit ties.“This is what we previously agreed,” said a Spanish official. However, the mandate has not yet been published so it remains unclear how close it is to Madrid’s deal with LondonGibraltar’s post-Brexit status stands out because the territory is dependent on around 15,000 workers crossing the border every day from Spain, as well as vital goods, such as food.As a result, the territory wants closer ties with Spain, such as Schengen membership, than it enjoyed while the UK was a member of the bloc. In turn, Spain is eager for the neighbouring region of the Campo de Gibraltar, one of the poorest parts of the country, to benefit more from the territory economically.But both sides were aware that the Commission’s proposals to station Spanish border police at Gibraltar’s port and airport could revive the dispute over the territory’s sovereignty that stretches back to the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, under which it was ceded to Britain.Madrid does not recognise UK sovereignty over Gibraltar, which it argues is a “colonial vestige [that] destroys the national unity and territorial integrity of Spain”. The country’s socialist-led government has maintained that position but has argued that economic relations on the ground — and closer ties overall — can matter “more than flags”.The UK said it would not comment on the mandate until it was published by the EU. However, officials expressed satisfaction that Frontex, which answers to Brussels rather than Madrid, would be involved.An EU source said “a number of changes have been introduced to the draft text” without specifying them, adding that the talks would not seek to tackle issues of sovereignty and jurisdiction.
287  Ireland has said it is “confident” it can sign a revised global corporate tax deal that would ditch the 12.5 per cent corporate rate that has been a cornerstone of its economic policy for two decades.This has raised expectations that the country will now join most of the rest of the world in backing a global minimum 15 per cent corporate tax rate, as a meeting of the OECD in Paris on Friday approaches that EU partners are billing as make-or-break. More than 130 countries agreed in July to the principle of a global 15 per cent minimum tax.Ireland has for months resisted any deal to set a rate of “at least 15 per cent” but Eamon Ryan, Ireland’s environment minister, told Irish radio on Tuesday: “I’m hopeful and confident that we will be able to be part of the solution here.” Paschal Donohoe, Ireland’s finance minister, told reporters in Luxembourg this week that he would put the amended OECD text to the cabinet on Thursday. A final decision on the Irish position is expected then.“[The tax issue] was sacred within Ireland, they had to take a stand on it,” said the chief executive of one major Irish company.Ireland is home to US tech giants such as Google, Apple and Facebook, which have powered the economy in the years after the financial crisis and been a big source of jobs. These companies have welcomed attempts to harmonise tax rules globally.While the precise details of the revised OECD text are not yet known, the words “at least” are expected to have been dropped, which Irish government sources have repeatedly pointed to as a major sticking point.Leo Varadkar, the tánaiste or deputy prime minister, on Monday said the amended OECD text “does respond to a lot, if not all of the concerns” Ireland had aired.The deputy prime minister has in the past raised the prospect of a two-tier system in Ireland, with a 12.5 per cent rate for smaller domestic companies. Donohoe was expected to have floated that with EU commissioners this week.“I think a combination of changed language and some sort of fig leaf for domestic companies would give enough cover to Dublin,” said Eoin Drea, a senior researcher at the Wilfried Martens Centre for European Studies, a think-tank in Brussels.Bruno Le Maire, France’s finance minister, told reporters in Paris he would like to “commend Ireland for the evolution of its position” and warned that it was a “now or never” moment to strike a global deal.“It will all come down to what happens at the OECD meeting this week, followed by meetings in Washington DC and Rome,” he said. “It’s in the next 15 days or so that we will determine if we can get a definitive agreement or not on a new international tax system for the 21st century.”Agreement from Ireland would leave just a handful of countries — notably EU members Estonia and Hungary — still outside the deal. EU economic commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said a deal could be struck at the G20 as early as next week or at an OECD meeting in Rome at the end of the month.As well as setting a global corporate tax floor, the plan gives countries the right to levy taxes on large companies based on where they generate revenue. “We should not underestimate these technical details” impeding political agreement among holdout countries, Le Maire said.Friday’s OECD meeting is still not the end of the road. All signatories need to get the deal past their legislatures, but the US — where President Joe Biden has only a tiny Senate majority — is pivotal. Hitting the OECD’s target of implementing the new rules by 2023 would be “challenging but possible”, said Gentiloni.
288  There have been a lot of books about the immediate postwar Germany, and still they come. I should know: I penned one myself, and I wasn’t the first either. It is a subject that seems bound to sell: there is blood, gore and retribution, plus there is a genuine interest in how people survived the so-called “zero hour”, when the clock stopped and started again. Not that there ever was a “zero hour”: unless Germans were suffering from shell-shock-induced amnesia, everyone carried something from the old era into the new.Journalist and historian Volker Ullrich has chosen to write about the end of the war rather than the postwar period; the time between Hitler’s suicide in the bunker on April 30 and the signing of the ceasefire in Berlin on May 8. It is not as neat a period as it looks, as Admiral Karl Dönitz’s post-Hitlerian Nazi government survived until May 23, when the British shut it down, coarsely humiliating ministers and generals alike. There is plenty of meat on the bone for all that and Ullrich delivers a punchy account that is a proper page-turner.The geopolitical issue of the time was a suspicion in some quarters that the “Anglo-Americans” (as the Germans called them) might join the remnants of Hitler’s army and attack the Soviet Union. Certainly, there were those in the US and UK government and high command who wanted this, and many leading Nazis clung to the idea as their last hope. Stalin was aware of the danger too. In the end the alliance held, at least until the beginning of the cold war.But there is still plenty to say about immediate postwar Germany, and Ullrich’s work and a book by fellow journalist Harald Jähner are noteworthy in that they are both written by Germans. For this reason, perhaps, both Ullrich and Jähner stress the absence of contrition on the part of defeated Germans. They seemed not to want to acknowledge the genocidal crimes they had committed both in the camps and the field. The Allied occupation used the notion of collective guilt to subjugate them: every man jack was guilty, which might have been stretching a point here and there. No one had voted for war, and the last “referendum” was held in 1938.Where Ullrich’s book Eight Days in May is political and military history, Jähner’s Aftermath is literary and social. Where Ullrich’s story is very largely familiar, Jähner’s is often new. As the title suggests, Aftermath takes in the immediate postwar years where Germany was administered by the Allies as well as the stirrings of recovery both in Konrad Adenauer’s Bonn Republic and Walter Ulbricht’s East Germany.There were plenty of Nazis about. In West Germany they were rattling around in the police and the judiciary — in government, too, until Willy Brandt became chancellor of a Social Democrat-led administration in 1969. Small wonder it took so long for those who opposed Nazism to be recognised or heard.Jähner excels in Aftermath in his description of ordinary people: young Germans who sought to shake some of the rubble out of their hair. There was a mania for dancing, even though there were precious few young German men around. The western Allies had banned “frat” — fraternisation with the enemy — but the order proved unenforceable. Many soldiers, both in the east and west, simply helped themselves. Prostitution was as rife as venereal disease.At first Germany had to contend with a complete lack of infrastructure (a train journey from Hamburg to Munich could take a week; today it takes just over six hours). It teemed with swaths of belligerent “DPs” (displaced persons — some of Hitler’s 7m foreign slaves), Jews seeking to go to the US or Palestine, soldiers hobbling back from as far as the Urals to wives who had lost hope of seeing them again, or German expellees whose homes across the Oder river had been awarded to Poland or Russia and sought a billet in a truncated Reich. These “Prussian” newcomers were hardly received with open arms.The image of the law-abiding German crumbled: they scrumped and pilfered to feed themselves and their children. Once the black market and the “cigarette economy” made way for the new Deutsche mark and the Wirtschaftswunder (economic miracle) dawned, Germans were ready for glamour again. That meant holidays, comedies at the cinema, kidney tables and swing — which was all the more respectable because the Nazis had banned it.These two books dovetail nicely, to the degree that their sources are sometimes the same. The occupation of Germany was billed to be a “Carthaginian peace”, one that would all but eradicate the vanquished party, but some of the more extreme policy proposals, such as comprehensive deindustrialisation, were rapidly dropped. With the outbreak of the cold war, the west felt the need to have the Germans on their side, much as some Nazis had hopefully predicted. When that happened, life in West Germany at least went back to a sort of normality where they could cultivate collective amnesia.Eight Days in May: How Germany’s War Ended by Volker Ullrich Allen Lane, £25, 336 pagesAftermath: Life in the Fallout of the Third Reich, 1945-1955 by Harald Jähner WH Allen, £20, 382 pagesGiles MacDonogh is the author of ‘After the Reich: From the Liberation of Vienna to the Berlin Airlift’Join our online book group on Facebook at FT Books Café
289  The UK’s pandemic death toll was blamed on ingrained individualism. It then vaccinated with the speed of a collectivist culture. East Asia’s low caseloads were credited to its eternal competence. The region proceeded to fall behind on jabs. India avoided the worst of the pandemic, and then didn’t. After bodily health, the human function that has suffered most of late is our psychic need for a pattern in events. Just as one emerges, making intuitive sense of the crisis, it succumbs to randomness.It is with care and almost dread, then, that I mention the newest pattern. Vaccine mandates are not incurring a vicious public backlash, at least not yet. Almost a month has passed since President Joe Biden announced that most US workers would have to be vaccinated or frequently tested. Emmanuel Macron is even further into his experiment with health certificates in France. Each man is unpopular for reasons that predate these coercive interventions: it is less clear that either is ailing because of them. Street protests are real but containable. Resignations from work are at modest levels. The governor of California even feels emboldened to require vaccines for school children.If it holds, the public’s grudging tolerance of mandates will have eye-opening lessons. For one, people are hopeless predictors of their own future behaviour. Surveys had suggested a rash of job-quitting in the event of employer mandates (just as they had implied that France, whose vaccination rate is pulling ahead of Britain’s, would be a laggard). Public opinion data does not just inform the election predictions of speculative columnists. It is also an important basis of government policy. If the science has a systemic blind spot for the future, for what people think they would do in hypothetical scenarios, it has distorted governance.Another conclusion is that partisanship has its uses. Were vaccine hesitancy spread evenly across the political spectrum, Biden would be shedding more votes now. Instead, it correlates with Republicanism. It is a sign of the most dire civic rot that people base even their approach to personal health on their tribal fealties. But it also means that Biden’s mandate is mostly alienating those who were never going to vote for him anyway. The very bifurcation of America can empower as well as curb a leader.Of all the inferences to be drawn from the elusive backlash, the last is the most far-reaching. In fact, after five years of anti-elite politics, from Brazil to the Philippines, it feels transgressive to express this thought: in the end, people want to be led. Pandering from a politician is like ingratiation from an underling, or round-the-clock contact from a lover: it can elicit the inverse of the desired reaction.Libertarians who read Brexit and Donald Trump as “their” breakthroughs always missed this point. Hatred of those in government is not the same as hatred of government. If anything, populism was a howl at the failure of elites to use their powers: against immigration, industrial decline and other species of social change. Populism’s don’t-tread-on-me wing is its loudest, and certainly the likeliest to protest. But the movement’s raw electoral weight comes from a wholly different sensibility. It remains an open question how much of Trump’s appeal has to do with ideological specifics (he is pro-vaccine, remember) or an almost Darwinian projection of strength.The public has already supplied an example of what we might call enlightened docility. Imagine being told in 2016 that, in four years, there would be vast support for a lockdown with no peacetime precedent, prescribed by an invisible expert class. Next to coercion of that scale and nature, the mandates are laissez-faire.I say all this with the jitters of a man carrying a vase in a greased hand across a stone floor. A mandate revolt could be just around the corner. Scattered protests can take a while to congeal. There is an air of unreality about a White House fussing over spending bills while a profound social experiment rolls out.A month in, though, the president is not vacillating. Looking back, the language in which he couched his mandate was as provocative as the act itself. “Our patience is wearing thin,” he said last month, “and the refusal has cost all of us.”Consider that he was addressing some 80m unvaccinated people here, not a sect of Montana survivalists. He knows the political risk of such bluntness. He also knows that walking on eggshells around voters incurs more contempt than peace.janan.ganesh@ft.com
290  About 3,000 French Catholic priests were guilty of rape or other sexual abuses, mostly of adolescent boys, in the 70 years since 1950, according to a report for the Church released on Tuesday.Jean-Marc Sauvé, who chairs the independent commission on sexual abuse in the Church (Ciase), said a study conducted as part of the three-year investigation found that an estimated 216,000 people who are adults today had been sexually abused by between 2,900 and 3,200 priests. The number of cases rises to 330,000 if attacks by lay workers are included.“These numbers are more than worrying, they are shocking,” Sauvé, himself a practising Catholic, said. “This is an issue that must be dealt with . . . The Church can and should do everything that’s necessary to re-establish everything that was destroyed, and reconstruct what was broken.”The French report, which runs to about 3,000 pages with its appendices, is the latest investigation to shake the Catholic Church around the world, with similar abuses having been exposed in countries such as the US, Ireland and Australia.François Devaux, founder of a victim support group called La Parole Liberée (Speak Out), took the stage at the launch of the report to condemn the guilty priests and the Church and to demand billions of euros in compensation. “You must pay for all these crimes,” he said twice, slowly and emphatically.He paid tribute to the authors of the report, who held 243 hearings for the victims and interviewed 11 of the aggressors. “You have explored the darkest details and the most abject acts that man can commit with his neuroses,” he said. “In this hell were atrocious mass crimes and misdemeanours for decades.” Devaux condemned the betrayal by the priests of childhood innocence and of their own principles, as well as the “hypocrisy and lies” that followed and the “awful mechanisms of an institution that totally malfunctioned”.Sauvé, too, criticised the Church’s “deep, total, cruel indifference’ until the year 2000 and said the remedial actions taken were “really about protecting the institution and maintaining the failing priests in the priesthood”. About 90 per cent of victims were boys, many of them between the ages of 10 and 13, Sauvé said.His report makes 45 recommendations, among them that the Church should recognise responsibility for what happened and pay compensation. It also says there should be exceptions to the secrecy of confessions heard by priests in order to report serious attacks on minors or vulnerable people, and suggests the Church consider abandoning the absolute demand for celibacy by appointing married men to the priesthood.Eric de Moulins-Beaufort, who chairs the French Catholic Bishops Conference, said he was “ashamed and appalled” and told victims: “I want to ask your pardon”. The Church in France was shaken in recent years by the case of Bernard Preynat, a now defrocked priest who was convicted last year of sexually abusing minors and sentenced to five years in jail. He admitted abusing more than 75 boys, among them Devaux.The scandal over Preynat prompted the resignation in 2019 of Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, the archbishop of Lyon and one of the most senior clerics in the Catholic hierarchy, after he was convicted of covering up Preynat’s abuses, although the conviction was later overturned on appeal.A film about the case by François Ozon called Grâce à Dieu (Thank God) was so titled because Barbarin had said publicly that the crimes of which Preynat was accused had happened long ago and were therefore covered, “thank God”, by a statute of limitations.According to Sauvé, 22 of the suspected sexual abuse crimes that were handled by the investigators for the new report have been forwarded to prosecutors because are recent enough not to be covered by the legal time limits.
291  Good morning. Tough day Monday. It seems that the spike in energy prices sparked one of our periodic stagflation freakouts. The growthy, long duration “Faang” stocks got hit harder than the wider market, small-caps were down less than the Nasdaq, bond yields edged up, and so on. By now it’s a familiar pattern. But to see the real pain, look beyond the US. Email me: robert.armstrong@ft.comDeveloped world investors are anxious. Economic growth is slowing and inflation is annoyingly persistent. Central banks have little choice but to tiptoe towards tightening monetary policy, or risk losing control; lots of people think the central bankers need to tiptoe faster. Combine the hawkish vibes and decelerating growth with high-risk asset valuations, and financial markets have been jittery.But if the threat of stagflation is annoying in the developed world, it could be calamitous in the developing world.Emerging markets are heterogeneous, of course. Many of them have certain financial vulnerabilities in common, though. Emerging-market consumer price index baskets are more heavily weighted to volatile (and correlated) food and energy prices. Because of this, and because of past inflation scares, EM central banks have to be much more reactive to maintain their credibility and keep inflation in check. And when developed market central banks are tightening, that weakens EM currencies, making inflation worse and reducing or reversing capital inflows. Strangely, in emerging markets, the most dominant financial factor is the US Federal Reserve.In the current moment, there is some good news for emerging market countries, from Russia to Nigeria, who export energy. But for the energy importers such as Turkey, India and China, recent high energy prices are an additional burden.Many EM central banks are grasping the nettle and tightening rates. Russia has pushed rates from 4.25 per cent to 6.75 per cent this year; Brazil, from 2 per cent to 6.25 per cent; and Mexico, from 4 per cent to 4.75 per cent. Others, such as Turkey and South Africa, are holding back. Here, from the Bloomberg terminal, is a chart of some key EM currencies against the dollar over the past month:Russia (in yellow) has the most hawkish policy and sells energy; its currency is hanging in there. South Africa (white) has been holding rates unchanged and Turkey (red) has cut rates, astonishingly; those currencies are getting crushed. Brazil and Mexico (purple and green) have not tightened enough to satisfy markets, it seems.Luis Costa, emerging markets strategist at Citi, call this a “reality bites” moment for EM investors:The deteriorating performance of emerging market bonds and equities over the past month tell the tale:One is told to invest to the sound of cannons, and the artillery is booming in EM. By the EM strategists I spoke to agreed: not yet. Costa of Citi said:Here is Simon Quijano-Evans of Gemcorp:Quijano-Evans is looking for entry points, but sees few of them now.The strategy in the months to come, says Ed Al-Hussainy of Columbia Threadneedle, is to stick close to the countries where the central bankers are hitting back hard at inflation:Quijano-Evans puts the “adults in the room” concept into a graph. Here is real central bank policy rates (policy rates minus expected inflation) plotted against countries’ “basic balance” (current account deficit plus foreign direct investment, a measure of vulnerability to swings in the dollar). Note Russia towards the upper right:For the US, from an economic perspective, the pain of the pandemic has been offset by an early vaccine rollout and massive fiscal stimulus. Many emerging markets have had less vaccine access, most of them do not have the fiscal capacity to stimulate significantly, and now they are confronted with the possibility of US monetary tightening. As Al-Hussainy sums up:My old friend and bitter rival John Authers made a strong case yesterday that the “stag” in stagflation is a lot less worrisome than the “flation”.
292  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.EU leaders are gathering in Slovenia for an informal dinner ahead of tomorrow’s summit with six Western Balkan countries, and their lack of appetite to discuss membership prospects is already stoking up frustration in the region. We’ll give you the rundown on why the hosts’ attempts to put a firm deadline on EU’s vague enlargement promises have backfired and why the mood among Balkan leaders is gloomier than ever.In other commitment issues, the UK’s threat to unilaterally suspend parts of the Brexit agreement that relate to Northern Ireland has prompted contingency work on the EU side — including some carefully choreographed steps before any action is taken.And seeking to create some Twitter buzz, the European Central Bank has published a study looking at tweets about the Frankfurt-based bank, viral and flops alike — including Christine Lagarde’s own presence on the social media (she is more active than her US or UK counterparts).Tonight in Slovenia, European Council president Charles Michel wants EU leaders to spend dinner talking about Europe’s place in the world. But some of those present reckon that before the chin-stroking on Afghanistan, Aukus and China, they should probably tackle an unresolved problem closer to home, write Marton Dunai in Brdo and Henry Foy in Brussels.The working supper will take place on the eve of the EU’s Western Balkans summit, an event ostensibly arranged to take stock of the long-delayed process of admitting the region’s six countries into the bloc.But 18 years after the first discussions, their leaders are becoming increasingly irritated at a failure to progress — and the intention of many EU states to keep kicking the can down the road.“We have had our time living with big expectations . . . and seeing so many promises broken,” Albania’s prime minister Edi Rama told Europe Express, describing the summit as the “latest marriage counselling session”.Two decades ago enlargement seemed like the bloc’s slogan; today it is almost taboo. In the lead-up to the Slovenia summit, it has been the elephant in the room for many big western states which see the promise as a political irritant to be continually delayed.Janez Jansa, Slovenia’s prime minister, attempted to change that last week when he demanded that member states agree to a summit declaration setting 2030 as a deadline to admit Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia.The surprise move was met with a mix of horror and ridicule, and has since been cut from the text, which now balances the bloc’s enlargement pledge against “its capacity to integrate new members”.“Those who are against enlargement don’t want any ambition on the topic. It can be in 2100 as far as they are concerned,” said a senior EU diplomat involved in the negotiations. “Jansa wants a tangible result, something concrete . . . [And] at least a dozen member states want a clear and strong message.”Some of the foot-dragging can be blamed on the Western Balkan states themselves: slow progress on reforms and solving internal disputes. But other issues are Brussels’ to resolve, such as the seemingly core question of just how many Western Balkan states exist. Spain and four other EU states don’t even recognise Kosovo as a country.“We move as fast as the most conservative member can go,” said another EU diplomat. “[But] pretending is not an option any more. In my view it was all about pretending from both sides. The EU pretended to do enlargement, countries pretended to be doing reforms.”An EU support package worth €30bn should soothe some of the impatience, but some states are also shopping around for alternative geopolitical friends. Russia, China and Turkey have financial and political leverage in the region, and are keen to get more. Take Bosnia and Herzegovina, where Russia is capitalising on the political infighting and EU’s waning influence.The possibility of Beijing-on-the-Adriatic has focused some minds in Brussels, but the sceptics — mainly from western and northern Europe — show no sign of budging. The can will be kicked again.“Of course there are problems [in the Western Balkans] but it is alarming that we are not able to agree on saying anything about our direct neighbourhood,” said the senior EU diplomat. “We should really show that this is our region.”Europe’s escalating gas supply crunch is pushing up the price of allowances linked to carbon emissions as energy producers switch over to cheaper but dirtier coal. EU carbon allowances last week topped €65 a tonne for the first time. Allowances under the UK’s nascent cap and trade system hit a record £76 (€88) a tonne. (More here)Britain’s messy and ill-tempered divorce from the EU might have marked the low point for relations between the two sides, write Sam Fleming and Andy Bounds in Brussels.But that notion has steadily evaporated as the year has progressed, as arguments over the operation of the Northern Ireland protocol dominate dialogue between London and Brussels.The latest stage in the downward slide comes as Lord David Frost, the UK’s Brexit minister, warns he’s ready to unilaterally suspend parts of the UK’s exit deal by triggering Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol.Frost negotiated the protocol in October 2019, but he now judges the deal he struck to be “unsustainable” given the disruptions it has caused to Northern Ireland. In a command paper this summer the UK said it wanted a sweeping rewrite of the protocol, including stripping away European Court of Justice oversight — a suggestion viewed as a non-starter in Brussels.On the EU side, a UK decision to trigger Article 16 has been seen as pretty likely for some weeks, and Brussels has been weighing its options for retaliation, which would vary in severity depending on how far-reaching the UK measures are.First, however, there is likely to be some choreography, as Brussels puts forward a platter of proposals this month aimed at easing some of the genuine difficulties created by the protocol.The UK is ready to sit down and hold detailed discussions over the EU offer, but Frost warned yesterday: “From what I hear I worry that we will not get one which enables the significant change we need.” Triggering Article 16 would by no means erase the provisions in the protocol that the UK wants to change, however. Instead, the article permits unilateral safeguard measures, while paving the way for further negotiations aimed at finding a “commonly acceptable solution” — within the framework of the protocol.Just how sweeping such safeguard measures can be is an open question which will probably be the subject of further, fierce disagreement between the sides. The UK can be expected to take an expansive view.An EU diplomat said: “There’s an acquiescence that Frost doesn’t need much to trigger Article 16 if that suits him politically given the formulation of the command paper. The hunt for a scapegoat is the easiest of all hunting expeditions and the UK very much seems to need one at the moment.”How much should central banks care about Twitter? Given how ephemeral and often irreverent the social media service can be, you might think any self-respecting central banker would steer well clear, writes Martin Arnold in Frankfurt.But there may be some value to engaging with the twittersphere, according to two researchers at the European Central Bank who analysed millions of tweets about their institution in both English and German and published their findings on Monday.After stripping out tweets about the “England and Wales Cricket Board”, the researchers split the remainder between those by central banking “experts” and “non-experts” and concluded the ECB can reach both camps even if it is more effective at reaching the specialist audience.This is important, they indicated, because “the discussion about the ECB on Twitter is disproportionately influenced by views that are expressed in strong language, and by relatively subjective tweets” which are more often expressed by non-experts.As an example, they said Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro during the 2012 sovereign debt crisis was “highly controversial and was overall met with a certain degree of negativity” among German Twitter users.But the good news for the ECB the next time it faces a Twitter storm, is that the researchers concluded “central bank communication has the potential to make discussions in social media somewhat more factual and moderate”.All this is likely to be music to the ears of ECB president Christine Lagarde, who is a frequent tweeter — unlike her counterparts Jay Powell in the US and Andrew Bailey in the UK — and often talks of wanting to improve communication with the wider public.The researchers, however, admit Twitter may have its limits, saying: “Whether it ultimately succeeds in fostering trust, making central banks accountable, or influencing agents’ inflation expectations and behaviour remains an open issue.”
293  Even before Andrej Babis’s secret purchase of a luxury French property cropped up in a vast leak of files from offshore organisations on Sunday, he was facing a tight race to win a second term as Czech prime minister.But the revelations that the billionaire, who built an empire stretching from fertilisers to food before entering politics, sent $22m through a sequence of offshore companies to buy the property on the Riviera have given extra uncertainty to this weekend’s election.Opposition politicians seized on the claims to question whether Babis, who has been dogged throughout his premiership by separate allegations of fraud and conflict of interest, which he has repeatedly denied, was fit to lead the 10.7m-strong central European nation.“Andrej Babis must prove that he used taxed money for this transaction,” said Petr Fiala, from the rightwing opposition coalition, Together. “If not, he has no right to be in politics and take care of taxpayers’ money.”Babis denied on Twitter on Sunday having done “anything illegal or wrong”. He claimed that the allegations were merely an attempt to “denigrate me again and thus influence the Czech parliamentary elections”. During a debate on Czech television, he said the money used to buy the property, known as the Château Bigaud, had been taxed.A poll published on Sunday suggested that Babis’s Ano would emerge as the biggest party from the election, which will be held this Friday and Saturday, with 27 per cent of the vote. However, to form a government, Babis would need the support of at least one other group — something that was not looking straightforward even before yesterday’s revelations about the 2009 château deal.“It looks like it will be very difficult for Babis to have a functioning government with a majority after the elections. It looks like a stalemate,” said Milan Nic, senior fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations.“Because this news came so close to the elections it will probably have some impact. But Babis will try to use it to portray himself as a victim . . . It is a big scandal for one part of society, but for the other, it might just be seen as an attack on Babis.”Babis entered politics in 2011 having turned his Agrofert company into one of the Czech Republic’s biggest private employers. He promised to use his experience to run the country like a business. Supporters say that is one of the reasons they back him.“You hear from the other parties that Babis is the worst guy walking on planet Earth. But when you look at it over a 10-year perspective and compare his work to the work and scandals of the politicians before, he is quite solid,” said Lukas, an entrepreneur from Brno, arguing that Babis had simplified construction rules and cut VAT avoidance. He also said the prime minister’s much-criticised handling of the pandemic was better than claimed by opponents.For Babis’s critics, his business dealings have long been a point of controversy. The tycoon put his Agrofert assets into trust before becoming prime minister. But in April an EU audit found that he had breached conflict of interest rules because of his continued links to the business, which received EU subsidies while he was in office. In June, police recommended that he should be charged with fraud over the alleged misuse of an EU subsidy in a separate case that has shadowed him for his entire premiership.Babis has repeatedly dismissed both sets of allegations as attempts by his political enemies to undermine him.While the allegations have not so far deprived Babis of voters, they have narrowed his political options. The groupings placed second and third in Sunday’s opinion poll — Together, and a separate coalition of the Pirate party and the Mayors and Independents — have both ruled out a coalition with him.If Babis cannot win over parts of Together, his only chance of forming a government would be some sort of deal with the far right SPD and other smaller parties, such as the Communists.But diplomats say a coalition involving the stridently anti-immigrant SPD — whose leader Tomio Okamura once suggested Czechs should walk pigs past mosques to “remind” Muslims that they could leave the country — could leave Babis isolated in Europe.The SPD has also said that it would demand that a government put forward legislation allowing for a referendum on the Czech Republic leaving the EU or Nato — something that Babis has previously rejected.“[Sunday’s] disclosures will further raise the post election stakes. Babis’s future options now depend entirely on Okamura and the Communists,” said Nic. “Some kind of post-election coalition with parts of the centre-right bloc — even without Babis as prime minister and after months of talks — is now harder to imagine.”
294  Proposed European rules to deal with failing insurance companies have been criticised for potentially exposing policyholders to losses, with one EU consumer group branding it “an extreme step”.Brussels last month unveiled a bloc-wide resolution framework for the sector, similar to banking rules that came into force in 2015. Designed to avoid a disorderly failure of insurers and reinsurers, it also aims to protect those companies and individuals insured by struggling firms.The proposals include requiring pre-emptive recovery plans from companies, granting authorities the power to intervene when things are going wrong and the use of resolution tools such as forcing losses on shareholders and general creditors.The overall objective is to transfer the insurance portfolios safely to a viable insurer. But the powers include, as a last resort, an option to “convert to equity or reduce the principal amount of claims, including insurance claims”. Consumer groups have raised concerns. Better Finance, which represents financial services customers, said it was “very difficult to understand how and what would justify such an extreme step” such as reducing insurance claims on individual, non-professional insurance clients.“This is all the more outrageous given that insurance policyholders continuously pay to ensure the guarantee that their insured event is covered at any time,” said a spokesperson.Before insurance claims could be hit, the tool seeks to ensure that “shareholders and creditors of a failing insurance or reinsurance undertaking suffer losses first and bear an appropriate part of the costs arising from the failure of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking as soon as a resolution power is used”.Finance Watch, another EU consumer group, said it accepted the principle that policyholders could share losses in extreme cases. “[But] there should be a calibration of the amount of losses shareholders and creditors take, such that the likelihood that policyholders are touched is very low,” said Thierry Philipponnat, the group’s head of research and advocacy, who also sits on the sanctions committee at the French prudential regulator. “The mattress should be thick enough.”A commission spokesperson declined to comment. In its proposal, the commission said the conversion tool would give “shareholders and creditors . . . and, to a certain extent, policyholders, a stronger incentive to monitor the health of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking during normal circumstances”.The commission’s announcement highlighted a key safeguard of the reform, a “no creditor worse off” principle. That means no creditors — including policyholders — should be worse off in a resolution than they would be in an insolvency. The proposal also points out that states can offer guarantee schemes to offset any hit to policyholders.Some member states have national resolution mechanisms, but these would be the first rules in force across the bloc, with details to be hammered out between the European parliament and member states.Replying last week to the proposals, regulator Eiopa said it “deeply regrets” that the plans do not also include a harmonisation of the patchwork of state guarantee schemes on offer in different EU countries.Policyholders whose insurers fall over receive different levels of protection, depending where the policy originates, Eiopa said, adding: “This issue needs to be tackled as it may seriously undermine the functioning of and trust in the European single market.”
295  On the stark neon-blue set of TV channel CNews, the gadfly political commentator Éric Zemmour has debated all comers on his pet issues of immigration, Islam and the decline of France. At least seven ministers from President Emmanuel Macron’s government have jousted against Zemmour this year on the primetime show Facing the News.Twice convicted in court of racial or religious provocation, the extreme rightwinger is now seeking to parlay the notoriety he built up on the current affairs channel into a presidential run and is expected to soon declare his candidacy in France’s elections set for April.Zemmour has come from nowhere in the past month to become one of the most popular potential candidates after Macron and the far-right leader Marine Le Pen, with one poll last week showing he could capture up to 15 per cent of the vote in the first round, which would severely dent her chances.“It’s my turn,” he wrote in his new book, France Has Not Said Its Last Word. His rise is a sign of the increasing clout of CNews, a TV channel backed by conservative billionaire Vincent Bolloré that critics liken to Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News in the US, which championed former president Donald Trump and rightwing causes.Owned by media group Vivendi, CNews has doubled its audience share in four years to reach second place among the country’s four 24-hour news channels. Its business model pairs a low-cost news operation with brash debates on topics from violent crime to the glories of Napoleon.CNews is not yet as influential as Fox in the US, nor is Zemmour as popular as Trump. But rival politicians are lamenting how the channel is setting the terms of the national debate and deepening rifts in an already divided society.The key to the recent success of both CNews and Zemmour is the lesson he drew from the UK’s vote for Brexit and Trump’s election triumph: be radical, even outrageous, if you want to win. His latest attention-grabbing sally was to demand a ban on “foreign” names such as Mohammed and Kevin.“One doesn’t win from the centre any more,” Zemmour says he told Le Pen in a secret meeting earlier this year, when she tried to convince him not to stand. “People expect firmness and conviction, even radicalism.”The CNews phenomenon has surprised many in the French media industry who thought that strict broadcast regulations would make it impossible to launch an opinion channel. The Conseil supérieur de l’audiovisuel (CSA) requires channels to showcase a range of opinions and impartially dole out time to politicians, especially during campaigns.There are no such broadcast rules in the US so Murdoch, the News Corp billionaire, turned Fox into a conservative mouthpiece.Gérald-Brice Viret, head of programming at Vivendi’s TV operation, says France’s broadcast regulations mean that CNews could never be anything like Fox News. “We are not populists but we are popular,” he adds. “And obviously that makes everyone angry.” But Roland Lescure, a member of parliament for Macron’s La République en Marche party, says there are still dangers. “The risk of CNews, when you look at what Fox News started as and became, is the showbizification of news, which allows any debate to become hysterical and extremist and move away from moderation, simplifying complex questions on matters such as health and Covid-19 vaccines,” he says.Macron’s political party decided to allow its representatives to appear on CNews if they wanted, but “because we are in the moderate camp, usually our people look like the nice guy who’s being bashed,” adds Lescure.The rise of CNews comes as France’s once staid media — nearly all the major papers and TV channels are either state-backed or owned by billionaire businessmen — is in a period of tumult. Decade-old regulations have failed to keep up with the high-speed news cycle or the spread of social media.A period of unprecedented consolidation is also under way. Key outlets will soon change hands if regulators approve pending deals, such as the proposed merger of the country’s two biggest private broadcasters TF1 and M6.Bolloré, Vivendi’s biggest shareholder, stands to be a big beneficiary of the dealmaking. If it wins regulatory approval, Vivendi plans to buy the rest of the French media and retail group Lagardère that it does not already own. That would hand it Europe 1 radio, Le Journal du Dimanche newspaper and celebrity magazine Paris Match. Although such old media assets do not bring in much profit, they are closely followed by the business and political elite and help shape French public opinion.Macron, then a novice politician, appeared on the cover of Paris Match eight times during his long-shot bid for the presidency in 2017, and his ministers frequently grace the cover of JDD on Sundays.The 63-year-old Zemmour, who is married with three children, recently got his first Paris Match cover, when he was pictured in the sea embracing his 28-year campaign adviser Sarah Knafo. Speculation has been rife over whether it was a deliberate publicity stunt to boost his campaign or a paparazzi scoop with a long lens.The extent to which billionaire owners of French media influence coverage has long been the subject of speculation. Direct interventions are hard to prove, but critics note how business newspaper Les Echos tiptoes around coverage of its owner LVMH boss Bernard Arnault, while the Dassault family’s Le Figaro espouses a conservatism on economic and security issues that dovetails with its defence interests.“It’s never explicit. It’s always implicit,” says one industry executive. “But with CNews, Vincent Bolloré went much further. He showed that you can take a strong editorial line and transform a TV channel into a political weapon of war. The fear now is he could do that with all these other [media] properties.”CNews, like Zemmour’s political ambitions, is a relatively recent phenomenon. It was born out of the ashes of a month-long strike at Vivendi’s TV news operation in 2016. Then called i-Télé, it was a conventional 24-hour news channel without a particular political slant. Zemmour had his own show on the channel until 2014, when he was fired for allegedly minimising France’s role in the Holocaust in an interview with an Italian newspaper.I-Télé was losing roughly €30m a year and was faced with two new competitors after the TF1-owned LCI news channel moved from paid to free-to-air, and state-backed France Info launched its own news channel. The spark for the strike was the controversial hire of a star presenter, but it soon metastasised into a broader protest against Vivendi’s de facto new boss — Bolloré, who had become board chair with a roughly 15 per cent stake.Bolloré had started dictating strategy at Vivendi’s pay-TV operator Canal Plus, firing its top executives and killing one of its best-known shows, Les Guignols, an irreverent mock newscast presented by puppets. The Breton billionaire had also long supported conservative politicians like Nicolas Sarkozy, so i-Télé journalists wanted assurances that their newsroom would remain independent.But the protest at i-Télé backfired. Bolloré saw it as an opportunity to clear out the newsroom to cut costs, says one former employee. During the strike, he would get regular updates on the number of journalists who had accepted buyouts, and urged the bosses to convince more to leave. By the end, nearly one-third of the newsroom of 120 had quit.A few months later, i-Télé was rebranded CNews with a slogan that promised “news, analysis and opinions”. Serge Nedjar, the longtime Bolloré lieutenant in charge of the turnround, put together a schedule built around talk shows, which were cheaper to produce than on-the-ground reporting.People close to Bolloré say he believed that the French media was too leftwing and saw CNews as a necessary alternative to defend liberal economic ideas and cover issues that other media neglected. The tycoon, they say, was particularly concerned about security and immigration and saw Zemmour as a key voice to raise these issues.The emphasis on debate over news was also a good business strategy, says Vivendi executive Viret. “If we had done the same format as other news channels, we would have all vampirised each other,” he adds.Another key move was promoting Pascal Praud, a silver-haired, bespectacled radio personality best known as a football commentator. Praud’s morning show brought together a regular cast of journalists and analysts to comment on the day’s news. With a curmudgeonly style, he often selected topics favoured by the far-right, such as anti-police protests, the veil worn by some Muslim women, and climate change scepticism. He acted as a hands-off moderator who often let the panellists clash — the louder the debate, the better.Ratings began to climb. Nedjar defended the channel’s positioning in Le Journal du Dimanche last year, telling the newspaper that it was “important to listen to all opinions, even the most disturbing and politically incorrect ones”.He added: “We were the first to focus, from the outset and unfailingly, on certain sensitive and explosive themes, such as security, immigration, the environment, or the violence in our cities. Our competitors resisted covering these topics.”Critics counter that CNews has gone too far. “Bolloré crossed a red line by handing a media outlet over to the extreme right,” says a prominent adviser to French chief executives and politicians. “A taboo has been broken. That is what has many people so worried.”Benoît Hamon, the Socialist party’s 2017 presidential candidate, said last year: “Mr Bolloré, captain of industry at the head of a far-right TV station, is pouring petrol all over the place and calmly lighting the fire with Zemmour, Praud and their merry band.”Zemmour’s return to CNews in 2019 helped drive ratings to new heights. Last May, CNews briefly dethroned BFM as the top 24-hour news channel, prompting celebrations at Vivendi. But even its best rated shows tend to attract 600,000 to 800,000 viewers, well shy of the roughly 6m that watch the traditional nightly news on TF1.Although Vivendi does not disclose the news channel’s financial figures, Viret says its losses have narrowed significantly and that it aims to break even next year. Unlike Fox in the US, which has long been a profit engine for Murdoch’s business, CNews represents a very small part of Vivendi, so the financial stakes are not high for Bolloré.The rise to prominence of the extreme right in France over the past 30 years has steadily pushed the issues promoted by Zemmour — Islamism, immigration, educational failings and the supposed decline of French civilisation — into the heart of the French political debate.In his telling, Zemmour’s childhood was one of assimilation from Algerian-Jewish roots after his family migrated to France during the war of independence in the north African country.Zemmour has espoused the “great replacement theory” that suggests Muslim immigrants will overwhelm the native inhabitants of Europe, and has a gift for polemical, anti-woke, anti-green, anti-migrant hyperbole that many voters find attractive. “No small town, no small village in France is safe from a savage squad of Chechen, Kosovar, Maghrebi or African gangs who steal, rape, pillage, torture and kill,” he writes in his new book.In his earlier writings, the commentator has also slammed the supposed negative effects of feminism on society, and in his book The French Suicide wrote nostalgically about the days when a man could grope a woman without being hit with a sexual harassment complaint.The CSA has struggled to rein in CNews and its star. It fined the channel €200,000 last year for a tirade in which Zemmour called young migrants thieves, murderers and rapists and said they “must be sent back”. Zemmour’s words, said the CSA, incited hatred and discrimination.The CSA has also issued repeated warnings to CNews for not showing diverse opinions, including one for giving too much airtime to Le Pen’s party during regional elections. Viret defended the channel: “We respect all our obligations on airtime to the second.”Over the summer, supporters plastered Paris with posters that blared “Zemmour president” in capital letters. French media began a steady drumbeat of speculation over his intentions, which Zemmour stoked as he prepared to launch his book.Macron allies and leftwing politicians argued that the CSA should treat Zemmour as a candidate even though he had yet to declare. That would mean counting his time spent on screen so as to ensure that he did not get more airtime than other candidates. In mid-September, the CSA did exactly that. The next day CNews said Zemmour would no longer appear on Facing the News. Viret says it would have been “totally unworkable” to apply the CSA’s new approach.Zemmour took to Twitter to complain that the CSA had overstepped its authority: “I will not be quiet. #STOPcensorship.” But since he stepped down from his show, he has appeared frequently on other CNews broadcasts as a guest, and has benefited from intense coverage in other outlets.He did not respond to requests for comment for this story.The latest opinion polls suggest that Macron and Le Pen are the two candidates most likely to top the polls in April and therefore face each other in a run-off in May, as they did in 2017. That would exclude Zemmour and others from the final round.Zemmour, CNews and other rightwing news outlets, however, have already changed the terms of French political debate and moved it in the direction of the bitter confrontations that characterise politics today in the US, forcing almost every candidate to focus intently on issues such as immigration and crime.After rightwing magazine Valeurs Actuelles published a call to arms from retired French generals this year complaining about laxity, Islamism and “hordes” of immigrants, and hinting at the need for a coup d’état, one poll found a majority of the French supported the signatories and nearly half agreed France “will soon have a civil war”. “More than ever, combative politics works,” says Vincent Martigny, politics professor at Nice university. “You could even say that Bolloré is following the example of Murdoch.” Letter in response to this article:The ironic back-story of France’s rightwing pundit / From Francis Ghilès, Senior Associate Research Fellow, Barcelona Centre for International Affairs, Barcelona, Spain
296  September was a good month for European social democrats. Two national elections — in Germany and Norway — look likely to oust conservative-led governments and put social democrats in charge. After a long continent-wide decline and years of centre-right dominance, they could soon lead governments in Germany and every Nordic country, as well as Spain and Portugal. While they still languish in countries such as France, Europe’s traditional centre-left parties have more cause for optimism than in a long time.This resurgence is no return to past glories. In Germany, Olaf Scholz and the SPD’s 25.7 per cent vote share, up more than 5 points from the previous election, was “an astonishing result”, says Catrina Schläger, an analyst at the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung, a think-tank close to the SPD. Still, it was one of the party’s weakest postwar elections. Schläger cautions that “the German party system has changed . . . into a more plural one, with many medium-sized parties.” Tarik Abou-Chadi, professor of European politics at Nuffield College, Oxford, says “the days of 40 per cent election results are over.”Germany’s Greens (and somewhat the liberal FDP) benefited as much as the SPD from the huge swing away from the right. This trend inflicted a near 9 point loss to Angela Merkel’s conservatives and a 2.3 point hit to the far-right AfD.“We need to adjust our idea of what winning elections means in fragmented party systems”, says Abou-Chadi. “The goal of the social democratic left should be to lead a coalition that is closest to their ideal point” in terms of policies.Norway illustrates the challenge. Jonas Gahr Støre is set to become prime minister — not thanks to his own Labour party’s vote tally, which fell slightly from 2017, but because of a strong shift towards harder-left environmental parties and the traditional rural-interest Centre party.This follows a Nordic pattern. When Denmark’s Mette Frederiksen came to power in 2019, her Social Democrats “won” with a lower vote share than four years earlier. Earlier that year, her sister party in Finland ousted a centre-right coalition from power after an election that marginally improved the centre-left vote share, but only to the party’s second-worst result ever.The year before, Sweden’s Social Democratic leader Stefan Löfven had retained his position as prime minister although the party’s vote fell to its lowest level in more than a century.These political shifts did not increase social democrats’ electoral support. A paucity of actual votes was offset by sufficient gains for coalition partners — variously green, hard-left, liberal or rural-interest parties. Yet in each case, social democrats claimed the prime ministership as the biggest single party in centre-left coalitions.That brings challenges. One is how much influence social democrats end up having on the government platform. In Norway, three-way talks, which would have given the Labour party a dominant position in the middle of coalition policy disagreements, broke down after the Socialist party withdrew. The risk is now that the two-party minority government now looking likely will pull Labour far in the direction of its coalition partner, the Centre party, which shares many policy preferences with the centre-right.In Germany, the desire by the Greens and the FDP to align their positions before opening coalition talks means Scholz does not even have the default claim on initiating negotiations to form a government that his Nordic colleagues have enjoyed. On the other hand, it matters that he won “with the most leftwing programme in decades”, says Abou-Chadi.Running a campaign on social questions, Schläger says, allowed Scholz to attract voters from both the conservatives and the hard-left Linke party, but also a sizeable number of previous non-voters.That may not be enough for the long term. The SPD’s “electorate is very old”, says Abou-Chadi. Both in Norway and Germany, young voters overwhelmingly supported green and liberal parties instead. Unless social democrats can increase support among the young, he warns, “they will have problems remaining the strongest party” of the progressive-left blocs.
297  When Mikhail Morozov visited fin de siècle Paris, he said he “ceased to be a tourist and became a human being”. It’s little wonder the Russian industrialist and art collector felt revitalised by the French capital. Born into a cultivated family whose fortune derived from textile mills, Mikhail and his brother Ivan had grown up in a Moscow beau monde of Impressionist artists and wealthy patrons whose efforts were forging a new avant-garde era known as Russia’s “Silver Age”. In the throes of post-Impressionist ferment, Paris must have felt like an even more thrilling nirvana. From the time of his first visit to Paris in 1898 to his death at the age of 33 in 1903 — he was a notorious bon viveur — Mikhail built a collection of 39 French paintings, including works by Monet, Manet (the first to enter Russia), Renoir and Gauguin, and 44 by Russian artists. Meanwhile, between 1904 and 1914, his brother Ivan acquired 240 French works, including the first Picasso to enter Russia, and 430 Russian.Now, the Morozov collection is on show at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris, the first time all these works have travelled outside Russia. It is the second leg of a journey that began with the foundation’s 2016-17 display of the collection acquired by Sergei Shchukin, a businessman and contemporary of the Morozovs.Shchukin — owner of 50 Picassos — was the braver buyer. But visitors to the foundation won’t be disappointed. The scene is set with portraits of the collector brothers. Painted by Valentin Serov, a full-length portrait of Mikhail hints at his excessive tendencies, buttons straining over his tailcoat.Ivan’s portrait, by Impressionist Konstantin Korovin, boasts a fluid liveliness he lacked in reality. Unlike Shchukin, who welcomed Russian artists into his home to view the French contingent, Ivan hoarded his collection for his privileged circle. And while luxury was a leitmotif at home, for workers in his Tver factory, grim conditions provoked regular strikes.Whatever his character defects, Ivan’s eye was impeccable. In 1908, his purchase ensured that “The Harlequin and his Companion” (1901) became the first Picasso to enter Russia. Showing Harlequin and his friend slouched over a café table, chins propped on their hands in bored melancholy, the image exemplifies the tension between estrangement and intimacy that shines through Picasso’s early work. Next to it is “The Cork” (1878), which became the first Manet to enter Russia when it was bought by Mikhail in 1900. Showing two barflies, it testifies to the radical shift made by this French trailblazer away from stiff, academic idylls towards images of life in all its compelling, chiaroscuro imperfections.It was risky to take such bold pictures — scandalous, even, in conservative Parisian circles — back to far more puritanical Moscow. Curator Anne Baldassari says that the Morozovs’ collection of nudes caused particular outrage. But the city’s artists longed for novelty. On show here, “Portrait of a Chorus Girl” (1883) — painted by Korovin after he returned from a trip to Paris — shows a full-lipped young woman in a rakish straw hat sprawled in front of leafy trees, her casual fearlessness echoing the artist’s rapid, blurry, shimmering brushstrokes.In 1907, Ivan started to commission the monumental cycles that would transform his mansion on prestigious Prechistenka Street into a trendsetting domus. Our first sight of these brave new roomscapes are the paintings commissioned from Pierre Bonnard between 1910 and 1912 that adorned the staircase. The centrepiece here is “The Mediterranean”, a triptych of 4m-high panels showing a sun-washed, tree-shaded terrace stretching towards a glimmering azure sea, clearly designed to bring a slice of Côte d’Azur summer to a chill, grey Moscow afternoon.Detached and inward, Cézanne could not be more different from the sensual, sun-worshipping Bonnard. Yet Ivan became a passionate collector of the Aix-en-Provence-based artist’s work. His Damascene moment came in 1907 at the Salon d’Automne in Paris, where a posthumous Cézanne retrospective included “Paysage Bleu” (1904-06). Showing Cézanne at his late zenith, the painting translates the Provençal landscape into a symphonic hymn of mottled blues with splashes of ochre and terracotta to hint that the day’s heat still simmers. Between 1907 and 1913, Ivan bought no fewer than 18 Cézannes.It’s the long-hidden French gems that are this show’s treasure. There are two astonishing Van Goghs: “La Mer aux Saintes-Maries” (1888), a diminutive marine view whose zesty blues and whipped-cream whites prophesy the Fauvism that wouldn’t arrive for another two decades; and “The Prison Courtyard, Saint-Rémy” (1890), a tragic image of prisoners shuffling around a green-grey tower. Made after a drawing by Doré just two years after the life-affirming seascape, it was painted while Van Gogh was locked up in the Saint-Rémy asylum. Between them, these two images are a poignant witness to the turbulent psyche of this tormented talent.Equally illuminating are the Matisses. A quartet of early still lifes — “The Bottle of Schiedam” (1896), “Blue Pot and Lemon” (1897), “Fruit and Coffee Pot” (1898) and “Blue Pitcher” (1901) — show the painter navigating away from Dutch-style grandeur towards the ecstatic chromaticism that, in the 1898 painting, transforms a fruit bowl into a sun-kissed festival of peachy pink, citron yellow and eau-de-nil.By 1912-13, when Matisse painted his “Moroccan Triptych”, his surrender to pure colour was complete. In a palette of ultramarine, cobalt and turquoise, the paintings bind the north African sky, sea and architecture into a single radiant expression of sun-seared, ceramic-smooth blueness. It was acquired by Morozov with the assistance of Shchukin who, rather than being threatened, encouraged his fellow collector to buy bolder works.This is not a flawless show. In 2021, to see Gauguin’s Tahitian paintings of pubescent, half-naked girls curated without so much as a nod to the creepy eroto-colonialism that underpins them, is unacceptable. And although Morozov called them the “pearls of his painting gallery”, the stylised panorama of flimsy, raspberry-skinned nudes ensures that the decorative cycle, “L’Histoire de Psyche” — commissioned from Nabis group painter Maurice Denis by Ivan for his Music Salon in 1907 — is a kitsch, reactionary, faux-Arcadian pastiche of the Renaissance cycle by Raphael on which they were based.Yet the conservative anima of “Psyche” played a fascinating role in the rollercoaster journey the Morozov collection suffered after the Russian Revolution of 1917. When his collection was nationalised in 1918, Ivan fled to Finland before settling in Switzerland. In 1925, his Russian paintings were dispatched to Moscow’s Tretyakov Gallery.In 1928, the collection was united with that of Shchukin as the State Museum of Modern Western Art, but a number of Denis panels were covered by Shchukin’s Matisse works. In 1937, when the Matisses were removed along with Fauvist and Cubist works because their “formalism” was deemed ideologically unacceptable, the “Psyche” cycle was reinstated.Towards 1948, Stalin pulled the plug on the whole decadent enterprise. Squirrelled away in the Pushkin and Hermitage museums, the Morozovs’ paintings were not shown until after Stalin’s death in 1953 when some Impressionists found wall space. However, the later avant-gardes remained off-limits until the late 1960s and Morozov’s name was not mentioned until a show in 1981 at the Pushkin Museum.In Paris, this story is recounted through documentary photographs of the Prechistenka mansion’s many transformations. But, shocked though we are by such suppression, we should remember that the freedom of Russian artists today is gravely at risk. President Vladimir Putin has written a note in the Louis Vuitton Foundation’s catalogue lauding Morozov’s “unique collection”. It’s a shame he is less compassionate towards contemporary dissident voices.To February 22, 2022, fondationlouisvuitton.frFollow @ftweekend on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first
298  The EU needs to classify gas as a “transition fuel” to green energy if it wants to cut the use of coal and meet its emissions targets, the chief executive of the Czech energy group EP Infrastructure has said.The bloc is aiming to reduce its net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050, and the European Commission is due to spell out next month how it will classify natural gas and nuclear energy during the transition to a greener economy.Gary Mazzotti, chief executive of EP Infrastructure, which transports Russian gas to several European markets and is controlled by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky’s EPH, said that for central Europe the only realistic way to move away from its historic reliance on coal was via gas.“The longer you put off giving gas that transition [status], the longer you prolong the use of coal,” he said in an interview with the Financial Times.The commission’s classification system will need to win the approval of a majority of EU states and the European parliament. Countries such as Poland have been pushing for gas to be recognised as a transitional fuel while the likes of France have demanded nuclear technology be assigned this label. A group of 150 NGOs have urged the commission not to award gas such a label.However, Mazzotti said that for central Europe, there was no alternative to treating gas as a transitional fuel. “Ultimately, the French need nuclear to be classified as sustainable, and this part of the region needs gas to be sustainable if you want to achieve carbon neutrality,” he said, adding that the bloc also needed to ensure that adequate gas storage facilities and long-term contracts were in place.Europe’s gas market has been in the spotlight in recent months as prices, which slumped last year as the pandemic hit, have spiralled, forcing some energy suppliers out of the market, and prompting concerns about supplies this winter.Mazzotti said the surge in prices had been driven by a range of factors, ranging from a rebound in European demand as the pandemic eases, to a drop in European production and lower deliveries of LNG from the US.Some market participants also believe that Russia has contributed to the surge in prices by limiting top-up sales to customers, in an effort to pressure EU regulators into approving its newly completed Nordstream 2 pipeline — which was fiercely opposed by the US and several countries in central Europe.Mazzotti said this could be a factor, but that in the medium to long term, high gas prices did not help either consumers or suppliers, and could also slow down the green transition.“Low [gas] prices encourage too much transition [away from coal] too quickly. And the high prices that we have right now encourage no transition and actually promote the extension of the life of coal,” he said.“So there is a . . . balance which I would expect to come back into the market, some time after the first quarter of next year.”
299  France and Spain have joined forces to demand sweeping changes to the EU’s energy market rules in the face of “unbearable” electricity price increases that are hitting consumers and driving up inflation.Paris and Madrid’s calls for reform come after a surge in gas prices that has raised fears of an EU winter energy crisis.“The EU energy market is not fit for what we want to achieve,” said Bruno Le Maire, France’s economy minister ahead of a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Luxembourg on Monday. “It is time to have a look at the European energy market. It has one major downside, which is the alignment of electricity prices with the price of gas.”Le Maire said the crisis was “unfair, inefficient and costly” for citizens and businesses. He said he and his Spanish counterpart, Nadia Calviño, would ask the European Commission for better regulation of the bloc’s natural gas stocks and reform of EU rules to reduce price volatility.The EU’s common energy market was set up in the 1990s to help liberalise market access for electricity providers and ensure some harmony in prices. Governments retain full control of their national energy mixes.Spain has since July been calling for a change to the EU’s marginal pricing system — under which rates are set by the highest prices national grids are willing to pay. Last month it demanded a common EU approach, including natural gas purchases to counteract vendors’ market power and the building of strategic reserves.“European challenges require a European response,” Calviño, the number two in Spain’s government, said in an FT interview ahead of the meeting. She argued that a strategic gas reserve would be “learning the lesson from the response to the pandemic and the centralised buying of vaccines”.Speaking after the Eurogroup ministerial meeting, EU economics commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said Brussels would present a package of energy policies in December that will explore the bloc’s role in the common procurement of natural gas and options for greater storage.Gentiloni added that national policy responses should be “temporary and targeted to respect the single market and state-aid rules”.Spain’s Calviño pushed back against electricity companies’ challenge to Madrid’s €3bn levy on their “windfall profits” — one of the leftwing government’s main reactions to the crisis. Madrid says the funds will be used to reduce the prices faced by consumers — at present pushed up by high gas and carbon costs — but the utilities say the move could deter green investment and violate EU law.“It is essential that this increase in wholesale prices is not fully passed on to customers and companies and therefore we must use all possible legal instruments to reduce the elements of the energy bill,” Calviño said. She added that the Spanish levy, most of which has already become law, was “absolutely and fully compliant with EU legislation”.In Spain, where electricity tariffs paid by more than a third of households are linked to high spot market prices, the energy crisis has dominated the political agenda for months.But the price rises have added to the sense of urgency elsewhere in the EU, with some leaders calling for the bloc to reconsider decarbonisation plans that could further increase the pressure on households.Brussels is resisting demands to amend its electricity pricing rules, with officials maintaining that much of the price surge will dissipate early in 2022. The commission will, however, publish a paper shortly laying out what options governments have to tackle the crisis.Officials told the FT that the commission was assessing whether government measures in response to the price rises were in line with EU electricity market and state-aid rules.One EU competition expert said Spain’s raid on windfall profits would be assessed to see if it unfairly targeted some companies and sectors over others, thus falling foul of the bloc’s state-aid rules.In a further sign of concern about the issue, José Manuel Albares, Spain’s foreign minister, travelled last week to Algeria, traditionally the country's biggest gas provider, to obtain assurances that it would keep Spain supplied at market prices, despite the planned closure of a pipeline that runs via Morocco.
300  Ireland has unveiled plans to pump a record €165bn into infrastructure projects by 2030, as it struggles to keep pace with a fast-growing population after decades of under-investment in the sector.Despite the lofty ambitions for more roads, train connections, green buses, broadband and sports facilities and the history of delays and cost overruns for infrastructure projects, taoiseach Micheál Martin said he was confident that the government could deliver on “many, many of the projects” in the National Development Plan.Decades of under-investment in schools, hospitals and housing despite the Celtic Tiger boom that preceded the 2008 financial crash have left holes in public infrastructure.With Ireland’s 5m population set to grow by 1m by 2040, pressure on existing services is only set to grow. “With a rapidly rising population, Ireland needs to invest big in infrastructure,” deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar said.The plan will lift public spending on infrastructure to 5 per cent of modified gross national income — an economic measure Ireland uses that strips out factors relating to its open economy that could otherwise distort GDP — versus 4.5 per cent now and 2.5 per cent in 2017, the government says.That is well ahead of the EU average of 3 per cent of GDP and works out at some €19.3bn in 2030 compared with €12.7bn this year. “We are investing in the future and going for growth,” said Varadkar. The programme does not draw on some €1bn in Covid-19 recovery funds that Ireland is receiving from the EU.Some 80 per cent, or €136bn of the programme, is to be funded directly from government coffers with the remainder from semistate bodies as well as public-private partnerships.The government will end the year with a national debt of a quarter of a trillion euros. Dublin announced on Monday that public revenues were picking up with tax receipts in September of €6.4bn — 20 per cent higher than the same month last year and 8 per cent above the government’s targets.The 184-page plan includes the largest investment in Irish history on housing as well as education and healthcare projects, but much of the focus is on transport infrastructure, including a long touted Metrolink connecting Dublin airport to the capital. No completion date for the Metrolink was included.Eamon Ryan, environment minister, said the programme was the greenest capital investment plan in Ireland’s history and had been “climate-proofed”, including €35bn on transport initiatives “prioritising walking, cycling and public transport”. The programme would create more than 80,000 direct and indirect jobs in the construction sector, he added.Analysts have questioned the government’s focus and ability to see the projects through.The plan includes many major highway projects as well as bus and train infrastructure. Brian Caulfield, an engineering professor at Trinity College, said that “my fear is that roads get through planning faster”.Marie Sherlock, a Labour party senator, tweeted that some initiatives “may never see the light of day”.Martin acknowledged that “delivery is a key challenge”, adding: “We have to get better at actually delivering infrastructure.”
301  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
302  The British government will suspend parts of the Brexit deal covering trade with Northern Ireland if it does not get an expansive set of concessions from the EU, Lord David Frost said on Monday.The UK’s Brexit minister struck a downbeat note as he addressed the Conservative party conference in Manchester, warning that Brussels was failing to grasp the scale of the changes needed to fix a deal that has bedevilled post-Brexit relations with the EU.“I urge the EU to be ambitious. It’s no use tinkering around the edges. We need significant change,” he said.The UK and Brussels have been locked in negotiations since last July over the so-called Northern Ireland protocol, the part of the Withdrawal Agreement that requires all goods going from the British mainland to Northern Ireland to follow EU customs rules and regulations.Despite agreeing to the arrangement in October 2019, Frost has declared the deal to be “unsustainable” and is asking for a fundamental rewrite of the protocol, including removing the oversight of the European Court of Justice.The European Commission is working on a new set of proposals to ease some of the problems caused by the deal, which diplomats expect will be put forward this month.However, Frost signalled that the UK had low expectations of Brussels’ package and was prepared to suspend parts of the agreement unilaterally, using a mechanism in the protocol known as Article 16.“We await a formal response from the EU to our proposals. But from what I hear I worry that we will not get one which enables the significant change we need,” he said, adding that he had sent legal texts to the commission based on the solutions outlined by the UK in July.Officials on both sides said negotiators remained a long way apart. In a closed-door meeting with MEPs last week, the EU’s Brexit commissioner Maros Sefcovic made it clear the bloc was open to “creative solutions” to the stand-off, but only within the legal framework of the existing deal.Among the ideas are longer-term legislative solutions to help supplies of medicines and new efforts to facilitate trade in the area of customs and animal health in Northern Ireland. But UK aspirations to strip the ECJ of its role were a non-starter, Brussels has insisted.UK officials similarly said London would not tolerate a foreign court overseeing an internal trade border in the Irish Sea. Instead, they want an independent arbitration mechanism. “We’ve got to set a goal that trading with Belfast is the same as trading with Birmingham,” said one.Once put forward, Brussels’ counterproposals were expected to lead to a set of intensive negotiations in late October or early November, officials said. Failure to reach agreement would probably lead to the triggering of Article 16, a clause that either side can invoke if they judge the protocol is causing “economic, societal or environmental difficulties”.The UK said in July that the threshold for using Article 16 had already been reached, but it was delaying its use in order to find solutions. The EU has for the same reason deferred legal action that it took earlier this year over the UK’s breaching of the terms of the protocol.Once triggered, Article 16 would require a set of talks and, if no deal were reached, potential legal and trade sanctions. EU officials said Brussels’ reaction to the UK invoking Article 16 would depend on whether London used it to address narrow and specific areas of concern, or took a wider approach and suspended Irish Sea border checks entirely.If the UK went too far, there was a risk of both broader trade retaliation and diplomatic fallout, officials said.France’s Europe minister Clément Beaune warned in an interview with the Financial Times that invoking Article 16 could “kill the accord”, including elements of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement. He added that Paris hoped the UK would not take that step.“It would show in any case that [the UK] does not want to respect the agreements we have signed, that is to say the withdrawal agreement, and the trade and partnership agreement — and it would also be a big breach of trust, as well as a mistake for the stability of Ireland.”But London is under pressure from Northern Ireland’s Protestant unionist parties, which have rejected the protocol as an attack on their community’s place within the UK and want it scrapped.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, has threatened to collapse Northern Ireland’s power-sharing executive as soon as this month by pulling his ministers out unless the protocol goes.Doug Beattie, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, told the FT that triggering Article 16 would not go far enough. “It may well address narrow issues within the protocol and begin a negotiation process but it is not a long-term solution.”Officials on both sides said the next few months would be crucial in normalising relations between the EU and the UK, which have been poisoned since January by the issue of the protocol.Frost acknowledged that a deal was essential to restoring “friendly relations” with Brussels, adding: “But we cannot wait forever. Without an agreed solution soon, we will need to act, using the Article 16 safeguard mechanism.”
303  Austria’s government has outlined a plan to impose new taxes on carbon emissions that will, in turn, fund tax cuts for middle earners in a move Chancellor Sebastian Kurz hopes will breathe life into his coalition government’s green-conservative agenda.From next July, Austrians would be taxed €30 per tonne of carbon, rising to €55 by 2025, Kurz said. The measure will initially translate to an extra cost of 10 cents on the litre at petrol stations and also €130 more for the average Austrian household’s annual heating costs.Receipts from the rise will be passed on in the form of tax cuts worth an estimated €18bn by 2025, the Austrian chancellery said. From next July the income tax rate will drop from 35 to 30 per cent for those earning between €18,000 and €31,000. A year later it will drop from 42 to 40 per cent for those earning between €31,000 and €60,000.“We’ve said we want to give relief to all those who work, in particular low- and middle-income workers, families and pensioners who have worked their whole lives,” Kurz said.The twin measures highlight the delicate balancing act of EU governments that are striving to shift consumers away from CO2-intensive spending, while avoiding fuel protests such as the gilets jaunes that rocked France for months in 2018. Austria’s chancellery officials said Kurz was particularly wary of triggering such a backlash in Austria as frustrations over pandemic-related restrictions have mounted.Austria joins other EU states in imposing a cost on CO2 emissions. German legislation that came into force this year set a price of €25 per tonne, rising to €55 by 2025. France has a carbon tax of €45 a tonne, and the Netherlands €30.The EU-wide Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) applies a carbon price for big industrial polluters and power generators by allocating tradeable allowances. The price for these allowances reached more than €64 last week. One allowance gives the holder the right to emit one tonne of CO2.“Less dirt in the air, more money in the exchequer,” declared vice-chancellor Werner Kogler, leader of Austria’s Green party, who announced the measures alongside Kurz on Sunday.Austria’s opposition parties, however, were universal in their criticism of the proposals.The social democrats argued that the package favoured the interests of big business: under the plan, some large emitters will receive exemptions. The effect of inflation and fiscal drag will wipe out the gains for low- and middle-income taxpayers within just two years, said their party’s finance spokesperson Jan Krainer.Herbert Kickl, leader of the rightwing populist Freedom party, said the tax reform was “a pure sham . . . a punishment package for Austrian taxpayers”.Austrian climate activists meanwhile said the carbon tax was nowhere near enough.A prominent study in the scientific journal Nature estimates that a price of €120 per tonne is needed by 2030 to decarbonise economies by 2050, in line with EU goals.The tax deal follows months of tense negotiations between Kurz’s conservative People’s party and the Greens that came down to the wire, with the federal budget due to be presented to parliament next week. Kurz was forced to cancel a trip to Spain this weekend in order to finalise terms with his coalition partners.For Kurz, the deal is politically sensitive. Poll ratings for his party have slipped over the past 18 months. The party is polling at 35 per cent favourability, down from 44 per cent in May 2020. Last weekend, regional elections saw vaccine sceptics elected in Upper Austria and the Communist party take control of Austria’s second city, Graz.Additional reporting by Mehreen Khan in Brussels
304  Thank God for Germany. That is not a sentiment that you heard much during the 20th century. As the second world war drew to a close, Henry Morgenthau, the US Treasury secretary, argued that the only answer to the German question was the destruction of the country’s industrial capacity. François Mauriac, the French writer, welcomed the division of the country, joking “I love Germany so much, I’m glad there are two of them”.When reunification loomed in 1990, a meeting of chiefly British intellectuals, convened by Margaret Thatcher, discussed the German national character. Her chief foreign policy adviser wrote minutes suggesting these were “in alphabetical order, angst, aggressiveness, assertiveness, bullying, egotism, inferiority complex, sentimentality”.Thirty years on and these stereotypes about national character have been completely reversed. It is the US and the UK where politics seem increasingly prone to “angst, aggressiveness” and all those other unattractive, supposedly Teutonic, qualities. These days, it is German public life that is characterised by the virtues the British often attribute to themselves — calm, restraint, rationality and compromise.The recent German election and its aftermath underline the point. It was a close contest, but the losers accepted the results gracefully. Nobody tried to claim that the voting was rigged or that their opponents were “scum” — or represented a mortal danger to the country.The Social Democrats now look set to lead a German government for the first time since 2005. But a transition of power will not bring about an abrupt rupture in policies or an attempt by the political opposition to paralyse the government, as is happening in the US.The SPD’s Olaf Scholz, who may become chancellor, ran as a continuity candidate. As my FT colleagues reported, voters saw Scholz “with his quiet demeanour, long experience in government and pragmatic politics, as Merkel’s natural successor”. How very different from the leadership profiles of Donald Trump or Boris Johnson.This reversal of roles is not simply one of the ironies of history. It is the product of history. Unlike any other country that I know of, Germany has placed a memorial to its greatest national disgrace right at the heart of its capital. The Holocaust memorial in Berlin stands near the Brandenburg Gate, the traditional centre of the city. It is a symbol of modern Germany’s determination to acknowledge the horrors of Nazism — and to learn the lessons.Because they know where demagoguery can lead, mainstream German politicians are allergic to the cult of the leader. No candidate for chancellor would ever boast, as Trump did, that “I alone can fix it”, or encourage chants of “lock her up” about his opponent. In the recent election debates, the party leaders treated each other with an underlying respect and restraint. They know that politics is a serious business. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Germany’s president, is said to be particularly contemptuous of Johnson because he thinks that the British prime minister treats politics as a game.Modern Germany is not immune to the dangers of political extremism. In 2020, a crowd of anti-vaxxers and assorted extremists attempted, unsuccessfully, to storm the Reichstag. In the wake of the refugee crisis of 2015, when Merkel allowed over 1m migrants and refugees into the country, many observers, myself included, predicted a surge in political extremism in Germany. The atmosphere in the 2017 election was often ugly. The extreme-right Alternative for Germany party won a large bloc of seats in parliament.But in the most recent election, the political extremes of right and left both lost votes. The centre has not only held in Germany, it has strengthened. The AfD is still strong in eastern Germany, but it is further away than ever from national power.One difference between Germany and other large western nations is that high levels of immigration have not radicalised the mainstream right. Trump came to power on the back of a promise to build the wall. Johnson won the Brexit referendum on a pledge to “take back control” of Britain’s borders and laws — particularly borders. In France, Michel Barnier, who is campaigning for the centre-right’s nomination for the French presidency, has called for a moratorium on all immigration from outside the EU. Éric Zemmour, the rising star of the far right, threatens to throw 2m people out of the country.The German government, by contrast, continues to make the case for immigration. In August, the head of Germany’s federal labour agency said that the ageing of the country’s workforce means that Germany needs to let in 400,000 new immigrants every year — arguing that without this level of migration, “there will be a shortage of skilled workers everywhere”. Only the AfD condemned the idea outright.The strength of the centre ground in Germany does not mean the extinction of debate. It could take months to form a governing coalition. It will be hard to narrow policy differences between the Greens, the Free Democrats and the SPD. But the very need to build a coalition militates against the political polarisation — and demonisation of the opposition — that has become standard in the Anglosphere.In the 21st century, German politics is once again exceptional. But this time for a good reason.This article has been republished to correct the name of the former Treasury secretary Henry Morgenthaugideon.rachman@ft.comLetters in response to this article:Washington memorialises America’s greatest disgrace / From David C Speedie, Charlottesville, VA, USBritain’s liberal political culture puts Germany in the shade / From Vernon Bogdanor, Professor of Government, King’s College, London, London WC2, UK
305  Turkish inflation accelerated to its fastest rate in two-and-a-half years in September as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan stepped up his unconventional efforts to bring down soaring prices.Data released on Monday by Turkey’s official statistics agency showed that the consumer price index rose at an annual rate of 19.58 per cent last month — up from 19.25 in August. The rate is nearly four times the central bank’s official inflation target and the biggest yearly increase since March 2019.Erdogan, whose ruling party is suffering from historically low poll ratings, has faced growing public discontent over the soaring cost of living.But the Turkish leader, who believes contrary to economic orthodoxy that high interest rates cause inflation rather than curb it, has also pressured the country’s central bank to lower borrowing costs even amid rising prices.The bank slashed its benchmark lending rate last month. The decision, which left Turkey with the deepest negative interest rate of any emerging market, put fresh pressure on the embattled Turkish lira.Public anger has focused in particular on food prices, which have accelerated even faster than the headline inflation rate. The cost of food rose almost 29 per cent in September, according to the latest data.Erdogan has blamed rising prices on “opportunists” in the food and retail sectors. Last month his government announced a fresh round of investigations into supermarket chains that it accused of adopting “unreasonable” price increases.On Sunday, the Turkish president said he had ordered agricultural co-operatives to open about 1,000 new branches across the country in order to provide “suitable” prices for basic goods.“We gave the order for about 1,000 of these businesses to open around Turkey, starting at 500 square meters each,” he said. “These are places where prices are suitable to our citizens’ budgets.”Erdogan, who built much of his early political success on the back of ushering in rising prosperity, has increasingly developed a reputation for eccentric and erratic solutions to economic problems in recent years.In 2018, in the wake of a currency crisis that wiped almost 30 per cent off the value of the lira, the government launched a campaign urging retailers to hold down their prices. The following year, the government launched municipal-run “people’s vegetable” stalls in major cities in an effort to combat what Erdogan called “food terrorism”.Analysts warn that the combination of high inflation and low interest rates could lead to fresh pressure on the Turkish lira, which has hovered in recent weeks above what would have been a record low of nine to the dollar.“The further rise in both headline and core inflation last month will provide some food for thought for the central bank, but we doubt that it will prevent it from pushing ahead with further interest rate cuts,” Jason Tuvey, an economist at the London-based consultancy Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients after Monday’s data. “Political pressure on the institution for lower rates appears to be swaying decisions.”
306  Bernard Tapie, the French businessman who rose from nothing to scale the heights of power in politics and sports despite being dogged by scandal, has died of cancer aged 78.With a gift for self-promotion and not a little charm, Tapie became a symbol of les années fric (the money years) in 1980s Socialist-led France as he made a fortune buying bankrupt companies in industries from batteries to weighing scales.But Tapie was never a dull chief executive in a suit, and he stood out in the often conservative French business elite. With his trademark mane of wavy hair and a deep tan, he seemed to live multiple lives — all of them colourful — earning vast sums of money only to lose it, winning elected office, and becoming a television presenter and pop crooner.His biggest business coup — buying sports-gear maker Adidas — in the 1990s ended as his biggest nightmare, leading to a long legal battle he was still fighting when he died. The legal woes, which pitted him against the French state and banking establishment, have outlived him: an appeals judgment is expected on October 6.As he rose in business in the 1980s, Tapie caught the eye of then Socialist president François Mitterrand, who backed his political career by helping him win a seat in parliament for Marseille. His fearless takedown of far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen in a televised debate in 1989 impressed Mitterrand, who later named him as minister of urban affairs, to the shock of others in the cabinet.When he was named minister, he decided to sell his stake in Adidas to signal his independence, a decision he later told his biographer he bitterly regretted. “I’ve made many mistakes in my life, but that was the biggest one,” he said. “Selling one of the best known sports brands in the world for a shortlived stint as minister.”Although he grew up in a working class family in Paris, Marseille became Tapie’s spiritual home and where his most glorious and lowest moments took place. He gained adulation as the owner of Olympique de Marseille when it won five titles and Europe’s top football prize in 1993, a first for a French club. Opprobrium followed, however, when he was convicted in 1995 on match-fixing charges, and served six months in prison after losing his appeals.Soon after, he went bankrupt and was convicted in separate cases for corruption and tax fraud.When Tapie emerged from jail in 1997 he told journalist Airy Routier he would exact revenge just as the main character did in Alexandre Dumas’s The Count of Monte Cristo. “I am Edmond Dantès. I will come back and crush them all,” Routier recalled in a 2020 documentary.Tapie did indeed rebuild his business interests, helped in part by a spectacular arbitration award worth €403m that he won in 2008 stemming from the sale of his stake in Adidas.That saga began when he sued the then state-owned Crédit Lyonnais bank, his former lender, alleging the bank had sold Adidas at a depressed price. Tapie ended up fighting the French state after Crédit Lyonnais failed.The case turned into a political scandal after it was alleged that President Nicolas Sarkozy and allies had pushed for the settlement instead of continuing the court case. Since the payout to Tapie came from public coffers, it prompted outrage in some quarters and questions about whether he benefited from political connections.L’Affaire Tapie, as it was called in the press, has cast a long shadow over the French business and political elite: in 2016 Christine Lagarde, now head of the European Central Bank, was convicted of negligence over her actions as France’s finance minister at the time (Lagarde did not appeal). Her then chief of staff, Stéphane Richard — now chief executive of state-backed telecoms group Orange — is still facing charges related to the payout and his appeal judgment is expected on Wednesday.As the various cases dragged on, Tapie returned to his habits of conspicuous consumption. He splashed out on a 76-metre yacht he named Reborn, a private jet and bought the Marseille newspaper La Provence.In 2015, a court ordered Tapie to return the Crédit Lyonnais settlement money, but as of mid-2021 he still had not done so amid the continuing legal challenges.Prosecutors also alleged that Tapie and others engaged in fraud to get the settlement. He was tried along with five co-defendants and acquitted in 2019. Prosecutors appealed that decision and a new trial took place in May 2021.Weakened from a years-long battle with cancer, a white-haired, rail-thin Tapie appeared in court on one occasion before his family said he was too frail to attend.Tapie went public in 2017 with his diagnosis of stomach and oesophageal cancer by telling a well-known Olympique de Marseille supporter, who announced it on social media. The next day, fans at OM’s Velodrome stadium chanted his name and unfurled banners reading: “Courage! We are with you boss.” Since then Tapie had spoken out about his battle with the illness and advocated for other sufferers. “Each person has to find the motivation for their combat,” he said in an interview with broadcaster TF1 in April this year. “Science is advancing incredibly quickly, so someone with a supposedly mortal cancer now can still have hope.”In the same interview, he said there were things he still wanted to accomplish and mused about acting in a movie for his old friend, the director Claude Lelouch. “He wants to make a last movie with me and I am crazy happy about it!”Tapie is survived by four children and his wife of 34 years, Dominique Tapie.The story was corrected on October 4, 2021 to include the fact that Christine Lagarde was convicted of negligence in 2016.
307  As semiconductor shortages continue to force carmakers to cut back production, the EU’s internal market commissioner Thierry Breton visited Japan and South Korea last week in search of international partnerships for the bloc’s planned “European Chips Act”. Formally unveiled last month by Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, this aims to bring the EU up to speed with other leading microchip producers. The plan is well motivated — but flawed in parts.Supply chain disruptions have focused attention on microchips as the heart of the digital economy — crucial to artificial intelligence, quantum computing and the “internet of things”. Access to the most sophisticated chips is important not just for industry but for military security. Yet most production is in the hands of China, Taiwan, South Korea, and the US.All are investing heavily in bolstering their own positions. The bipartisan Chips for America Act envisages billions of dollars of investment in microchip manufacturing and research. China, hampered by export controls preventing transfer of US technology, is spending even more on trying to catch up. Von der Leyen frames the EU’s plans as a matter of “competitiveness and technological sovereignty”.Semiconductors are the kind of area in which co-ordinated EU action can bring results. But one of the key goals — doubling the EU’s share of global semiconductor manufacturing to 20 per cent by 2030 — is risky and expensive. Today’s top producers enjoy a head start of decades and countless billions of dollars in investment. They also have large manufacturing sectors, for example in consumer electronics, that provide markets for the output of “mega-fabs” or plants producing large volumes of advanced chips.The business case for pouring vast investment — including public money — into building a substantial EU position in all parts of the semiconductor value chain is unproven. It is unclear if EU chip plants, with higher labour costs and lower subsidies, can compete with low-cost Asian producers.There is a more compelling case for the EU to funnel public and private investment into building up parts of the supply chain that it already does well — including research and development, and specialist manufacturing. It should seek to harness its scientific prowess in high-value areas, notably by rekindling its chip design industry. Europe lacks leading “fabless” tech companies that design chips and outsource manufacturing — though it has strong research facilities, such as Belgium’s Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre, a leader in semiconductor research, including 2-nanometer chips.The bloc also needs to strengthen mutual dependencies with other partners, especially the US. It could leverage its position as a supplier of machinery and other important inputs, such as chemicals, for chip manufacturing. The Netherlands’ ASML, for example, supplies advanced lithography machines to chipmakers. The EU can offer its machinery, inputs and designs in return for guaranteed access to microchip production.Though the EU’s semiconductor initiative has received most attention, a parallel alliance it launched in July — on edge and cloud computing — is no less significant, and arguably a better case for an activist policy. It aims to bring together businesses, academics and the research world to foster development of next-generation cloud infrastructure for the public and private sectors. Success here, rather than in being able to make its own chips, will be more decisive in securing European competitiveness for the future.
308  Nothing says October like autumn foliage, pumpkin spice latte and — to EU aficionados — decamping in Luxembourg for the ministerial councils this month. With the energy price crisis having contributed to worsening inflation data, we’ll explore how the issue is likely to dominate the eurogroup today — and several other ministers’ meetings taking place at the Kirchberg Conference Centre.Also on the eurogroup agenda, though a mere side note, is the single currency’s mushrooming supervisory architecture. We’re unpacking what the thousands of newly employed financial sleuths are supposed to be doing and when the yet-to-be-established structures are expected to come online.And with local elections in Italy ending tonight, we look at Matteo Salvini’s dwindling fortunes — with the caveat that the political survival skills of “Il Capitano” should not be underestimated.This article is an on-site version of our Europe Express newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every weekday morningEurope’s escalating energy price crisis will be the focus of attention today when eurozone finance ministers discuss how surging electricity and gas prices could strain government coffers and scupper the EU’s nascent economic recovery, writes Mehreen Khan in Brussels.This afternoon’s meeting of the eurogroup in Luxembourg will be dominated by record prices for natural gas, the causes and consequences of which are dividing member states. The EU’s southern and eastern countries have called on Brussels to help alleviate the pressure on their struggling households, demanding the European Commission come up new emergency funds and provide explicit support for national spending measures to protect consumers.In an interview with the Financial Times, Spain’s deputy prime minister Nadia Calviño urges the commission to provide a common response after Madrid has been forced into drastic action to curb price rises for consumers. France and Italy have launched similar emergency measures this month. Brussels has said it will make clear the tools member states have at their disposal — in line with EU energy and competition rules. But the commission is unlikely to offer radical measures such as diverting the profits from the bloc’s Emissions Trading Scheme to cushion the blow for households. A commission’s “flexibilities” paper is likely to be published next week. Brussels’ initial response may prove to be modest, but officials and diplomats are acutely aware of how the energy debate could poison talks on crucial policy areas that will need to be resolved in the upcoming months. The energy crisis has touched on some of the EU’s most sensitive internal debates, from the bloc’s approach to carbon taxes, dependence on Russian gas, upcoming rules for sustainable finance, and the pending revision of EU spending rules. European leaders are due to grapple with the potential fallout at a summit in Brussels later this month. Northern member states are balking at the idea that higher fuel costs should lead the EU to slow down the road to decarbonisation. The fact that poorer, more fossil fuel reliant countries are in line to suffer the brunt of the impact also risks deepening divides on the transition to net zero and a looming revamp of EU fiscal rules.“This has the potential to sow distrust between countries as we enter a gruelling winter,” said one EU official. In an interview with the FT, BioNTech chief executive Ugur Sahin said Covid-19 vaccines might need significant changes next year to deal with new variants, along with booster shots and doses for the unvaccinated. Around the globe, Israel has been an outlier in its booster campaign for anyone over 12 — with encouraging results. In the EU, France was the first country to start administering booster jabs to over 65 years old last month. In the UK, booster shots are being offered to those over 50. (More here)Earlier this year some could be heard arguing that the advent of a new German coalition government after federal elections had the potential to break some of the most stubborn stalemates in the EU agenda, among them over the long-stalled Banking Union project, writes Sam Fleming in Brussels. Such claims are more likely to elicit cynical looks at the eurogroup today, as policymakers grimly contemplate continued political deadlock on files including European deposit insurance and bank crisis management. Yet as a forthcoming note from the Centre for European Policy Studies argues, beneath the stagnant surface there is surprisingly rapid movement in other parts of the EU’s regulatory scene. Karel Lannoo, the note’s author, describes a “blossoming European supervisory architecture” as the EU continues to amass new financial supervisory tasks, structures and employees. Some 2,500 people are now employed in EU financial supervision, the note finds — an enormous expansion compared with the pre-crisis era of thinly staffed supervisory committees with dozens of employees. Half of those individuals are working in the Frankfurt-based banking supervisor housed at the European Central Bank. Others are in bodies including Paris-based Esma, whose proposed new chair Verena Ross won support from the European parliament’s econ committee last week. The arrival of the proposed new Anti-Money Laundering Authority in the first half of this decade will add at least another 250 to the EU’s army of scrutineers — teeing up a battle among capitals to win the coveted job of hosting the agency. The problem with all this is, inevitably, the system’s burgeoning complexity and the problem of duplication and overlap with national bodies. New proposals for the regulation of crypto assets and the handling of technology risks in the financial sector (known by the affable-sounding acronyms Mica and Dora) have for example been bogged down in political turf wars.Meanwhile, the Brussels-based Single Resolution Board has only once been used in a fully fledged bank resolution, as governments seek to circumvent the EU-level rules and protect their failing banks using taxpayer money. Esma is seen as one of the success stories, and it counts the credit rating agencies and trade repositories among the institutions directly under its watch. But it is far from being the powerful capital markets regulator and supervisor that some believe is necessary to achieve a level playing field for market players and further the goal of Capital Markets Union (CMU). Indeed, that long-cherished EU ambition — which has been around for more than a decade and a half — remains as elusive as ever, as member states seek to guard the privileges of their own domestic watchdogs and build up the fortunes of their financial centres. The scant prospects for progress on CMU are unlikely to be enhanced when finance ministers meet today and tomorrow. As CEPS argues, Europe’s financial supervisory tasks and structures are growing at a rapid pace, but “a clear vision is missing”.Mayoral elections in Italy’s largest cities that started yesterday and are ending this evening are expected to do little to alleviate the troubles engulfing Matteo Salvini, the embattled leader of the populist League party, writes Davide Ghiglione in Rome.About 12m voters are going to the polls across the country, in more than 1,000 cities and smaller towns, for the first time since former European Central Bank president Mario Draghi was appointed prime minister last February. The centre-left is expected to win the most important cities, including Milan, Rome and Naples, while the outcome in Turin looks uncertain — with the centre-right possibly scoring a win there.The projected setbacks of the centre-right only solidify Salvini’s downward trend, aggravated last week when his social media manager, Luca Morisi was placed under police investigation for the alleged possession and sale of drugs. As the news leaked, Morisi resigned from the party, saying that he needed to “unplug” for family reasons. Morisi has denied the allegations, but said “the personal matter that concerns me represents a serious fall as a man”.His resignation, however, wasn’t enough to shelter Salvini, who himself is to stand trial for refusing migrant ships to dock in Italian ports when he was minister of interior.Morisi’s departure complicates Salvini’s attempt to bring about yet another transformation of his party, as he seeks to attract a more moderate and pro-European voter base.The social media guru had been one of Salvini’s closest advisers and had a crucial role in the success of the populist leader’s public profile on social media, which rebranded the League from a one-time northern separatist group into a pan-Italian nationalist party with a strong anti-immigrant discourse.Morisi’s method was simple: keep a steady flow of posts, tweets and Instagram stories showing Salvini engaging in relatable, day-to-day activities — from eating Nutella to praying on his knees before the Virgin Mary — all lined with xenophobic messaging. Since Salvini decided to support the government led by Draghi, who as head of the ECB was credited with saving the euro, the League’s national poll ratings are eroding, slipping to second place.Just as the League’s appeal is waning, the far-right Brothers of Italy — the only opposition party — enjoy more public support nationwide than any other Italian party (23 per cent in recent polls) after having scooped up a significant chunk of Salvini’s voters. Brothers of Italy leader Giorgia Meloni is now a serious contender to Salvini’s claim to become the candidate of a potential centre-right coalition to replace Draghi when his term ends.These elections will certainly represent a blow for him, but for the time being he has not been inflicted mortal woundsWithin the League itself, tectonic shifts are under way: Some members are silently reorganising around Giancarlo Giorgetti, a business-friendly political veteran who represents the mainstream wing of the party. As minister of economic development, Giorgetti has been carving out an increasingly crucial role for himself within the Draghi government, leaving Salvini only the crumbs.Some observers warn against writing Salvini off too soon, after all, he did succeed in convincing voters multiple times, shifting from an anti-euro, to an anti-immigration and now to a pro-European stance. “Figures with the political capital of Salvini don’t end in an instant,” said Gianluca Passarelli, professor of political science at Sapienza university in Rome. “He has still a dense network of loyal supporters throughout the country who will continue to fight alongside him.” Eurozone finance ministers meet in LuxembourgEuropean parliament starts its week-long Strasbourg session. . . and later this weekEU leaders meet in Slovenia tomorrow for an informal dinner ahead of a summit with western Balkan leaders WednesdayEU environment ministers meet in Luxembourg WednesdayCzech parliamentary elections take place on Friday and SaturdayNow we are primarily looking for momentumCoalition talks: Germany’s leading political parties have started exploratory talks yesterday, with the pro-business Free Democrats meeting (separately) with potential Social-Democratic chancellor Olaf Scholz and his rival from the centre-right, Armin Laschet.

Trickle of visas: British PM Boris Johnson signalled he would resist business pressure for more temporary visas for foreign workers to ease supply chain disruption. Credit Suisse, raided: Swiss police have raided the lender’s offices and seized documents relating to the collapse of its $10bn fund range linked to Greensill Capital. The public prosecutor in Zurich has opened a criminal investigation into Greensill’s activities and the way in which Credit Suisse funds that financed the British firm’s contentious lending schemes were managed and marketed, according to two people familiar with the probe.EU insolvency rules: Proposed rules to deal with failing insurance companies have been criticised for potentially exposing policyholders to losses.

309  Europe’s escalating gas supply crunch has pushed up the price of allowances linked to carbon emissions as energy producers switch over to cheaper but dirtier coal.EU carbon allowances last week topped €65 a tonne for the first time. Allowances under the UK’s nascent cap and trade system hit a record £76 (€88) a tonne.Under both the EU and UK emissions trading systems, polluters buy credits granting them permission to emit one tonne of carbon.Soaring gas prices driven by supply shortages have made generating energy from coal more profitable in the short term. Since coal is more polluting than gas, demand from power producers for EU and UK allowances has increased, driving up prices, said energy market analysts. Coal accounted for more than 5 per cent of UK power generation in early September, its highest level since March.The price rises are “being driven, we believe, by increased utility demand, as a result of increased fossil fuel generation”, said Tom Lord, head of trading at consultancy Redshaw Advisors.Traders had accepted that “for a certain amount of time”, potentially running into 2022, “there will be this fuel switch from gas to coal and therefore higher emissions from the power sector”, said Sebastian Rilling, EU power and carbon markets analyst at ICIS, the market intelligence group.The EU and UK systems are designed to put a cost on carbon dioxide emissions. Energy producers and industrial groups often buy allowances in advance to hedge their exposure to the carbon price, and to ensure they have enough credits to cover anticipated emissions. Speculators have also shown increasing interest in the market.The EU ETS broke above €50 in May for the first time, and has broadly stayed above that level since. The UK launched its own post-Brexit system in May. Allowances in the two markets traded roughly at parity until September, but UK credits have been trading at a widening premium for about two weeks.Redshaw’s Lord said that in addition to gas market issues, the UK system was suffering from an insufficient supply of credits. The newly established UK ETS has fortnightly auctions and few industrial sellers, and “doesn’t have a surplus like the EU market has”, he said.UK utilities are having to hedge both as a result of switching over to coal and because they used EU allowances to hedge their exposure before the UK system was established, he added.Looking ahead, the price of allowances under both systems will in part depend on gas prices, said analysts. Falling gas prices could prompt a switch back to the fuel and away from coal, and drive down the price of allowances.But a harsh winter that drives up fuel demand could mean sustained demand for coal.“I don’t think there’s much room for further price surges for [EU allowances] right now in the absence of an even tighter gas market,” said ICIS’s Rilling. But “it seems unlikely that [they] are going to come down from their all-time high levels any time soon”.
310  Hours before he issued a decree that makes it a crime to deny genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina, diplomat Valentin Inzko went on a dawn visit to the site of a mass grave in Srebrenica and, in his words, “searched his soul”. Then he did what he thought was the right thing.The town was where more than 8,000 Bosniak Muslim men and boys were killed by Serb forces in 1995. It was one of the most notorious incidents of the 1992-95 armed conflicts around the break-up of Yugoslavia, which claimed around 100,000 casualties.After that visit — and just before he left his post as international High Representative overseeing the small Balkan country — Inzko used the powers of his role to impose the ban on denying that genocide took place here in the 1990s.The issue divides the country. Many Serbs still deny that the atrocities were genocide despite several international court rulings on the issue.“My conscience dictated ultimately to use the Bonn powers and to impose the law,” Inzko, 72, told the Financial Times this month, referring to his former office’s authority to force through important legislation or sack officials seen as detrimental to the peace process.But the Austrian diplomat’s action has triggered a debilitating dispute in Bosnia and added to the complex situation in the wider Balkans, a fragile region where the EU is vying with Russia and China for influence.Since Inzko’s decision in July, Serbian members of Bosnia’s government — a carefully calibrated tripartite arrangement between mostly Muslim Bosniaks, eastern orthodox Serbs, and catholic Croats — have boycotted the administration, calling the ban a limit on freedom of expression. Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik has insisted genocide did not take place.The walkout by Republika Srpska (RS), one of the two entities that make up Bosnia, has undermined efforts such as responding to the coronavirus pandemic — Bosnia has Europe’s lowest vaccination rate — as well as basic functions such as agreeing next year’s budget.It also puts the unity of the Bosnian state in doubt at a time when Serb nationalism is on the rise and RS talks more loudly of wanting to break away.Inzko said he anticipated the reaction to his decision but said that bringing Bosnia into line with EU law, which prohibits genocide denial, was more important. “What is riskier for the future of the country?” he said. “The glorification of war criminals as founding fathers of Republika Srpska or a big, but temporary stir?”Inzko’s successor Christian Schmidt, a 64-year-old German former government minister, faces the challenge of protecting the genocide denial ban while ensuring Bosnia has a working government. In his first interview with international media, he said there would be no change to the genocide ban.“I do not see that there is anybody to have the content of legislation put into question,” he said.He said a boycott of Bosnia’s administration was the wrong political approach and he was concerned by the government’s “dysfunctionality”.But Schmidt sought to avoid laying collective blame, telling the FT that the genocide denial ban “cannot be directed against [Bosnian Serbs as a] people, only against individuals”.Bosnian leaders will attend a summit between the EU and western Balkan nations in Slovenia on Wednesday, with enlargement of the union high on the agenda. The EU is keen to keep the door open for Bosnia and the west Balkans in general, but balks at specific promises. A Slovenian EU presidency proposal for a 2030 deadline to admit all six western Balkan countries in the region shocked several member states.“Many people in the region perceive the EU process as dead,” said Majda Ruge, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin.Instead, a plan B was necessary, Ruge said, including “other types of leverage to prevent the unravelling of the central government”. She said that allowing that to happen would be a “humiliation” for the EU.Schmidt has also had to defend his position after a Security Council challenge from Russia and China, which argued in July that the Office of the High Representative (OHR) was no longer necessary to preserve peace in the Balkans. Russia was a party to the Dayton peace accords that outline Bosnia’s governance.Russia’s foreign ministry told the FT that the OHR was a “humiliating external protectorate” that “creates problems and undermines peace and stability”. Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in written answers to the FT that Schmidt’s appointment was “illegitimate” because it required approval from all Dayton signatories.Russia also accused Inzko of “attacking [the] whole Serbian people” with his declaration on genocide denial.Bosnian Serb leader Dodik, a close Moscow ally, has also called Schmidt illegitimate. “You were not chosen as the high representative,” Reuters quoted him saying in July. “The Serb Republic . . . will not respect anything you do.” Dodik’s spokesman did not reply to FT requests for comment.Analysts told the FT that Russia wants to keep western Balkan countries out of the EU and the Nato defence alliance.Russia wants to “leave Bosnia as it is — an ungovernable country where ethnic groups block each other”, said Maxim Samorukov, a fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center. “And since it’s ungovernable, it can’t join Nato. That’s Russia’s only goal in Bosnia.”China’s influence has also increased in the western Balkans after billions of euros of investment, including in Bosnia, said Laszlo Markusz, a former diplomat in the region and a researcher at the Hungarian Foreign Policy Institute.Schmidt said Bosnia’s unity and stability was paramount but required firm backing from the international community. He said Bosnia’s governance structure had to stay as it is. “There will be no change,” he said.The German said he had experience of dealing with his own country’s past, and took optimism from its post-communist reunification.“I come from a country which sadly has a lot of experience of war criminals and war crimes,” he said in his office overlooking the Sarajevo valley, once the scene of a three-year siege where snipers preyed on civilians. “I know how to get into a new dimension of co-operation with the neighbours.”This article has been amended since publication to correct a reference to the office of High Representative as being a UN post.
311  A Russian housing boom stoked by Kremlin-backed mortgage discounts and an exodus from dilapidated Soviet-era city-centre apartments has turned Sergei Gordeev’s PIK into one of Europe’s biggest property developers.After the company built 40,000 housing units last year, its stock price is up by more than 100 per cent in 2021, propelling its market capitalisation to almost $12bn and the personal wealth of its majority owner to more than $8bn.Now, using money raised in a $500m secondary public offering in Moscow on Friday, PIK is looking to upend the housing sector with a push into prefabricated blocks it says will take just two weeks to build.Gordeev says Units, PIK’s new modular construction division, will dramatically reduce the carbon footprint from concrete, cement and central heating in conventional housebuilding.The conveyor belt at its first factory in south-west Moscow resembles that of a car plant. Gordeev believes that using a factory-based, robot-built model, housing construction costs will be cut by 30 per cent.“Young people won’t be working as labourers on construction sites in 10 years — it’s a fundamental technological shift,” Gordeev told the Financial Times. “Construction won’t be handmade and you won’t have all those people on the building site, because all buildings will be manufactured in factories and built in a matter of days.”Though PIK has yet to build its first apartment block with the technology, Mikhail Ganelin, an analyst at Aton, said Units could “revolutionise housing construction” and predicted that PIK could be valued at multiples similar to online banking pioneer Tinkoff, whose stock price has grown more than threefold over the past year.Though it slightly missed its $500m target and the stock price subsequently slid 12 per cent, Friday’s SPO still made PIK one of the most valuable Russian companies to sell shares on public markets since a resurgence in offerings late last year.It was oversubscribed several times over, with 40 per cent of the stock bought by Russian investors and 25 by US-based investors, according to Boris Kvasov, head of equity capital markets at VTB Capital, one of the investment banks co-ordinating the deal.Demand for Russian stocks has risen as institutional investors seek returns in emerging markets and retail traders flood the Moscow exchange, looking for more value for their savings while historically low interest rates reduce the attraction of bank deposits.Renaissance Insurance and IT provider Softline filed for listings last week, while agricultural producer Rusagro held an SPO on Thursday.The PIK and Rusagro deals “were closed with a discount of just under 9 per cent to their trading price prior to deal launch, both attracted a large amount of high-quality demand and the order books were oversubscribed several times, which allowed them to increase the initial offer volume”, Kvasov said.PIK said it would spend Rbs11.6bn ($159m) buying back some of its shares from VTB, which has a 23 per cent stake in the company, and spend the rest on “general corporate purposes . . . including debt repayment and business expansion”.Units is planning to ramp its capacity for the new model of houses up to nearly 2m square metres a year by the end of 2023 through the opening of several new factories, including one in the Philippines.PIK is also expanding Kvarta, an online real estate marketplace that allows customers to buy, sell and rent homes directly from the company. PIK expects Kvarta to generate Rbs24bn in revenue this year and is considering spinning it and Units off in separate IPOs.“There are so many things you can do with your time. Why spend it on brokers and agents?” Gordeev said.Some bankers have warned that the housing boom may fade after officials began to wind down a Kremlin-backed discounted mortgage scheme that pushed banks to underwrite a record Rbs4.4tn last year, an increase of 50 per cent on 2019.Russia’s central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina said this month that the country had “practically reached the limit of mortgage growth” compared with real incomes, which are down 11 per cent since 2013. House prices per square metre rose 39 per cent last year, according to the central bank — after growing only 33 per cent in the six previous years combined.The Audit Chamber, a watchdog that monitors government spending, said recently that the rapid growth in mortgages and house prices “could create a financial bubble that could seriously harm the stability of the financial sector and real incomes”.But Gordeev insists PIK’s future is in tech, where companies such as Tesla are valued at multiples traditional businesses could only dream of.“Development isn’t a tech business. It’s the art of buying land and thinking of the right thing to put there, then getting government approval and building it,” Gordeev said. “What we’re betting on has huge scalability and huge potential for inventing new technology, products, and services that can really change things.”
312  Germany’s leading political parties held competing rounds of exploratory coalition talks on Sunday, aimed at winning over potential partners to form the government that will take the reins from Chancellor Angela Merkel after 16 years in power.Both the Social Democrats (SPD), who won the largest share of votes at about 25.7 per cent, and Merkel’s Christian Democrats, who came second, are trying to woo the third- and fourth-placed parties: the Greens, with 14.8 per cent of the vote, and the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), with 11.5 per cent.The SPD was less than two percentage points ahead of the CDU, at 24.1 per cent, leading both parties to claim the right to launch coalition negotiations. Either of these parties, however, would need to form an alliance with the two smaller parties.Most Greens favour joining a coalition with the SPD, while the FDP has signalled a preference for partnering the CDU.The SPD negotiating team, led by chancellor candidate Olaf Scholz, held bilateral talks with both the FDP and the Greens and expressed an eagerness to move forward with both parties as quickly as possible.“The SPD is now ready for three-way talks,” Lars Klingbeil, SPD secretary-general, said after a two-hour meeting with the Greens.His counterpart for the FDP, Volker Wissing, however, said after his liberal party’s meeting with the SPD that it was “clear that there are some stumbling blocks. But what is also clear is that we are determined to form a reform government that will move our country forward.”A majority of Germans appear to favour a “traffic light” coalition — named after the red, yellow and green colours of the parties — led by the SPD with the Greens and FDP. On Friday, a survey showed that 51 per cent of Germans favoured the “traffic light”, while only 18 per cent supported a CDU-led coalition.Armin Laschet, CDU candidate for chancellor, who insisted on his party’s right to lead exploratory talks, took his party to its worst-ever electoral result — it dropped 8.9 percentage points compared to the 2017 election.A survey released on Sunday suggested that his party’s popularity has fallen further since the vote, dropping three points to 21 per cent. The SPD has gained two points to reach 28 per cent.Following the indecisive outcome of last week’s election, the Greens and FDP have turned Germany’s usual process of coalition explorations on its head. They began negotiating with each other first, and plan to continue those talks in the hope of reaching a consensus on which party they want to govern with. That could make them the kingmakers of the elections.Speaking after talks with the SPD on Sunday, co-leader Robert Habeck said both sides were satisfied with their initial discussions.“We found a willingness on the part of the SPD to actually start over again, to spark a dynamic that can perhaps solve problems that have been left for so long,” he said, a reference to criticisms that Merkel’s government, in which the SPD was junior coalition partner, lagged behind on many issues like climate change and digitalisation.“Now we are primarily looking for momentum,” Habeck said.The FDP also met with negotiators from the CDU and its Bavarian sister party on Sunday. The CDU-CSU will meet the Greens on Tuesday.“We are very close together on the essential content-related points,” said Markus Blume, CSU general secretary. “It was a good evening, it was a good start, which makes you want more.”Many Germany observers are worried that coalition talks could last for months, particularly given the complexity of the outcome. After Germany’s 2017 elections, negotiations dragged on for six months.But leaders from the four main parties involved all expressed optimism over the weekend that a new coalition could be formed by late December.“We aren’t interested in a stalemate,” the FDP’s Wissing said.Additional reporting by Guy Chazan in Berlin
313  Germany’s financial regulator has filed a criminal complaint against senior staff at Northern Data, accusing it of potential market manipulation.BaFin’s complaint, which was filed earlier this year, was revealed on Friday*, a day after the Frankfurt-listed IT company, which operates racks of high-powered servers and provides services to Bitcoin miners, published financial results for 2020.The unaudited numbers, which came after months of delays, were far worse than the company’s previous guidance. Northern Data reported an operating loss of €12.3m, against previous expectations of operating profit of €45m-€60m. Revenues came in at €16.4m, against guidance of €120m -€140m.BaFin told the FT that the watchdog had flagged potential market manipulation “in the context of Northern Data” to criminal authorities but declined to comment further.On Monday morning, a spokeswoman for the Frankfurt prosecution office told the FT that it received the criminal complaint, adding that the allegation focuses on a potentially misleading ad hoc release that was published by the company in November 2019.A lawyer for Northern Data told the FT on Sunday its client was looking into the matter.Northern Data’s shares dropped 43 per cent immediately after the news of the criminal complaint, first reported by Wirtschaftswoche, but recovered half their losses in late trading to close 21 per cent down on Friday.German financier Christian Angermayer, an influential investor in Northern Data, declined to comment.At its peak in February 2021, Northern Data was valued at €1.7bn on the Frankfurt stock exchange. Since then, it has lost 60 per cent of its market capitalisation.The company was accused last year of misleading investors in an anonymous article on Medium.com that said Northern Data was overstating its prowess in “high performance computing” and understating its reliance on bitcoin miners. The article argued that Northern Data’s hosting services seemed so strangely profitable that the company was either “cooking the books” or it had “found the dumbest customers in the crypto industry”.Northern Data at the time denied any wrongdoing. The Medium.com post has since been taken offline as it is “is under investigation or was found in violation of the Medium Rules”, the website says.BaFin is raising questions over Northern Data’s acquisition of its US-based peer Whinstone, that was announced in mid-November 2019, one person with knowledge of the matter said. Back then, the German company said that Whinstone was building “by far the largest Bitcoin mining facility worldwide with a capacity of one gigawatt on an area of over 100 acres in Texas.” Mathis Schultz, then-CEO of the suitor which at the time was named Northern Bitcoin, said at the time that the transaction was “catapulting ourselves faster than originally planned to the top of the world in Bitcoin mining.”In its criminal complaint, BaFin argues that the value and significance of the deal may have been overstated, according to the same person. The watchdog also accuses Northern Data of giving misleading statements about its revenue and profit situation after November 2019. In a presentation published on Thursday, Northern Data said the huge gap between guidance and reported numbers was caused by the fact it was “unable to realise the revenues with our two major customers” as those dealings “haven‘t led to the essential revenue recognition in FY 2020”.Because Northern Data remained in the process of acquiring the erstwhile clients, it said, its dealings with them were “not expected to lead to the recognition of revenue in the financial year 2021”.*This article has been amended to reflect that Northern Data’s revenue guidance for 2020 was €120m-€140m and to clarify the timing of the BaFin complaint.*On 29 November 2021, the public prosecutor’s office in Frankfurt informed Northern Data that it had declined to initiate preliminary proceedings due to “a lack of initial suspicion”, and had declared that there was no initial suspicion of market manipulation and that the initiation of investigative proceedings had therefore been rejected.
314  China sent a record number of warplanes into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone on Friday and Saturday ahead of a visit to Taipei by French lawmakers.The escalation of Beijing’s intimidation against Taipei comes as China endures growing economic pressures while stepping up domestic regulatory and political crackdowns.According to Taiwan’s defence ministry, 38 military aircraft entered Taiwan’s air defence identification zone on Friday, including 28 J-16 fighters, four SU-30 fighters, four H-6 bombers, an anti-submarine plane and an early warning aircraft.On Saturday, the Chinese Air Force sent 39 aircraft, including 26 J-16 fighters, 10 SU-30 fighters, two anti-aircraft planes and one early-warning aircraft, Taiwan’s defence ministry said. On both days, the numbers markedly exceeded the daily record of 28 planes, which was set in June.Some 16 Chinese military aircraft entered the zone on Sunday, including 12 fighters.Military experts define the incursions as grey zone tactics, operations aimed at eroding Taiwan’s security but stopping short of war. China claims Taiwan as its territory and threatens to invade it if Taipei refuses to submit to its control indefinitely.The Taiwanese government on Saturday denounced the latest incursions. “China has been wantonly engaged in military aggression, damaging regional peace,” said Su Tseng-chang, the premier.The US said it was “very concerned by the People’s Republic of China’s provocative military activity near Taiwan”, adding that it undermined regional stability.“We urge Beijing to cease its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure and coercion against Taiwan,” said Ned Price, state department spokesperson. “The US commitment to Taiwan is rock solid.”Last week, Beijing described Joseph Wu, the Taiwanese foreign minister as a “shrilling fly” in an unusual verbal attack that Taipei described as “slander and abuse”.October is traditionally a politically charged season because both China and Taiwan celebrate their national days this month. On Friday, Beijing marked the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949. On October 10, Taiwan celebrates the Republic of China, the state that was overthrown in mainland China by the PRC but continues to exist in Taiwan, where the ROC government fled in 1949.Last year, however, there was no marked increase in air incursions by China’s People’s Liberation Army.Some observers in Taiwan said the PLA’s increased harassment could be an attempt to intimidate Taiwan ahead of planned exchanges with Europe. Next week, a delegation of French lawmakers is due to visit Taipei. Later this month, Taiwan’s chief economic planner is scheduled to lead a 65-strong delegation to several central and eastern European countries.However, military experts noted that the level of PLA air activity near Taiwan had been at a heightened level for weeks. Since Taiwan conducted its regular annual military exercise in early September, PLA air incursions frequently included fighter jets, a pattern rarely seen until now.The PLA has been sending aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ on an average of 20 days per month since September 2020, when Taipei made the incursions public for the first time.Often only one or two anti-submarine warfare or early-warning aircraft a day enter the zone for extended periods. Large numbers of fighters and bombers, like this weekend, have in the past appeared when Taiwan has enjoyed international attention or engaged in foreign exchanges.The warplanes do not enter Taiwan’s sovereign airspace, which begins 12 miles off the coast of its territory. But by frequently entering the ADIZ, they force Taiwan’s military to continuously scramble fighter jets, exhausting its resources and gathering intelligence in the process.Additional reporting by Demetri Sevastopulo in Washington
315  On September 15 Pierre-Eric Pommellet’s Naval Group colleagues were rejoicing over a long-awaited letter from an Australian government official saying the company had completed an important phase of its multibillion-euro submarine contract when he received a phone call telling him the whole deal was dead.An Indo-Pacific security alliance signed between the US, UK and Australia whereby Washington would supply nuclear-powered submarines made the French vessels redundant, the chief executive of the state-owned defence company was informed.The Franco-Australian submarine deal “was not just a programme, it was a transformation for the company, we were projecting Naval Group into a new world,” Pommellet told the Financial Times. “It was a transformation for France also. And so everything that is happening today is hard. It’s hard for the team.”Some parts of the Australian government had apparently not been in the loop — hence the unfortunate letter, Pommellet said.The ruptured contract will be a painful financial hit for Naval Group, and to a much lesser extent Thales, which owns a 35 per cent stake in the state-controlled defence company and had its own agreement to supply electronic systems. Safran, France’s third-biggest defence company, which had been assigned research and development work, said it was “analysing the effects” of the termination on its business.The loss is bad news for French defence exports. Though they have increased in recent years thanks in large part to Dassault Aviation and Naval Group, irrespective of the Australian deal, orders have declined to an eight-year low last year, according to data from the defence ministry. It also comes two months after the Swiss government chose Lockheed Martin’s F-35 against competition from Dassault’s Rafale and Eurofighter.Sash Tusa, an aerospace and defence analyst at Agency Partners in London, said people fall into two camps when it comes to what caused the contract’s failure: those who believe it is the product of “an Anglo-US stitch up”, and those who say it was caused by Naval Group’s operational faults. “It’s probably somewhere in between,” Tusa said.In the Normandy port of Cherbourg, where the French submarines were to be built, the debate has hit morale and piqued workers’ pride. “We know this could have an impact on Naval Group’s reputation,” said union member José Baptista. “That’s why we’re making a big effort to say that this has nothing to do with the quality of our work and we are doing everything we can to make sure that we compensate for the loss of the Australian business with new contracts.”Beyond the €840m Naval Group received for the portions of work it already completed, the deal would have generated about €500m in annual revenues, or 10 per cent of total revenues, for the “years to come”, according to Pommellet. “It’s a huge crisis,” he said. “But . . . the world is vast and there are many people interested in what we’re doing.”President Emmanuel Macron has taken on the mission to show precisely that: on Tuesday he announced a $3bn contract for the delivery of three Belharra frigates to Greece. The ships will be built in France by Naval Group. The Greek deal represented a “vote of confidence as well as a demonstration of the quality offered by France”, he said.France also announced this week that it would sell 52 Caesar artillery guns to the Czech Republic in a deal worth €257m.Thales too needs to preserve its reputation. The day after the so-called Aukus deal, the group told investors it would have no material impact and confirmed its 2021 profit targets.The company received about €65m in annual earnings before interest and tax from its stake in Naval Group pre-pandemic. Thales said that the maximum it stood to gain in any one year from the submarine contract via its stake in Naval Group was €30m, which still represents a fraction of its €2bn annual earnings in 2019.Thales could also still sell electronic components to Lockheed Martin. Although the US defence giant had been due to make the submarines’ combat systems under the French agreement, some analysts believe it could yet become a supplier as part of the Aukus deal.However, the slow pace at which the Naval Group submarine contract progressed, and a potential loss of credibility in France’s defence operations, could limit Thales’s growth in Australia, which has become a key market to the company in recent years, some said.“Whether they like it or not, this is a black mark for Naval Group,” Tusa said. And, for Thales it represents a “loss of momentum in the Australian market, which takes the wind out of its sails”.However Thales said that this was a “misunderstanding”. “We have to keep in mind that Thales Australia, with its 3,800 employees across 12 major sites, is an Australian company, an industrial defence leader in the country” and has been a “trusted partner serving the Australian Defence Force for more than 30 years”, a spokesperson said.As the financial details of a compensation agreement are ironed out by lawyers in Paris and Canberra, French defence companies will look for closer European co-operation, mirroring a push by Macron for a more coherent EU strategy. Defence experts have long called for greater consolidation of Europe’s fragmented defence industry, in part to help boost national budgets but issues of sovereignty have proven too difficult to overcome.“Europe needs to pull closer together,” one French executive said.As he announced an €8bn investment in EU defence initiatives over the next six years, Hervé Grandjean, spokesperson for France’s defence ministry, said the ruptured agreement should “lead us to . . . strengthen our partnerships with European countries”.But some EU partners are sceptical. Christian Mölling, research director with the Berlin-based German Council on Foreign Relations, pointed out discussions about prospective industrial consolidation have been “going on for 30 years and nobody has consolidated”. The French, he added, will never be “willing to integrate what they see as the crown jewels of their defence industry”.
316  Spain has vowed that it and other European countries will press ahead with plans to introduce a minimum corporate tax of 15 per cent under a groundbreaking global pact led by the OECD, even if equivalent measures fail in the US.In an interview with the Financial Times, María Jesús Montero, budget minister, said it was unacceptable that some groups in Spain paid as little as 6 per cent corporate tax while smaller companies paid 19 per cent, adding that “you can’t have this regressive fiscal engineering”.As one of the first EU countries to introduce a “digital tax” on companies such as Google, Spain has bolstered its status as a trailblazer for tougher EU tax rules. The global compact on a minimum corporate tax is also entering a decisive period, with participating countries meeting on Friday to thrash out details ahead of G20 finance ministers and leaders gathering later this month.Referring to July’s deal by more than 130 countries, which agreed the principle of a global 15 per cent minimum tax, Montero said: “It is unstoppable . . . Independently of what happens in the [US] Congress — which hopefully will go in the right way — this debate is now settled: Europe cannot pull back from what we have all agreed in the OECD.”US President Joe Biden is battling to salvage his $3.5tn spending bill — a cornerstone of his legislative programme that contains proposals for a new minimum effective corporate tax of 15 per cent as well as headline tax increases for businesses. Biden lacks the support of two key Senators for the spending legislation.Another potential sticking point in Spain’s position is that, while any country can unilaterally implement the global minimum tax, for the EU to act as bloc requires unanimity from its 27 members. But Estonia, Hungary, Malta and, most importantly, Ireland have not yet endorsed the agreement.Still, as most of the multinationals paying low tax rates in Ireland are US companies, if the US Congress approves the legislation Ireland would automatically lose its tax advantage and is expected would then agree, so clearing a big hurdle to a final global agreement.In Spain, Montero is in the last stages of negotiating the government’s 2022 budget proposals. The radical left Podemos grouping, the junior partner in the Socialist-led coalition, is campaigning for the 15 per cent corporate tax rate to be included in the country’s budget plans.Montero, a Socialist, said the tax measure would be included in those proposals, which have to be backed by parliament by year-end — or it would follow a report by an expert committee on fiscal reform next February.But she warned that the international consensus could still be tested by “differences about the small print”, arguing that the figures could be “radically different” depending on whether the 15 per cent is levied on companies’ taxable income or their reported profits, and if some sectors are exempted.Other areas still to be finalised in the tax deal include the dispute-resolution mechanism and specific exemptions for countries that, while not tax havens, attract companies via various tax incentives, often for manufacturing plant and machinery.Montero said she was confident Spain’s minority government would win parliament’s backing for the budget, as it did for the first time last year. “It is important that the recovery is fair, and that it reaches all our citizens,” she said.The budget forecasts that Spain’s fiscal deficit, which is expected to be 8.4 per cent in 2021, will drop to 5 per cent next year and continue to fall to just above 3 per cent by 2024. But critics of the leftwing government are sceptical it will give up on the high spending habits of the pandemic era.
317  Joe Biden’s commerce secretary has warned that protecting American steel is a matter of national security, adopting predecessor Donald Trump’s position as European and US officials race to avoid an escalation in tariffs later this year.Trump imposed hefty duties on imports of steel and aluminium from Europe and other countries in 2018, controversially justifying the measure on national security grounds.The EU retaliated with its own tariffs on a range of US imports, but shelved plans to increase those tariffs in May in a gesture aimed at settling the dispute. The tariffs are set to be applied in early December.“We would like to come to a resolution,” Gina Raimondo told The Financial Times. “Having said that, we need to protect the US steel industry. For every year in the 10 years before the tariffs were imposed, we never got above 80 per cent capacity. That is a national security risk, it’s an economic risk.” Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU trade commissioner, held meetings with Raimondo and US trade representative Katherine Tai earlier this week as the two sides tried to thrash out a deal.Tai said the countries were talking “intensively” to reach an agreement.European officials have insisted that the EU does not present a national security threat to the US, although they have acknowledged that global excess capacity threatens both the European and US steel industries.Negotiators have given themselves until the beginning of December to find a settlement, which is also meant to address the oversupply of steel resulting from production in countries including China. However, Dombrovskis said this week that the EU would need to reach an agreement with the US by early November to allow it time to prepare to either waive or reimpose tariffs on American goods. EU officials say that it is impossible to suspend the tariffs for a second time.Removing the tariffs will be politically painful for the US president because they are popular within the politically powerful steel industry and in mill states, including Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania, that will be heavily contested in the next elections.While EU officials initially hoped for a removal of the tariffs with nothing to replace them, Dombrovskis has said Europe was “ready to look [at] other solutions, understanding the fact that the US also is interested in protecting its steel industry”.The US could also propose some form of export quota, though the EU has already ruled that out. Or it could opt for converting the tariffs into “safeguards” designed to deal with a sudden flood of imports, though those would be hard to square with World Trade Organization rules.The discussions over the tariffs are part of a broader effort by the US and EU to strengthen transatlantic ties following the bitterness of the Trump years.Earlier this year, the EU and US agreed to suspend a 17-year dispute over aircraft subsidies, lifting the threat of billions of dollars in punitive tariffs on their economies in a boost to transatlantic relations.The deal takes the form of a five-year accord to suspend punitive tariffs linked to the original disagreement. Coupled with that is the creation of a ministerial-level working group to discuss subsidy limits and overcome any issues that may arise between the two sides.
318  Marine Le Pen had long been preparing for her second presidential face-off with Emmanuel Macron next spring when a political newcomer disrupted her plans.As recently as September 12, with opinion polls suggesting that the veteran far-right politician and the French president were, as in 2017, the top candidates likely to reach the second and final round of the vote in April, she explained what she saw as a simple vote: “The French want this choice between him and me. It’s really a choice between globalism and nationalism.” Then came Eric Zemmour. The rightwing television polemicist, who has yet to declare officially that he is a presidential contender, has mounted an assault on public opinion that has thrown electoral calculations into confusion.As Zemmour’s support among voters for the first round rose from 7 per cent the first time he was included by Harris Interactive three weeks ago to 13 per cent now, backing for Le Pen has collapsed from 23 per cent to 16 per cent in the past month. Zemmour is also close to polling at the same level as third-placed candidate Xavier Bertrand of the centre-right Les Républicains, who is at 14 per cent. Macron has remained steady at 23 per cent.Zemmour was a novel element in what had hitherto seemed a stale campaign, said Christèle Lagier, assistant politics professor at Avignon university. “If his candidacy becomes real, it will hurt the right and the extreme right,” she said.When Le Pen launched her campaign in the Mediterranean town of Fréjus only weeks ago, she dismissed his chances as a presidential hopeful, labelling him a “third candidate” who would fade away like so many before.“I’m always happy that there are extra candidates who start saying the things we’ve said for 20 years,” Le Pen said. “There have always been marginal candidates.”Zemmour, however, is no longer marginal, say political scientists. Fuelled by publicity from a primetime television talk show, a dedicated YouTube channel and a new book, Zemmour has made incendiary attacks on Muslim immigration and what he sees as the decline of French civilisation. He was twice convicted over racial or religious comments.Le Pen’s problem with Zemmour is that while he does not shy away from aggressive views, she has moderated her tone in an attempt to “detoxify” her party to try to win over traditional centre-right and former Communist voters since she inherited the party from her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, a decade ago.On immigration, while Le Pen has proposed a referendum on identity, citizenship and the control of immigration, Zemmour has called for a ban on foreign first names such as Mohammed and said he would favour the return of 2m foreigners to their countries of origin.This week, when asked about the lessons of labour shortages and the need for foreign workers in post-Brexit Britain, Le Pen even said she was not an ideologue and would accept the need for foreign labour in French sectors that required it. “If my country, France, needs immigrants, then so be it,” she said.Even her father and the party’s founder, 93-year-old Jean-Marie Le Pen, now says he will support Zemmour rather than his own daughter if he is better placed to win. “Marine has abandoned her strongholds and Eric occupies her former terrain,” he told Le Monde in an interview. “If Eric is the best placed candidate in the nationalist camp, of course I will support him.” Jean-Marie Le Pen, who has been convicted of anti-Semitism, also joked that Zemmour was now being demonised as he says he was in the past. “The only difference between Eric and me is that he is Jewish. So it’s difficult to call him a Nazi or a fascist. That gives him greater freedom.” For Marine Le Pen, “many think her ‘detoxification’ policy is the wrong one,” said political analyst Vincent Martigny. “She needs to stick to quite a radical line not to lose her supporters, but she also needs to open up to get new voters. That’s always been her dilemma.” Le Pen’s rebranding has had a limited impact. Many voters who see themselves as centre-right — those who supported disgraced centre-right politician François Fillon in his failed bid for the presidency in 2017 — may be inclined to back Zemmour even though his views are more extreme than Le Pen’s, according to analysts.They say it is because Le Pen carries the baggage of her party’s past, rooted in anti-Semitism, while Zemmour — of Algerian Jewish origin — comes across as a well-spoken Paris intellectual.“Those who support the LR are extremely close in many ways to those of the Front National [the old name for Le Pen’s Rassemblement National],” said Martigny. “But they don’t want to get into an alliance with the FN, because ‘they are racist, and we are acceptable people’.”Jean-Yves Camus, an expert on extremism, agrees on the inclinations of Fillon’s supporters. “There are voters who are ready to shift to someone who is in favour of the market economy, an intellectual, and yet very hard on immigration and so on.” If Zemmour succeeded in eradicating Le Pen from the second round, it could paradoxically inconvenience Macron, who has been counting on another easy win in the second round to be re-elected. The president might face someone such as Bertrand from the centre-right who, polls suggest, has a better chance of beating him than Le Pen.For the moment, though, the main victim of Zemmour’s rise is Le Pen. “Everyone knows Marine Le Pen can’t win,” is one of Zemmour’s favourite phrases, and the person working hardest to ensure that comes true is none other than Zemmour himself.
319  The kingmakers of Germany’s election — the liberal Free Democrats and environmentalist Greens — once shared little when it came to politics. But now they have something in common: the people voting for them.Young Germans flocked to the FDP and Greens last Sunday, with 44 per cent of under-25s voting for them. The trend reflects the demand for change from a younger generation that feels ignored both by Angela Merkel’s centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU), who endured their worst electoral result in history, and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), who eked out a narrow win.These two big tent parties dominated Germany’s postwar era, but a younger generation now feels the SPD and CDU lack a clear philosophy for steering their country through choppy waters ahead - from the end of the Merkel era at home, to global threats such as climate change.“Those parties have no world view. They don’t have anything they really want to act on,” said Justus Gutsche, 18, a member of the Young Liberals who voted for the FDP. “The Greens have ecology. The FDP has liberalism. What do the CDU and SPD have?”Young voters have barely been factored into German political strategy in recent years, analysts say: the under-30s make up only 14.4 per cent of the electorate, compared with 57.8 per cent for over-50s.But this time, their votes could help shape the next government: the Greens and FDP will now get to decide whether to form a coalition with the SPD or CDU.Election data show a stark generational divide, with the vote share won by the SPD and CDU rising steadily with voter age. For the Greens and FDP, the trend is the opposite.“Where voters go in the next 20 years will depend on what these [two] parties do now,” said Renas Sahin, 20, a first-time voter and member of the Green Youth.Simon Schnetzer, a political analyst who studies the youth vote, said younger Germans had experienced a years-long “awakening”, starting with the refugee influx in 2015 and the ensuing populist backlash. Next came mass climate change protests. Last year, the coronavirus pandemic exposed Germany as a laggard on digitalising public services and speeding up its plodding internet.“Before these three crises . . . this was a ‘feel fine’ generation, it felt like a wealthy future was secure. It does not feel that way any more,” Schnetzer said. “Their big issue now is having a future worth living for.”Paulina Brünger, a young climate activist with the Fridays for Future protest movement, recalled her surprise at the swift government response to the pandemic — from emergency laws to massive spending programmes.“We had politicians saying: this is a crisis. It’s going to be hard. But we can get through it together,” she said. “We’ve now seen with Covid-19 what politicians can do when they think there’s a crisis — and how little they have acted on the climate.”The pandemic also triggered a shift away from the CDU, which won 25 per cent of voters under-30 in 2017, compared with 11 per cent last Sunday. Young FDP voters told the FT they followed lockdowns to help protect older generations, yet felt their needs — such as establishing effective online education platforms — were ignored.“I remember the FDP being laughed at in the 2017 elections for having digitalisation as a topic,” said Noreen Thiel, 18, who this year not only voted for the first time but also ran as an FDP candidate in Berlin. “Our government simply forgot young people.”While the appeal of Green politics to young voters fighting for the future of the planet is clear, Schnetzer was surprised that the liberals took the same share of first-time voters as the Greens, at 23 per cent each.He attributes the FDP’s success partly to the appeal of its leader Christian Lindner, especially among young men. The 42-year-old politician drives a Porsche and is known for his witty retorts. Lindner himself told the Financial Times that young voters chose his party “because the FDP is all about freedom and zest for life, the joy of technology and innovation as a future promise”.Young FDP voters believe they share common ground with the Greens: both have similar stances on human rights and legalising cannabis, and both want to lower the voting age to 16.“I hear some conservatives say [lowering the voting age] would only give an advantage to the Greens,” Thiel said. “Well, if you’re not coming up with policies to attract young people, you can’t hate them for not voting for you.”Many young FDP voters interviewed by the FT supported a “traffic light” coalition of the SPD, Greens and FDP, believing it would more likely meet their demands.But left-leaning young Greens remain wary. “If getting into a coalition with the SPD and FDP means not making radical change . . . the Greens will have to think whether what they are doing is really the way forward,” Sahin said.Schnetzer suspects the two parties may struggle to live up to the hopes of young voters. “Up to now, it was easy to say they were the agents of change,” he said. The coming days, under pressure from more powerful parties and the expectations of older voters, “will show how strong their will to change really is”.Yet continuing to neglect young voters could be risky, warned Gutsche. He is from a poor eastern mining region and in recent years has seen people who felt sidelined turning to the far-right Alternative for Germany. He fears the pull of populism.Young climate activists, for their part, warn some in their ranks could turn to radical tactics if the next government does not take more drastic action to counter climate change.“I don’t expect some kind of rebellion,” Sahin said. But he worries that without change, faith in democratic institutions could fade. “We cannot let that happen,” he said. “We would face a generation that lost its sense of hope.”
320  Sitting in a snug European home, one can sip organic tea in the evening and watch dystopian American politics play out on television.Much more sad, of course, if the lights and television were to go off and the tea kettle stay cold. That is not a distant risk, thanks in part to Europe’s energy geopolitics. By now, everyone has heard about a squeeze on European gas supplies benefiting Russian group Gazprom and the Moscow’s influence.Less discussed is how conflicts in north Africa are likely to reduce Spain’s winter gas supplies, while potentially adding to upward pressure on power prices for the rest of Europe.On October 30, Algeria plans to shut a pipeline transporting Algerian gas to Morocco, Spain and Portugal. This is part of a long simmering feud between Algeria and Morocco that arguably began with the former’s independence from France in 1962.Morocco is angry with Algeria for its support of the Polisario Front, which wants independence for Western Sahara. Morocco insists that it has sovereignty over the long-disputed territory. Relations deteriorated further this summer when Algeria accused Morocco of having a role in starting several serious forest fires on its territory.The tensions have reached the European Court of Justice, which this week handed a legal victory to the Polisario Front, ruling that a broad economic treaty between the EU and Morocco could not be automatically extended to cover Western Sahara.Spain is the European country most affected by the CJEU decision. Western Sahara is a former Spanish colony. Some Polisario members have Spanish passports. And, in recent decades, the Spanish fishing fleet has come to depend on Western Saharan waters (and Moroccan licenses) for up to a third of its catch.European ties with Morocco extend far beyond fish. There are migration flows, European investments including auto manufacturing, sometimes-rocky security arrangements, tourism, and the supply of Moroccan vegetables to European tables.France and Spain have special legal relationships with Morocco that extend beyond the scope of other EU treaties. Algeria also has many ties to Europe, but it stands a bit apart. Its colonial-era struggle for independence from France is part of its national identity. Its armed forces buy a lot of kit from Russia and China.And Algeria sells a lot of gas to Italy, Spain and Portugal. The gas to Italy goes directly through an undersea pipeline. The gas to Spain and Portugal has been flowing through two other undersea pipelines. The first, built between 1996 and 1997, passes through Morocco, which uses some of the gas for its own generators. The second, commissioned in 2011, goes directly from Algeria to Spain.This is where EU and Spanish foreign relations now get even more problematic, especially in a tight international gas market and with insufficient European energy storage ahead of winter.On September 29, the day the CJEU decision on Western Sahara was announced, Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy supremo, issued a joint statement with his Moroccan colleague reaffirming a strategic partnership. They also vowed “to take the necessary measures to ensure the legal framework” for trade relations. This might antagonise Algeria and harden its resolve in its dispute with Morocco.Tellingly, the next day the Spanish foreign minister and energy secretary landed in Algeria for meetings with their counterparts on, among other topics, the imminent 25 per cent expansion of the direct Algeria-Spain gas pipeline’s capacity. Even with the additional gas, Spain will struggle to import gas supplies this winter through its LNG terminals.Spanish consumers are already enraged by high power prices. This has prompted Madrid to make a €3bn raid on profits of Spanish energy companies, like renewables star Iberdrola.With the pipeline shut down, Morocco will have to find ways of doing entirely without Algerian gas, though its energy sector has already been planning for this contingency. It has coal power plants it can use, and could switch to other imported fossil fuel sources for its gas generators.Europeans would be mistaken to think that Algeria and Morocco frame this dispute around economic and technical factors. There are profound sentiments about sovereignty, military balance, and culture at work here. It will not be easy for the EU to navigate such an environment to secure supplies.
321  This week, we’ll be analysing Labour’s annual jamboree and whether Sir Keir Starmer has met expectations. How did he take on the left and what was the core message of his keynote speech? Chief political correspondent Jim Pickard and political correspondent Jasmine Cameron-Chileshe will explore.Later on, we’ll turn our attention to the cost-of-living crunch approaching this winter. There are widespread fears across Whitehall that the situation could get worse, with inflation rising, fuel and food prices set to soar and even fears there might not be enough turkeys for Christmas. So what is causing all this disruption and is it about to get worse? George Parker and Chris Giles discuss the issues.
322  Speaking before the Saint Laurent show on Tuesday evening, held in the open air against a twinkling Eiffel Tower, Saint Laurent designer Anthony Vaccarello said that staging a live event was important because of the emotion: “I do the job because of the tension and the energy, and that’s missing without a show.” Certainly there was a visceral thrill this week to seeing real clothes on a real Paris catwalk, which most of the audience hadn’t experienced for more than a year.Jewellery designer Paloma Picasso, a friend of Yves Saint Laurent’s, was the inspiration for this season’s collection. “Paloma was very sexual but not the kind of woman you mess with. I like that cold distance,” said Vaccarello.This collection was brimming with the overt sexuality the designer is known for, with skintight, shiny catsuits in black, scarlet and printed florals, some with halter-necks or twisted bandeau bras that would take a lot of body confidence to pull off. More appealing were sleek column and tuxedo dresses with power shoulders, plunging V-necks and chunky gold buttons, which had a fierce glamour, as did oversized jackets worn with flares. Accessories were attention-grabbing, including visor-like shades, bold gold jewellery and clutch bags that were tucked into the pockets of jeans like weapons.The lights, music and location summoned drama you just don’t get from a fashion film, but watching very thin, very young models anxiously walk the catwalk in treacherously high shoes undermined Vaccarello’s view that “for me, being sexy today is assuming what you are, being confident, having the power”.At his 10-year anniversary show for Balmain, Olivier Rousteing served up sexiness and major spectacle. He staged a “Balmain Festival” with a catwalk show for more than 4,000 people, most of them members of the public, which opened with a recorded message from Beyoncé celebrating Rousteing’s achievement in being a black designer heading a Parisian luxury house. Models wore barely-there black tops, some bandeau style, and a witty one that resembled a metal link of a chain, teamed with low-waisted trousers. Clingy dresses featured more cut-outs than coverage, though some had a slightly “Egyptian mummy” vibe, such as a white bandage dress that appeared to be unravelling. A fun finale featuring supermodels Natalia Vodianova, Naomi Campbell and even (publicity coup alert) former first lady of France Carla Bruni had Balmain superfans whooping. Many of the ideas at Balmain were seen across the shows: skimpy tops and miniskirts, flared knit trousers and knee-high boots, straps and trailing ribbons. At Courrèges, cross-front tops in blue and silver appeared along with striped minidresses. Rick Owens’ beguiling gothic futurism featured thigh-high boots with multiple straps and clingy cobweb knits, while Rokh offered super-chic cocktail dressing on ’50s wiggle dresses, made rebellious with wet-looking fabrics. Minidresses and crop tops aren’t for everyone, but Lisa Aiken, fashion and lifestyle director of Neiman Marcus, says she is “seeing people buying party heels, clothes for dressing up and tailoring. It’s about feeling put-together again.” In contrast to lockdown, where shoppers splurged on classic handbags and investment knitwear, “No one wants to invest in essentials.”At Loewe, Jonathan Anderson explored sexual tension, but combined with surrealism, so alongside attractive sequin slip dresses with flamenco frills were back-to-front trench dresses with hammered metal breastplates and a model carrying a sculpture of a foot. “The idea of doing a show now is a surrealist act,” Anderson mused. There was a surreal and dreamlike flavour at Rochas too, where 24-year-old designer Charles de Vilmorin used brushstroke illustrations on billowing dresses and flame-like frills on leather boots in a show that felt intriguing and original.Dior’s Maria Grazia Chiuri was musing on the performative nature of clothing this season. She referenced artist Anna Paparatti and her colourful 1964 artwork “The Game of Nonsense”, creating a circular platform catwalk with coloured sections. “Fashion is a big performance . . . the clothes are important in life because in some way we perform the work,” Chiuri said at a preview. “I think over the last two years we felt like we should renounce fashion, but like a game there are some aspects that are fun.”She was also looking at former Dior designer Marc Bohan’s 1961 Slim Look collection, giving it a more colourful, youthful, pop-art feel. More signs the mini is back came from boxy miniskirt suits in black, orange and yellow, and dresses with beaded gold fringing, while silk minidresses in buttercup yellow and grass green were teamed with matching macs. Go-go boots with coloured piping and Mary Jane shoes added to the retro mood.Dior has been a star performer for LVMH during the pandemic. After the show, Dior chief executive Pietro Beccari said: “It was not a good year for everybody, but Dior came out of the crisis accelerating, we came up with a certain advantage to the competition, who were maybe less courageous or had less momentum.”Possibly the most picture-postcard mise-en-scène came from Chloé designer Gabriela Hearst. Models walked alongside the River Seine, so close to the water that a speedboat was on hand in case anyone fell in.Hearst’s ultra-luxe, pared-back boho, with a fluid kaftan dress in burnt orange and striped cashmere poncho, tapped into the free-spirited Chloé woman the Richemont house is known for. Hearst has a nuanced take on sexy: “I’m interested in sensuality. I like alluring, something that I need to look twice at. Sensual is back for me.”Hearst collaborated with seven NGOs, including Ocean Sole, a social enterprise in Kenya that made the upcycled multicoloured platform flip flops in the collection. “The bigger mission here is, can you increase revenue in a company and decrease the impact on the environment?” she said. “The volume drivers are the ones you have to change really fast. We transformed [popular products] into lower-impact products.”In a season where some designers have gone for va va voom and others have emphasised values, Hearst’s decision to put environmental and social impact at the heart of a luxury brand was wonderful to see. “It’s a beautiful location, it’s sunny,” she said. “We are privileged to be in this moment.”Find out about our latest stories first — follow @financialtimesfashion on Instagram
323  Top US diplomat Antony Blinken will visit Paris next week as part of Washington’s efforts to patch up relations with France after it was excluded from a new strategic pact and lost a submarine deal with Australia.The Biden administration is trying to defuse France’s wrath after the US, UK and Australia — known as Aukus — last month announced a new deal for nuclear submarines, prompting President Emmanuel Macron to recall his country’s ambassadors to Washington and Canberra last month.Karen Donfried, the US state department’s newly appointed assistant secretary for European and Eurasian affairs, said next week’s meetings in Paris were “part of our commitment toward a process of in-depth consultation going forward”.“We recognise this will take time, and will take hard work, and it will need to be demonstrated, not only in words, but also we are all committed to working closely with our French counterparts at every level, on this important effort,” she told reporters ahead of the visit.“I don’t think there’s a silver bullet, in terms of how we are working to deepen our relationship with the French going forward,” she said, adding there was a “need for better and more open consultations among allies”.French officials insist they were outraged not only by the loss of the deal to provide submarines to Australia, but by the way France was left in the dark on discussions about the new pact. The deal damaged trust among Nato allies at a time when the US is seeking to stitch together a network of alliances to help counter China.Senior US officials including Blinken failed to respond sufficiently quickly to requests from senior French officials to talk ahead of the deal’s announcement on September 15, according to officials briefed on the diplomatic efforts.Since the diplomatic fallout, US President Joe Biden has led efforts to appease France’s fury. He spoke directly to Macron a week after the September 15 announcement, while Blinken also met his French counterpart, Jean-Yves Le Drian.France’s ambassador to the US, Philippe Etienne, this week returned to his post in Washington, and met US national security adviser Jake Sullivan at the White House on Thursday to “to begin a process of in-depth consultations on a range of strategic matters”, according to a National Security Council spokesperson.Biden and Macron are also due to meet in person at the end of October in Europe.Blinken, who will lead an extensive US delegation to Paris including representatives on climate, trade, economics and energy, will also discuss how the US “will work with friends to revitalise and raise the level of ambition of the US-EU relationship”, said Donfried.Blinken is expected to discuss US commitments to the French relationship spanning the Indo-Pacific region, counter-terrorism in the Sahel, the climate crisis, economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and other ways to work with US allies and partners “to address global challenges and opportunities”.
324  Good evening from chilly Cambridge, where autumn has kicked in and soaring gas prices have consumers considering when (and how high) to switch on their central heating.The UK and Europe’s natural gas crunch is poised to intensify after Beijing ordered Chinese state-backed companies to secure their energy supplies at any cost.Energy prices were also a factor in eurozone inflation hitting 3.4 per cent in September — the highest for 13 years — piling pressure on the European Central Bank to scale back its monetary stimulus. Germany’s inflation hit 4.1 per cent in September — its highest level for 29 years.Yet surging gas prices will soon reverse course, according to Mike Fulwood, a senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, who argues that it would require a longer and colder winter than last year to see prices sustained above current levels.Meanwhile, the price of Brent crude oil touched $80 per barrel this week for the first time in three years and the UK’s panic buying of petrol has led to fears of the country running out of fuel.For up-to-the-minute coronavirus updates, visit our live blogUS Congressional Democrats have delayed a make-or-break vote on Joe Biden’s flagship $1.3tn infrastructure package, dealing a blow to the White House as divisions within the president’s party threaten to torpedo his legislative agenda. Biden’s $3.5tn social safety net and climate change bill also remains in doubt because a group of moderate Democrats object to its size and some key details.The dollar touched a 12-month high against major currencies as traders bet that persistent inflation would drive the US Federal Reserve closer to its first pandemic-era interest rate rise.The seasonal gloom is expected to deteriorate further with British business leaders warning that the UK is facing an “autumn storm” of rising taxes, escalating costs, labour shortages and supply disruption, as the UK government’s Covid-19 support schemes end.While the UK’s economy grew faster than projected in the second quarter, with GDP rising 5.5 per cent in the second quarter after an initial estimate of 4.8 per cent, the supply chain is hamstrung by a lack of lorry drivers.In response, supermarkets and big retailers are offering salary rises and “golden hello” payments to drivers, making it increasingly tough for hauliers and food suppliers to cling on to staff.The driver shortage knocked nearly one-fifth off shares in AO World on Friday after the electronics retailer said supply chain disruptions were holding it back.Sign up here for our Trade Secrets newsletter and keep up to speed on international trade and globalisationThe Financial Times has waved a sad goodbye to Philip Stephens, whose final column reflects on how global policymakers’ challenges have evolved over the past quarter of a century. When his column first appeared in the FT, “the world belonged to liberalism”, he writes. Now, western democracies are threatened by a lack of public trust.Vietnam has abandoned its zero-Covid strategy after lockdown led to a record drop in GDP, while both Mexico and Colombia have raised interest rates in a bid to calm inflation.Capital markets have never been so hot, with companies across the globe tapping investors for more than $1tn worth of share sales and nearly $4tn of bond issuance.On the subject of bonds, distressed debt funds have flocked to bonds issued by Evergrande, betting that Beijing will rescue the Chinese property developer to avoid fears of contagion in the real estate market and the global financial system.If Evergrande’s executives are keen to drown their sorrows, their custom may be appreciated at JD Wetherspoon, which reported a record annual loss of £154.7m. Tim Martin, founder and chair of the pub chain, has blamed the loss on lockdowns and called the UK government’s Covid-19 measures “draconian”.Drugmaker Merck said it would ask US regulators to authorise the first antiviral pill to treat Covid-19 after a late-stage clinical trial showed that the drug cut the risk of hospitalisation or death in half. If the US Food and Drug Administration authorises the drug called Molnupiravir, it would be the first treatment of its kind, a twice-daily pill prescribed for five days to patients who have recently been diagnosed with Covid-19.The hole in the ozone layer this year has widened to among the largest on record, according to data from EU observation programme Copernicus.

325  The EU should expand to include the entire western Balkans by the end of the decade, according to a proposal from the holder of the bloc’s presidency that has stunned fellow member states ahead of a summit next week.The idea of bringing countries including Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina into the EU rapidly was floated on Friday by Slovenia. It comes ahead of a meeting of EU leaders that will discuss enlargement of the 27-member union.The proposal, made in a meeting of ambassadors in Brussels, dumbfounded other member states and was described by some as entirely unrealistic given the economic and political challenges in the region.Enlargement is a highly sensitive issue for the EU, which is divided over the need and speed at which countries should be allowed into the bloc. But the union is under pressure to proceed with accession talks with Balkan countries that are also courting closer ties with China and Russia.The EU added 13 member states between 2004 and 2013 in a rapid expansion. After that Jean-Claude Juncker, the former commission president, promised no more admissions until 2019 — but applicant countries are becoming increasingly impatient as Brussels continues to drag its heels.Leaders from all EU member states and the six western Balkan countries of Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia will attend Wednesday’s summit.Diplomats from member states that want Brussels to speed up talks with the western Balkans — mainly from the bloc’s east and south — are pushing for “ambitious” language on accession at the summit, but admitted that a hard deadline was politically explosive.“We need a declaration. This is very important,” said one EU diplomat. “And [one] with a date won’t be accepted.”Further complicating the EU’s stance towards the region and the challenge of integrating it into the bloc, five member states — Cyprus, Greece, Romania, Slovakia and Spain — do not recognise Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008, as a country.Ursula von der Leyen, the commission president, has toured the western Balkans ahead of the summit, reiterating her support for countries including Serbia to join the union.But politicians in the region view the topic with acute frustration while appetite for further enlargement is low in a range of bigger member states.The commission, which leads the process of evaluating progress towards EU membership, has said national governments should move forward with Albania and North Macedonia “as soon as possible”. The two countries should have started EU membership talks last year, but progress remains blocked by the lack of unanimous support from member states.Slovenia’s government declined to comment. North Macedonia, one of the countries seeking accession, said it welcomed the push Slovenia was giving to talks and said it was “time for the EU to deliver”.Additional reporting by Marton Dunai in Budapest
326  When I arrive at the Shangri-La Hotel in Paris, there is already a crowd waiting behind a velvet rope to get in, and paparazzi clustered on the sidewalk. I’m here to see a fashion show put on by Koché, an independent French brand known for its androgynous, streetwear-meets-couture vibe. The mood is festive. The sun is shining. Everyone looks beautiful or, should I say, very cool without trying.Nature is healing at Paris Fashion Week. It feels like the first real edition to be held since Covid-19 shut down the world some 18 months ago. No more compromises. No more fear, since vaccines and masks are required. About a third of the 97 shows will be live, including all the biggest names, while the rest will stick with streamed videos.In a gilded salon with chandeliers overhead, rows of upholstered gold chairs have been set up to line the catwalk. Soon, the impossibly tall models come out wearing the creations of designer Christelle Kocher — a shimmering sequinned pink minidress, a perfectly cinched green-and-gold brocaded trenchcoat, a midnight blue cape fringed with feathers.It is a massive departure from what the French designer did a year ago at a guerrilla-like outdoor show at the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont in north-east Paris. Covid-19 restrictions made Koché’s show then a bit chaotic. Professional models were interspersed with amateurs and the designs more casual, almost punk-inspired. I watched the spectacle from a park bench.Kocher says she made the clothes more elaborate this year to showcase the craftsmanship that she and her team could finally do properly now that they were no longer working over Zoom. “I wanted the setting to feel calm, soft and poetic, like the salons where couture was shown to clients in the past,” she tells me after the show. When I ask how she felt this week, now that she can show to a big audience again, she says she is “really moved. It was beautiful. People are so happy to be together.” Returning to in-person shows is no small thing for the city that incubated the modern global luxury goods industry. Event planners, florists, restaurants, high-end hotels, drivers — all benefit from the glitz. Sonia Papet, the concierge at the five-star Le Bristol hotel, is struggling to keep up with requests for restaurant reservations. “It has been great to see all our regulars again. But they all want to go to the same places at the same time!” she tells me.The return to the before times does have one disadvantage for me. In the pandemic, none of the high-flying editors, influencers, celebrities and buyers who usually come from the US and Asia could attend. So local correspondents like me got seats to the few in-person shows.Chanel, Hermès, Louis Vuitton, Kenzo, Dior, Chloé: I enjoyed them last year as a traveller who got a surprise bump-up from economy to first class — with wonder and the certainty that this was not going to happen again. This year, now that many of the real VIPs are back, I’ve scored only a handful of invitations.But it is impossible to be grumpy about it. Paris has been its spectacular old self since the return from the summer holidays. With vaccination rates now among the highest in Europe and few remaining Covid-19 restrictions in effect, Parisians have finally been able to do all the things that make living in this very dense, loud, expensive city worth it.This of course means different things to different people. For me, it has meant going out to dinners with friends — a basic pleasure that was impossible from roughly November to June because of a 6pm curfew. I’ve also gone back to fighting for a table at La Palette, a café favoured by the beautiful people in Saint Germain, before retreating to a less cool back-up plan.For others, it means reviving the tradition of weekend protests, lately against President Emmanuel Macron’s vaccine passport requirements. Those are fading now, but I can’t help but welcome them as part of a return to normal.Another thing I’ve appreciated is how creativity and daring have staged a comeback in the capital. Lionel Messi now plays for Paris Saint-Germain — the ultimate luxury status symbol for a team owned by Qatar. His first goal on Tuesday night against Manchester City was a thing of insane beauty.Another visible symbol of Parisian audacity is the Arc de Triomphe, which for the past few weeks has been wrapped in 25,000 sq metres of silvery blue plastic fabric held in place with red cords. The artwork was the long-held dream of the Bulgarian conceptual artist known as Christo, who died in 2020. His nephew had to battle bird conservationists and Covid-19 delays to get the project over the line.The effect is hypnotising. A familiar monument is made new. Even the usual mayhem of cars, bikes and buses circling around Place de l’Étoile is being paused at weekends.I had an unfamiliar feeling recently — “FOMO”. When the pandemic was at its worst, we were spared the feeling that we were missing out on fun experiences. There simply were not any to be had.Since I lived alone, I could not fall back on the family cocoon for companionship. All that was left was work. And plumbing the depths of Netflix and Amazon Prime. A fog of isolation settled in. Sometime during the second (or was it third?) lockdown, I vowed that if the pandemic ever ended, then I would never again turn down a social invitation.A friend called me last week to invite me to the reopening of the Rex Club, one of the city’s best-known dance spots, which had been closed since Covid-19 hit. Laurent Garnier, a legendary French DJ and the club’s spiritual founder, was playing on Sunday. “Come on, it’ll be fun,” said my friend.Nightclubs in France have suffered from government’s decision to keep them closed longer than any other businesses during the pandemic. They were allowed to reopen in July as long as they respected crowd-size caps and checked people’s vaccination status, but the Rex decided to wait until now.Tucked in the basement of the Grand Rex, an extravagant Art Deco movie theatre, the Rex is a tad grungy. The bar is sticky. It gets absurdly hot in there. But the Rex is beloved by fans of techno and electronic music for having incubated many “French Touch” DJs, the local iteration of house in the 1990s. In my twenties I used to go there a lot.But those nights felt like another life, and I had work the next day, so I politely said no, having completely forgotten my promise.Only to regret it the next day. My friend posted a video of the crowded dance floor. People whooped with joy and jumped up and down as the beat picked up. Even Laurent Garnier had a massive smile on his face.Another friend texted me to propose a last-minute outing to the theatre. She had tickets to one of the season’s most talked-about shows, an intense drama called Maman, which stars French singer and movie actress Vanessa Paradis in her first theatrical performance. It is playing at one of my favourite theatres in Paris, the Théâtre Edouard VII, nestled in a pedestrian-only round plaza on the right bank.“It’s a ticket for a strapontin tomorrow night,” she tells me, referring to the foldable seats stuck on the edge of the aisles. “Do you mind?”This time I did not hesitate. It would be the first time I’d set foot in a theatre since the pandemic began.Sitting in the dark in the sold-out performance as the play began, I felt a twinge of discomfort. It was not the tiny seat, or being in a crowded room with strangers. It was the pace of the play. After so much Netflix bingeing and social media scrolling, I was not used to listening to theatrical dialogue. Everything was distracting me — audience members shifting in their seats, exhaling loudly, fiddling with their phones.I took a few deep breaths to settle myself down.Jeanne, played by Paradis, and her very clueless husband sat at the dinner table as she tried to tell him about a life-changing thing that just happened to her. The conversation was awkward and angry as the husband realises that Jeanne has suddenly become a stranger.With only three characters, the play centred on Jeanne, who was in every scene. Paradis, a former child star and former partner of Johnny Depp, had shed the ingénue schtick she usually had in movies for something deeper and more disturbing.Slowly, I was drawn in. The occasional noise from a creaking seat or sneeze was just a reminder that we were having a collective experience, not a solitary one. I can still do that.A few hours later, I was one of the first on my feet to applaud the performers.Leila Abboud is the FT’s Paris correspondentFollow @ftweekend on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first
327  France will vote on April 24 whether to give President Emmanuel Macron a second five-year term or entrust the presidency to his rightwing challenger Marine Le Pen. The race is a repeat of the 2017 election, in which Macron decisively defeated Le Pen with 66 percent of the vote. The latest polling points to a far narrower outcome in this election.Emmanuel Macron, the centrist incumbent, won the first round with 28 per cent of the vote. His comfortable early lead in the polls narrowed significantly in the last weeks before the vote, prompting Macron to warn he could lose to the far right.The tightening polls led supporters to worry he had spent too much time responding to the war in Ukraine, which initially boosted his ratings, instead of campaigning. Macron sought to play a leading role in diplomatic efforts to prevent the war and still holds frequent calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky to try to broker peace. Macron’s campaign focuses on his efforts to liberalise the economy, including plans to increase the retirement age. France’s strong post-pandemic economic recovery boosted his pre-election poll ratings. Now he must convince voters that he is more than a president of the rich and can unite a fragmented France, and that he can be trusted with immigration, a key battleground in the debate.Far right veteran and leader of the Rassemblement National, Marine Le Pen, came second with 23 per cent of the first-round vote. She re-emerged strongly in the polls after fending off candidates from the extreme right and the far left and could become France’s first female president.Analysts say her campaign’s pivot away from immigration to the cost of living crisis has helped her widen her voter base. Le Pen’s strong comeback suggests her attempts to “detoxify” her party’s racist image have paid dividends with the public, despite alienating some loyal supporters, including her niece Marion Maréchal, who declared her support for extreme-right rival Eric Zemmour.Le Pen is sceptical of the EU and Nato and has longstanding ties with Putin, which she has recently tried to downplay. She is campaigning under the slogan “Give the French their country back” and wants to rewrite the constitution to give France new powers to tightly control its borders and cut off immigrants from housing subsidies and healthcare.The two remaining contenders topped a field of 12 candidates in the first round of voting on April 10:Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftwing veteran who founded La France Insoumise, or “France Unbowed”, after defecting from the Socialist party, is the leading candidate on the left of French politics. He wants to lower the retirement age to age 60, legalise cannabis and welcome migrants. With France’s fractured left unable to unite behind one candidate, his chances of reaching the second round look slim, although he has risen slightly in the polls.Eric Zemmour, an anti-immigration television polemicist recently convicted of hate speech, came from nowhere to reach second place in the polls last autumn by calling for “immigration zero” and criticising Le Pen as incapable of winning. His new party called Reconquest has offered a harder line alternative for conservative and far-right voters. But the war in Ukraine has weakened his position by reminding voters of his support for Putin and pushing his main issues – immigration and crime – down the list of priorities.Valérie Pécresse, elected leader of the Île-de-France region around Paris, won the nomination for the centre-right Les Républicains. Polls had initially suggested she could pose a serious challenge to Macron in a run-off but her support has since waned. Self-described as two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher, Pécresse has taken a hard line on immigration, wants to slash public spending and fight sexual harassment. She must win over centrist voters and conservatives who are flirting with candidates from the far right.Yannick Jadot, an MEP and leader of the Green party Europe Ecologie-Les Verts, calls himself a pragmatic environmentalist. He led the Greens to third place in the EU elections in 2019 and like Macron he refuses to be branded as from the left or right.Fabien Roussel, a journalist, became general secretary of the French Communist party in 2018. He favours re-industrialisation, a shorter working week and retirement at 60, but has also discomfited some on the environmentally-minded left — and attracted bons vivants from the Socialists — by arguing cheerfully that a higher minimum wage would allow people to enjoy “good wine, good meat and good cheese” to benefit the economy and improve eating habits.Anne Hidalgo, Socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, is best known for her efforts to rid large parts of the French capital of cars, winning her fans internationally but enemies in Paris and its suburbs. But her poll numbers are in the low single digits and have recently declined, suggesting her hopes for the presidency are remote.
328  Increasing numbers of German workers are demanding higher pay amid rising inflation, with some going on strike, causing economists to worry that widespread demands for higher wages could start a self-fulfilling inflationary spiral in Europe’s biggest economy.German inflation rose to a 29-year high of 4.1 per cent in September, while in the 19-countries that share the euro it accelerated to a 13-year high of 3.4 per cent, official data showed on Friday. Lifted by soaring energy prices, that is higher than the 3.3 per cent rate expected.Most economists believe euro area inflation will reach 4 per cent by the end of this year, twice the European Central Bank’s target, but then fade next year. That also remains the main message to date of ECB president Christine Lagarde.However, such forecasts could prove wrong if higher prices prompt widespread wage increases that send inflation higher still.In one example this week, workers at German motorhome maker Carthago went on strike over pay, demanding their share of the spoils from a surge in orders thanks to a pandemic-fuelled rise in “staycations”.“Inflation in Germany keeps going up,” said Frederic Striegler, an official at the country’s biggest union, IG Metall, explaining its demand for a 4.5 per cent pay increase and extra early retirement funds for wood and plastic workers at Carthago and other companies in the Baden-Württemberg region of southern Germany.“The motorhome industry has got so many orders and so much profits and employees just want a share of the cake,” said Striegler, adding that more strikes were planned in two weeks at makers of motorhomes and caravans, as well as furniture companies across the country.Unions are making similar pay demands for German workers in other areas, such as banking and in the public sector. This week, retailers and mail order companies in the Hesse region agreed to raise their workers’ pay by 3 per cent this year and a further 1.7 per cent in April next year.“The narrative that German wage settlements were well-behaved this year belongs to history,” said Carsten Brzeski, head of macro research at ING. “Latest announcements show that unions are going into upcoming negotiations with demands linked to current inflation numbers, not to inflation expectations.” Propelling inflation higher are rising energy costs and supply chain bottlenecks which have sent shipping costs soaring and left manufacturers short of everything from steel to semiconductors. On Wednesday, Lagarde said: “How long these bottlenecks will take to fade out is a question we are monitoring very closely and this is on our radar screen.”Another potentially inflationary factor is that unemployment continues to fall both in Germany and across Europe, and more companies are reporting labour shortages. The European Commission said the proportion of construction companies reporting that a lack of workers was limiting their activities hit a record 27 per cent in its latest survey.The German association of freight transport and logistics companies has warned of a shortage of more than 60,000 truck drivers, which it expects to increase by 15,000 a year as more drivers retire than are trained.However, the pay demands of German unions are still below the equivalent ones they were making before the pandemic hit, according to Allianz economist Katharina Utermöhl. who said: “We expect wage demands to remain in check for now.”Furthermore, the country’s Kurzarbeit furlough scheme supported the wages of just under 1m people in July, but it is due to be scaled back at the end of the year. Utermöhl said this meant “the labour market’s current record recovery pace is likely to hit a speed bump in the coming months”.As central bankers debate how “transitory” the latest surge in inflation will be, they are watching the progress of wage negotiations in Germany and elsewhere with particular interest. Lagarde has said the ECB would “look very attentively” at this, adding: “At the moment we are certainly not seeing any widespread contamination of those price increases into wages.”
329  Two years ago furlough was barely part of the British lexicon. The pandemic reintroduced the term from the US, where public sector workers are “furloughed” during the country’s periodic government shutdowns. Suddenly, as businesses were forcibly closed to stop the spread of coronavirus, the extraordinary policy of furlough became an everyday term. Put together at short notice, the UK scheme, which came to an end on Thursday, originally paid 80 per cent of employees’ wages.It is unlikely to leave the British vocabulary, or policymakers’ toolboxes, soon. For all the focus on stimulus and easy monetary policy, job preservation schemes of this kind were the biggest innovation in macroeconomic policy of the pandemic. Given their success in preserving employment through a deep recession, there will surely be demands for a repeat when the next economic crisis hits. The policy, however, came at great public expense and should be reserved for true emergencies.Short-time work schemes were already common in much of Europe pre-Covid, with the state encouraging employers and workers to respond to temporary lower demand by making up some of the difference between the pay for normal hours and reduced ones. Existing programmes were swiftly beefed up or made easier to access. They were often extended to temporary and agency workers.Job retention programmes have been deployed at an unprecedented scale. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, about 19 per cent of German workers were on Kurzarbeit schemes in the first part of the pandemic compared with 4 per cent during the financial crisis. In France, a third of workers were put on activité partielle against 1 per cent in 2009. The think-tank for rich countries estimated that about 50m workers in total had their wages supported by such policies in 2020.The goal is to preserve the relationship between employers and employees that represent much of the productive capacity of an economy while it is put into deep freeze. The risk is that the schemes preserve, at a very high cost, jobs that are simply not coming back, preventing workers from being reallocated to growing sectors. Indeed, as recently as July more than half of UK aviation workers were still on furlough; they have now left the scheme while many flights are still grounded.A longer-than-expected pandemic and frequent returns to shutdown, too, meant many workers were not willing to return to workplaces, fretting that the jobs could soon vanish again or re-evaluating, after an enforced leave of absence, how keen they were to return. While unemployment has not risen by as much as expected, labour force participation has fallen in much of Europe and the US and, despite widespread joblessness, businesses face labour shortages; some hospitality workers simply decided they had had enough of long hours and poor pay when restaurants reopened their doors.Providing blanket support to workers, with few strings attached, was right during enforced shutdowns. There was little prospect of millions of workers switching to the few growing sectors while governments were encouraging them to stay at home. When emergencies come to an end, however, so too should emergency policies. Lessons need to be learned from the experience and that will take time. That should include their potential use for any future pandemics as well as the possibility to limit the severity of more normal recessions. The pandemic has shown that the greatest tool policymakers have is preparation.Letter in response to this article:It’s not just policymakers who earn brownie points / From Richard Sykes, Skipton, North Yorkshire, UK
330  A notable exception is Magnum, the independent photo agency founded in 1947 by photographers Robert Capa, Henri Cartier-Bresson, George Rodger and David Seymour. What started as a way for a self-selected group of elite photojournalists to support each other through the wilds of the postwar media market has evolved into a global business writing a new chapter with a more outward-looking agenda. This includes a new consumer-facing Paris gallery that hopes to stake a larger terrain in the lucrative market of collectible photography. Magnum’s overarching strategy is shepherded by Caitlin Hughes, who assumed the post of CEO in September 2019. Alongside her is photographer Olivia Arthur, Magnum president, who, along with all of Magnum’s voting members, holds sway over the company’s direction. Steering the gallery agenda are global exhibitions director Andréa Holzherr and Paris gallery director Samantha McCoy. Though Magnum’s roster is still majority men, it should be lost on no one that the executive ranks of the organisation long synonymous with grouchy old shooters in flak jackets are now majority women.Times have changed since the close of the second world war, when war-ravaged territories were reopening and photographers experienced newfound freedom to roam the globe, and benefited from proliferating print supports. Today, an abundance of newspapers and magazines, once the most important clients of Magnum photographers, are facing industry-wide financial collapse. Everyone and their mother’s mother has a powerful camera in their back pocket, and they publish their snaps for free on social media. Exclusives are harder and harder to come by. “I pay our lawyers more by the hour than our photographers get for a couple of days on an editorial assignment,” says Hughes, who came to Magnum from the advisory firm Halios, Ltd. (Before that, she worked at McCann Erickson and Boston Consulting Group, in new media for the BBC – thank her, among others, for iPlayer – and she is a non-executive director of Juventus Football Club.) If more people entering the field creates more competition for professional photographers, it also creates more interest in photography and greater visual literacy. Outside of journalism, “in the past decade, the photography community has really exploded, from festivals popping up everywhere to the book market,” says Olivia Arthur. Adds Samantha McCoy: “It’s an accessible market and allows us to work with new collectors. There’s so much potential.” In place of the dominance of Life and Time magazines, those who pay the big bucks include institutions such as London’s National Portrait Gallery; the Centre Pompidou, Paris; Deutsche Bank; and the Pinault Collection, as well as private über-collectors. The emphasis may have shifted, in some contexts, from gathering news on assignment to producing objects of beauty, but even non-journalistic photography remains a medium that chimes with reality. “The deeper story underneath the beautiful image; a passion for telling a story” is how Arthur defines Magnum’s point of difference today. Still, she complains of a “photo ghetto,” where the most enthusiastic consumers are still too often fellow photographers. “You go to these festivals,” such as Les Rencontres d’Arles, Photo London or Paris Photo, “and we all know each other’s work and buy each other’s books and go to each other’s talks. But at some point we got too inward and needed to look out. I’m keen on expanding our audience.” Magnum is comprised of 42 full members who enjoy worldwide representation and voting rights on new recruits, four associates and 13 nominees (voted in by existing members; it takes a total of four years minimum to become a full member). Once you’re in, you’re in for life, which means in addition to new work, it has lucrative estates such as those of Burt Glinn and Robert Capa to license and sell. The agency has long had a presence at photography fairs, and an accessible ecommerce platform – most popular is the annual “Square Print Sale,” where, for the past eight years, 6in x 6in prints of estate-stamped or signed photos go on sale for just £100 apiece. But, with a social media reach of more than six million, they could do more to attract the uninitiated. New opportunities for partnerships across different media are being explored, such as collaborations with musicians or chefs. There will be more online exhibitions and a stronger focus on curation. But evidently, a better bricks and mortar showroom is also a must. “Someplace where we can open the doors and invite people in,” Hughes says. “Make it feel welcoming and that people can have a direct connection with us.” Enter Paris. I loved the fact that it was on a really interesting street where culture and art is moving. It’s not too precious, because Magnum isn’t precious” Magnum’s previous address, on a small street just off the Montmartre Cemetery in the 18th arrondissement, was more of an office that occasionally opened its doors for exhibitions. The new space, in the 11th arrondissement (adjacent to the glitzy gallery circuit in the Marais, but scrappier), sits in a cobblestone courtyard like only Paris can provide, with a massive atelier window revealing the goings on inside. Fiona Naylor, the gallery’s interior architect as well as a Magnum board member shepherding the estate of her late partner Peter Marlow, had a hand in selecting the location. “We looked at 20-odd different buildings, and the key was great bones, as well as a good position in terms of other galleries,” she says. “I loved the fact that it was on a really interesting street on the eastern side of Paris where culture and art is moving. It’s not too precious, because Magnum isn’t precious.” Rather than a white box, Naylor kept the exposed stone and beams, allowing layers of history to show through in the gallery – the first space you arrive in off the courtyard – as well as the library, which is visible between the exhibition walls, and the upstairs office and conference spaces.McCoy’s first curatorial effort at the gallery, opening on 22 October, is a dialogue between Bruce Davidson, a longtime Magnum member, and 2020 nominee Khalik Allah – specifically Davidson’s series of photographs from the 1960s taken on one block of East 100th Street in Harlem, and Allah’s ongoing series shot on 125th and Lexington. “The idea was to juxtapose a storied name from Magnum with an up-and-coming one,” McCoy says. “It was important for me to launch the new space with a bridge between heritage and new works.” The following show will feature a re-release of Susan Meiselas’s 1972-75 series Carnival Strippers in colour for the first time, as well as images captured behind the scenes. Arthur and Hughes are both keen to emphasise that the diversifying slate of Magnum photographers today – there are more women and non-white members than ever before, a trend that Arthur says started about 10 years ago and has become more conscious since the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020 – also includes diversity of practice. 2018 Nominee Sim Chi Yin has included spoken word performances as part of her Interventions body of work. Other photographers, notably including Allah, incorporate moving images. Opening up to the public also means making Magnum photographers themselves more accessible. “We’re a living, working organisation,” says Hughes. “Our photographers and the community will be there, editing their work and discussing it. Some are not into it and some are. They’ve suffered a lot in lockdown, Zoom hasn’t been a compensation for not spending time together, and for many people, one of their main reasons for being in Magnum is the sense of connection. Photography can be such a solitary pursuit.”Magnum entering the gallery space in a more serious way could be seen as encroaching on the turf of the established international galleries that already represent many of its photographers. Except, as agents as well as exhibitors, Magnum gets its cut no matter where the work is sold. “Ultimately the art world is an ecosystem,” says McCoy, “and the important thing is to work together. One gallery can’t do everything.” Maybe not, but this is a good start. Magnum, 68 Rue Léon Frot, 75011, Paris, magnumphotos.com
331  Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.The EU’s brand-new tool allowing it to freeze money when there are rule of law violations may soon get its first outing. EU officials say initial moves may be taken before the end of October, teeing up a complex and lengthy process that will take many months before any funding is potentially held back. (Quick reminder: this is the highly-contested mechanism that Budapest and Warsaw objected to last year, holding the EU’s post-pandemic recovery plan hostage for several months).In brighter news, Kosovo and Serbia managed to patch up their latest skirmish (over license plates) that had reignited tensions in recent weeks. The EU-brokered deal comes just in time for next week’s summit in Slovenia with EU and western Balkan leaders.Brussels is gearing up to take the first steps deploying its new rule of law conditionality mechanism as soon as this month, in an escalation of its battles over EU values, according to officials familiar with the discussions, writes Sam Fleming in Brussels.Poland and Hungary are among those in the frame, but the commission is looking at several member states where it is sufficiently worried that possible rule of law violations could threaten the use of EU funds.Discussions are still under way within the commission over exactly when and how to trigger the mechanism, and no final decisions have yet been taken in the politically charged process. But some officials think initial communications could come within weeks as the commission responds to intense pressure from the European parliament for timely action.It would mark the first steps towards wielding new legislation which came into force at the beginning of this year empowering the commission to hold back payments of EU money where it finds there are infringements of fundamental principles that endanger the EU budget.The new rules were the subject of a ferocious battle late last year as Poland and Hungary threatened to veto the EU’s seven-year budget, including the €800bn Next Generation EU recovery fund, because of the regime. The budget eventually went through, but in March Hungary and Poland challenged the rules in the European Court of Justice. The court will hear their case on October 11 and 12 — and a judgment isn’t expected until next year.The European parliament has been pushing the commission to accelerate its use of the new rules, demanding information on its first cases by October.Any commission decisions using the new mechanism would ultimately have to go before the council. But unlike older (and weaker) sanctions mechanisms which require unanimity among member states, decisions to freeze funds in this case are taken by qualified majority. This means countries such as Hungary and Poland would find it more difficult to garner sufficient support to veto the move.The conditionality mechanism, which is overseen by budget commissioner Johannes Hahn, is part of a growing array of tools the commission can deploy in its feuds with member states accused of running roughshod over key values including the independence of the judiciary and the fight against corruption.Both Hungary and Poland are awaiting approval of their bids for recovery fund cash, as the commission seeks to insert tougher conditions into their plans requiring them to abide by rule of law requirements. In addition, the commission is considering how to use tighter rules requiring officials to check for compliance with key EU values before approving member state bids for cohesion funding.And the commission has asked the court to fine Poland because of its defiance of legal judgments as it attempts to push Warsaw to overhaul its judicial regime. (A separate ECJ order for Warsaw to pay €500,000 every day it refuses to comply with one of its judgments has so far been ignored by the government).Existing Article 7 disciplinary procedures against Poland and Hungary over alleged breaches of EU laws and values have remained stuck, mainly because of the unanimity rule in the council which allows the two countries to shield each other.“The commission has new tools when it comes to protecting the EU budget and the rule of law and it’s important that we use them — we have to be credible,” said Vera Jourova, commission vice-president for EU values, warning that existing rule of law actions hadn’t gone far enough. “We are determined to use the new conditionality mechanism where we see fit.”Kosovo and Serbia agreed yesterday to defuse border tensions that have kept both Pristina and Belgrade on an increasing level of high alert in the past two weeks over the issue of displaying vehicle licence plates in one another’s country, writes Marton Dunai in Budapest.“We have a deal!,” Miroslav Lajcak, the EU special envoy in charge of normalising relations between Belgrade and Pristina, exulted on Twitter.Lajcak said he hammered out the agreement with Kosovo deputy premier Besnik Bislimi and Serbia’s Petar Petkovic, the top official for the Kosovo issue in Belgrade.Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia in 2008, a move that was recognised by a majority of European Union member states but vehemently rejected by Belgrade, which considers Kosovo an historical part of the country.Today a vast majority of Kosovo is ethnic Albanian, but in four northern counties the majority of the population is still Serbian. Serbia has mandated cars from Kosovo to replace licence plates with temporary Serb ones, a move that Pristina reciprocated in September.Ethnic Serbs blocked border crossings in response, which prompted the Pristina government to send in special police. Belgrade sent tanks and warplanes in what looked like a dangerously escalating conflict last week.Under the deal reached in Brussels, special police will be removed along with road blocks on Saturday. The EU’s peacekeeping units (KFOR) will replace local police and stay for two weeks to ensure tensions don’t flare up again.From Monday on, neutral stickers will replace temporary plates on both sides as an interim measure.A tripartite working group chaired by the EU will work to find a permanent solution to the licence plate issue and is expected to present its findings within six months.Since January, EU and non-EU citizens coming to work in the UK must have a job offer, at a set skill and salary level, from an approved employer. Requirements are lower for a list of shortage occupations compiled by the government, for health workers, researchers and a quota of seasonal farm workers. Even though visa applications to bring in skilled workers under the revamped regime are nearing pre-pandemic levels, few are from the EU. Routes into the UK for low-skilled workers are largely closed.

332  Europe’s Social Democrats rarely have much to celebrate these days. No wonder, then, that Olaf Scholz’s victory in Germany’s election was such a red-letter day for the European left.Socialists across the continent have drawn comfort from a result widely seen as a huge breakthrough for progressive politics in the EU’s largest economy.Scholz himself pointed to the wider significance of his win. “Our success will inspire other social democratic parties in Europe and maybe beyond,” he told Der Spiegel on Friday. If the SPD succeeds in its double mission of modernising Germany’s economy while strengthening social cohesion, “then others, too, will try it out”, he said.Scholz’s victory came just two weeks after the Labour party triumphed in parliamentary elections in Norway. And some are already seeing a trend.“In Germany, just as in Norway, we’ve seen Social Democrat parties win by promoting respect for working people, and setting out a credible plan for the future digital and green economy,” Anneliese Dodds, chair of Britain’s opposition Labour party, told the Financial Times.The outcome of Sunday’s vote was hardly a landslide victory — the SPD won just 25.7 per cent, less than two points more than their centre-right rivals, the CDU/CSU. But the party is now preparing for talks on forming a unique three-way coalition with the liberal Free Democrats and Greens that would break the mould of German politics and could mark a sharp break with the 16-year era of outgoing chancellor Angela Merkel.Others are now studying the Scholz playbook, hoping to find tips for their own future campaigns. The German finance minister “mixed leftist solutions in his programme, like a higher minimum wage, with a centrist personal profile and approach”, said Enrico Letta, leader of Italy’s centre-left Democratic Party, who is running in Italian elections due by mid-2023. “I [too] am trying to mix progressive solutions with a very reassuring approach to the people.” SPD MPs say the coronavirus pandemic and the anxieties it unleashed helped their cause. “Corona meant that issues such as welfare and work played a big role in the campaign,” said Nils Schmid, a senior SPD lawmaker. “This election wasn’t about refugees, or law and order, or Europe — it ended up being about classic, bread-and-butter economic issues that played to the SPD’s strengths. And that had a lot to do with the pandemic.”However, experts warned against seeing Sunday’s result as a sign that Germany was shifting to the left. Die Linke, a hard-left party, saw its share of the vote slump. And only one in four voters plumped for the Social Democrats, a party that in 1998 won 41 per cent.“If the SPD, Greens and FDP team up, I wouldn’t see it as a leftwing coalition but rather as a liberal, ecological, modernising coalition,” said Robert Vehrkamp, a political scientist at the Bertelsmann Foundation.“The political centre in Germany has changed, it has become more modern, more liberal, more environmental, and it no longer felt represented by the Christian Democrats post-Merkel.”But some warned against other leftwing parties in Europe drawing conclusions from the SPD’s victory. Lykke Friis, a former centre-right minister in Denmark, said no two Social Democrat parties were alike these days — indeed some have major differences on policy.Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen, a Social Democrat, has outflanked the populist right on immigration and is far more hardline than Scholz on EU fiscal policy, for example. “The German and Danish Social Democrats are not exactly soulmates,” she said. “They’re definitely not singing from the same hymn sheet.”Nevertheless, the SPD’s win is a rare piece of good news for a political movement that has been on the ropes in Europe, hit by the decline of the industrial working class, its former mainstay, and the rise of rightwing populist parties who have eaten into its electoral base.Britain’s Labour party has been out of power for the past 11 years, suffering big losses in its former northern, working class strongholds in the 2019 election. The French Socialists have ceased to be a significant political force and Letta’s Democratic Party of Italy is lagging in the polls behind two rightwing groupings — the League and Fratelli d’Italia.The Nordic countries, however, provided an early sign of a shift to the left among some European electorates. After Norway’s Labour victory this month, for the first time since 2001 Norway, Sweden and Denmark will have Social Democrat prime ministers. In recent years, Scholz’s advisers often pointed to the left’s rebound in Scandinavia as a harbinger of what might happen in Germany.But the German SPD’s campaign will be hard for other parties to emulate. Though based on traditional leftist themes — stable pensions, more affordable housing, higher wages for carers and other low-paid workers — it was also highly personalised, focused tightly on Scholz.That was the key to winning over tens of thousands of voters who previously backed the CDU/CSU. They saw the finance minister, with his quiet demeanour, long experience in government and pragmatic politics, as Merkel’s natural successor — even though he came from the rival party.“A lot of Merkel voters switched from the CDU/CSU to the SPD — people who weren’t satisfied with the conservative candidate for chancellor [Armin Laschet] and were prepared to try something new,” said Vehrkamp.Some think this personality-focused approach could pay dividends in other countries. Enrico Letta said he would make a similar offer to voters, promising continuity with Mario Draghi’s sure-footed premiership in Italy. The former ECB chief is expected to leave office in 2023, possibly earlier if he runs for the Italian presidency.But Social Democrats in Germany insist their victory was not just down to Scholz but to the way the party framed its campaign — which was carefully constructed around the theme of respect.“Scholz addressed the individual experiences of people in society — their feelings of insecurity, frustration over high rents, fear of losing their jobs, the anger that has been festering in industrial societies for 20 years now and has fuelled the rise of populism,” said Schmid. “He created a narrative out of that [which] really spoke to people.”What also helped was the unusual degree of discipline the SPD exhibited during the campaign. “We decided on our manifesto, party leadership and chancellor candidate in transparent processes, and carried all 400,000 members with us, so that everyone could feel responsible for the result,” said Cansel Kiziltepe, an SPD MP.Any European social democratic party wishing to imitate the SPD’s success should consider the importance of internal unity, she said. “It’s what made our campaign work so well.”Additional reporting by Erika Solomon and Davide Ghiglione

334  Centre-left politician Klara Dobrev on Thursday raced ahead in Hungary’s first national primaries to select the challenger to prime minister Viktor Orban in parliamentary elections due next spring, with nearly all constituencies having reported results.Orban, 58, has been in power since 2010, reviving Hungary’s economy but building a self-styled illiberal regime that Freedom House, the political freedom and human-rights organisation, no longer considers a full democracy. The EU is considering withholding development funds to rein in Budapest.Most of Hungary’s fragmented opposition sees the primaries as the only way to defeat Orban’s ruling Fidesz, which triumphed in every election — local, national and European — for a decade before losing one municipal vote in 2019 after a similar local primary.Dobrev, a 49-year-old lawyer who is a European Parliament vice-president, is better known in Hungary as the wife of former premier Ferenc Gyurcsany — a divisive figure whose legacy she has struggled to shake off. If successful, she would become Hungary’s first female leader.Dressed in a blue suit and a yellow jacket, the colours of the EU flag, and with Gyurcsany at her side, she told supporters: “The run-off is coming . . . change has begun.”Fidesz has campaigned strongly against Gyurcsany, who is the chair of Dobrev’s Democratic Coalition (DK) party but not running in the primaries himself. Fidesz claims every candidate is a Gyurcsany puppet.“Gyurcsany rules supreme,” Mate Kocsis, Fidesz caucus leader, wrote on Facebook. “Either his wife will run or his puppet in the capital . . . Once again it will be up to us to defeat him next spring.”Speaking after the results, Gyurcsany dismissed those remarks and said that DK was the leading force of the opposition.Dobrev’s two main opponents — liberal Budapest lord mayor Gergely Karacsony and Peter Marki-Zay, a mayor in the rural south-east of the country — will start talks on Friday about one endorsing the other against Dobrev, whom they consider unable to beat Orban.Dobrev, who won 35 per cent of all primary votes, said she would not engage in “power machinations” but would instead go it alone, insisting that voters no longer cared about her husband’s legacy.A run-off in early October will decide on the final candidate, with the options still open late on Thursday. Marki-Zay said he might step down if he was convinced that Karacsony, who received 27 per cent of the vote to his own 20, was better placed to beat Orban in April.Karacsony, who is widely tipped to beat Dobrev if he and Marki-Zay reach an agreement in the coming days, appeared unwilling to step down. “Dobrev cannot lead the opposition to replace the government,” he told the online television channel Partizan. “So we need someone else to stand against him.”Parallel local constituency primary races selected district candidates and set the power rankings of the six opposition parties — a patchwork of patriotic, liberal, green and socialist groups that pledged to co-operate after the primaries.With data available from 84 constituencies, Dobrev’s DK won 29 primary contests, the former far-right Jobbik was second with 24 wins, and the Socialists and the urban-liberal Momentum with 10 each.“The campaign cast a fresh light on political forces other than Fidesz in lots of small towns,” the think-tank Political Capital wrote in an analysis, saying this could override a suffocating dominance of the ruling party in the country’s media.“That is the main challenge to Fidesz: masses who have been cut off from independent information channels had no idea a potent political alternative existed.”
0  EVERYONE WANTS to be a little bit Danish. Hygge, a sense of Nordic contentment attained via baking, candles and good company, became the philosophy du jour during lockdown. Danish dramas win garlands, while its comedies contain jokes so enjoyably dark that viewers may worry about finding themselves on a Europol watch list. Even Danish semen has become a booming export, thanks to the country’s combination of liberal rules for donors and reputation as a small nation of tall hunks.Listen to this story.But it is the Danish labour system that attracts the most plaudits. Leftists drool over a model that sees burger flippers in McDonald’s paid the equivalent of $22 per hour. Those on the right marvel that the country has no statutory minimum wage. Instead, employers and stakeholders sit down together and hammer out collective agreements that cover most workers. It is the same in neighbouring Sweden. Employees benefit from wages and benefits that are among the most generous on the continent; employers can hire or fire with ease during boom or bust. Denmark and its Scandi neighbours manage to be both a worker’s paradise and a capitalist’s dream.Telling Scandinavians how to run a labour market is akin to teaching the French how to bake baguettes. Yet this is the position in which the Nordic countries have found themselves. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, wants all workers to be covered by a minimum wage, whether through national law (as in most of the club) or through collective agreements (as in Scandinavia). Proposals that will see the topic of minimum wages dragged into EU law are being negotiated among MEPs and national governments.At first glance, Denmark and Sweden have little to worry about. A common minimum wage is not on the table. Indeed, that would be impossible for a club that includes Luxembourg, whose minimum wage is €2,202 per month ($2,550) and Bulgaria, where it is €332. According to the EU’s own treaties, only national governments can set a minimum wage. Indeed, the commission came to praise the Scandinavian system, not to bury it. It would rather everyone looked a bit more like Sweden or Denmark, with collective agreements galore.Instead, the commission wants to shape how national governments guarantee decent wages, rather than to set their level. Under its proposals, countries would still be in charge of the details. Those with statutory minimum wages would be forced to ensure these are adequate when measured against average incomes. For those without a minimum wage, a group which includes Italy, Austria, Cyprus and Finland as well as the Scandinavian duo, the commission wants at least 70% of workers to be covered by collective agreements—a hurdle that the Scandinavians already meet.Yet the Scandinavian duo are still fretting, and with some cause. All legislation comes with unintended consequences, particularly at the European level, where the European Court of Justice is a player as much as a referee. In Sweden about 60% of collective agreements do not include a minimum wage, points out German Bender, an analyst from Arena Idé, a Swedish think-tank. With EU law now encompassing minimum-wage rules, legal challenges would become possible. And peculiar things can happen. A case in the 1960s involving an unpaid electricity bill worth a few lira ended up establishing the primacy of EU law, which means EU rules trump national ones if the two clash. The so-called “no bailout” clause in the EU’s treaties did little to stop a series of bail-outs. A single judgment might upend the Nordic labour model.When proposals start rolling, they are tricky to stop. Employment legislation gets agreed by a qualified majority of governments, so vetoes do not apply. Usually, though, the EU avoids topics that are sacred to national governments. Pleas that legislating—rather than issuing suggestions—on minimum wages violates the Scandinavian principle of no government interference in wage-setting fell on deaf ears. Denmark and Sweden “yellow-carded” the proposal for a directive on minimum wages, a formal protest, but to no avail. In the EU’s ministerial council, where national governments haggle over a position, the lawyers say it is perfectly legal. The French government, which will shepherd negotiations on the topic from January, is keen to get it done sharpish.Beyond the bare minimumNew rules on minimum wages are only the beginning of a wider push on workers’ rights at the EU level. Laws to make pay transparent have been put forward by the commission. Proposals on how countries must treat “platform workers”—such as Deliveroo riders and Uber drivers—are in the works. For some it is a welcome shift in EU policy. During the austerity years governments were to be lean and mean. Angela Merkel was fond of noting that the EU was 7% of the world’s population, a quarter of its economy, but about half of all its welfare spending. Today, the tune has changed. Generous welfare states and high worker protections were once held to be the cause of the EU’s woes; now they are the solution.For the Scandinavians, this shift is cause for concern. Their system is not broken, yet the EU insists on fixing it. There is little scope for dodging the legislation. Denmark has an opt-out on the euro, as well as on European laws on justice and home affairs. Sweden is in theory obliged to join the euro eventually, but uses a loophole to cling on to its krona. Such derogations are a thing of the past, however, and of no help in the present case. Europe is no longer à la carte. Systems that work well, such as those of Denmark and Sweden, may have to change in order to help systems that work less well, such as those of Cyprus or Italy. “United in diversity” is the EU’s slogan. But unity increasingly trumps diversity as the EU delves ever further into the lives of its citizens. Everyone wants to be a bit like Denmark. But Denmark may soon start to resemble everywhere else.
1  TURKEY HAS deported Syrian refugees before. Some were sent back to their war-scorched homeland for failing to register with the authorities or for minor crimes. Some say they were tricked or forced into signing voluntary return forms. But none thought they would be thrown out for eating bananas. Until now.Listen to this story.In October the government said it would deport seven Syrians for sharing “provocative” videos on social media, which showed the young refugees staring into their phones and munching yellow fruit. This was in response to an interview with a Turkish man who had blamed Syrians for driving up rents and complained that they could afford bananas, which he could not.The banana-eaters seemed to be mocking prejudice against refugees. But officials accused them of mocking the needy. And that was not the end of it. Turkish police arrested a Syrian journalist who had made light of the uproar in a video that showed him nervously buying bananas from a grocer, then hiding them under his sweater. (He was released on November 8th.)Some 3.7m Syrians have made Turkey their home over the past decade. The Turkish welcome, once generous, has become grudging. As the lira plummets and inflation tests 20%, the refugees are becoming a target of frustration. With its poll numbers shrinking President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government appears keen to prove that it can act tough. Even over soft fruit.
2  IT WAS NOT poverty or ambition that drew Irfan Demirbilek to Germany from Turkey in 1968, but the lure of its splendid cars. Spotting a queue outside an employment office in Istanbul one day, Mr Demirbilek, an electrician who had long dreamed of having his own wheels, decided to join them in applying to work in West Germany. The countries had signed a “guest-worker” deal in 1961, and a brief spell earning Deutschmarks would suffice for an Opel or VW Beetle. A few months later Mr Demirbilek was on a three-day train to Cologne, his head full of excitement and apprehension.Listen to this story.As with so many Turkish guest workers, his brief German sojourn turned out to last a lifetime (and several cars, he chuckles). Now 84, he is sitting with his wife at a theatre in Düsseldorf, where the pair have just been garlanded with flowers in a ceremony to mark the 60th anniversary of the guest-worker treaty. The moment has offered Germany a chance to reflect on the complex history of what is now a 2.75m-strong Turkish minority, its largest by a distance.Three-quarters of a million poor and largely unskilled Turks came to West Germany during the 12 years the agreement was in force. (Family reunification, and later waves of political exiles, boosted the numbers further.) Talk to guest workers and their descendants and you hear complex family histories: of immigrants vacillating between return and staying; women struggling to make sense of a place to which they had no economic or cultural link; and “suitcase children” tossed back and forth between the two countries.Germany, too, went through agonies, as its Gastarbeiter became a permanent minority in a country with little understanding of itself as a land of immigration. Integration policy came late, and was halting. First-generation Turks often lived in dormitories in enclaves where encounters with Germans were rare. Learning German was seldom needed for the manual work most performed. Children could be placed in migrant-only classes on the assumption they would one day go “home”; the gifted were often held back from the best schools.Public distrust found expression in government policy. In 1983 Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who wanted to halve Germany’s Turkish population, offered guest workers repatriation payments. It was not until 2014 that Turkish-Germans born in the country could retain dual citizenship into adulthood. Today some 1.5m residents, including nearly two-thirds of adults, do not have a German passport. (The incoming coalition is discussing reform of Germany’s citizenship laws.) Xenophobic violence, common in the 1990s, is still a threat: four Turkish- and Kurdish-Germans were among the ten victims of a mass shooting in Hanau last year.The reality for most is more prosaic. Germany’s Turks own some 90,000 businesses, employing half a million people. They have spread beyond well-known neighbourhoods such as Marxloh in Duisburg or Mülheim in Cologne to suburbs and rural areas. Turkish-Germans are familiar faces from football to film. Eighteen won seats in the Bundestag in September’s election. But difficulties persist. Children with a Turkish background are likelier to drop out of school and earn less at work than other Germans, even when family background is accounted for. Zerrin Salikutluk, an expert on integration at Humboldt University in Berlin, describes studies suggesting that teachers’ low expectations for Turkish pupils tend to reduce their grades. Germans with Turkish-sounding names still face discrimination in housing and hiring.Such problems should dwindle over time, though others have emerged. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s autocratic president, has directly appealed to Turkish-Germans who struggle to find a place in Germany—and has exported his own country’s turbulent politics. At times of strain between the two governments, surveys find that a growing number of young Turks say they feel drawn to Turkey. Hakan Demir, a newly elected Turkish-German MP for Neukölln, a diverse district in Berlin, says local children enjoy provoking him by calling themselves Ausländer (foreigners), something he does not hear from older constituents. Well-integrated Turks bristle at having their loyalties questioned.Even Germany’s belated recognition of the achievements of its migrants often comes wrapped in well-meaning condescension. “The labels have changed,” says Meral Sahin, a wedding-shop proprietor in Cologne, reeling off half a dozen of them, from “guest worker” to “foreign resident”. But, she adds, they always said more about the Germans using them than the people to whom they were applied. Ugur Sahin and Özlem Türeci, the Turkish-German scientists behind the BioNTech covid-19 vaccine, have expressed unease at the politics of being held up as immigrant role models.Germany has learned from some of its mistakes. It quickly channelled Syrian and other migrants from the 2015-16 wave into language and integration courses. Yet, notes Nesrin Tanç, a Duisburg-based author, for all the commemorations Germany still lacks an overarching story capacious enough to include Germans, Turks and other groups. Such notions can seem eccentric, even dangerous, in a country where patriotism is regarded with queasiness for obvious historical reasons. But since people with a “migrant background”, in the German argot, are more than a quarter of the population, the need for a unifying narrative has only grown.At a recent ceremony to honour guest workers, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Germany’s president, urged his compatriots, Germans and Turks alike, to “develop a history together” in which the contribution of all German residents could be acknowledged and celebrated. Germany, now rapidly ageing, is once again crying out for foreign labour. When the next wave of recruitment from abroad takes place, previous episodes will provide valuable lessons. 
3  FARMERS IN SOUTHERN Italy are cultivating avocados and mangos. Tropical creatures such as the rabbitfish are turning up in Mediterranean nets. And Bordeaux winemakers fret that their Merlot grapes may become extinct. Fifty years ago all this would have been unthinkable. But since the early 1980s rising temperatures have forced some farmers to swap grapes for passion fruit.Listen to this story.Italy and France have long been proud of their cuisines. Both countries jealously guard the rules that say only ham made in Parma can be called “Prosciutto di Parma”, and only fizzy wine made in Champagne can be called champagne. Roquefort, that most celebrated of blue cheeses, was given special protection by the parliament of Toulouse in 1550.The fact of having been grown somewhere famous has traditionally been seen as a guarantee of quality. But climate change could upset that. Take polenta, a popular Italian dish consisting almost entirely of ground maize. High temperatures and drier weather have already reduced maize yields in southern Italy. If this pattern continues and spreads northwards, will Italian polenta-makers have to order their maize from elsewhere? And what about durum wheat, which grows abundantly in Mediterranean lands and is used to make pasta, flatbreads and couscous? Modelling suggests that durum yields will sharply fall there if the temperature keeps on rising.So should gourmands worry about the future of spaghetti? Gabriele Cola, a researcher at Milan University, is optimistic about the short term. “I don’t see crops at serious risk, because farming is more informed and technologically capable, so it can always respond to changes,” he says. Increased irrigation can counter the effects of drought. Scientists may also breed more resistant varieties of crops.But in the long run deeper change seems likely. If temperatures rise unabated, farmers in northern Europe may find they can grow southern staples; polenta may invade Germany. And southern locavores may have to adapt. If tropical fruit continue to thrive in Sicily, could ham and pineapple pizza one day be considered authentically Italian?For more coverage of climate change, register for The Climate Issue, our fortnightly newsletter, or visit our climate-change hub
4  THE BRITISH government is easily distracted. At the G7, it was sausages that knocked its concentration. Leaders gathered in Carbis Bay in June to discuss the pandemic and climate change. Instead they found Boris Johnson, their British host, embroiled in an argument with the EU about the export of chilled meats to Northern Ireland. At COP26, the environmental jamboree in Glasgow in Scotland, it was fish. Mr Johnson argued with France over the fate of a few dozen fishing licences in the Channel Islands.Listen to this story.Britain’s relationship with the EU has a habit of interfering with set-piece events. France threatened to ban British boats from its ports, as well as jam up freight heading to and from Britain with extra checks. In turn Britain threatened to sue France for breaching the terms of a trade deal between the EU and Britain, agreed on with a mixture of stress and haste at the end of 2020. Two NATO allies, nuclear powers and partners on the UN Security Council with a combined GDP larger than Japan’s, issued threats over a fishing industry worth only about 0.1% of it—though they managed to park the issue for a few days while the bigwigs were in town.Fishing illustrates the Richard Scarry rule: politicians are terrified to mess with workers whose jobs are often depicted in children’s books, since voters have a romantic view of farmers, firefighters, cops, etc. So fights between national fishing fleets can swiftly escalate, until prime ministers and presidents are slapping each other with figurative flounders. The EU keeps such squabbles in check between its members, but Britain has left the club. Dull meetings of a fisheries council have been replaced by a British minister dashing across the Channel for talks to avert a trade war.Franco-British ties have often frayed. When all went well, it led to good things such as jointly developing Concorde, the world’s first supersonic passenger jet. When things went poorly, it led to bad stuff, like the operational performance of Concorde, which lost lots of money and then fizzled out. When both countries were in the EU, it took larger disputes, such as Iraq, to strain the relationship. Now, even scallops can blow things off course.Take away bodies like the EU, which tie governments together in ceaseless dialogue, and friction is inevitable. Neighbours row, no matter how well-tempered they usually are. Across the Atlantic, local hegemon America frequently squares up against Canada, the most placid neighbour imaginable, over everything from timber to milk. Japan and South Korea are both rich democracies fearful of authoritarian neighbours and allied to America, but they do not let that get in the way of a reliably spiky relationship.Although the EU is skilled at soothing things between its members, that can make things more complex for its neighbours. Ottawa can speak to Washington directly, without having to worry much about bilateral relations between Canada and Montana. When Britain tries to deal with its EU neighbours, it now faces an overlapping matrix of legal and political authority, between the EU and national governments. At times, the British government still clings to the false hope that convincing a few big countries is enough to sway the EU. The opposite is the case: those that are most affected by an issue hold the pen on controversial files, whether they are large or small. Other governments back them, building up favours that can be repaid. The EU is complicated. Dealing with it is complicated, too.Britain is hardly alone in enduring a rocky relationship with the EU. So do most of the club’s neighbours and allies. Turkey, ostensibly an ally but more usually an annoyance, is a constant thorn. The club often clashes with America, another economic power used to having its way. Switzerland’s relationship (the most similar to Britain’s) is often barbed. For an example of somewhere that usually has a calm relationship with the EU, the best options are Norway or Liechtenstein, which is less a country than the answer to a pub-quiz question. Britain is too large to accept being pushed around but too small to force its way.Perpetual arguments beckon, says Samuel Lowe of the Centre for European Reform, a think-tank. When the row over fish passes, attention will turn to Northern Ireland, a more serious problem. The British government wants to overhaul the Northern Ireland protocol, which oversees trade involving the province. Depending on how it does it, this could trigger an all-out trade war between Britain and the EU, or, at best, months of negotiations. When that issue passes, others will flare up, whether on data protection, financial regulation or British exporters facing a carbon border-tax.The threat is not the rows themselves, but the opportunity costs of dealing with them. Britain and France will remain strong military allies. In the midst of the row, a French sub popped up in Faslane, which is home to Britain’s nuclear subs. The Lancaster House treaties, in which the two countries tied their armed forces together, still stand. Such agreements do not collapse overnight. But they can wither if there is little political desire to keep them watered. Amid the noise, the longer-term damage being done can be silent. Don’t worry about the bang; fear the whimper.We need to talkAfter Brexit, officials in Britain and the EU come together almost only in crisis or confrontation. Rather than regular meetings aimed at solving problems before they appear, diplomats talk when things have already gone wrong. Politicians will always scrap, whether inside or outside the EU. But there are now fewer forums for diplomats to heal the wounds. Even America and the Soviet Union had a red phone. European history is one of grumpy relations between neighbours. The EU did not exist, so they had to invent it. Over 60 years, an apparatus emerged to stop small technical arguments becoming big political headaches. Brexit means having to reinvent a space for arcane policy discussion between Britain and its European neighbours. Until it does, public fights over scallops or sausages will be too tempting to resist. 
5  A GERINGONÇA IS pleasing to say, but difficult to operate. The Portuguese term, sometimes translated as “contraption”, refers to a device patched together from oddly fitting parts. Although the governing arrangement that António Costa, Portugal’s prime minister, assembled in 2015 was dubbed the geringonça, it proved surprisingly durable. But on October 27th it finally fell apart, as two left-wing partners voted down his budget, triggering elections two years early—a rare occurrence in Portugal.Listen to this story.Though the budget was expansive, splashing out on free kindergarten and other goodies and increasing the minimum wage, it was not lavish enough for Mr Costa’s radical allies, the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP) and the Left Bloc (BE). Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, the president, had announced in advance that if it failed, he would call elections. If he was hoping to put pressure on the parties to seal the deal, the gamble failed.The parties are scrambling to influence the electoral timetable. Most want elections on January 16th, to avoid prolonged instability. But the calendar is complicated by the plans of the biggest opposition party, the Social Democrats (PSD), a centre-right outfit despite its name, to hold leadership elections on December 4th. That would leave the winner scant time to pick candidates for the general elections. One PSD candidate, Paulo Rangel, is lobbying Mr Rebelo de Sousa (who hails from the PSD himself) to hold the elections later, to allow the party time to regroup. The current leader, Rui Rio, wants to postpone the primary instead. The president was due to announce the date on November 4th.After an inauspicious start Mr Costa has won respect, not least in neighbouring Spain (where the centre-left Socialists also depend on a far-left party, Podemos). His Socialists came second in 2015’s election, then toppled the short-lived minority PSD government, cobbling together a majority with the BE and PCP, previously considered untouchable by the moderate Socialists.The then-president required a written agreement between the parties: the BE and PCP never joined the government but made clear commitments of support. But Mr Costa increased his party’s seat count in 2019’s elections. Mr Rebelo de Sousa decided not to insist on a formal agreement before blessing the second geringonça. The Bloc and the Communists, weakened and unbound by any deal, were sure to flounce out at some point.Some think Mr Costa might have been happy for them to do so now. Portugal’s covid-19 vaccination rate, 87%, is one of the world’s highest. He can point to decent GDP growth and falling unemployment until the pandemic (which in 2020 caused GDP to plunge further than in any year since the 1930s). He has kept the deficit, which made Portugal a ward of the European Union and the IMF after the financial crisis, low enough to win international respect.But this has come at the cost of public investment: Portugal’s is thought to be the lowest in the EU in 2020 and 2021. Salaries are low by Western European standards: the minimum wage, at €775 ($900) a month, is around €300 less than Spain’s. Many Portuguese head abroad to work.If Mr Costa nonetheless does well, he might be able to govern with smaller, more tractable allies than the ones that have just let him down. Miguel Maduro, an ally of Mr Rangel in the PSD leadership contest, wants to return to an informal arrangement where whichever of the two biggest parties ends up with the second-largest tally of seats agrees not to try immediately to topple a minority government led by the other one.But all the moderate parties are warily watching Chega, a far-right party with just one deputy now, but worryingly strong support in the polls. Mr Rangel refuses to govern with Chega. (Mr Rio has been more equivocal.) If Chega squeezes the other parties, any new government will be tricky. Portugal may be joining a new European normal: shrinking established parties, growing extremes and complex coalitions, a kind of permanent geringonça. 
6  QUEEN YULIA spends her nights lip-synching in a cheap wig and a disco-ball bra. Sometimes she does so on a plastic horse. She is one of a handful of professional drag queens in Georgia. She is also a co-owner of Success Bar, the country’s only avowedly gay pub. (Some other clubs in Georgia run occasional gay nights.) Before she made a living on stage, she was in charge of “face control” for the bar. For bouncers at most other venues, that means maintaining an air of exclusivity by letting in only stylish folk. For Queen Yulia and security guards at other LGBT events in Georgia, it means screening out bigots who might turn violent.Listen to this story.This is hard. Hatred, unlike a cool outfit, is not instantly visible. Partygoers hoping to attend a gay night at Bassiani, a nearby club, must submit their names, dates of birth, links to their Facebook profiles and even passport numbers days in advance. The party’s security team then screen for signs of prejudice before allowing anyone to hit the dance floor. Nomadic Boys, a travel blog catering to gay tourists, advises clubgoers in Tbilisi to “avoid entering in big groups” and “keep silent as the bouncer scans you”, lest innocent punters be taken for violent homophobes. Such scrutiny is needed in Georgia, where violence against gay people is alarmingly common.On July 5th anti-gay rioters ransacked the headquarters of gay-rights groups that had planned a pride march that day. The thugs injured dozens of journalists covering the attack. One cameraman who was beaten later died, though the cause of his death remains unclear. Irakli Garibashvili, Georgia’s prime minister, called the pride march a “propagandistic parade”. He said it ought to have been cancelled, since 95% of Georgians oppose its message. The march planned for Tbilisi wasn’t like pride celebrations in other European capitals where revellers throw condoms around, says Nia Gvatua, another co-owner of Success Bar. We were just trying to walk down “one fucking street”, she says.Gay Georgians are used to having their events disrupted. In 2019 bigots threw smoke bombs at a screening of a gay romance film. In 2013, as activists marked May 17th, a day on which activists worldwide decry homophobia and transphobia, rioters threw stones at pro-gay demonstrators and tried to lynch a man they thought was gay, says Amnesty International, an NGO. The next year, the head of Georgia’s Orthodox church chose to designate the same day as an annual celebration of family values.Most Georgians think gay sex is immoral. In a survey in 2018 by the International Social Survey Programme, 84% said it was always wrong. That was a higher share than in the Philippines, Russia or Turkey.Success Bar thus offers an island of tolerance. Gay people can mingle, dance and have sex in the Dark Room, a dimly lit section of the bar. That is handy. More than 40% of Georgians live in multigenerational households. Grandma’s watchful eye makes sex at home awkward for anyone, but especially for gay couples.Tight security keeps clubgoers safe, for the most part. According to Queen Yulia, gay-bashers sometimes create fake Facebook profiles, posing as gay, to get into her bar. Once inside, they figure out who is gay or trans so that they can attack them later, outside. They tend to avoid fights inside the bar, where they are outnumbered.Covid-19 restrictions and the fear of violence left Georgia’s gay nightlife shuttered for months. Success Bar reopened in October. On its first day back, two gay activists were arrested outside the bar, supposedly for breaking a covid curfew.Queen Yulia no longer feels safe in Georgia. Since the attack on July 5th, life for LGBT people has become worse, she says. She takes taxis everywhere now because she “can’t take two steps” on the street without getting yelled at or beaten. She is saving money to leave the country. Others are leaving, too. For those who remain, the party goes on, but so does the struggle for acceptance. 
7  FOR THE past six months Italians have been floating from triumph to triumph. It began in May when an Italian band, Maneskin, won the Eurovision song contest. In July their men’s football team became Europe’s champions and in August, at the Olympics, their male sprinters astonished the sporting world, claiming gold in the 100 metres and 4 x 100 metres relay. In October an Italian scientist, Giorgio Parisi, shared the Nobel prize for physics.Listen to this story.Italy has meanwhile had what is, for it, the novel experience of being governed by an internationally respected prime minister, Mario Draghi, with a huge parliamentary majority that allows him to turn his projects swiftly into law. Supported by an effective vaccination campaign, the economy is recovering strongly. On October 28th Mr Draghi, a former president of the European Central Bank, forecast economic growth this year of “probably well over 6%”, though few expect Italy’s GDP to regain its pre-pandemic level until 2022, well behind America and Britain, among others. But Standard & Poor’s, a rating agency, has revised its outlook for Italian debt from stable to positive, and Italians can look forward to a period in which their government will be in a position—under an obligation, indeed—to spend liberally for the first time since the days of the post-war, American-funded Marshall Plan.Italy stands to be the biggest beneficiary in absolute terms of the EU’s post-pandemic recovery project. From the core Recovery and Resilience Facility alone, it is due to receive €191.5bn in grants and loans. Such an influx of cash cannot help but have an impact on an economy that, even before covid-19, had barely grown this century: in real terms, Italy’s GDP in 2019 was only 4% above its level in 2000, thanks to a combination of slow growth in even the best years and big declines in the bad ones. Real GDP per person was 1% lower over the period, compared with increases of 16% in France and 24% in Germany. Oxford Economics estimates that over the next three to four years the EU’s recovery project will add on average a helpful annual 0.5 percentage points to Italian GDP growth.Enzo Moavero, a professor at LUISS university in Rome who has served as a non-party minister in three recent governments, warns that the real challenge for Mr Draghi will be to deliver sustainable growth at or preferably above the European average. This, he reckons, will require “effective reforms that lead to thoroughgoing structural change.”The EU’s recovery project is designed to address that issue. It makes the allocation of funds contingent on specific reforms and investments aimed at improving the growth prospects of member states. Italy has so far been given an initial €25bn with no strings attached. But it will have to satisfy a daunting 51 requirements by the end of the year to qualify for the next tranche. And it could struggle to meet the target. A report to the cabinet on September 23rd revealed that at that point only 13 of the 51 objectives had been reached.Italy’s reform programme is not the problem; that is ahead of schedule. In May a package was approved that simplified a wide range of bureaucratic procedures. And a shake-up of the criminal-justice system is about to be implemented. A further reform, focusing on civil justice, is in the pipeline. Officials say that legislation to promote competition is also coming soon.The problem is with investment. The outstanding foot-draggers appear to be the ministry of tourism, which at the time of the report had yet to implement any of the six investments for which it is responsible; and the department for ecological transition, which had implemented only one.Looking beyond the end of this year, two doubts arise. The first concerns the fate of legislation after it is handed out for implementation at the sub-national level. “In Italy, the intention of policies is all too often lost in translation,” says Paolo Graziano, who teaches political science at the University of Padua. There is a shortage of the necessary project-management skills among officials charged with implementing complex programmes—a shortcoming the Draghi government says it has begun to address. But another reason, says Fabrizio Tassinari of the European University Institute in Florence, is that “secondary legislation becomes hostage to vested interests, from local authorities to trade unions.”A further doubt centres on Mr Draghi himself. He is known to want the presidency, which becomes vacant in February, and if he were chosen he would have to resign as prime minister. Even if he does not become head of state, he is unlikely to remain in government after a general election that has to be held by the spring of 2023, and may well come sooner.On October 18th mayoral candidates from the Democratic Party (PD) were elected in Rome and Turin, completing a clean sweep of Italy’s biggest cities by the centre-left. But the PD and its allies are weaker in the provinces. Polls continue to suggest that Italy’s next government will be a coalition dominated by two parties that have long been critical of the European Commission: the Brothers of Italy (FdI) party, which has links to neo-fascism, and the hard-right Northern League.Those close to Mr Draghi argue that his departure need not lead to a radical break. His government has established bureaucratic mechanisms for steering and controlling the flow of the recovery money that will, with luck, outlive it. And future governments will be just as constrained by the deadlines the commission imposes and loth to forfeit the flow of cash from Brussels by failing to meet them.Perhaps. But the League, which is a part of the coalition underpinning Mr Draghi, and the FdI, which is not, are both wedded to policies and interests that are at odds with the reforming thrust of the recovery plan. The League has already succeeded in parrying it in one important area. A significant weakness of the Italian economy is that, while taxes on labour are too high, those on property are too low. Mr Draghi’s government moved to adjust the balance by changing the criteria used in the land registry in a way that would have boosted the revenue from property. But he ran into determined opposition from the League’s leader, Matteo Salvini. As a result, the changes will not now come into effect until 2026; and even then they will not be used to calculate tax liability.“I am more positive now than I was a year ago,” says Nicola Nobile of Oxford Economics. “But I still consider a permanent improvement in Italy’s economic prospects to be an upside scenario rather than a base case.” 
8  BEFORE THE euro, Schengen, “Ode to Joy”, butter mountains and the Maastricht treaty, there was the atom. “The peaceful atom”, wrote Jean Monnet, the cognac salesman turned founding father of the EU, was to be “the spearhead for the unification of Europe”. Europe was a nuclear project before it was much else. In 1957 the EU’s founding members signed the Treaty of Rome to form the European Economic Community, the club’s forebear. At the same time they put their names to a less well-known organisation: Euratom, which would oversee nuclear power on the continent. The idea of the common market was nebulous; the potential of nuclear energy was clear.Listen to this story.Where nuclear power was once a source of unity for Europe, today it is a source of discord. The common market morphed into the EU of today, while Euratom became a backwater. Of the EU’s 27 countries, only 13 produce nuclear power. Some ban it. France and Germany, the two countries that dominate EU policymaking, find themselves directly opposed. France generates over 70% of its power from nuclear reactors. Germany has pledged to close all its nuclear power plants by 2022. For France and its atomic allies, nuclear energy has a bright future. For Germany and its sceptic kin, the technology is an unhealthy past.It is against this backdrop that the EU has to answer a question. Is nuclear power green (since it emits very little carbon dioxide) or not (because nuclear accidents, though extremely rare, are dangerous)? Green industries face a life of subsidies and cheap capital as governments tighten investment rules elsewhere. Their dirty counterparts face a tougher life. How the EU is managing the decision reveals a lot about the club.Take the politics of it. With the Franco-German engine sputtering on nuclear policy, unlikely alliances have formed. France and the likes of Poland and the Czech Republic are usually sparring partners. French politicians generally see the region as an expensive appendage and a source of labour that undercuts French workers. Countries in eastern Europe see the French as protectionists who suck up to Russia. Yet when it comes to nuclear power the two are firm pals. It is tempting to carve the EU into simple blocs, whether Club Med or the Frugals. The reality of European politics is kaleidoscopic. Nuclear power is no exception.In this debate, Germany is likely to be on the losing side. It gave up on nuclear power after the Fukushima disaster in 2011, when an earthquake and tsunami caused a meltdown in Japan. Angela Merkel vowed to ban it in barely a decade. Countries from Belgium to Bulgaria followed, scrapping plans to build nuclear power stations and pledging to switch others off. However, opinions have shifted. Germany knows it does not have the votes to stop nuclear power being rated as green. Austria and Luxembourg would probably join it on the barricades, but few others will. For a supposed hegemon, Germany is not especially hegemonic.At the same time France is increasingly influential. Europe falling back in love with nuclear power is just one example of the many policy debates heading in a French direction. On everything from industrial policy, where the club is now enthusiastically dirigiste, to expansive rhetoric on foreign policy, the EU is speaking French. (Although France’s quest to get the club to make more use of the French language is failing.) Nuclear power is another debate in which Paris gets its way.Whatever the topic, the EU is a dealmaking machine, with consensus forged via a mix of bribery, blackmail and back-scratching. Gas power is undergoing the same kinds of debate as nuclear power. While gas generates carbon emissions, it is cleaner than coal, argue its supporters. Some countries are pro-nuclear and anti-gas; others are the reverse. Some oppose both, while some demand both. Ostensibly the topics are separate. In reality, they are wedded in the minds of national governments and MEPs who have final approval. Overlapping interests are played off against each other in a compromise that will, at best, leave almost everyone equally unhappy.If the politics are linked, so are the policy consequences. Take another neuralgic debate: reform of the EU’s spending rules. A likely compromise is that while stiff rules could remain for day-to-day spending, countries could be able to spend more freely in the name of the green transition. If nuclear power is labelled green in the private sector, it becomes harder to avoid a similar designation when it comes to public money. German voters may end up looking across the Rhine and seeing their French neighbours splashing cash on energy they see as dangerous.Politics permeates every EU institution. On paper the European Commission, which makes the initial decision on how to treat nuclear power, is full of civil servants who offer technocratic answers. In practice, they know the question of nuclear power is political. They also know that life will be easier if they answer it quickly, preferably before a new German government containing a virulently anti-nuclear Green party is formed. Mrs Merkel can leave office with another compromise to her name; the incoming Greens can come to power and blame the previous government for a fait accompli. Machiavelli was a civil servant, after all.Clean energy requires dirty dealsNuclear policy is a reminder that fates in the EU are bound together, whether the topic is energy, the environment or the economy. As the EU’s energy market integrates, those countries that pride themselves on only using the cleanest energy will benefit from those that rely on more debatable sources. The EU is an increasingly homogenous beast, with fewer carve-outs for those who want to do things differently. Collective decisions have collective outcomes. “To approach our atomic future separately…would have been insane,” wrote Monnet. The EU will approach its atomic future together, whether some countries like it or not. 
9  “COME WITH me,” says Aleksandar Vucic, Serbia’s president. “Now you are going to see a smile on my face!” From the terrace of Belgrade’s presidency building he points at skyscrapers shooting up and declares triumphantly: “Like a phoenix rising from the ashes!”Listen to this story.Other former Yugoslav states worry that Serbia’s army is also rising from the ashes. During a petty dispute with Kosovo about car number-plates in September, Serbia flew warplanes close to the border and deployed armoured vehicles to cow its smaller neighbour.Between 2015 and 2021 Serbia’s defence spending jumped by some 70% to $1.4bn a year. Russia and Belarus have given it ten MiG-29 jets. Russia has given it 30 tanks and armoured personnel-carriers and sold it an air-defence system. It has bought Chinese armoured drones, Russian helicopters and a French surface-to-air missile system. This month the defence minister announced that Serbia was negotiating to buy transport planes and helicopters from Airbus. Last month came news that it was talking to Israel about anti-tank missiles. Turkish drones, which were used to devastating effect in last year’s defeat of Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh by Azerbaijan, may be on the shopping list. Serbia’s own defence industry is also producing new kit, as opposed to just churning out more Yugoslav-era stuff.After the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s Serbia’s military capacity decayed. But in 2014 the government decided to rearm. Russia’s intervention in Ukraine showed that the era of conventional warfare in Europe was not over; and floods in Serbia that year were a “wake-up call”, says Daniel Sunter of the Balkan Security Network, a think-tank. They revealed that the country had barely any helicopters for search-and-rescue missions. In 2015 Croatia, also restoring its armed forces, asked America to supply it with rockets which, if fired at Serbia, could reach deep inside the country.A modern state needs a modern army, says Mr Vucic. Serbia spends more in absolute terms than before, but its defence spending as a share of GDP has hovered around 2% since 2005. Compared with Bulgaria, Hungary or Romania, that is “peanuts”, says Mr Vucic. But Serbs were not at war with Bulgaria, Hungary or Romania in the 1990s. They were at war with neighbours that now have smaller military budgets. Serbia outspends Albania, Bosnia, Montenegro, Kosovo and North Macedonia combined. It also outspends Croatia, which is buying French jets to restore its almost non-existent air capacity.If Serbia were merely modernising its armed forces no one would mind. It is the context that sets off alarms. Bosnia is in political turmoil again, and Milorad Dodik, the Bosnian Serb leader, suggested on October 14th that if his part of Bosnia seceded and violence were to follow, Russia would step in to defend it. Serbia’s government-controlled tabloids constantly proclaim that war with the Kosovo Albanians or the Croats is imminent. In October, following a clash between Kosovo Serbs and the Kosovo police, Serbia’s imaginative tabloids linked the presence of British Gurkha troops to the violence.At the same time nationalists, including Serbia’s minister of the interior, talk about the creation of a “Serbian World”, which many in Kosovo, Montenegro and Bosnia fear is code for a Greater Serbia that might swallow them up. Mr Vucic dismisses that as “propaganda”. He says that all the neighbours know that rearmament is “not against them”.Vuk Vuksanovic, a researcher at the Belgrade Centre for Security Policy, says that the real significance of the country’s rearming is political rather than military. Showy arms deals impress Mr Vucic’s supporters, who tend to hold the armed forces in high esteem.But Serbia is effectively surrounded by NATO (see map). With a big alliance shielding its small neighbours, Serbia is highly unlikely to send its soldiers into action in the forseeable future. Indeed, Serbia has excellent (if discreet) relations with NATO, and America trains Serbian troops. Having a strong army means that big powers treat you with respect, says Mr Vuksanovic. And if, “God forbid”, the regional status quo were to break down, then “if we can inflict damage on our hypothetical opponents, they will perhaps be more accommodating with us at the negotiating table.” 
10  EKATERINA ENGALYCHEVA never got her badge showing Lenin as a child. The week she was supposed to join the Oktiabriata (“little Octobrists”, a reference to the revolution of 1917), as all Soviet children did at the age of seven, the Soviet Union fell apart. But 30 years later Ms Engalycheva is a member of the Communist Party and a Moscow city councillor. She campaigns against Vladimir Putin’s crony capitalism; Lenin would no doubt have approved. But he would have been horrified by her other demands: for fair elections and impartial justice. She has been detained and fined for protesting against the jailing of Alexei Navalny, Russia’s opposition leader, and recently had to barricade herself in her office while police waited outside to arrest her.Listen to this story.She is far from the stereotype of a Communist. She is not a red-flag-waving pensioner, and does not care about Stalin. Nor does she feel any attachment to the Soviet-era Communists who “betrayed our country and our people, switched sides and settled in United Russia” (the vehicle through which Mr Putin now controls the Russian parliament). She is not bothered that the Communist Party today is led by Gennady Zyuganov, a Stalin-praising former Soviet ideologue. What matters more to her is that the party is showing signs of becoming a genuine opposition. And this is making the Kremlin, and indeed Mr Zyuganov himself, nervous.Mr Zyuganov founded his post-Soviet Communist Party in 1993, aiming to benefit from some of the resentment and nostalgia brought on by the Soviet Union’s collapse. It was in fact a nationalist and imperialist party, which that year was involved in an unsuccessful armed revolt against Boris Yeltsin’s democratic government. In 1996, when Mr Zyuganov challenged Yeltsin in presidential elections, Russian liberals and businessmen, fearful of a Communist revanche, threw all their resources behind the ailing president. “I would rather elect a dead Yeltsin than a live Zyuganov,” one TV executive said at the time.Mr Zyuganov lost, but for the next two decades his presence allowed the Kremlin to frame politics as a binary choice between democracy and Soviet-style communism. Today many Russian democrats, desperate to get Yeltsin’s successor out of the Kremlin, find themselves voting for the Communists.They are well aware of the irony. But, as Yevgenia Albats, a firebrand of Russia’s opposition media, says, “this bitch of a government has left us no choice.” With nearly all forms of politics banned and Mr Navalny behind bars, the Communist Party has become the main beneficiary of his “smart voting” strategy. He urged Russians to vote for whichever candidate was best placed to beat United Russia’s. Had the votes been counted honestly in parliamentary elections in September, the Communists would have got roughly the same number as United Russia. Even after all the rigging it won 19% of the vote, up from 13% in 2016.This success has discombobulated Mr Zyuganov. Financed and controlled by the Kremlin, he has enrolled his party in Mr Putin’s system of “managed democracy”, which presents an illusion of choice while reinforcing the Kremlin’s control. “Smart voting” has spoiled that game. Not only did it boost the Communist vote, it gave its younger deputies a sense of power.It is not only protest votes that are buoying the Communist Party. Several young politicians running on the party’s ticket are using it as a platform from which to launch their own left-wing agenda. Many of them would fit comfortably into a European-style social democratic party.Consider Mikhail Lobanov, a 37-year-old maths lecturer at Moscow State University. He ran a Western-style campaign, crowdfunding and canvassing door-to-door, in a relatively affluent part of Moscow. He ditched ideological clichés to focus on urban activism and social welfare. “I believe in the left idea as a way of restraining the excesses of capitalism through equal opportunities and access to universal health care and education,” he says. The Kremlin’s blatant rigging robbed him of victory, but not of his appeal.With leftism advancing in much of the rest of the world, it is striking how long it has taken to come into vogue in Russia, particularly given the inequality that Mr Putin’s rule has entrenched. An obvious explanation is that it takes time for people to forget the Soviet attempt to enforce equality, the millions who were murdered in its pursuit, and how catastrophically it failed. Now, however, six years of falling incomes have prompted many Russians to reconsider the politics of the left.The Communists’ current shift is largely a reaction to Mr Putin’s policies. By annexing Crimea in 2014 he stole the party’s previous nationalist agenda, leaving it to make a choice, explains Gregory Yudin, a sociologist. “They could either move further to the right and become extinct, or they could step out of their ghetto and shift to the left.”Valery Rashkin, a Communist MP and head of the party’s Moscow branch, decided to experiment. At the September election he backed a number of young candidates such as Evgeny Stupin, a 38-year-old former police investigator who had served in the Urals but quit his badly paid job (along with the obligatory membership of United Russia) and moved to Moscow to look for work. The injustice and corruption that he encountered there led Mr Stupin to the Communists.The Kremlin is now directing Soviet-style repression against young Communists, and trying to paint them as Stalinists. Meanwhile, the Communists are standing up for human rights, for example by demanding investigations into reported torture in Russia’s prisons. Mr Putin’s Russia is indeed a looking-glass world. 
11  FRENCH OFFICIALDOM is abuzz with preparations for the PFUE, which the MEAE and SGAE are organising for the PR in 2022. Lost? Spare a thought for the outsider who must daily navigate the French passion for acronyms and initialisms. All countries use them, but France has a particular penchant. The latest (PFUE) refers to the French Presidency of the European Union, which starts in January 2022 (and is in fact the presidency of the Council of the European Union). No matter. The abbreviation is already everywhere, and, as the opening sentence says, officials from the foreign ministry and a secretariat in the prime minister’s office are preparing this occasion for the president.Listen to this story.The preference of the French for abbreviations is so ingrained that they scarcely notice it. Britain may have its NHS, or America NASA. France has them for every part of life: transport (TGV, RER, SNCF), politics (PS, EELV, LREM, LFI, RN (formerly the FN) and LR), unions (CGT, CFDT), work (SMIC, CDD, CDI, CSE, RTT), the police (BRI, RAID), taxes (CSG, URSSAF, IFI). The principle seems simple: why use a word like budget when an abbreviation like PLF (projet de loi de finances) will do?What is behind this zeal? Some date it to the organisation of the modern state in the late 19th century, when bodies such as unions (CGT) or the political movements that later joined together as the SFIO, the precursor to the Socialist Party (PS), emerged, and with them the complex names that deserved shortening. Perhaps it is also the result of the state’s tendency to bureaucratic complication; an acronym can simplify rather than confuse. So the Société Nationale des Chemins de fer Français (the national railway) becomes the less indigestible SNCF.The fact that practitioners of such an elegant language infect it with such abominations has not gone unnoticed. The Académie Française, which polices such matters, recommends that when it comes to acronyms “moderation is a good thing and abuse dangerous.” Curiously, one of the few spheres in which the French leave prolix descriptions alone is food. No CDC for confit de canard, nor BDV for blanquette de veau. Organisational or bureaucratic life, it seems, is to be tolerated and shortened. Gastronomy can take its time.Correction (November 1st 2021): The PFUE refers to the presidency of the Council of the European Union, rather than the presidency of the European Council as we originally stated.
12  THE EUROPEAN UNION has a firm stance on paying for border walls: it won’t. Even after Europe’s migration crisis in 2015-16, when 1.4m people arrived, many fleeing Syria’s civil war, the European Commission sent Hungary away with a flea in its national ear when it asked for reimbursement for fencing off its border with Serbia, one of the main entry points.Listen to this story.Nothing in the Schengen Borders Code, which governs border management, a shared responsibility between the EU and its member states, stops the commission from paying for fences. But the view in Brussels is that they are costly and ineffective. They can be climbed. They divert rather than deter migrants. And they get in the way of genuine refugees with the right to asylum. The EU sends border guards and pays for higher-tech solutions instead.But the commission is now being urged to change its mind. This comes as the number of first-time asylum-seekers this spring has almost doubled compared with 2020 (when covid-19 made moving hard). Meanwhile, Belarus is mischievously trying to herd Iraqi asylum-seekers into Lithuania, Latvia and Poland, perhaps in retaliation for EU sanctions on its election-rigging government. And many Europeans expect a lot of Afghans to arrive soon. This month 12 member states wrote to the commission requesting changes in how the EU tackles border security. Among other things, they want Brussels to pay for fences. A physical barrier “serves the interest of [the] whole EU, not just member states of first arrival”, it argues. Such things, it says, should be “adequately funded from the EU budget as a matter of priority”.The group, which includes Hungary, Latvia, Austria, Poland and Greece, was led by Lithuania, which wants EU taxpayers to cover 75% of the €152m ($176m) it will spend on a three-metre-high fence on its border with Belarus. The project is scheduled for completion next September. This summer Politico reported that both Lithuania and Greece had asked for funding for their own barriers. Greece wanted help to pay for a €60m extension of its fence along its north-eastern border with Turkey. This is a pre-emptive move, in case those Afghans arrive, and a “necessity” for border protection, said a Greek spokesman.The commission has not formally responded. But last week its president, Ursula von der Leyen, seemingly rebuffed the request at a summit of EU leaders in Brussels. “There will be no funding for barbed wire and walls,” she reportedly told the leaders. But some observers think that could change if enough member states continue to push hard.The commission is already taking a tougher approach to migration. The EU’s joint border force, Frontex, is getting more money and people; and the commission has also proposed creating a union-wide deportation co-ordinator, though squabbling over which EU countries should take how many asylum-seekers has held this up. The EU’s commissioner for home affairs, Ylva Johansson of Sweden, has praised fencing as a tactic to slow migration. On a recent visit to Lithuania, she called the country’s fence a “good idea”. EU Commissioners have learned from the migrant crisis of 2015-16 that taking in lots of asylum-seekers comes with a political cost, says Roderick Parkes, of the German Council on Foreign Relations, a Berlin-based think tank. Building a wall doesn’t.European countries have built about 1,000km (600 miles) of border fencing over the past 30 years, the bulk of it since 2015. Today, more than half of all EU states have some physical barrier at an external border. As fencing becomes more normal, it will be harder for the commission to refuse to fund it, Mr Parkes says. Member states will argue that physical barriers are now part of the routine border protection that the EU shares a responsibility to fund. And even if the EU won’t pay up, some states have found ways to build fences without springing all the costs on their own taxpayers. Lithuania, for example, won’t be paying for its barrier alone. The Czech Republic has already committed to send the country €530,000 to speed up the work. 
13  A GOOD DUST-UP with one Western ally or another is something that Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, always relishes. On October 23rd he took on ten of them at the same time, announcing that he had ordered the American, French, German, Dutch, Canadian, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, and New Zealand ambassadors to be declared personae non gratae, a prelude to having them kicked out of the country. Their offence was to have signed a letter urging Turkey to release Osman Kavala, a philanthropist locked up on farcical terror and coup charges. It took another couple of days, the exhortations of Turkish officials, who warned him of the dire potential consequences to the country’s economy, and a carefully crafted statement by the American embassy, in which the mission said it did not meddle in Turkey’s domestic affairs, before Mr Erdogan backed down. The envoys were allowed to remain in Ankara.Listen to this story.After nearly provoking, then averting, the biggest diplomatic crisis Turkey has seen in decades, Mr Erdogan proclaimed victory. The envoys “took a step back from the slander against our country”, he said. “They will be more careful now.”The episode, and the gloating that followed, showed how badly Mr Erdogan needs something to celebrate. Turkey’s leader is having one of the worst slumps of his long career. An alliance of the two main opposition parties, the secular Republican People’s Party (CHP) and the nationalist Iyi (“Good”) party is polling ahead of Mr Erdogan’s governing coalition, composed of his own Justice and Development (AK) party and the Nationalist Movement Party. Were parliamentary elections to take place tomorrow (they are not due until 2023, together with the next presidential election), the ruling coalition would lose its majority. Mr Erdogan, meanwhile, trails behind each of the four most likely contenders for the presidency, in some cases by double digits in putative run-offs. The whispers are starting to grow louder: could the Erdogan era be drawing to a close?The economy, hobbled by high prices and a plummeting currency, is the main reason. The lira has lost over 20% of its dollar value since the start of the year, more than any other major currency. The latest rout came on October 21st, when the central bank slashed the main interest rate by two full percentage points. Days earlier, Mr Erdogan had sacked three members of the bank’s monetary-policy committee. The surprise cut, the second in as many months, brought the rate to nearly four points below the rate of inflation, which reached 19.6% in September. Many governments have used negative real interest rates to revive growth, usually after undershooting their inflation targets. Turkey is overshooting its own target (5%) fourfold. Investors have run out of patience.From Mr Erdogan’s vast palace in Ankara, things do not look so bad. The economy grew by a record 21.7% in annual terms in the three months to July, thanks to large base effects and booming exports. But inflation and devaluation are ravaging the wages of ordinary Turks. In dollar terms, GDP per person, which grew steadily until 2013, is back to where it was in 2009. During Mr Erdogan’s first decade in power (he first became prime minister in 2003) millions of Turks worked their way into the middle class. Over the past couple of years, according to the World Bank, 3.2m of them sank into poverty.Mr Erdogan’s opponents smell blood, calling (in vain) for early elections, in the knowledge that they would have a genuine chance to unseat him. Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the head of the CHP, recently urged officials to stop following “illegal orders” from Mr Erdogan and warned that those who continued to do so would be held accountable when the opposition took power.Since 2016, when an abortive coup rocked Turkey, the main opposition has deferred to Mr Erdogan on almost every national-security issue, from the country’s purchase of advanced weapons from Russia to its armed offensives in Syria and Libya. That changed on October 26th, when the CHP said it would oppose renewing the government’s mandate to deploy troops to Syria and Iraq. Businesspeople have also begun to speak up. Turkey’s largest business group, TUSIAD, recently called for a return to central-bank independence and the separation of powers.Knives out?There are even signs that officials and ruling-party backbenchers may be preparing for the end of the Erdogan era. Ankara is awash with allegations that a charity linked to one of the president’s sons placed hundreds of sympathisers in government jobs. Leaked documents suggest the charity was allocated a number of properties the government seized from the Gulen community, the group involved in the 2016 coup. Meanwhile, Sedat Peker, a fugitive mobster, continues to regale his 2m Twitter followers with stories implicating officials in crimes ranging from corruption to drug trafficking. Analysts believe at least some of the leaks are coming from disaffected AK types or bureaucrats eager to distance themselves from the government.But it is far too early to write off Mr Erdogan. Turkey’s leader continues to tower over the country’s politics and to command the loyalty of tens of millions of people, the media and state institutions, including the courts and the police. More troublingly, he and his entourage may be capable of desperate measures to cling on to power. Mr Erdogan’s latest showdown with the West will not be his last. Another military offensive in Syria, and another wave of repression at home, may be around the corner as well. Mr Erdogan will surely not go quietly. 
14  WHEN OWNERS of cafés and bars in Madrid wanted to honour the regional boss, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, after the hardest months of the pandemic were over, several offered dishes a lo Ayuso, con dos huevos, or with two eggs; a reference to the expression’s other meaning: “with a pair of balls”.Listen to this story.Ms Ayuso is riding a wave. In 2019 she was elected president of the Madrid region (including the city and surrounding towns, with 6.6m people), representing the centre-right People’s Party (PP). Just a year later she faced a brutal first wave of the coronavirus, and heavy criticism for its toll on Madrid. Nonetheless, over the ensuing year, she fought to keep the region’s businesses open—earning the gratitude of madrileños such as those bar owners. Today her face adorns signs in shops (“We Are All Ayuso”), and even socks depicting her as a Catholic saint.Most important, in a snap election in May (after a falling out with her coalition partner), she romped to a second victory. The Socialists, who lead the national government, limped to third place. Pablo Iglesias, the leader of Podemos, a radical-left party that governs with the Socialists nationally, took a risk and left the cabinet to fight the Madrid elections. His fifth-place result led him to quit politics.Ms Ayuso’s victory came with a slogan simple to the point of crudity: “Liberty or communism”. But freedom is a note she sounds again and again. “Madrid is liberty, or else it isn’t Madrid,” she tells The Economist, returning to the theme no matter what she is asked about. Madrid prospers when people are left alone to run businesses, do with their property as they will and live as they choose. Asked what government can do besides get out of the way, her answer is to give people more freedom of choice, for example in work schedules.This is reflected in her economic policy. Her chief economic adviser, Javier Fernández-Lasquetty, gives credit to €53bn ($62bn) worth of tax cuts since 2004 for helping bring Madrid’s once-sluggish growth rate above the national average. Madrid now has Spain’s biggest regional economy, ahead of Catalonia’s. In early September she scrapped the region’s last independent tax, making it the only region under Spain’s usual fiscal arrangements to lack any such levies. She praises economic rivalry between Spain’s regions: “When has competition ever been a bad thing?”This has led to carping. Ximo Puig, the Socialist president of Valencia, complained recently that Madrid’s position as the capital brought jobs its government had done little to earn, allowing it to engage in “fiscal dumping”. Ms Ayuso retorts that “this is the discourse of the politicians who cross their arms and do nothing.” Neutral observers note that Madrid has been the capital since the 16th century; its economic rise is far more recent.The party has seemed unsure how to handle its rising star. When she said she would run for the PP presidency in Madrid, the leadership acted startled, saying the regional party should be run by someone not also running a government. Ms Ayuso quipped: “I’m a woman and can do two things at once.” (In every other region the PP governs, the jobs are held by the same person.) The press pitted her against Pablo Casado, the PP’s national leader, in a trivial spat that lasted weeks.Mr Casado’s attacks on Pedro Sánchez, the prime minister, are wearyingly predictable. His party leads in many polls (see chart), but Mr Casado’s own ratings are poor. By contrast, Ms Ayuso is spontaneous and genuine, meaning that she makes headlines, if also gaffes. Asked whether she supported Mr Sánchez’s proposal to ban prostitution, her criticism of the government included the line “They only want to destroy jobs.” But her moment in the spotlight has led to speculation about a national future. For a time she did little to discourage it. She opened a Madrid office tasked with exploiting the global standing of Spanish to boost business, something more appropriate for the national government. Her repeated wanderings into issues beyond the remit of a regional leader—and a trip to Washington and New York to meet politicians and think-tankers at the height of the PP’s internal spat—fuelled talk about her ambitions.At the party’s recent conference in Valencia, though, she pointedly thanked Mr Casado for assisting her career, and said “My place is Madrid.” This will not end speculation. Unlike some of the party’s barons, she comes from the middle class and has risen far. Critics who say she is no intellectual nonetheless concede her cleverness. Others say she was lucky, rather than brilliant, to share madrileños’ desire not to be ordered to stay at home in the pandemic. Just 43, childless, churchless, single (so “you can tell the market is bare,” she has joked) and even bearing a tattoo on her forearm, she is hardly an obvious leader of Spain’s traditional conservative party. But she proudly declares herself a liberal, not a conservative, saying the PP has room for both. Madrid is her place for now. But Spaniards are watching to see whether her style has room to grow. 
15  ONE THING seemed clear during Germany’s topsy-turvy election campaign. Whatever the result, the negotiations required to form the first government of the post-Angela Merkel era would be complex, difficult and extremely long. A fragmented electorate was likely to force Germany into its first three-way coalition since the 1950s, binding together parties previously united only by distrust and disagreement. Mrs Merkel, mused some, would have to don one of her famous coloured blazers for one last New Year’s speech as chancellor, as the coalition talks ground into January.Listen to this story.The election result was indeed messy. Yet less than a month later matters have progressed more smoothly than anyone dared hope. The Social Democrats (SPD), who won a narrow victory over Mrs Merkel’s conservative Christian Democratic bloc, are discussing a “traffic-light” coalition (the name comes from the parties’ colours). with the Greens and Free Democrats (FDP), a pro-business outfit. The parties’ negotiators spent a week huddled in a Berlin exhibition hall thrashing out their differences. So far, they appear to have got along swimmingly.On October 15th the three parties issued a 12-page paper with the results of their deliberations so far. The FDP, the odd man out in what will otherwise be a left-leaning coalition, has won guarantees of no tax rises on personal or corporate income, and that Germany’s deficit-limiting “debt brake”, enshrined in the constitution, will not be touched. These are concessions to reality as much as to the FDP. The progressive parties could not hope to get tax increases or constitutional changes through the Bundesrat, Germany’s upper house.Seeking to prove that their putative alliance can be more than the sum of its parts, its members are promoting a narrative of “modernisation”. This finds expression in commitments to halve the approval time for infrastructure schemes, accelerate digitalisation, loosen immigration laws, increase R&D spending and reduce the voting age to 16. There are also pledges to boost house building, tackle child poverty and to lift the hourly minimum wage to €12 ($14), the signature policy of Olaf Scholz, the SPD’s candidate for chancellor.Yet the paper is vague, or silent, on the trickiest issues. Its proposed tweaks to the creaking public-pension system will not suffice to see off a coming demographic crunch. Its ambivalent statement on the European Union’s fiscal rules, over which governments will scrap early next year, “just shows that we couldn’t agree on anything consistent”, says Sven Giegold, a Green MEP involved in the negotiations.The biggest open question is how the government can hope to fund the huge investments needed for Germany’s promised energy and digital transitions. Pundits are buzzing with ideas, including the establishment of public companies or complex off-budget vehicles. But for now the parties promise merely to “ensure the necessary investments…within the framework of the constitutional debt brake”. Threading this needle may be the trickiest part of the formal coalition talks to come.Almost 300 negotiators, spread across 22 working groups, will now spend the coming weeks thrashing out the details. Their bosses must manage the delicate question of apportioning government jobs: the FDP and Greens both have their eye on the finance ministry, currently occupied by Mr Scholz. (After the surprise resignation of Jens Weidmann on October 20th, they must also agree on a new president of the Bundesbank.) All being well, the parties will conclude a formal coalition agreement—likely to be the length of a small book—in December. Assuming it is approved by the Green membership, and perhaps that of the SPD, Mr Scholz will be granted his wish of being anointed chancellor before Christmas, and Mrs Merkel hers of leaving her blazer in the wardrobe on December 31st.

16  CORONATIONS HAVE taken many forms throughout European history. Spanish kings received a golden apple. French kings were doused in sacred oils from the Holy Ampulla in Reims. Napoleon went for a variation on a theme, oiling up and then crowning himself in the presence of a pope. Polish kings endured the alarming spectacle of waking up to an archbishop in their bedchamber on the big day.Listen to this story.Coronations of a different sort happen whenever the EU’s 27 leaders gather for the European Council, the club’s top institution, which began a two-day summit on October 21st. The Europa Building—a glass cube encasing a fluorescent oval nicknamed the “space egg” which hosts the gathering—may lack the pomp of Reims cathedral. Yet once presidents or prime ministers enter the ovum, they in effect become elected monarchs. For the next few hours, each leader abides by a royalist creed: l’état, c’est moi, with 27 national governments reduced to 27 individuals.Invented in 1974 as an informal gentlemen’s dining club (it was all gentlemen, back then), the European Council was a place for leaders to discuss continental issues in private. It sat outside the EU’s treaties. Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, the French president who invented the forum, christened it with a regal flourish: “Le Sommet est mort. Vive le Conseil Européen!” (The summit is dead, long live the European Council). Skip forward five decades and it stands as the most powerful EU institution, settling every major question, whether constitutional or merely controversial.As a result, the European Council hands vast powers to the individual leaders who sit on it. For some countries this is no big deal. In France, Emmanuel Macron sits atop a system that hands the president huge powers compared with his fellow leaders. For those with weaker executives, it is awkward. Italy has a carousel of changing leaders, with some there through talent and others via dumb luck. It has rattled through eight heads of government in Angela Merkel’s 16 years as German chancellor. In an intimate setting like the European Council, where personality collides with power, this is a weakness. Why cut a deal with someone, if he or she will be replaced in a few months?Unlike an actual king, EU leaders do have to worry about voters and parliaments at home. Sometimes this is tactics. Conjuring up the spectre of frothing MPs at home is a good way of winning concessions from peers. Some parliaments, particularly Scandinavian ones, do keep their leaders on a short leash—a tactic legislators in other countries would do well to follow. All leaders are aware of each others’ domestic constraints.But the European Council exists to forge compromise. How to reach it ultimately comes down to the individuals at the table.Once a decision is taken by the individual leaders, it is difficult to unpick. If 27 have agreed to do it, then 27 have to agree to undo it. Inertia is a powerful force in EU politics. Once the club sets off in a certain direction, it is hard to stop. For that reason, the European Council is supposed to be far-sighted, like a company board. While the EU’s management does the day-to-day, heads of government should meet a few times a year to set the general direction. A few sentences are usually enough for the grandest schemes. Huge proposals, such as monetary union, begin life as a few lines in a European Council communiqué.The European Council is explicitly not a legislator, according to the EU’s treaties. Yet it increasingly finds itself in effect producing laws. Line-by-line haggling once reserved for major constitutional moments such as treaty change is now common when devising specific policies. In July 2020 leaders spent five days locked in argument over €1.8trn ($2.1trn) of spending, including the make-up of a €750bn package of new jointly guaranteed debt. Fractions of a percent of gross national income were fiddled with until the early hours. Since the European Council’s conclusions are seen as a royal proclamation, it gives little leeway for the EU’s actual legislators to fiddle again, if instructions are too specific.To its defenders, the European Council is the most democratic EU institution. Leaders are household names. But the EU suffers from an attention deficit rather than a democratic one. On paper, the EU is a parliamentary system: an executive is beholden to a directly elected chamber, while national governments act collectively as co-legislators. Summits suck attention, and with it legitimacy, from the rest of the system, where MEPs and ministers grind out EU law. Leaders would rather do it themselves than delegate. The upshot? More meetings. In the 1990s, leaders gathered three or four times a year; in the 2010s, they met twice as often. If able to muster via video, the temptation is to convene even more.King for a dayEven the format of summits has drawbacks. The European Council is nimble, but narrow. The largest states shrink to the small clutch of advisers who make the trip. Decisions are made in deliberately stressful circumstances. Summits start late and end late because physical exhaustion mixes with social pressure to get deals over the line. It embeds the misleading idea that progress in the EU is possible only in crisis, even if artificially created. A tool that works well in emergencies is relied on for the everyday, a bit like using a fire extinguisher to fill a kettle.Since individuals wield so much power, personality counts for a lot in the court of kings. France under François Hollande was rather meek. Mr Macron is happiest performing in a continental arena, pushing French ideas onto a much wider realm. Sheer force of character can lend even the smallest country clout. In such a forum a change of personnel can lead to a change of policy. The departure of Mrs Merkel, who this week was attending what may be her last such meeting, will change the dynamic at the EU’s top table. Another monarch will be along soon enough. The queen is dead. Long live the next one. 
17  UNTIL A FEW weeks ago only political junkies knew who Peter Marki-Zay was. That changed with his unexpected victory on October 17th in the run-off of the first-ever primary for the Hungarian opposition. The 49-year-old mayor of Hodmezovasarhely, a smallish and almost unpronounceable town in south-eastern Hungary, was elected by supporters of six parties as their candidate to try to replace Viktor Orban, Hungary’s prime minister, at parliamentary elections next April.Listen to this story.“We won the battle, but we need to win the war,” said Mr Marki-Zay, a conservative Catholic not affiliated with any party, at a rally in Budapest. Several politicians stood next to him, as did several relatives (he is a father of seven). Notably absent was his rival, Klara Dobrev, a vice-president of the European Parliament. Ms Dobrev merely acknowledged her defeat and pledged to support Mr Marki-Zay in his quest to remove Mr Orban from power.Ms Dobrev won the first round of the primaries last month and Mr Marki-Zay had come third after Gergely Karacsony, the mayor of Budapest. Yet (after some hesitation) Mr Karacsony withdrew in Mr Marki-Zay’s favour. Both reckoned that Ms Dobrev could not beat Mr Orban, mainly because she is married to Ferenc Gyurcsany, a wildly unpopular former prime minister who faced riots in 2006 after revelations that he had repeatedly lied about the state of the economy.Now comes the harder part. The six opposition parties that range from leftist and liberal parties such as Momentum and Democratic Coalition to Jobbik, a former far-right party that has become more moderate in recent years, need to maintain their united front. As well as electing a common candidate for prime minister they have picked one unified candidate for each of Hungary’s 106 constituencies. But even before the run-off they had started bickering. The small-town mayor accused Ms Dobrev of blackmailing politicians into voting for her. Ms Dobrev accused Mr Marki-Zay of methods reminiscent of Mr Orban and Donald Trump.The opposition still needs to do a lot to win a majority, especially in smaller cities, says Robert Laszlo of Political Capital, a research outfit in Budapest. Forging a single joint list for the 93 proportionally elected seats will be the main source of conflict, he predicts; but he also worries about a fight for dominance between the allied parties. Moreover, Fidesz, the party of Mr Orban, will do whatever it can to drive wedges between the allies.Mr Orban, who controls a two-thirds majority in parliament, will use every tool in his box to defeat his rival. He would have preferred to fight Mr Karacsony or Ms Dobrev, as the claim that the opposition is a puppet of Mr Gyurcsany will not be effective against a rural, conservative mayor. He will probably attack Mr Marki-Zay’s hectic manner, his unpredictability and his penchant for long speeches. He will no doubt label him an “American agent”, since he once worked for a car-parts firm in America, and that is all the evidence a conspiracy-monger like Mr Orban needs.The prime minister is diligently wooing voters with their own money. He promises to send $2bn on a tax refund for families early next year. Pensioners will get a special bung in November and two weeks of extra state-pension payments in January. The minimum wage will rise.Mr Orban’s friends control most media outlets. He can also count on the support of the various oligarchs who became rich on his watch. Yet despite all the prime minister’s advantages, polls put his challenger neck-and-neck with him. If the opposition alliance wins, Mr Marki-Zay has promised to mend fences with the European Union. He wants Hungary to join the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, which can investigate the theft of EU funds—a huge problem in Hungary. He also wants to prepare his country to adopt the euro.Mr Marki-Zay has already surprised observers twice, first by winning the mayor’s office in a town previously loyal to Fidesz, and then by prevailing in the primary. A third upset—beating the man who made Hungary a byword for demagoguery—will be harder still. But it is not impossible. 
18  EUROPE’S BUREAUCRATS are not usually shy about prescribing how exactly to prepare and present food. Yet there is one ultra-sensitive matter they prefer not to touch: whether Jews and Muslims should be allowed to slaughter animals as their faith usually requires, with just a swipe of a super-sharp knife that causes blood to cascade from the veins. American bodies that promote religious freedom have called the legal mess disgraceful; animal-rights activists and secular-minded organisations agree, for exactly opposite reasons.Listen to this story.A mess there is. Most EU members allow a religious exception to the general rule that animals should be stunned before slaughter. But Denmark, Sweden and Slovenia do not. Finland says that slaughter and stunning can be simultaneous. The Dutch decree that the animal must not be sentient for more than 40 seconds after its throat being cut. In fractious Belgium, the Dutch- and French-speaking regions ban non-stun slaughter. Administratively separate Brussels, where many ethnic Moroccans live, has no such ban. This has prompted lawsuits by Jewish and Muslim groups; the latest has just been rejected by Belgium’s constitutional court. Two Muslim bodies may take the matter to the European Court of Human Rights.Jewish groups were also disappointed when, on October 5th, the European Commission laid out a strategy against anti-Semitism. While proposing ways to foster Jewish life and promote Holocaust remembrance, it ducked how to guarantee time-honoured Jewish customs, says Pinchas Goldschmidt of the Conference of European Rabbis. By refusing to spell out a right to kosher slaughter, Europe’s institutions are sending an unfriendly message to Jews already fretting over their safety, says the rabbi. “This has more to do with two-legged animals than four-legged animals,” he says. Bans on religious slaughter have a dark history in Europe: they were imposed in Switzerland in the 1890s to stop Jews immigrating and in Germany in the 1930s to make them leave.In Britain, where halal food is big business, the authorities are prevaricating. Religiously slaughtered meat should at least be clearly labelled so that the non-religious, as well as the devout, can follow their consciences, says Stephen Evans of the National Secular Society.
19  AS AN ICY wind rattles the windows of his office, Sergei Shapkin dips a biscuit in honey and ponders the art of survival. He is the mayor of Pavlopil, a village in eastern Ukraine. When Vladimir Putin started grabbing Ukrainian territory in February 2014, Mr Shapkin knew his village was in danger. On one side were pro-Russian separatists, armed by the Kremlin. On the other were loyalist forces. If they fought over Pavlopil, villagers would die.Listen to this story.So Mr Shapkin, a cardigan-wearing former history teacher, talked to the men with guns. His village was of no strategic value, but it had shops. He suggested that the separatists enter in the morning, unarmed and on foot, to buy food and cigarettes. The Ukrainian army could do the same each afternoon. That way, they would not bump into each other and start shooting. It worked—there was no fighting in Pavlopil, and the locals stayed alive, apart from one whose tractor hit a mine.Ceasefires have come and gone since September 2014, and sporadic shooting continues in eastern Ukraine. Just on October 12th, the day of an EU-Ukraine summit in Kyiv, monitors counted nearly 300 ceasefire violations, including 77 explosions. “Everyone has a shelter,” says Mr Shapkin. “We’re all prepared with candles, hammers and torches. And we all have bags packed in case we suddenly have to move.”Mr Putin wrote an essay in July expanding his argument that Russia and Ukraine are a single nation. Since he has already annexed Crimea, a Ukrainian peninsula, and sponsored the takeover of a big chunk of eastern Ukraine by ethnic Russian separatists, Ukrainians take his threats seriously. In March and April he massed more than 100,000 troops on the border, before pulling them back. Now, as winter approaches, Ukrainians have another worry: that Russia will turn off the gas again.In 2009 it shut off the flow of gas through Ukraine for two weeks. This cost Russia a fortune, since its gas needs to pass through Ukraine to reach customers in Europe. Soon, though, it may be able to pump gas to Germany via a new pipeline, Nord Stream 2, that bypasses Ukraine. Once it opens—which could be soon, though it is subject to legal and diplomatic challenges—Mr Putin will be able to choke off supplies to Ukraine almost at will.Technically Ukraine does not buy gas directly from Russia, but from downstream countries such as Hungary. In reality, it takes Russian gas in the east and substitutes its own gas, which is produced in the west of Ukraine, for transmission onwards. So if the flow through Ukraine were to stop, the east of the country would be in trouble. “We’re gas hostages,” says Vadim Boichenko, the mayor of Mariupol, a port city 25km south of Pavlopil.On October 12th in Kyiv Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, assured Ukrainians that Europe would protect their energy independence. They are not reassured. President Volodymyr Zelensky seeks shelter for his country inside NATO and the EU. But this is a non-starter. NATO members do not want to extend their principle of “an attack on one is an attack on all” to a country Russia has already attacked. And the EU has enough trouble integrating corrupt ex-communist states such as Hungary without admitting a grubbier, bigger one like Ukraine.Trust is lacking on both sides. Mr Zelensky’s first taste of geopolitics was when President Donald Trump urged him to supply dirt on Joe Biden, with a veiled threat that American support for Ukraine’s security might depend on it. President Biden has not been much better, from a Ukrainian perspective. To cement relations with Germany, in May he waived sanctions that might have blocked Nord Stream 2.The West would like to support reform in Ukraine, but it is not easy. Corruption is rife. Oligarchs dominate the economy, control two of the bigger political parties and put other lawmakers on retainer. The IMF hesitates to throw money at a state from which billions have been stolen with apparent impunity.The oligarchs are entrenched in public life in complex ways. Consider Mariupol, which nearly fell to pro-Kremlin forces during the war. The conscripts who were supposed to defend it were about to flee. The city was saved when the local steel baron, Rinat Akhmetov, urged his staff onto the streets and another oligarch, Ihor Kolomoisky, armed a militia. Seeing that the militiamen were ready to fight, Ukrainian soldiers stayed, too. Since then, Mariupol has become a haven for fugitives from the fighting: 100,000 out of a population of 540,000. The city looks far nicer than it did in 2014. Hefty investment has improved its buses, roads, parks and rubbish collection. A new airport and university are planned.Public opinion has shifted, too. Before the war two-thirds of people in Mariupol supported a pro-Russia political party. That share has fallen by half. Mr Putin’s aggression has alienated the people he claims to defend. So the kind of “hybrid warfare” that worked in Donbas, where Russia stirred up local ethnic Russians to demand secession, will not work in Mariupol, says Mr Boichenko. Yet Russia still has a hand on Mariupol’s throat. The amount of cargo processed in its port has fallen by half since 2012, first because of the war, then because Mr Putin made it harder for big ships to reach it from the Black Sea. Critics wonder if it is healthy for a city to depend so much on one tycoon. Mr Akhmetov is said to be Ukraine’s richest man.Mr Zelensky, a former comedian, has vowed to cut Ukraine’s oligarchs down to size. He is expected to sign a new law soon that would allow a panel he appoints to label as “oligarchs” anyone who is very rich, finances a political party and controls media assets. This would make it harder for anyone so labelled to raise capital.Critics note that Mr Zelensky has close ties to Mr Kolomoisky, one of the most controversial oligarchs, whose television channel hosted the show that propelled the president to stardom. They worry that the law might give Mr Zelensky too much discretion to cow his enemies and force them to sell their television channels to his friends. “It’s to make oligarchs behave, politically,” says Daria Kaleniuk of the Anti-Corruption Action Centre, an NGO. “Not to stop them from being oligarchs.”One illustration of how oligarchs weaken Ukraine is the retail market for gas. Many homes get their gas from companies controlled by Dmitry Firtash, a tycoon with Russian ties who is living in Vienna and fighting extradition to America for alleged corruption. His firms have huge unpaid debts to Naftogaz, the state wholesale supplier. This is money that could have been invested to increase domestic gas production. Meanwhile, a new Naftogaz CEO appointed by Mr Zelensky agreed to pay the state a fat dividend out of the firm’s frosty-day fund. This will help Mr Zelensky build roads, which are popular, but will leave less in the kitty for Ukraine to buy emergency supplies should Mr Putin ramp up his pipeline power politics.

20  HE MAY ONLY be 35, but Sebastian Kurz has been involved in enough political intrigue for several lifetimes. On October 9th Mr Kurz was toppled as Austria’s chancellor for the second time in three years, amid claims that he had masterminded a conspiracy to buy himself favourable media coverage. In America Mr Kurz would barely be old enough to run for president. But his career at the top of Austrian politics may already be approaching its end.Listen to this story.Mr Kurz and nine others stand accused of an elaborate plot to upend the leadership of the conservative Austrian People’s Party (öVP), and ultimately of the country. Prosecutors allege that, starting in 2016, the finance ministry siphoned taxpayers’ money to fund bogus opinion polls, published in a compliant newspaper, to help Mr Kurz unseat Reinhold Mitterlehner, then head of the öVP, and take his job. Fake invoices are said to have disguised the ploy. The evidence is in a stash of 300,000 text messages discovered on the phone of Thomas Schmid, a supporter of Mr Kurz who was working at the finance ministry. They show Mr Kurz egging on Mr Schmid; at one point he describes Mr Mitterlehner as an “arse”. (On October 12th a pollster was arrested in connection with the case. Mr Kurz protests his own innocence.)Mr Kurz tried to cling on when the news broke, but resigned under pressure from the Greens, the öVP’s coalition partner, and his own party’s regional barons. He proposed as his replacement Alexander Schallenberg, an ally who had served as his foreign minister since 2019. A career diplomat, Mr Schallenberg shares his erstwhile boss’s tough views on migration but not his instincts for populist tub-thumping, nor his obsession with media coverage. This will relieve other EU leaders, many of whom were tiring of Mr Kurz.Yet will Mr Schallenberg really be in charge? Moments after being sworn in he insisted on Mr Kurz’s innocence and said he would continue to consult him closely. Insiders say he does not want to trample on Mr Kurz’s democratic mandate. Mr Kurz says he will not be a “shadow chancellor”. But he immediately appointed himself head of the öVP’s parliamentary group, a position that affords him a seat at the cabinet (and immunity from prosecution, although he says he will seek to have this lifted). He will hope to return as the party’s candidate for chancellor at the next election. That is due in 2024, though so delicate is the political mood that few believe the öVP-Green coalition can survive that long.Still, if the obsequies for Mr Kurz are premature, so are expectations he can simply ride out the storm, says Marcus How at VE Insight, a Vienna-based political consultancy. Even if there is no smoking gun linking Mr Kurz to the poll-buying conspiracy, further revelations are likely as prosecutors wade through Mr Schmid’s messages. Their investigations, and thus possible criminal charges, will rumble on for years. Once Mr Kurz loses his aura of political invincibility, his party’s regional chiefs will drop him quicker than a hot Knödel.The broader stench engulfing Mr Kurz has become hard to ignore. Once feted as the Wunderkind future of European conservatism, his freshness appealed to voters tired of the grubbiness that has long bedevilled Austrian public life. Instead he has been embroiled in endless scandal. The first coalition he led, a controversial alliance with the far-right Freedom Party (FPö), collapsed in 2019 when an FPö leader was ensnared in a video sting. In May Mr Kurz was accused of perjuring himself before a parliamentary committee investigating corruption. In his brief political life the former chancellor has been in coalition with three of Austria’s four other main parties; all of them have ruptured. That is a warning for anyone else who might think of going into government with him.Mr Kurz’s fall coincided with a comparable defenestration in Prague. On October 9th Andrej Babis, the Czech Republic’s billionaire prime minister, lost an election to a five-party alliance. Mr Babis has also faced allegations of corruption, linked to EU subsidies channelled to his agricultural empire. (He denies wrongdoing.) Yet Milos Zeman, the erratic president, may try to delay the exit of Mr Babis, an ally, as long as possible. One day after the election Mr Zeman was rushed to hospital, leaving the country in constitutional limbo. Like Mr Kurz, Mr Babis is down—but not yet out. 
21  “RUSSIA IS ABOUT bears now, it’s not about bullies.” So joked Sergei Ryabkov, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, this week, speaking about the crisis in Europe’s natural-gas market. His country favours stability and lower prices over runaway prices, he insisted: “We would prefer to have here a bear market.”Listen to this story.Russia is responding to a view gaining currency in European capitals that Gazprom, the state-controlled energy goliath that is the continent’s biggest supplier, has been stoking the continent’s energy crisis by withholding exports of natural gas. European parliamentarians are demanding that Gazprom be investigated for not shipping more gas, allegedly as a ploy to secure final regulatory approval for the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline designed to ship Russian gas to Germany.The Cassandras get it half right. Europe is indeed mired in an energy crisis. The price of natural gas has skyrocketed of late across Europe. This has led to panic in Britain, where the government is now considering offering subsidies and other state support for steel, chemicals and other heavy energy users. On October 12th E.ON, a German energy firm, took the extraordinary step of suspending new gas-supply contracts for residential customers.Worse yet, the continent looks headed for a bleak winter with a possibility of severe gas and power shortages. Matt Drinkwater of Argus Media, an industry publisher, observes that official forecasters are concerned that the La Niña weather phenomenon may produce an especially harsh winter not only in north-west Europe but also in north-east Asia and North America, which would spark further global competition for energy.Europe’s stores of natural gas were well above the five-year average at the start of 2021, but a long winter combined with lower production in Norway and Britain (in part due to pandemic-related snags) means storage is now at worrying levels. Edward Morse of Citigroup, an American bank, predicts that if this winter is indeed a bitter one, those stores could run out.Fuel switching was an option in the past, but that is difficult now. For example, green activism has stymied Europe’s nuclear development. James Huckstepp of S&P Global Platts Analytics, a research firm, notes that the region “can’t flip back to coal plants easily because some of them have been closed—and the rest made unattractive because of carbon policies.” And as recent painful episodes of low wind and depleted hydroelectric reserves across parts of Europe have made clear, renewable energy is not yet a reliable substitute for gas.Using less gas will be difficult, at least in the short term. But is it possible for Europe to get hold of more gas? One way is to try to bully Russia into exporting more. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, recently praised Norway for helping with the gas crisis, but pointed an accusing finger at the Kremlin: “This does not seem to be the case in Russia.” But analysts reckon that the gas giant is actually exporting more gas to Europe this year than it did before the pandemic, and its big continental customers have recently confirmed that it is meeting its contractual obligations. There is little hard evidence that Russia is a big factor in Europe’s current gas crisis.Another possible way to boost supply would be to increase imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) by ship. Over the past two decades, Europe’s strategy of reducing reliance on Gazprom led to big investments in LNG, which now makes up some 20% of the continent’s gas (up from none a few decades ago). When the global gas market was well supplied a few years ago, Europe enjoyed low gas prices thanks to access to surplus cargoes. But the combination of stagnant investment in new production and a sudden spike in global gas demand linked to the global economic recovery has led to a mad scramble for LNG of late.That has some in Europe pointing, with a bit more justification, to another foreign bogeyman. Mr Morse notes “a tendency among European officials to put the blame on China”. LNG imports have shot up in the Pacific region, with mainland imports soaring by 25% of late. Cargoes from America and the Middle East are spurning European ports, lured by the hefty price premium offered by Asian buyers. One advantage they have is explicit state support. In China, energy-security concerns have led officials to ensure adequate winter supplies “at all costs”.The other advantage they have, explains Michael Stoppard of IHS Markit, a research firm, is that most Asian gas is still procured on long-term contracts linked to the oil price—a practice Europe abandoned as it liberalised gas markets. Since Asian buyers are hedged, they feel less pain than do European counterparts fully exposed to today’s astronomical prices. Mr Putin has, with some justification, ridiculed Europe’s embrace of “market-based” pricing for gas as the work of some “smart alecs” at the European Commission, and suggested that Gazprom stands ready to revive the old-fashioned type of oil-linked contract.In the end, no foreign bogeyman offers a satisfying explanation for Europe’s gas crisis. There is another plausible, albeit controversial, explanation found closer to home: the continent’s headlong rush to decarbonise its energy system. Mr Morse argues that what Europe’s leaders are hiding from on the eve of the UN’s big climate summit next month in Scotland is the first crisis of the energy transition. As it shifts away from fossil and nuclear power and embraces renewables, the region has not properly dealt with the need for redundancy on the grid. America has such problems too, but he notes that it is self-sufficient in energy. Europe is far from it.

22  B REXIT, BEFORE it happened, was imagined in many forms. Hard, soft, Norwegian, Swiss or Turkish. Briefly, an Albanian option was discussed. Often it was just “clean”. A “clean Brexit” would free Britain from the EU’s single market, customs union and its courts, advocates said. Just as there are many ways of leaving the EU, there are many ways of remaining. There is the clean version, in which countries quietly accept the EU’s strictures. Then there is the messy version, where governments foul up the club. Think of it as “dirty remain”.Listen to this story.To see dirty remain in action, look at Poland. Its Constitutional Tribunal challenged the legal order of the club in a ruling on October 7th. In a case brought by the Polish prime minister, the court, which is stuffed with allies of the government, ruled that fundamental parts of EU law do not trump Poland’s constitution. The judgment, which was exactly what the government wanted, has punctured six decades of European case law. In short, the EU’s supreme court is no longer supreme, as far as Poland is concerned.Poles protested in droves, claiming that the government was attempting to drag the country out of the bloc against their will. But anyone expecting a British-style “Polexit” will be disappointed. Support for the EU within the country is among the highest in the union. Standing for an election in Poland on a platform of quitting the EU would be akin to a manifesto promising to drown puppies. The problem is not that Poland is trying to leave the EU; the problem is that it intends to stay.Dirty remain is more pernicious than Polexit. The risk is that the EU’s legal order in Poland slowly fades, argues Daniel Sarmiento of the Complutense University of Madrid. A domino effect takes over. If courts across the EU cannot trust their Polish peers, then the EU’s legal system starts to gum up. An arrest warrant here is not honoured there; a banking licence granted in one country may not be honoured in another. Over time, an area over which people, goods, capital and services can flow freely turns into one where they can move only with trouble.Bad behaviour can spread. Eurosceptics have mostly given up on leaving the EU. It is, as Britain has shown, rather stressful. Eric Zemmour, the nationalist radical mulling a run in the French presidential election, has pledged to restore the primacy of French law over EU law. Even more mild-mannered figures, such as Michel Barnier, the EU’s Brexit negotiator, toy with the same idea. If one government can avoid abiding by unpopular rulings by the EU’s top court with little fear of sanction, it becomes a tempting option for all.As an idea, “dirty remain” has a veneer of respectability. Its Polish proponents argue that everyone else does it, but only Poland is attacked. Polish judges are fond of citing their German counterparts, who have accused the European Court of Justice (ECJ) of overstepping the mark in recent years. In such rulings, the medium counts as much as the message. No one doubts the independence of Germany’s constitutional court. No one believes in the independence of Poland’s.The messages are different, too. The German court accused the ECJ of exceeding its mandate in approving a programme of bond-buying by the European Central Bank. The Polish court said the country’s constitution trumped fundamental parts of EU law, such as “ever closer union”, a much more sweeping ruling. The German court was playing with matches; its Polish counterpart doused the EU’s legal system in petrol and deliberately started a fire.On paper, the solution to such a disagreement is simple: leave the EU. Britain made things easy for the club when it departed. Rather than hanging around blocking things and generally causing a fuss, it followed the procedures as laid down in Article 50 of the treaties it was so keen to leave. Doing this without a clear plan was “like putting a gun in your mouth and pulling the trigger” according to Dominic Cummings, the man who led the Vote Leave campaign. Yet to the surprise of EU diplomats this is exactly what the British government did.Instead, Poland is following a strategy that played out in Watchmen, a comic. In it, Rorschach, a vigilante, is sent to jail, where he greets a fellow inmate in the canteen by tipping the contents of a deep-fat fryer over his head. “None of you seem to understand,” he says to his now-crispy foe. “I’m not locked in here with you. You’re locked in here with me.” In the EU, destinies are linked. If one person starts hurling a fryer, everyone must duck. David Cameron, Britain’s prime minister at the time, begged for concessions from the EU ahead of Britain’s referendum on leaving it, including an opt-out from “ever closer union”. Poland threw its fryer without warning.Such dirty tricks are difficult to deal with inside the club. A nation-state can enforce its will internally, sending in the police or even, in extremis, the army to quell insurrection. The EU has no such tools. The European Commission could refuse to sign off on Poland’s share of its covid-19 recovery fund, depriving the country of €57bn ($66bn), for instance. The danger is that this will prompt Poland to bring the EU’s workings to a halt in protest.Amicable divorce or poisonous marriageBad behaviour outside the club is less of a problem. After doing things by the book as a member, Britain has discovered a rebellious streak, trying to renege on the terms of its deal with the EU. This causes little trouble for the EU. Rather than an existential problem, Brexit is a tedious one involving the movement of sausages across the Irish sea. Britain has been cauterised. By contrast, the rule of law in Poland is an open wound. It is a long-term threat, which needs to be solved if the EU is to thrive. Just as a financial crisis in one country can spread to another, so can a constitutional crisis. Dealing with a departure is relatively easy for the EU. Handling dirty remain is much harder. 
23  “T HE FRENCH Trump, it’s you!” a Parisian ally of the former American president once told Eric Zemmour. Or so the outspoken anti-immigrant polemicist claims in his latest bestselling book. A few weeks ago, such an assertion appeared self-serving and fanciful. But a recent poll surge by this Vichy apologist and television personality has taken established French political parties by surprise. Mr Zemmour is seeking nothing less than to turn nationalist party politics upside down and outflank Marine Le Pen, by making the hard-right leader look too soft.Listen to this story.Ahead of next April’s two-round presidential election, two recent first-round polls have put Mr Zemmour in second place, ahead of Ms Le Pen and behind Emmanuel Macron, the sitting president. This has transformed him from a commentator on frenzied TV talk shows into the subject of them. Which is exactly where the radical nationalist, who has been convicted of inciting racial hatred, wants to be. Polls still suggest Mr Macron will lead in the first round and win in the second. But they also suggest that Mr Zemmour, who has yet to confirm he is running, could upset presidential ambitions on the left and the right.The 63-year-old Mr Zemmour has been a controversial pundit for a quarter of a century. His décliniste books predict the collapse of French civilisation, with titles such as “French Melancholy” and “French Suicide”. More recently he has grabbed attention as a provocateur on CNews, a cable channel that some liken to America’s Fox News. “Zemmour président” posters have been pasted to lamp posts and walls. Last month Mr Zemmour was forced to quit his nightly TV show under French rules that require broadcasters to give equal airtime to political figures. The broadcast regulator judged that he was already more politician than journalist, and so his appearances would have to be counted as such.Whereas Ms Le Pen has tried to sanitise her party’s xenophobic image and distance it from its roots, Mr Zemmour seeks to radicalise, provoke and frame the debate around his own obsessions. He is “counter-feminist”, anti-woke, and blends erudition with outrage, simple sentences and rant. Of Jewish-Algerian descent, he has declared that Vichy France in fact protected French Jews, that foreign first names (such as Mohammed) should be banned, and that Islam is not compatible with France. Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder of the party his daughter now leads, said approvingly that Mr Zemmour says “things that nobody dared say, except me”.Mr Zemmour’s popularity may yet prove fleeting. But the polemicist, who claims he is a Gaullist, seems to have found a potent pitch. It mixes a veneer of intellectual respectability with crude populism, in a way that links the ultra-Catholic bourgeois vote to the working-class electorate. Ms Le Pen, by contrast, appeals to those on tight budgets, from the populist right to the ex-Communist left. In 2017 Ms Le Pen scored fully 34% in the second round, against Mr Macron. But she failed to win a single region at elections this year, and her star has waned. Now she and Mr Zemmour are competing for many of the same disillusioned, hard-right voters. The provocateur, who has styled himself as a sort of French Trump with more brains, could take votes from the nationalist fringe of the mainstream right as well as from her, and threaten her place in the run-off.Mr Zemmour’s surge is further confirmation of the weakening of political parties in French presidential politics. Mr Macron showed to spectacular effect in 2017 that it is possible to seize the presidency under the fifth-republic constitution without an established party. “There will be a before and an after Macron,” says a voter: “The old parties of left and the right, they don’t exist anymore. People don’t identify with them. They feel lost.”The Socialists, whose candidate in 2017, Benoît Hamon, scored just 6%, are not polling much better this time, even under their current hopeful, Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris. The Greens’ nominee, Yannick Jadot, is also struggling. A clutch of other candidates lie even further to the left. None shows any inclination to give way to any other, and even if they did this might not be enough for the left to make it to the second round.On the centre-right, the Republicans will vote for their nominee on December 4th. The three favourites are Xavier Bertrand, head of the northern Hauts-de-France region, Valérie Pécresse, head of the Ile-de-France region around Paris, and Michel Barnier, the former EU Brexit negotiator. Mr Bertrand is preferred by the French as a whole. But the 70-year-old Mr Barnier, who is less well-known in France than in Britain and fancies himself as an elder statesman, has made a calculated pitch for the anti-immigration vote. For card-carrying members, who will vote for the nominee and tend to be on the party’s right, this could be just their champion. Meanwhile, Edouard Philippe, a centre-right former prime minister, launched his own new party, Horizons, on October 9th but promises to use it to help Mr Macron in 2022.By splitting the hard-right vote, Mr Zemmour could in fact end up helping Mr Macron’s re-election prospects. No poll yet suggests that Mr Zemmour could win a run-off. “He’s capturing attention as the curiosity candidate,” says Emmanuel Rivière of the Kantar polling group: “It’s far harder to run a real campaign than to appear on TV or attend a book-signing.” All the same, the president’s party is warning against complacency. “It’s going to be tough,” says Roland Lescure, one of Mr Macron’s deputies: “It’s winnable, but it’s not won yet.” With six months to go and France in a febrile mood, Mr Zemmour is dragging politics onto toxic ground, and contributing to what could be a nasty, divisive campaign. 
24  FOR THOSE worried about the health of European democracy, the departures were all the more welcome for being so unexpected. After a decade in which populist governments have undermined the rule of law and moulded the state to their advantage across central and eastern Europe, two leaders accused of manipulating the political system lost power on the same day. An election in the Czech Republic appears to have ended the tenure of Andrej Babis, the billionaire prime minister, who is under investigation for misuse of EU subsidies, which he denies. In Austria, meanwhile, an investigation into the use of government funds to buy favourable media coverage has led to the resignation of Sebastian Kurz, the chancellor—although he, too, denies wrongdoing.A bigger showdown is looming. Poland’s government, led by the populist Law and Justice (PiS) party, has spent years trying to establish political control over its courts, bringing it into conflict with the EU. On October 7th its constitutional court raised the stakes by declaring that parts of the EU’s founding treaty infringe the Polish constitution, and that the final say in such conflicts belongs to Polish judges, not to the EU’s highest court. Such a break with EU treaties could force the European commission to deny Poland access to €36bn ($42bn) in covid-recovery funds. That would be the biggest escalation yet in the EU’s internal feud over the minimum democratic standards that all its members should uphold. If the commission goes ahead, it would signal a strong resolve to bring wayward members into line—and thus mark a big escalation in the long conflict.Mr Kurz is a 35-year-old wunderkind whose tough anti-immigration policies aided his rapid rise to become head of the Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP), foreign minister and then chancellor. But the scandal has shed unwelcome light on concerns about how he did it. On October 6th police raided the chancellery, the foreign ministry and the ÖVP’s headquarters. The justice ministry’s economic crimes unit accused the party of using money from the Foreign Ministry to bribe a tabloid newspaper to run positive stories on Mr Kurz between 2016 and 2018. The stories were based on surveys allegedly doctored to make him look more popular, produced by a friendly polling agency.Illiberal regimes often use state advertising to buy influence in the media. Some, such as Hungary’s government under Viktor Orban, do it blatantly. In Austria, things are less clear-cut, but have moved in a worrying direction of late. Government advertising purchases make up a large part of most newspapers’ budgets, and many have long worried that this may exert a subtle influence over their news coverage. But messages on a phone confiscated from a colleague of Mr Kurz showed an unusually naked quid pro quo.Mr Kurz denies that he broke any laws or had any knowledge of the scheme. He will stay on as head of the party in parliament, and his replacement as chancellor is a close ally, Alexander Schallenberg. He might even have tried to stick it out, had not his coalition partners, the Green Party, threatened to bring the government down if he stayed. Austrians are sharply polarised in their views of Mr Kurz, but he is likely to attempt a comeback. His travails suggest that Europe’s problems with systemic corruption are not limited to formerly communist countries.In the Czech Republic, Mr Babis’s defeat is piquant in that he long campaigned on an anti-corruption platform, claiming to be too rich to need bribes. He built his fortune starting in the 1990s by creating Agrofert, an agricultural conglomerate. Since entering politics in 2013 he has been dogged by investigations into whether the company abused EU subsidies. That investigation is now being pursued by the European public prosecutor’s office. Mr Babis has put his shares in Agrofert into a trust, but another EU investigative body, OLAF, concluded early this year that his connections to the company constituted a conflict of interest.In the run-up to the election polls showed Mr Babis’s ANO (“Yes”) party narrowly in the lead. But on October 3rd an international journalists’ consortium released the Pandora Papers, a massive analysis of leaked documents from financial companies. The consortium’s Czech members, Investigace.eu, said the leaks showed that in 2009 Mr Babis had sent $22m through a shell company in the British Virgin Islands to buy a secret villa in the south of France.Mr Babis spent the last weeks of the campaign imitating Mr Orban’s EU-bashing rhetoric. He has imitated Mr Orban’s techniques of media control too: Agrofert owns publications with a 25% share of the print news market. But the Pandora Papers got heavy coverage and may have tipped the balance in the election. Turnout was high, especially among young people and in cities where the opposition is strong. Spolu (“Together”), an alliance of centre-right parties, got 27.8% of the vote to ANO’s 27.1%. An alliance of the Pirate Party with a group of mayors and other officials got 15.6%. Together they will have a narrow majority in parliament because most parties fell short of the 5% threshold.Mr Babis is far from done. President Milos Zeman, a eurosceptic populist, has vowed to reappoint him as prime minister regardless, claiming ANO won more votes than other individual parties. But that effort is unlikely to last long. Matters are further complicated by the fact that Mr Zeman was taken to hospital on October 10th. The victory of the opposition alliances vindicates a tactic adopted in other countries struggling with illiberal populist leaders. In Hungary too, opposition parties have teamed up across the political spectrum to try to unseat Mr Orban in the election next year.Balancing out the progress, the Polish court decision on October 8th was the week’s gravest challenge to the rule of law in Europe. Ever since PiS came into office in Poland in 2015 it has been trying to gain control over the country’s courts by giving the government power to appoint pliant judges and punish defiant ones (another model borrowed from Mr Orban). That has brought Poland into ever deeper conflict with EU treaties, which require member states to have independent judiciaries. Polish judges have been barred from referring controversial cases to the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the EU’s highest court. Some who did have been suspended and prosecuted.The European Commission, which is supposed to enforce the bloc’s treaties, has been a reluctant cop, taking years to inch towards meaningful sanctions. But the constitutional court’s ruling could now force the commission’s hand. In a suit brought by Mateusz Morawiecki, Poland’s prime minister, the court declared that parts of the EU’s founding treaty violate the Polish constitution, and that Polish judges rather than the ECJ have the last word in such questions.The constitutional court is a rubber stamp for PiS, and officials in Brussels were prepared for an unfavourable decision. But the direct attack on an EU treaty went beyond their expectations. The principle that European law supersedes national law and that the ECJ is the arbiter of disputes lies at the very core of the EU. If member countries can ignore European laws or interpret them as they see fit, the European project is moot. (An earlier blow had been struck in May last year by Germany’s constitutional court, which ruled that in an area concerning European Central Bank financing, the EU exceeded its authority. That row is still being sorted out.)The commission’s initial statement on the ruling was circumspect, but many officials think the time has finally come for a firm response. It could refuse to authorise Poland’s request for money from the EU’s massive €800bn covid recovery fund, which includes a clause requiring the commission to certify that recipient countries respect the rule of law. Poland has asked for €36bn. It needs the money for a slate of social programmes the government has labeled the “Polish New Deal”. This would be a nuclear step, but it may be a fight over the rule of law that the EU cannot avoid.
25  THERE IS NO such thing as a bad view of the Bosporus, the waterway that divides Istanbul between Europe and Asia. But the one from the bridge of the Gas Cobia, a 180-metre tanker, as it makes its way from the Sea of Marmara to the Black Sea, is hard to beat. Ottoman palaces slide past. Hagia Sophia soaks up the morning sun. The towers of the Rumeli Hisari, the fortress Sultan Mehmet II used to choke off supplies to the city he later conquered, march down to the shore. Passenger ferries and fishing boats bounce on the waves.Listen to this story.For Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, one Bosporus is not enough. So he is building another. In June, at a ground-breaking ceremony for a bridge over the Sazlidere, a river on Istanbul’s western fringes, Turkey’s leader announced he was starting work on a giant canal, known as Kanal Istanbul, bypassing the Bosporus altogether. A tender linked to the project, for housing units close to the Sazlidere, took place on October 7th. The new waterway would stretch for 45km (28 miles), turn the city’s European side into an island, and cost at least $15bn. Mr Erdogan himself describes the canal as a “crazy project”, presumably in a good way. Critics describe it as the biggest rent-seeking exercise in Turkey’s history and a recipe for an environmental disaster.Mr Erdogan’s pitch comes down to safety and money. The canal, he says, would be easier to navigate than the Bosporus, reduce congestion in one of the world’s busiest channels and bring in new revenue. Under the Montreux Convention, signed in 1936, civilian vessels can pass through the Bosporus and the Dardanelles, the straits linking the Sea of Marmara and the Mediterranean, free of charge. (The convention places limits on the size and number of warships that can cross the straits, and on their length of stay in the Black Sea.) But traffic can lead to long waiting times. Mr Erdogan’s hope is that ships will pay transit fees to jump the queue and use his canal.Aboard the Gas Cobia, Captain Ismail Akpinar shouts instructions at the ship’s crew (“Steady, zero two zero”). The Bosporus passage involves a dozen sharp turns of up to 80 degrees, currents of up to four knots (7kph) and shallow waters. For a small fee, shipping agents turn to experienced pilots like Captain Akpinar for help.They have every reason to do so. Ships regularly suffer engine or rudder problems during the passage. Three years ago, a tanker ploughed into a waterside mansion, causing over $30m in damages. The much greater danger, for a city that is home to more than 15m people, is a spill or an explosion. “If a medium-sized LPG tanker blows up here, nothing within a 3km radius survives,” says the captain.But in fact the Bosporus, contrary to the government’s claims, is becoming easier to navigate. The number of transits has fallen steadily, from 56,606 in 2007 to 38,404 last year. Thanks to skilful pilots, new traffic regulations and GPS technology, safety has been improving. No big, deadly accident has taken place in more than 40 years. Waiting times average less than 14 hours.Many analysts say building a new waterway next to an existing one makes no sense. With the Montreux Convention in place, ships that prefer to use the Bosporus and pay nothing would still be able to do so, notes Serhat Guvenc, a professor at Kadir Has University. The canal would only marginally reduce waiting times, he says. It would also be much more exposed to the storms that occasionally roil the Black Sea, says Yoruk Isik, a shipping analyst. “It would still be easier to transit the Bosporus, even on a bad weather day,” he says.Some doubt the project will ever get off the ground. Insiders say the ceremony in June was a stunt, and that the construction of a bridge over the Sazlidere was part of an unrelated road project. The logistical obstacles are immense. To make room for the canal, the government would have to reconfigure Istanbul’s roads, its sewage system and its power and gas lines, says Mr Isik. The price tag could easily reach $35bn, around 5% of the country’s GDP, says a Turkish banker. Contractors, including some Chinese and Western companies, are sniffing around, but most banks want nothing to do with it.Environmentalists warn of catastrophe. The canal could destroy Istanbul’s main reservoirs, raze much of its remaining forest and cover yet more land in concrete. It could also poison the Sea of Marmara. The canal would allow much more water from the Black Sea, which is less salty and packed with organic compounds, to gush into the Marmara, depleting its oxygen and killing much of its marine life.The real point of the canal, critics suspect, is to offer construction companies close to the government new land to develop. “This is a real-estate project,” says Ekrem Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul, who is leading a campaign against it. Mr Imamoglu’s party is in opposition at the national level and warns that, should it come to power, it will suspend all work on the canal. But the mayor does not have the authority to stop work from going ahead.Some Turks have bought into the hype. At his office a short walk from where the canal would meet the Black Sea, Hakan Bolukbasi, an estate agent, is doing a roaring trade. A square metre of land near the planned route of the canal now sells for 1,000 lira ($113), he says, up from 50 lira five years ago. Nearby, the fields brim with sunflowers, villagers sell watermelons from tractors and water buffaloes graze. All this may soon be gone. The area, and much of the land near the canal, has been earmarked for new housing. Buyers include Berat Albayrak, a former finance minister married to Mr Erdogan’s daughter, and members of Qatar’s royal family.The danger is that Mr Erdogan may use the canal as an excuse to renegotiate, or even withdraw from, the Montreux Convention. Earlier this year, after Mr Erdogan revoked Turkey’s participation in a convention protecting women from violence, the speaker of parliament remarked that the president could do the same with Montreux. Mr Erdogan said he would abide by it until a better one comes along. The comments provoked an angry response from Russia, which sees Montreux as a way to keep Western navies out of the Black Sea.Without the convention, the Black Sea would turn into a “powder keg”, says Cem Gurdeniz, a retired admiral. Earlier this year he and several other former officers were briefly arrested on coup charges after penning an open letter defending Montreux and criticising the canal project. The investigation is ongoing. The canal may one day trigger a crisis in the Black Sea. But it will provoke a political row in Turkey long before that. 
26  FOR MORE than two years, the common wisdom has been that Italy’s next government will be right-wing—and radically so. Polls have consistently indicated that the Brothers of Italy party, with its origins in neo-fascism, and the populist Northern League should together secure enough seats at the next election to form a parliamentary majority, perhaps even without needing help from Silvio Berlusconi’s more moderate Forza Italia movement.Listen to this story.But local elections on October 3rd and 4th showed how fragile the support underpinning the hard right is. Centre-left mayoral candidates won with more than half the votes in Milan, Naples and Bologna. Others in Rome and Turin look set to win in run-offs on October 17th and 18th.The elections followed a nightmarish campaign for the League’s leader, Matteo Salvini, and for the leader of the Brothers—who is in fact a sister, Giorgia Meloni. On September 26th it emerged that Mr Salvini’s social-media guru, Luca Morisi, was under formal investigation on suspicion of supplying narcotics. Mr Morisi denies any wrongdoing. Four days later, Ms Meloni’s drive to give her party a moderate, voter-friendly image suffered a grievous blow when a video was released showing some of her followers joking about Hitler, giving fascist salutes and apparently arranging for the Brothers to receive money illicitly. An investigation has since been opened into a suspected breach of Italy’s law on funding political parties.All this comes against a background of increasing division in the League. Mr Salvini’s position has become sufficiently tenuous for him to have spoken openly of being replaced. “If there is someone better than me,” he told an interviewer recently. “I’ll gladly enjoy [spending] a few hours more with my children.”The origin of his troubles is his decision earlier this year that the League should join Italy’s current government—a broad coalition headed by the former president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi. The League’s support for Mr Draghi earned it three places in the cabinet and a say in the spending of around €200bn ($230bn) from the EU’s post-pandemic recovery funds.But backing a government headed by a central banker who once defined himself as a liberal socialist was diametrically at odds with Mr Salvini’s populist instincts. It has also offered the Brothers a chance to steal the League’s populist thunder by remaining in opposition. Mr Salvini did opt to stay out of the cabinet, but has cut an increasingly awkward figure. In his efforts to hang on to the populist vote, he has repeatedly sniped at policies that ministers from his own party have endorsed.Nowhere has his predicament been more obvious than in the contrast between his courting of the anti-vaccine lobby and the government’s vaccine mandates. He originally described the EU’s plans for a pass for the vaccinated, those who had recovered from covid-19 or been tested in the previous 48 hours, as “insane crap”. Ignoring his objections, Mr Draghi’s government has since made the pass obligatory for access to a host of venues and services.Later this month Italy will become the first European country to require the pass for entry to both private and public workplaces. Even more embarrassingly for Mr Salvini, the government’s policies have been openly backed by the business minister, the League’s Giancarlo Giorgetti, and its regional governors in the industrial north—united in a desire to avoid further economically crippling lockdowns.The League has been steadily losing electoral support since mid-2019 and now polls around 20%, down from 30% or so two years ago. In recent months, and for the first time, it has been overtaken by the Brothers. It is not clear whether Ms Meloni’s party will be able to shrug off the latest allegations and hang on to that lead. But Italy’s right looks badly weakened. 
27  THE SHEER number was overwhelming. Between 1950 and 2020 at least 216,000 children were sexually abused in France by Catholic clergy. Thus, on October 5th, concluded a two-year independent inquiry commissioned by the church. Jean-Marc Sauvé, who led it, said it uncovered “the lead weight of silence smothering the crimes” committed by 2,900-3,200 clergy. If lay molesters involved in church activities were also included, the number of abused could reach 330,000.Listen to this story.Mr Sauvé’s introduction to the report is chilling and unflinching: “The Catholic church’s immediate reaction was to protect itself as an institution” and it “has shown complete, even cruel, indifference to those who suffered”. About 90% of the victims were boys, many between ten and 13 years old. He called for “a humble acknowledgement of responsibility from the church authorities for the mistakes and crimes committed under its auspices”.As was revealed by reports into sexual abuse by Catholic clergy elsewhere, the crimes in France involved a sinister web of misplaced trust, manipulated authority, concealment, silence and shame. The abuse was countrywide: in local parishes, scout groups, catechism classes and within families. Pope Francis expressed “great sorrow” for the victims. François Devaux, who suffered sexual abuse at the age of ten and later founded a victims group, called what they had gone through simply “hell”.It was the efforts of survivors such as Mr Devaux that forced the church to confront its denials and cover-ups. He and others came forward in 2015 to accuse Bernard Preynat, a priest and scout leader, of sexual abuse. Mr Preynat was convicted last year. In 2019 the accusations prompted the resignation of Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, convicted of covering up the Preynat affair (the conviction was overturned on appeal).France has an unusual link with Catholicism, due to strict secular rules, known as laïcité, designed to keep the state neutral in religious affairs. It lacks the wide network of church-linked boarding schools and state institutions that helped to conceal paedophilia in some other countries. Yet this proved no protection for the victims.Today the Catholic church in France is a hollowed-out version of its former self. Numbering 12,000, the priesthood is half what it was 20 years ago—and half of those serving are over 75. Only 49% of the French say they believe in God. Two years ago 56% said in one survey that they had a bad image of the Catholic church. This week’s report will entrench these trends.The church is not the only French arena in which denial of sexual abuse has been exposed. Another is politics, where, until #MeToo, sexual violence towards women tended to be hushed up. Two recent books also reveal how members of Left-Bank Parisian circles deployed the principle of sexual liberty to mask abuse and incest. By exposing the manipulation and cruelty of the predators, those brave enough to speak out may in future help prevent such abuse from going undetected for so long. 
28  FLANKED BY THE leaders of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, hailed the opening of the Svilaj bridge, linking the two countries. It was part of her tour of the western Balkan region, a term used by the EU to define the Balkan countries that have not yet joined the club and which have sat waiting on the doorstep since being promised eventual membership back in 2003. The happy integration between the EU and its Balkan neighbours was cast as nothing less than inevitable. “All the western Balkans belong in the European Union,” said Mrs von der Leyen. “It’s in our common interest, but I also believe it’s our destiny.”Listen to this story.Kind words collided with reality a week later. At a summit in Slovenia on October 6th of all 27 EU leaders and their six counterparts from Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia, the prospect of new countries joining the EU any time soon was absent. Instead, the western Balkan countries emerged with a pledge to cut roaming fees when their citizens visit the EU. An attempt by Slovenia to guarantee their membership by the end of the decade was dismissed as an outrageous publicity stunt. Literal bridge building was not accompanied by the metaphorical kind.Enlargement of the EU is, bluntly, dead. Across the western Balkans, governments are hurt. North Macedonia may have dutifully jumped through every hoop required to begin accession talks, including changing its name to settle a dispute with Greece. Yet an arcane row about the origins of the Macedonian language led to Bulgaria vetoing the start of negotiations. Albania, whose application is linked to North Macedonia’s in a futile attempt to stop such political gamesmanship, is also stuck. Its prime minister compared its relationship with the EU to a failing marriage. Normally, there is at least a wedding first. The EU wants to be a global force, but it is in danger of losing control of its own backyard.A realistic prospect of joining the EU is the bloc’s main tool for dealing with its neighbours. Yet at the moment, all sides know it is a fantasy. Countries such as France are deeply sceptical, preferring a deeper EU to a wider one. Diplomats from other cautious countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands insist their governments are fine with the idea of enlargement, as long as stringent criteria are met. Domestic politicians are, however, not always so nuanced. There is no chance of new countries joining the EU, even while the club’s leadership says otherwise.This is a problem. If incentives for good behaviour disappear, so do disincentives for bad behaviour. Tantrums in the western Balkans are now common, in the knowledge there is little to be lost. Why bother taking on vested interests or reforming the judicial system for naught? Those with little to lose have least to fear. Hence a row over number plates between Serbia and Kosovo led to special forces being deployed at the border. In the western Balkans, damned foolish things happen increasingly often.Sceptics insist that the club cannot digest new members. Former poster-children of EU enlargement, such as Poland, have become problem children. An EU without Poland or Hungary would spend less time worrying about nobbled judges or dodgy use of funds within the club. It is easy to find diplomats who think enlargement was a mistake. But this counterfactual is one that leaves the EU with an even more troublesome frontier. If the EU’s eastern members had remained outside the club, they might have followed the trajectories of other countries beyond the EU bubble, such as Ukraine. Exclusion is no happy solution.A sense of perspective comes from across the Atlantic. American diplomats remind their more sceptical European counterparts that life would be much easier with the western Balkans firmly inside the European tent, rather than outside getting wet, with other countries offering shelter. Montenegro has already got itself into trouble with a $1bn loan from China. Serbia has become a canny diplomat, accepting vaccines from everywhere and then distributing them to neighbours. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, sees Bosnia as a font of Islamist instability. In short, it is not a region that the EU can afford to lose.Instead, a dangerous complacency lurks among EU governments. The EU has dished out vaccines. It accounts for almost 70% of trade in the region. It invests about €3bn ($3.5bn) a year, which is a fair sum for a poor region of 20m people. Whatever Russia and China can offer, the EU can more than match, runs the logic. Threats of a geopolitical switch are brushed off by EU officials as diplomatic bravado by their Balkan peers.Size does matterAttention thus drifts elsewhere. Leaders would rather focus on the other side of the world, instead of the EU’s chaotic courtyard. On the eve of the Slovenian summit, leaders discussed the club’s strategy in the Pacific, which is a far sexier topic for those who dream of European might. The idea of spending hours discussing Kosovan number plates or the etymology of Macedonian words makes the eyes of European leaders roll into the back of their heads. In the Pacific leaders see history being made. In the Balkans they see history being repeated—to the point of tedium.Yet it is the western Balkans that is the more pressing test of the EU’s foreign-policy capability, rather than seemingly larger and more global topics. A coherent common policy on North Macedonia, Albania and their neighbours should be simple, compared with more difficult choices that lie ahead for the EU. At the moment, the EU’s China policy designates the country as partner, competitor and rival. Eventually it will have to pick, deciding what is in its collective interest. So the club may be better advised to begin with what should be the easier choices. If the EU wants to be a global power, it needs to become a local one first. A revived enlargement policy is the place to start. 
29  POLITICIANS’ PRIVATE finances are a big political issue in central Europe, as Andrej Babis well knows. Mr Babis, a billionaire who is prime minister of the Czech Republic, faces a general election on October 8th and 9th. A week before it, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, a reporters’ alliance, released an extravaganza of leaks from 14 financial firms, which it called the “Pandora Papers”. It charges that Mr Babis transferred $22m through shell companies in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), a tax haven, in order to buy a villa near Cannes anonymously. Mr Babis was already facing years-long investigations over alleged conflicts of interest and improper receipt of EU subsidies by Agrofert, an agricultural business he founded. He denies any wrongdoing.Listen to this story.Mr Babis was not the only politician tagged. Wopke Hoekstra, the Netherlands’ finance minister, was shown to have invested €26,500 ($30,500) in a friend’s safari company, also through a shell company in the BVI. Mr Hoekstra kept his shares while serving as a senator but sold them before becoming a minister, and broke no laws. But his Christian Democratic party has officially promised to take “firm action” against the use of tax havens.Like the consortium’s earlier investigations (which include the Panama Papers in 2016 and the Paradise Papers in 2017), the Pandora Papers show that secretive financial networks that can aid tax avoidance and money-laundering involve not just countries typically seen as corrupt, but many of those viewed as cleanly governed. Russians, Saudis and Americans are all heavily represented in the leaks. Besides the British Virgin Islands, the jurisdictions they used include Luxembourg and South Dakota.For the politicians concerned, the leaks are embarrassing but not devastating. The Netherlands has been mired in coalition talks for more than six months, but Mr Hoekstra seems likely to keep his job. As for Mr Babis, he is a skilled populist whose supporters tolerate the accusations against him. His party is in first place in the polls. According to a survey, two-thirds of Czechs think the government is run mainly by private interests. But whereas Czechs complain that their politicians are dirty, they do not seem to bother to elect cleaner ones.
30  AFTER MONTHS in lockdown in grey Berlin, Chris Bloom, a personal coach and blogger, planned his escape. Risking the ire of jealous Instagram followers, he took a covid-19 test, flew to Lisbon and settled into the Outsite co-working and co-living space, a pleasant blue-and-white tiled property with the essentials—stable internet and a coffee shop.Listen to this story.Mr Bloom is part of a growing brigade of digital nomads in Europe, who work remotely while satisfying their wanderlust. This kind of itinerant lifestyle is as old as laptops and free internet. But covid-19 has given it a boost. A game of lockdown arbitrage began earlier this year as border controls eased and people fled congested cities like Berlin and London. Some headed for other cities, such as Lisbon and Madrid, which offered sunshine and looser lockdown rules. Others chose remote spots on the Mediterranean and in the Alps. Now covid-19 restrictions are easing but the trend continues as many Europeans reject a traditional office routine after a year and a half of remote work. As Yoon-Joo Jee, an entrepreneur who has spent the pandemic between Seoul, Geneva and Lisbon, puts it: “there's an addiction in moving and exploring new places.”America has the best data on the rise of the new nomads. It had 10.9m digital wanderers last year, up from 7.3m in 2019. Academics say a similar jump is under way in Europe, which also offers continental scale and a lack of internal borders, at least within the Schengen area. Europeans itching for a change of scenery can roam freely from Helsinki to Seville. During the pandemic, Google searches for the term “digital nomad” reached all-time highs in France, and have been ticking up in Spain and Germany too. And there are plenty of destinations to explore. Eight of the top ten countries for nomads are in Europe, according to the Digital Nomad Index compiled by Circleloop, a telecoms firm, which ranks destinations on rental costs and internet connectivity, among other factors.This wandering lifestyle is likely to outlast the pandemic. Covid-19 has prompted big changes in how people work, some of which could become permanent. Many employers are introducing flexible work policies, so it is no longer just freelancers and entrepreneurs doing business on the beach. A third of French and German workers will operate remotely in 2022, predicts Gartner, a research firm, up from 22% and 27% in 2019, respectively. In one recent survey, 80% of employees considering a new role said the ability to live somewhere else was important to them. “I don’t think being a digital nomad is just a fashion at this point,” says Mohammad Jarrahi, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “There are some fundamental changes in the foundations of work.”The biggest barrier to the nomadic lifestyle is red tape. Totting up one’s tax bill, for instance, is complex for anyone who hops between jurisdictions. But new businesses are trying to help. During the pandemic John Lee started Work From Anywhere Team, a marketplace for tax consultants around the world. He argues that nomads like him need an “Amazon for tax advice”. The pandemic has created an awareness, says Michael Huertas of PwC, an accountancy firm, that “tax being drawn along national lines is really archaic.”Europe’s immigration rules are usually hostile to non-Europeans. But some governments, eager to draw visitors in economically challenging times, have been easing the rules for digital nomads. Croatia and Estonia have introduced long-term visas for people without EU passports who can prove that they are working online. In Portugal the regional government of Madeira has gone a step further, offering a free workspace, networking events, and an online portal replete with information about things like paperwork and places to stay. Since it was set up last November more than 9,000 people have registered on the Digital Nomads Madeira Islands website.The economic benefits that can flow from attracting nomads are clear. It is generally well-off folk with significant work experience who can afford to work from anywhere. They are unlikely to poach local jobs, but do spend money. In Madeira government officials estimate the average digital nomad spends €1,800 ($2,100) a month. Hannah Brown, who works for Estonia’s e-Residency programme, says the new visa has the added advantage of putting the small, peripheral nation on the map.Some locals, however, resent the nomads in their midst. As long-time nomad hotspots like Goa and Bali have found, well-paid outsiders can bid up the price of real estate. Some live in a bubble, having little to do with locals besides those who serve them iced lattes. The tensions can work both ways. Some wandering workers don’t like being called “nomads”, worrying that it makes them sound rootless. They may object even more to a new label that is gaining currency. Since so many nomads are male, single and fond of partying, cynics have started calling them “bro-mads” or even “digital gonads”.

31  GERMAN ELECTIONS are idiosyncratic affairs. Armin Laschet, the leader of the Christian Democrat Union, was grilled over his choice of bratwurst condiment (ketchup, not mustard). Annalena Baerbock, the Green candidate for chancellor, was skewered over plagiarism claims, a sin that bedevils only German politics. All politics is local, but in Germany it is parochial. The country may be Europe’s hegemon, yet foreign affairs and the future of the EU were barely mentioned. An at times surreal campaign ended with Angela Merkel, the outgoing chancellor and most powerful person in Europe, being photographed with a parrot on her head.Listen to this story.If the campaign was unmistakably German, the result was European. A slim victory for the Social Democratic Party (SPD) over its centre-right rivals, the Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian sister the Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU), will kick off months of coalition negotiations. German politicians struggled with the same problems as their peers across the continent; German voters behaved the same way as their neighbours. Europe was invisible in the campaign. But it is visible in the outcome.Politics in Germany has fragmented in the past decade or so, just as in every other western European country. Five parties got more than 10% of the vote each. When Angela Merkel came to power in 2005, only two did. In that same election, the CDU/CSU and SPD won 70% of the vote. On 26th September they managed barely half. It is a familiar story. In the Netherlands, 19 different parties now sit in parliament. In Italy, four parties ranging from centre-left to far-right hover around the 20% mark. Traditionally two-party systems, such as Spain, have become complex multi-party affairs. Germany is simply catching up.After posting the worst result in their history, the CDU/CSU can take some consolation from the fact they are not alone. Their political siblings in other countries have also lost ground. At the start of the 2010s, practically every big EU country had a centre-right government. Now, barring extremely canny negotiations from the CDU, none will. Conservative politicians used to run a continent; now they control a rump. In Germany, a bad campaign by a gaffe-prone candidate is part of the explanation. But the causes of the CDU’s malaise run deeper, and stretch beyond Germany’s borders.By contrast, after a decade of losing ground, the centre-left had something to cheer. Although not too loudly. Olaf Scholz, the SPD’s prospective chancellor, ran a cautious campaign based on competence, with enough radicalism to stop his party’s left from leaving for the Greens. It resulted in his party’s third-lowest postwar vote share, but paved a likely path to power.Now, Mr Scholz will endure the fate suffered by his fellow leftie leaders: staying in office via rickety coalitions. In Spain the Socialist Workers’ Party, another grandee of the centre left, took power with a little over a quarter of the vote. Once-mighty Scandinavian social democrats are still in government, but weaker than before. In the late 1990s centre-left parties were dominant across Europe. Their pitch was usually some variant of: “Things can only get better.” Now it is more like: “Things might not get worse.”Older voters keep the big-tent parties alive, both in Germany and across the EU. Call it the boomer bulwark. While four in ten under-30s backed the liberal Free Democrats or the Greens, 70% of over-60s voted for the SPD or the CDU/CSU. In Spain younger voters swoon for challenger parties, such as Podemos or Vox. But their parents and grandparents stick to traditional ones. In France, Marine Le Pen’s base is the discontented young. In Italy the far-right Lega and Brothers of Italy also rely on youthful voters. Parties now stand for young or old as much as left or right.Fractured politics mean complicated coalition talks. Germany is used to haggling between two parties. This time three will be necessary and negotiations could drag on. In a first for Germany, the Greens and the FDP (who came third and fourth) pledged to agree to terms with each other before negotiating with SPD or CDU/CSU. Again, Germany is joining a new European norm. Negotiations in Belgium are notorious for taking years and producing cumbersome coalitions. In the Netherlands, stuck in coalition talks since elections in March, the GreenLeft and Labour party discussed their own pact. In Nordic countries, four- or five-party coalitions are common. European politics is an increasingly complex (and increasingly Belgian) beast.Stick a pin in almost any rich, western EU country and one will find a populist party polling between 10% and 20%, offering a cocktail of immigrant- and Brussels-bashing. Germany, again, fits the norm. Alternative for Germany (Af D) won about 10% of the vote on just such a platform. Only Italy, where such parties collectively attract 40% of the vote, and France, where Marine Le Pen is a possible (though unlikely) president, buck the trend. By contrast, the alternative on offer to German voters is standard European fare.All European life is hereWhen asked why Germany does not take a bigger role in running the EU, Angela Merkel argued that it was impossible, since Germany was too much like the EU. Germany was already a delicate compromise between 16 different Länder (states), with a complicated relationship between its levels of government. German leadership was simply not feasible.But if Germany resembled the EU constitutionally, it now matches the club politically. Germany is fragmented, like its neighbours; its main centre-left and centre-right parties share the same woes as their peers. The nightmare of forming coalitions will draw sympathetic noises from Dutch, Belgian and Nordic neighbours. Old voters behave in the same way in Germany as they do in France or Italy, as do their children; fringe parties are better at causing a racket than winning power. When it comes to elections in the EU, the votes may still be national. But the politics are distinctly European. 
32  AT 6PM ON September 26th the atrium of the Willy Brandt House, the Berlin headquarters of Germany’s Social Democratic Party (SPD), erupted in cheers when an exit poll suggested it had won the country’s federal election. If victory was narrow, it was also sweet. Having long been in the polling doldrums, the SPD rode a late surge to 25.7% of the vote, 1.6 points ahead of its conservative rivals, the Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU). Olaf Scholz, the SPD’s candidate to replace Angela Merkel as chancellor, said voters had told the CDU/CSU that it “should no longer be in government, but in opposition”.Listen to this story.Mr Scholz’s emphasis was appropriate. For if this election had no clear winner, there was an obvious loser. At the Konrad Adenauer House, the CDU’s nerve centre, the mood was markedly gloomier. If the CDU/CSU had slightly outperformed the worst polling prognoses, the conservative bloc had still slumped to by far the worst election result in its history, losing some 4.1m votes and a whopping 8.9 percentage points since Mrs Merkel’s fourth and final win in 2017. After 16 years the chancellor, who remains in charge until a coalition is formed, will leave office with high approval ratings. But her party is in tatters.The CDU was battered across most of the country, with an especially dismal performance in the eastern states of the former GDR. It shed votes to every other party except the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the hard-left Die Linke. Over 1.3m voters, concentrated among the elderly, defected to the SPD. Several CDU cabinet members lost their direct seats (although they will, under Germany’s mixed-member proportional system, return to parliament on party lists). The Baltic-coast seat vacated by the departing Mrs Merkel went to the SPD. Infuriatingly for those CDU members who had grown frustrated with the lukewarm support, or worse, from their notional Bavarian allies, the CSU lost just one seat compared with the CDU’s 49.Much of the blame falls on the shoulders of Armin Laschet, the unconvincing candidate chosen by the CDU/CSU to fill Mrs Merkel’s shoes. In the campaign’s closing stages Mr Laschet relied increasingly on the negative message that the CDU/CSU had to be re-elected to block Mr Scholz from inviting Die Linke, along with the Greens, into government. Never entirely plausible, this proposition will not be tested because the notional left-wing coalition does not enjoy a majority.The CDU/CSU seemed no better prepared for the election aftermath. Rashly, Mr Laschet claimed to have discerned a “clear mandate” to lead a “Jamaica” coalition, with the Greens and the Free Democrats (FDP), a small, liberal outfit, as junior partners (the parties’ colours match the island’s flag). As the scale of the defeat sank in, he ditched that dubious notion in favour of another: that the second-placed party in German elections had often proceeded to form a government. Yet none had suffered a defeat on the scale of the one he had overseen. As several of Mr Laschet’s colleagues pointed out, the party needed a better argument than this to stay in office.Discontent quickly grew in the conservative ranks. There were calls for “personnel discussions”; code for Mr Laschet to quit. A potential rebellion over the identity of the head of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group was quelled only with a last-minute compromise. And friction between the sister parties intensified. On September 28th Markus Söder, the CSU leader, whom Mr Laschet had defeated in an internecine struggle for the chancellor-candidacy in April, acknowledged that Mr Scholz was “best placed” to assemble a coalition.More than two-thirds of German voters think Mr Laschet should throw in the towel. With his chances of forming a government fading, his remaining hope is to make the FDP and Greens an offer he imagines they cannot refuse. If that fails, says a CDU MP, he will be gone within a month.Germany’s magic middleAs in other European countries, the German vote is fragmenting (see Charlemagne). The SPD’s comeback cannot mask a long-term decline in the share of the vote that goes to two big “people’s parties”, from 82% in 1987 to below 50% this time (see chart 2). This is why Germany is probably heading for its first three-way coalition since the 1950s. (A continuation of today’s CDU/CSU-SPD “grand coalition”, with Mr Scholz as chancellor, is possible, but neither party wants it.) Fully 40% of voters said they wanted “fundamental change”.But unlike much of the rest of Europe, fragmentation has not come at the expense of Germany’s (broad) centre. The AfD lost ground, even if the CDU collapse in eastern Germany left it the strongest party in Saxony and Thuringia (see chart 3). Die Linke did even worse, barely scraping into the Bundestag. The four mainstream parties, meanwhile—the CDU/CSU, the SPD, the Greens and the FDP—will hold 85% of seats in the new Bundestag, up from 78% in 2017. In Germany, at least, the centre is holding.It is also moving leftwards. The SPD and the Greens, natural coalition partners, together won 40.5% of the vote, up 11 percentage points from 2017 and almost all at the expense of the CDU/CSU. The conservative bloc of the CDU/CSU and FDP together took 35.6% of the vote. This leftward shift is one reason for the momentum behind Mr Scholz’s attempts to put together a “traffic-light” coalition, led by his SPD with the FDP and Greens as junior partners. Another is the aura of humiliation now hanging over the CDU/CSU. The talk is of a “coalition of the winners”. If the FDP vote was broadly flat on 2017, the Green score of 14.8% was by far the best in their four-decade history.Indeed, the smaller parties have made the early running. At a televised debate on election night, Christian Lindner, the FDP’s leader, said that his party would speak to the Greens before attempting to come to terms with either of the larger parties. The FDP and Greens, needed in either a Jamaica or a traffic-light arrangement, will command 210 seats in the new Bundestag, more than either the CDU/CSU or the SPD. A joint platform would carry more weight than a typical kingmaker could hope for. “This would be an eye-level negotiation,” says Janosch Dahmen, a Green MP.Those close to the FDP-Green talks urge caution. The two parties must overcome serious political and cultural differences. They disagree on taxation and spending, investment policy, Europe’s fiscal rules and much more. In 2017 it was Green-FDP tensions that ended Angela Merkel’s hopes of forming her own Jamaica coalition. Their respective bases detest each other. “F.D.P.: Fick den Planeten (“Fuck the planet)”, tweeted Jürgen Trittin, a former Green leader, during the campaign. The road to any FDP-Green deal looks rocky.Yet “rocky roads don’t scare us,” says Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, an FDP MP. “We build good cars in Germany.” Towards the end of the campaign, as the SPD’s surge brought the prospect of a traffic-light coalition into view, Mr Lindner moderated his language accordingly. Robert Habeck, the Green’s co-leader, who will play a crucial role in the talks, has told his party colleagues to seek common ground with the liberals rather than victory over them. Economic boffins on both sides are drawing up plans to square the many circles, including a fudge on tax rises, and the creation of off-budget vehicles that could raise public investment without violating Germany’s “debt brake”, which limits deficit spending—a red line for the FDP.Moreover, the two parties, which between them won a near-majority among first-time voters, can present a credible narrative of change. This might find expression in support for projects like improving Germany’s ropy digital infrastructure, education reform or a streamlining of planning procedures. On September 28th, just after the CDU/CSU MPs had weighed Mr Laschet’s future, the Green and FDP leaders surprised everyone—including their own colleagues—by posting an Instagram selfie with an earnest caption speaking of “common ground”. The signal was clear: while others squabble, the new guard is getting down to business.The FDP-Green talks, say insiders, are about building trust more than assembling detailed policies; much less apportioning ministerial jobs, a complicated business that tends to happen at the end of coalition talks. The unflappable Mr Scholz is happy for his potential partners to learn to work together before opening negotiations with his team. Even if Mr Laschet is a dead man walking, for now neither the Greens nor the FDP will rule out a Jamaica coalition. To do so would instantly increase Mr Scholz’s bargaining power. Besides, there are murmurs that the CDU/CSU could seek to unseat Mr Laschet and approach the smaller parties with a different candidate.Yet the momentum is firmly with the SPD. Its officials hope to begin traffic-light talks by mid-October, and to meet Mr Scholz’s goal of finalising a government by Christmas—just in time for Germany’s G7 presidency in January. Nothing is certain. The FDP and Greens may fail to come to terms, and for now the CDU/CSU is clinging on to its hopes of remaining in office. But the stars are lining up for Mr Scholz. 
33  KYRIAKOS MITSOTAKIS, Greece’s prime minister, cast it as a love story. “History…wants us together,” he told Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, in Paris on September 28th. “So does geography.” He serenaded Mr Macron with tales of Ionian seafarers landing in Marseilles and the French Philhellenes who backed Greece’s war of independence. Mr Macron said that Greece was “a civilisation that has inspired us and enabled us to be ourselves”. Then the two leaders consummated their courtship with what they are calling a “strategic” defence pact.Listen to this story.The Franco-Greek relationship has been forged in rivalry with Turkey, which last year squared off with Greek warships around Cyprus, and with French ones off Libya. An anti-Turkey bloc, including France, Greece, Israel, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, has gradually taken shape. Mr Mitsotakis, eager to secure French support and bolster his own armed forces, had already agreed to buy 18 Rafale warplanes from France in January, at a cost of €2.5bn ($2.9bn), and six more in September. Now he will also buy three new French frigates, with the option of one more.That is a boon for Greece’s navy, which has just 13 ageing frigates against Turkey’s newer fleet of 16. It is also a well-timed consolation prize for Naval Group, the majority-state-owned French arms firm which Australia turfed out of a lucrative submarine contract on September 15th as part of its AUKUS pact with America and Britain. Naval Group is building the new frigates in Brittany; Greece is supposed to take delivery of its first in 2025.Yet both sides were keen to show that this was no mere arms contract. “It strengthens…our strategic autonomy and our European sovereignty,” said Mr Macron. Mr Mitsotakis agreed that it was “the first bold step towards European strategic autonomy”. Mr Macron has long been fond of such language—often irritating his eastern European allies, who see it as antagonistic to America—but it has a particular resonance after AUKUS. French officials have portrayed the Anglophone pact as a demonstration of American unreliability and a wake-up call for Europeans to collaborate more on defence matters.To that end, the new agreement also includes a striking element that is absent from AUKUS: a mutual defence clause. France and Greece are already obliged to support each other in the event of an attack, through Article Five of NATO’s charter and the more obscure Article 42:7 of the EU’s Lisbon treaty. Notably, Mr Mitsotakis said that the partnership now “goes beyond” those obligations. The decision to formalise a separate, bilateral alliance suggests that both Mr Macron and Mr Mitsotakis are concerned that, should a serious crisis erupt in the Mediterranean, Turkey might stymie NATO from the inside.The idea of a mutual-defence clause that is beefier than Article Five—which obliges an ally only to take “such action as it deems necessary”— is not unprecedented. France did the same thing with Germany in the Aachen treaty of 2019. The Anglo-French Lancaster House treaty of 2010 also implies far-reaching nuclear guarantees.But such bilateral deals are bad news for NATO, says Wess Mitchell, an American former state department official who co-chaired a reflection group for the alliance last year. The new pact “will be viewed in NATO and especially by eastern members of the alliance as implicitly undermining Article Five,” he says. Others, like Poland, may be encouraged to seek their own ad hoc guarantees from America.Moreover, despite the rhetoric of European sovereignty and autonomy, the ever-closer alignment of France and Greece reflects the EU’s divisions more than its cohesion; it does not, after all, involve the rest of the EU. In recent years both countries have grown frustrated with the bloc’s reluctance to put more pressure on Turkey. Germany, in particular, with its large Turkish diaspora and trade links, has been eager to water down such measures.Germany is also selling advanced diesel-electric submarines to Turkey’s navy. So later this decade, a very European contest will play out in the Mediterranean: France’s finest frigates tracking Germany’s best submarines. 
34  FRESH FROM victories in Tokyo, Russian Olympic medalists were preparing for a reception with Vladimir Putin earlier this month when they were told they would spend a week in quarantine before meeting the president. “I still can’t believe I’ll have to sit in one room for seven days,” Angelina Melnikova, a gymnast, wrote on social media. But the requirement wasn’t new: senior officials, journalists and even veterans of the second world war have had to self-isolate before coming within breathing distance of the man who has stood at Russia’s helm for over two decades, and who next week turns 69.Listen to this story.When Russia first recorded a surge in coronavirus cases in March last year, Mr Putin donned a yellow hazmat suit to visit Moscow’s main covid-19 hospital. State TV cameras captured him taking selfies with staff and shaking hands with the hospital’s chief physician, Denis Protsenko. “No head of state has so far dared to come so close to the infected,” gushed the Kremlin’s chief propagandist, Dmitry Kiselyov, on his Sunday night news show. All par for the course for a strongman who has built his reputation on action-man stunts.But in the months since then, perhaps no world leader has been as shielded from the virus. Days after Mr Putin’s hospital visit, Mr Protsenko announced that he himself was sick with covid-19, and Mr Putin holed up in his residence outside Moscow, haranguing officials by video-link as his approval ratings sank. Special tunnels were installed at the residence to douse visitors in disinfectant. Alexei Navalny, Russia’s main opposition figure, who is now in jail, coined a new nickname for his political foe: “grandpa in a bunker”.In March, the BBC reported that the Kremlin had spent $85m on quarantine accommodation for staff and visitors coming into contact with Mr Putin and other measures to ensure his well-being. That figure is all the more startling when you consider that Russia has had a working vaccine since last August, when the president approved the Sputnik V jab. On September 14th Mr Putin announced he was going into self-isolation after covid cases were detected in his inner circle, less than three months after he revealed he had been vaccinated. He emerged two weeks later, to be seen meeting Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan on September 29th. But Muscovites are not expecting to see him around the place.
